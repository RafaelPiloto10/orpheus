I do not love youisabella  
I never have I never will  
I saunter through this ceremony  
Confidence high, enthusiasm nil  
My reasoning need not detain you  
But woman it's not all bad news  
Very few find peace and succour  
In the spouse or life that they choose  
He will crush you  
Has no pity  
Wave on wave on wave of grief  
I shall love him  
Understand him  
That he loves me is my belief  
I do not need you isabella  
If I did we'd not be here  
We'd be in some lovers' heaven  
Our way ahead and dreams so clear  
I welcome you into my family  
Into it's dark internal wars  
Let me enter into battle  
I have the will I have the cause  
No-one leaves him  
But they're damaged  
And stripped of every vestige of good  
Is he man or  
Is he devil?  
I see but dread the likelihood  
I shall not stay poor isabella  
So never heed my marriage vow  
Believe in time you won't regret this  
Thought it may disturb you now  
Abandon all attempts to love me  
Don't fool yourself that's what you feel  
When you at last decide to hate me  
At least your emotion will be real  
Wolfish, savage  
Tuned to madness  
Love is stifled, joy denied  
I do hate him  
I am wretched  
A cold contaminated bride  
Isabella! isabella!  
I do not love you isabella  
I never have I never will  
I saunter through this ceremony  
Confidence high, enthusiasm nil  
My reasoning need not detain you  
But woman it's not all bad news  
Very few find peace and succour  
In the spouse or life that they choose  
Isabella!  
Isabella!
