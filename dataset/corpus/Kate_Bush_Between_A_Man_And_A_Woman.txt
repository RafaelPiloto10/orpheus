With her hand in his hand  
They were both happy again.  
You started to take sides  
They started arguing  
He said it was her fault  
She said it wasn't at all  
But the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  
  
Where angels fear to tread you go rushing in  
Well I had to tell you then  
And now I'm telling you again  
Stay out of this  
You must not interfere  
Don't you see this is  
Between a man and a woman?  
  
Every day and night I pray.  
Pray that you will stay away forever.  
It's so hard for love to stay together  
With the modern Western pressures  
I don't want to say it  
But I had to tell you then  
And now I'm telling you again  
  
Stay out of this.  
Oh, I know you mean to help me,  
And I know you've good intentions  
But stay out of this.  
This isn't your problem.  
Do not interfere - you are not needed here  
Let the pendulum swing  
Between a man and a woman  
Don't you see you're in the way - between a man and a woman.  
Every day and night I pray, let the pendulum swing  
Between a man and a woman.  
Between a man and a woman.
