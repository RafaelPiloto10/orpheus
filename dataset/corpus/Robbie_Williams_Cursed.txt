Dig your polished nails into the dirt  
Rip your skirt off  
Wipe the hurt off  
You know it tears my heart out when you  
Flirt with danger  
And any stranger  
  
You're not as stupid as I look  
Before I could read  
You wrote the book  
  
Cursed  
Since your birth dear  
And your worst fears  
Have all come true  
  
Held my hand when I got my first tattoo  
I was naked when they penetrated  
Told everyone I'd slept with you  
Thought you liked it and you wouldn't deny it  
Saint Peter's gonna be unfaithful  
Tell God he's got a dirty angel  
  
Cursed  
Since your birth dear  
And your worst fears  
Have all come true  
  
Babe you're not the first  
Here on earth dear  
Cause I'm still here  
And I'm cursed, too  
Cursed like you  
  
Hush  
Baby sleep now  
We all love you  
We always did  
  
Cursed  
Since your birth dear  
And your worst fears  
Have all come through  
  
Babe you're not the first  
Here on earth dear  
Cause I'm still here  
And I'm cursed, too  
Cursed like you  
  
Hush  
Baby sleep now  
We all miss you  
We always will
