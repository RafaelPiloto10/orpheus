Goddamn this dusty room  
This hazy afternoon  
I'm breathing in this silence  
Like never before  
  
This feeling that I get  
This one last cigarette  
As I lay awake  
And wait for you to come through the door  
  
Oh maybe maybe maybe  
I can share it with you  
I behave I behave I behave  
So I can share it with you  
  
You were not alone  
Dear loneliness  
You forgot  
But I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
  
I am not alone  
Dear loneliness  
I forgot  
That I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
We'll dream about somewhere  
Our smoke will fill the air  
As I lay awake and wait  
For you to walk out that door  
I can change I can change I can change  
But who do you want me to be  
I'm the same I'm the same I'm the same  
Oh do you want me to be  
  
You were not alone  
Dear loneliness  
You forgot  
But I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
I'm not alone  
Dear loneliness  
I forgot  
That I remember this  
You were not alone  
Dear loneliness  
You forgot  
But I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
  
I'm not alone  
Dear loneliness  
I forgot  
That I remember this  
Oh stranger stranger  
Stranger things have happened, I know  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh
