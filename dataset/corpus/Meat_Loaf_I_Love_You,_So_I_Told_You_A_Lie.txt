Every time I hear your name you know  
I wonder why you wanted to go  
I said no you couldn't come along for the ride  
I said hey, I want outta here and nobody taggin' behind  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cha know I love you so I told you a lie  
I love you so I told you a lie when I told you goodbye  
  
A family life and a lovin' wife just ain't my kinda scene  
Well when I'm all alone, when the nights are cold  
I get to thinkin' I was kinda mean  
We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I told you a lie  
  
ah, ah ah, ah ah  
Ut, ah ah, ah ah  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah  
Ut, ah ah, ah ah  
  
A family life and a lovin' wife just ain't my kinda scene  
Well when I'm all alone, when the nights are cold  
I get to thinkin' I was kinda mean  
We coulda had a good thing but I never wanted to try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I told you a lie when I told you goodbye  
  
Don'tcha know, I love you so I  
Don'tcha know, I love you so I told you  
Don'tcha know, I love you so I told you a lie  
Love you so I told you a lie  
I loved you so I told you a lie  
I loved you so I told you a lie  
Loved you so, loved you so  
Ah  
Loved you so I told you a lie  
Ah  
Loved you so I told you a lie
