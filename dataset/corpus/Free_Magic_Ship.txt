Over there is my magic ship  
Would you care to go on a trip  
We'll be sailing on and on  
To a land where few have gone  
Beyond the skies in my mind  
  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies  
Rolling out like the waves on the sea  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring your harmonies  
Rolling out to those who can see  
  
Let's away to a distant night  
Let's away on a magic flight  
We'll be sailing on and on  
To a land where few have gone  
Beyond the skies in my mind  
  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies  
Rolling out like the waves on the sea  
Sweet Bells ring and ring and ring your harmonies  
Calling out to those who can hear  
  
Oh who can see  
Because were sailing  
  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies  
Rolling out like the waves on the sea  
Sweet Bells ring and ring and ring and ring your harmonies  
Rolling out to those who can hear  
  
Oh can you see  
Inside  
Don't be afraid,  
Step aboard  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
All right here we go.
