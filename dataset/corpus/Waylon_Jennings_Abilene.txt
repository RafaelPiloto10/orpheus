Abilene, Abilene,  
Prettiest town I've ever seen  
Women there don't treat you mean  
In Abilene, my Abilene.  
  
I sit alone most every night  
Watch those trains pull out of sight  
Don't I wish they were carrying me  
Back to Abilene, my Abilene.  
  
Abilene, Abilene,  
Prettiest town I've ever seen  
Women there don't treat you mean  
In Abilene, my Abilene.  
  
Crowded city, ain't nothing free  
Nothing in this old town for me  
Wish to the Lord that I could be  
In Abilene, sweet Abilene.  
  
Abilene, Abilene  
Prettiest town I've ever seen  
Women there don't treat you mean  
In Abilene, my Abilene
