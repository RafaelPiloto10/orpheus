Oh you make me lay down  
Oh you make me forget I am here  
Oh you're making me safe now  
Oh you make the faces disappear  
  
I'm all right by the way  
Everyone saves the day  
Sometimes I feel it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Send it up  
Send it up now  
Send it up  
  
Oh I feel so close now  
Oh you're taking me back from where I've been  
Oh I'm not alone now  
Oh you rest me up and rush me in  
  
I'm all right by the way  
Everyone saves the day  
Sometimes I feel it  
  
[Chorus]
