Junkies lament  
  
Rikkis been kicking the gong  
Lickety split didn't take too long  
A junkies sick a monkeys strong  
That's whats wrong  
  
Well I guess hes been messing around down town  
So sad to see the man losing ground  
Hes winding down behind closed doors  
On all fours  
  
Mama don't you call him my name  
He can't hear you anymore  
And even if he seems the same to you  
That's a stranger to your door  
Go on ask him whats he come here for  
  
Oh my God a monkey can move a man  
Send him to hell and home again  
With an empty hand in the afternoon  
Shooting for the moon  
  
Hes halfway sick and its halfway stoned  
Hed sure like to quit but hes too far far gone  
And theyll wind him down with the methadone  
Hes all on his own  
  
Baby don't you throw your love away  
I hate to seem unkind  
Its only that I understand the man  
That the monkey can leave behind  
And I used to think he was a friend of mine
