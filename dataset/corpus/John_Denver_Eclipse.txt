The sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
  
There's a heavy smog between me and my mountains  
It's enough to make a grown man sit and cry  
It's enough to make you wonder  
It's enough to make the world roll up and die  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way that people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time comin' to me  
The fact I don't believe that I know what it means  
  
In the east a shaded moon is hangin' lazily  
I do believe I saw the old man smile  
I do believe I did  
I do believe he's been laughin' all the while  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way that people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time comin' to me  
The fact I don't believe that I know what it means any more  
  
When the sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
  
The sun again  
Sun again
