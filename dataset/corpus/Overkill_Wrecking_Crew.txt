Ain't no job too big or small,  
Just one sweep of the wreckin' ball.  
Put 'em up, we'll knock 'em down,  
Or knock 'em up, then leave town.  
Demolition of the mind.  
Desolation, left behind.  
Light the fuse, dynamite.  
Light the sky! in the night!  
  
We will walk!  
All over you!  
'Cause we are!  
The wreckin'! Wreckin' crew!  
We are the wreckin' crew.  
  
Wreckin' crew!  
We are the wreckin' crew.  
  
Destruction is a way life.  
Destruction, mayhem, havoc, strife.  
Crack a smile, here the sound.  
Watch 'em crumble to the ground.  
Innocence ain't no excuse,  
Slip your neck inside the noose.  
Pay in blood I demand,  
The wreckin' crew is outta hand.  
  
We'll wreck your neck!  
Wreckin' crew!  
Get wrecked!  
  
Turn to ashes, turn to dust.  
We're the ones that you can trust.  
Evil smile, wicked grin,  
Tear it down, begin to sin.  
Think that you will end it all,  
There's no one left to ball or call.  
When there ain't nothin' left to do,  
Call upon, the wreckin' crew!  
  
We'll wreck your neck!  
Wreckin' crew!  
Yer wreck!  
Ah! Wreckin' crew!  
Wreck! Wreck!
