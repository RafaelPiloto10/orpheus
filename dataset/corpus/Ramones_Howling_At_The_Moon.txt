Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la  
  
Ships are docking planes are landing  
A never ending supply  
  
No more narco no more gangster  
Conservatives can cry  
  
I took the law and threw it away  
'cause there's nothing wrong it's just for play  
There's no law, no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la  
  
It was glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing in the dark  
It was sparkling, sparkling, sparkling, sparkling in the dark  
I took the law and threw it away  
'cause there's nothing wrong it's just for play  
  
There's no law, no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Winter turns to summer sadness turns to fun  
Keep the faith, baby you broke the rules and won  
  
Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la  
  
Keep it glowing, glowing, glowing  
I'm not hurting any one keep it glowing, smoking, glowing  
I'm howling at the moon  
I took the law and threw it away  
'cause there's nothing wrong it's just for play  
There's no law, no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Oh baby oh baby oh baby oh baby  
  
I took the law and threw it away  
'cause there's nothing wrong it's just for play  
  
I'm smoking, baby  
I'm smoking, oh baby  
  
There's no law, no law any more  
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor  
  
Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la-la-la
