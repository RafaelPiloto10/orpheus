All I want to do is write a stupid song  
With a three line chorus, you can sing along  
And if it feels so good until it's gone  
Will you love me?  
  
Look at me  
Tell me I'm a loser  
A simple-minded microphone abuser that is me  
And I guess I know the reason why you hate me  
But I won't let your condescension break me, so sorry  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Cause all I want to do is write a stupid song  
With a three line chorus, you can sing along  
And if it feels so good until it's gone  
Will you love me?  
  
All I want to make is a melody  
The kind that sticks down in your memory  
And if it feeds our rock n' roll fantasies  
Will you love me?  
  
Cause music ain't some kind of competition  
And if you don't like me  
You don't have to listen to my songs  
You said this band ain't shit until you're wasted  
Pour another drink for me  
  
All I want to do is write a stupid song  
With a three line chorus, you can sing along  
And if it feels so good until it's gone  
Will you love me?  
  
All I want to make is a melody  
The kind that sticks down in your memory  
And if it feeds our rock n' roll fantasies  
Will you love me?  
  
Yeah!
