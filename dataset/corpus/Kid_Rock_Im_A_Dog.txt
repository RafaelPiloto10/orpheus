See me ride across the country with my shotty ridin' shotgun  
Got slimmys on my jimmy with magnums rockin' platinum  
Wig's dig this, the fuckin' police know I see 'em  
So I'm headin' up to Reno like a geo and I'll great 'em  
Free my mind of lifes inconsistencies  
You got a lot but yo you can't get these  
Free my mind of lifes inconsistencies  
I had enough and you can swing on these  
  
'Cause I'm a dog baby  
See me ride across the country  
I'ma dog bitch  
Big suitcase full of money  
I'm a dog mamma  
And I'm rollin' El Camino  
I'm a D-D-D dog  
  
Drop top continental with a suicide see me ride  
You by my side big girl, yo we will never die  
I'll be your Hollywood eyes and send you swingin' baby  
Bring it home to pappa and Rock gonna make it jingle baby  
It's a God damn shame people they look at me  
But I know in the end you givea fuck about me  
And that's the reason I spit fire  
That's the reason I'ma set your ass on fire, fire  
I shoulda never left the bottle  
And if they want the truth then tell them bitches i shot 'em  
  
I'm a dog baby  
See me ride across the country  
I'm a dog bitch  
Big suitcase full of money  
I'm a dog mamma  
And I'm rollin' El Camino  
I'm a D-D-D dog  
Yeah  
  
Yeah...can ya, can ya, can ya feel it now?  
Freedom or death, nothin' left to do but fill it up  
Triple X eyes of lust and you need to give it up  
Live it up sucker cause they're sayin' my days are numbered  
Who wants to live long anyway  
I'm goin' out with a blast  
Gettin' some ass, smokin' grass, leavin' all my cash for my little boy  
You wouldn't understand, you don't know where I come from  
hey yeah yeah  
  
'Cause I'm a dog baby  
See me ride across the country  
I'm a dog bitch  
Big suitcase full of money  
I'm a dog mamma  
And I'm rollin' El Camino  
I'm a D-D-D dog  
I'm a dog baby  
I'm a dog baby  
I'm a dog baby
