Just say come on let's be alone babe  
Just say you want to spend some time with me  
Just say anywhere we are  
It's all about love and anything we want to be  
  
Just say you feel the fire burning  
Just say the sun only shines on your face  
Just say this love can last forever  
I want to show you how much I want to know you  
  
There's a dream that I'm dreaming inside my head  
And I know just right where we are going  
Come on and take this ride  
Just come on inside and make this dream reality  
  
Let's both just get away  
Your smile's my holiday  
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation  
  
Just say just put your heart in my hand  
Just say I'll lay the whole world at your feet  
Just say we're going on a journey  
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside  
  
I see the joy I see the laughter we just don't care  
Happiness will never leave us alone  
You know there's such a place  
A wonderful place where love will find you and me  
Beautifu  
  
Let's both just get away  
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation  
L  
When I think about you baby  
Whee I talk about you baby  
What I say about you baby  
The world should know about you baby  
Because I really need you baby  
Because I really love you baby  
Because I really miss you baby  
I just want to get away  
  
Let's both just get away  
Your smile's my holiday  
You're my sweet vacation  
Through storms we'll find the stars  
Sometimes they tell us who we are
