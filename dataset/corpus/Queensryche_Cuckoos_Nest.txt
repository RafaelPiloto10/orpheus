Hey you cuckoo!  
See you're in the paper late today, accused of something,  
And your lips are closed to all of those who know she's missing.  
Talk abounds she won't be found alive and that's a pity.  
  
I read about all of these crimes. When will it end?  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
I'm tired of the insane running things,  
And I won't stop tryin' for change.  
  
Seems the town's ablaze and TV's live to show it's burning.  
All the while, the smiling juvenile is seeking mercy.  
  
I see these crimes all of the time. When will it end?  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
I'm tired of the insane running things,  
And I won't stop tryin' for change.  
  
We legislate and educate trying to find  
A way to fix the broken dream.  
  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
If this is the youth of tomorrow,  
I'm running the other way.  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
I'm tired of the insane running things,  
And I won't stop tryin' for change.
