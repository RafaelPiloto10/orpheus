Lets take on the world, forget that you feel a girl  
Once you're away, everyones still the same  
If I could rip at your shirt just to see if it'd hurt  
Everyday's golden day, when you've got someone to blame  
Could you feel so much in a bus you're sure there's nothing you can trust  
Once you're away, everyone stabs the same  
Sleep forever on your breast treat everyday now like a test  
But you'll still say everyone's to blame
