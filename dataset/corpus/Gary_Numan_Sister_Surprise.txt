We are  
Walking nostalgia  
Like old movies for real  
Look at me, look at you  
Look at them, look at us  
  
I'm young  
Sell a slim body to the man next door  
Sell a slim body to the man next door  
Like my sister surprise  
  
We'll wait for you  
  
We are  
The pleasure creation  
Gone wrong. gone wrong.  
  
We are  
Walking ghost stories  
No religion  
No relief  
No old wisdom  
No belief  
Sometimes I could scream  
  
We'll wait for you
