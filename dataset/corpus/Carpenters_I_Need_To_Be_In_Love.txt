The hardest thing I've ever done  
Is keep believing  
There's someone in this crazy world  
For me  
The way that people come and go  
Through temporary lives  
My chance could come and I might never know  
  
I used to say "No promises,  
Let's keep it simple"  
But freedom only helps you say  
Good-bye  
It took a while for me to learn  
That nothin' comes for free  
The price I've paid is high enough for me  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know I've wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find  
  
So here I am with pockets full of good intentions  
But none of them will comfort me tonight  
I'm wide awake at four a.m.  
Without a friend in sight  
Hanging on a hope but I'm alright  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know I've wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know I've wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
