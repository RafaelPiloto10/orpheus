Good times for a change  
See, the luck I've had  
Can make a good man  
Turn bad  
So please, please, please  
Let me, let me, let me  
Let me get what I want  
This time  
  
Haven't had a dream  
In a long time  
See, the life I've had  
Can make a good man  
Turn bad  
So for once in my life  
Let me get what I want  
Lord knows  
It would be the first time  
Lord knows  
It would be the first time
