Hey, Yoko, imagine a grapefruit and squeeze it on me  
Ah  
  
You say mustn't do this and that  
You say can't do this and that  
While you're losing your pants in a bullet proof car  
Losing your hair in a downtown bar  
Forget it, just forget it  
It's the curse, you're my curse, it could be worse  
  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe, ooh, listen  
  
You say mustn't have this and that  
You say can't have this and that  
While you're losing your apple and squeezing our balls  
Losing your mind and crawling up the walls  
Forget it, just forget it  
It's the curse, you're my curse, it could be worse  
  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe, ooh  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe, ooh, listen  
  
Ooh, yeah, do you wanna touch me? Oh yeah  
Do you wanna break your mind, boy?  
  
You're a dildo, I'm a whore  
I'm a Barbie, you're a whore  
Living in a glass house, having fun  
Lying in a glass house watching the sun  
Forget it, just forget it  
It's the curse, you are my curse, it could be worse  
  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh
