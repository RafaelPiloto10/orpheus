I get up at seven, yeah  
And I go to work at nine  
I got no time for livin'  
Yes, I'm workin' all the time  
  
It seems to me  
I could live my life  
A lot better than I think I am  
I guess that's why they call me  
They call me the workin' man  
  
They call me the workin' man  
I guess that's what I am  
  
I get home at five o'clock  
And I take myself out a nice, cold beer  
Always seem to be wond'rin'  
Why there's nothin' goin' down here  
  
It seems to me  
I could live my life  
A lot better than I think I am  
I guess that's why they call me  
They call me the workin' man  
  
They call me the workin' man  
I guess that's what I am  
  
Well they call me the workin' man  
I guess that's what I am
