Pretty smile lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady  
You're my no tell lover  
Every night in a different place I'll meet you tender lady  
You're my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming, even if it's you I'm lovin'  
  
Every minute is an hour every day's a lonely lifetime  
You're my no tell lover  
The little time that we spend together just can't last forever  
You're my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin' me that this affair's not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming even though it's you I'm lovin'  
I want her  
I can't leave her  
I won't live without her  
There's nothing left to say  
I want her  
I can't leave her  
  
Pretty smile, lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady  
You're my no tell lover  
Every night in a different place I'll need you tender lady  
You're my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin' me this affair's not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming even though it's you I'm lovin'  
  
I want her  
I can't leave her  
I won't live without her  
She's my no tell lover
