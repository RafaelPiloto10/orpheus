Well, I got a bumper sticker  
On the back of my truck  
There ain't another like it  
'Cause I had it made up  
I can tell who's behind me  
They give themselves away  
Lay on their horn when they read this phrase  
  
[Chorus]  
Honk if you honky tonk  
Don't if you don't  
But, if you do  
Don't you love to  
Honk if you honky tonk  
  
Me and Friday night go hand in hand  
Ice cold beer and a swingin' band  
A girl on my arm that won't let go  
She caught my little sign about a mile ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, just the other day I was cruisin' through town  
Sheriff pulled me over, I thought I had it now  
I rolled down my window, he said with a grin  
"I want one of them stickers or I'm gonna run you in."  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Honk if you honky tonk  
  
I hear ya honkin', yeah  
I'm pullin' over,  
Let's honky tonk
