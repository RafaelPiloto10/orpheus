I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain  
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008  
This music gave me a lane to ride in,  
But there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight  
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a of a lion  
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars  
You can't gamble with no cards  
What d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge  
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar  
To find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly  
But when I'm writing songs,  
I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies  
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind  
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies  
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog  
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong  
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be  
  
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's ease  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on you. K. Streets  
When a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets  
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool  
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk  
Listen, we all get down in the dumps  
But when they hear the melody and base line pump  
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then  
I run loose on my tongue  
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one  
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my  
Cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation.
