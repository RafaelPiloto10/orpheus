I'm running to catch up again  
Jumping higher and flying more often than not  
Your trampoline has got holes in it but I can still see the top  
Let me climb aboard and sample some of next year's fashion  
I'll wear the coat if you can put the hat on, I will wear the coat,  
Just let me clear my throat  
So I can say what's been delayed away  
  
Let me crawl into your lap and just lay here for awhile  
Satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job  
Never know how long I have waited  
Anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine  
Your smile pressed against mine  
Well I feel it. (oh boy  
And I'm gonna settle tight  
  
She could pour me over that sugar hill or mountain  
Until I get that cool breeze, a tight squeeze, I'd do it over again  
And I drink from her ever flowing fountain  
And then I wake up I comb my hair and I hurry it up  
But I arrive late I pack my things and I pick it up  
Well I put down a good amount of deodorant on this morning  
And I found that I could drown a little bit of peace of mind  
Well it's no secret that to some degree they're gonna have to see you sweat  
Strong enough for a man just do what you can to keep me soft and dry  
I stink awhile  
  
I don't know anything about those things  
I almost don't wanna know anything about those things  
Oh I don't care anything about those things  
Cause if I did you know I'd share myself on those things  
And I feel it oh boy  
  
I'll be, i'll be here all night  
I'll pick up the pieces and I put them back together now  
They may not be the right way but that's okay  
As long as they're all the same  
  
I wish you well, well that you'd get better  
And I know you'll find that it's a wild world  
And that's ok 'cause you're a wild girl  
And I took the hits and I turned to shit  
And if you had noticed well would you have thrown the towel in  
Before I missed out on all this love  
And watch me roll away again  
Watch me disappear under my skin  
I don't believe it that things could get any worse than they did that time  
You must have seen it  
I mean how could we get lost running in a straight line  
Your cries of why's and why nots, may it all get back to you  
And trickle and dance upon your headaches  
Years of biting cheeks are through  
So I don't believe in it  
  
But I feel it.
