Please please please  
No more melodies  
They lack impact, they're petty  
They've been made up already  
Please please please  
No more maladies  
I'm so tired of crying  
You'd think I was a siren  
But me and everybody's on the sad same team  
And you can hear our sad brain screaming  
  
Give us something familiar  
Something similar  
To what we know already  
That will keep us steady  
Steady  
Steady going nowhere  
  
Please please please  
No apologies  
At best they buy you time  
Until you next step out of line  
Please please please  
No more remedies  
My method is uncertain  
It's a mess but it's working  
And maybe if you tried it out  
You won't like it when you're crying out  
  
Give us something familiar  
Something similar  
To what we know already  
That will keep us steady  
Steady, steady  
Steady going nowhere  
  
Please please please  
No more melodies  
They lack impact, they're petty  
They've been made up already  
Please please please  
No more maladies

You'd think I was a siren

You can hear our sad brain screaming

To what we know already  
That will keep us steady  
Steady, steady, steady, steady  
Steady going nowhere  
  
Please please please  
No apologies  
At best they buy you time  
Until you next step out of line  
Please please please  
No more remedies  
My method is uncertain  
It's a mess but it's working  
And maybe if you want to try it out  
You won't like it when you're crying out  
  
Give me something familiar  
Somethin' similar  
To what we know already  
That will keep us steady  
Steady, steady  
Steady going nowhere
