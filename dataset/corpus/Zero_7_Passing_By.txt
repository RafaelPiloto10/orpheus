Don't think you love me  
Confusion settling in  
I don't think I'll be staying  
Around here, anymore  
  
There's no question that I love you  
But I'm living in my own time  
And here I am debating  
Whether I'm wrong, or right  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
All the promises I gave you  
Helped me to survive  
And all the times I wished you'd save me  
You were the love of my life  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
I'm only passing by
