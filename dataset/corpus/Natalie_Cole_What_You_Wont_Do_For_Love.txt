I guess you wonder where I've been  
I searched to find the love within  
I came back to ley you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I can't let go  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see  
I came back to let you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I can't let go  
  
Some people go around the world for love  
And they may never find what they dream of  
What you won't do, do for love  
You tried everthing  
But you don't give up  
In my world only you  
Make me do for love  
What I would not do  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see  
I came back to let you know  
Got a thing for you  
And I can't let go  
  
And though I only want the best it's true  
I can't believe the things I do for you  
  
What you won't do, do for love  
You've tried everything  
But you won't give up  
In my world only you  
Make me do for love  
What I would not do
