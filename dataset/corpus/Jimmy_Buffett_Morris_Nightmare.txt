"This is another new song we'd like to do for you now. It's a, tells the  
Story of a lovely cruise ship couple. You know in November, the snowbirds  
Start heading south down there, and you've seen them with the matching belt  
And shoes, condo commandos, you know. So uh, hey that's good shit. I smell  
It, alright, ooh. We better start this song before I get hungry. This is  
Called 'Morris' Nightmare'."  
  
Down in the islands where the happy folks stay  
Everybody do what Bwana Jim say  
He say its ok, it's ok  
  
You can do what you wanna  
Do what you like  
Twist a big ol' number  
Ride a motorbike  
It's alright, It's alright  
  
Dance to the drum  
Drink a lot of rum  
Love till you come to a stop  
  
Swing like a monkey in a coconut tree  
Sing like the dolphins in the deep blue sea  
Sing it's alright, it's alright  
  
"How does Fred Neil do it? Come on Jay Spell"  
  
You know people in the city got nowhere to go  
They used to go to bars now they go to Discos  
No, no, no disco (uh-uh, no)  
  
They never see the sun  
They hardly see the moon  
They barely see the ground 'til the snow melts in June  
Uptight, It's out of sight  
  
So they save a little money  
Take a little trip  
They only see the islands from a tacky cruise ship  
  
Buy a little liquor  
Buy some sea shells  
Husband tries to sleep  
Wife just yells  
Morris, you can sleep when you get home  
  
Down in the islands where the happy folks stay  
Everybody do what Biwana man say  
He say its ok, it's ok  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
Do what you wanna, do what you like  
  
"Morris! Oh for Christ's sake Morris, you can sleep when you get home.  
This is supposed to be a vacation you know.  
We come all the way down to Miami.  
We could go someplace nice like SeaWorld.  
I would like to go see, Tony Orlando is playing in Miami Beach.  
We could do some nice things like that.  
But no, What do we do, we have to go down to this goddamn swamp.  
This is a swamp Morris.  
You call this an island? This is a resort?  
It's full of mosquitoes and bugs and just is terrible Morris. Are you
listening to me?"  
  
"Bitch, Bitch, Bitch!"
