Oh, the city's alight  
With lovers and lies  
Bright blue eyes  
Oh, the city is bright  
It's brighter than day tonight  
  
Surrender, Surrender  
Surrender, Surrender  
  
Sadie said she couldn't work out  
What it was all about  
And so she let go  
Now Sadie's on the street  
And the people she meets you know  
She tried to be a good girl and a good wife  
Raise a good family  
Lead a good life  
It's not good enough  
She got herself up on the 48th floor  
Gotta find out  
Find out what she's living for  
  
Surrender, Surrender  
Surrender, Surrender  
  
Tonight...  
  
Oh, the city's afire  
A passionate flame  
It knows me by name  
Oh, the city's desire  
To take me for more and more  
It's in the street, getting under my feet  
It's in the air, it's everywhere  
My love for you  
It's in the things I do and say  
If I want to live I gotta  
Die to myself someday  
  
Papa sing my sing my sing my song  
Papa sing my sing my sing my song...
