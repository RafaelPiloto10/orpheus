Where d'you wanna spend eternity?  
Dreaming of liberty,  
Searching for reality,  
Trucking down infinity.  
  
Bury your past an' move on fast,  
Nothin's gonna last, so take a bit of grass  
An' move on, move on fast.  
  
What's your visibility?  
Looking for community,  
Hoping for unity,  
Trucking through infinity.  
  
Bury your past an' move on fast,  
Nothin's gonna last, so take a bit of grass  
An' move on, move on fast.  
  
Where d'you wanna spend eternity?  
I might meet you somewhere.  
All roads leads to nowhere,  
Trucking through infinity.  
  
Bury your past an' move on fast,  
Nothin's gonna last, so roll a bit of grass  
An' move on, move on fast.  
  
Move on! move on! move on! move on!  
Move on! move on! move on! move on!
