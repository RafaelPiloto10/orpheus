I was staring at the people  
Lost and terrified  
Turned and saw you smiling  
My heart was terrorized  
Lust among the millions  
Another suicide  
And when I think that love was there  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't want to talk about it  
The pain we share  
While they just talk about it  
While they just talk about it  
  
A hand reached out to touch me  
A letter hit the pile  
I felt my life revolving  
Like fingers in a dial  
Just then I stopped believing  
But only for a while  
And when I think that love was there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I think that love was there  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't give it up  
Don't count on their loving  
Don't give it up, don't try  
Don't give it up  
Don't count on their loving  
Don't give it up, don't try  
  
Don't want to talk about it  
Don't want to talk about it  
And when I think that love was there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I think that love was there  
I was staring at the people  
Lost and terrified  
Turned and saw you crying  
A victim of your pride  
But you are no civilian  
So open up your eyes
