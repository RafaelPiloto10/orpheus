Welcome to the strangest party baby  
It's like we're staring at the sun  
Everybody's got their invitations  
Hopin' that you're gonna come yeah  
These are the times  
Times  
These are the crimes  
Crimes  
What are we waiting for  
What are we hating for  
  
You're part of the solution  
Or part of the problem  
You're gonna have to dance with one  
You're giving up on  
The future honey  
I'll count you out of having some  
  
Here comes the rain  
Yeah here comes the rain yeah  
  
These are the times  
These are the crimes  
What are we waiting for  
What are we hating for  
  
Wash away the rain yeah  
Into the blue sea yeah  
  
These are the times  
These are the times
