Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the southland  
I miss my family once again and I think it's a sin  
  
Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her  
Well, I heard Ol' Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the governor boo, hoo hoo  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you, tell me true  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Here I come Alabama  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
They've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord, they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue, now how about you?  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue, oh, sweet home  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you and the gov'nor's true  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue, oh yeah  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you, yeah yeah
