All that style all going to waste  
All that beauty, but you never show your face  
I'm gonna make my way to you, knock down your door and walk on through  
I'm impatient, times a wastin', girl, if you give me an occasion  
  
I'm gonna rise to it, you know I really can do it  
I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise to it  
When you're lying next to me, baby, I can guarantee, I'm gonna rise to it  
I'll give you fever, I'll give you chills  
Make you a believer, ooh, I'm gonna break your will  
A little danger, a little fun, we're gonna take 'em one by one  
Walk the wire of desire, and if you dare to take it higher  
  
I'm gonna rise to it, you know I really can do it  
I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise to it  
When you're lying next to me, baby, I can guarantee, I'm gonna rise to it  
  
Get up, lights, camera, action, it's getting time for the show  
Tonight you're the main attraction  
And if you want a lover who can play the other role, I'm gonna, I'm gonna  
  
I'm gonna rise to it, you know I really can do it  
I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise to it  
When you're lying next to me, baby, I can guarantee, I'm gonna rise to it
