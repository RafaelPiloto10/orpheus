[Verse 1]  
I should've known when the cop told me I'm goin' too fast  
He told me  
Speed like that and it's bound to be a hell of a crash  
He told me  
Better late than you don't get there, do the math  
Oh you oughta be grateful  
For what you have  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Well what if I refuse to learn?  
I see a flame, I wanna get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
How can I blame you  
For showin' up at the party?  
Lookin' through me in that way  
Saw somethin' inside of me break  
Saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin' over my daydreams?  
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry  
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why's it hard for a man to be satisfied?  
Oh, I got one glimpse of the green grass on the other side  
'Cause it's all been comin' to this and goddamn I won't be denied  
Oh I'm gonna take one more chance tonight  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, what if I refuse to learn?  
I see the flame grow, I gotta get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
How can I blame you  
For showin' up at the party?  
Lookin' through me in that way  
Saw somethin' inside of me break  
Saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin' over my daydreams?  
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry  
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
  
[Bridge]  
Did I know my weakness?  
Did I mount all my defenses?  
Did I tell you to leave me alone?  
How can I blame you?  
You saw somethin' inside of me break  
You saw me wanna make a mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
How can I blame you?  
You saw somethin' inside of me break  
You saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin' over my daydreams?  
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry  
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
I wanna blame it on you  
I wanna blame it on you, yeah
