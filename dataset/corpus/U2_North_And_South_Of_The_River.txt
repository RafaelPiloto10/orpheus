I want to reach out over the loch  
And feel your hand across the water  
Walk with you along an unapproved road  
Not looking over my shoulder  
  
I want to see, and I want to hear  
To understand your fears  
But we're north and south of the river  
  
I've been doing it wrong all of my life  
This holy town has turned me over  
A young man running from what he didn't understand  
The wind from the loch just get colder, colder  
  
There was a badness that had it's way  
But love wasn't lost, love will have it's day  
North and south of the river  
North and south of the river  
  
Can we stop playing these old tattoos  
Darling I don't have the answer  
I want to meet you where you are  
I don't need you to surrender  
  
'cause there's no feeling that's so alone  
As when the one you're hurting is your own  
North and south of the river  
North and south of the river  
North and south of the river  
  
Some high ground is not worth taking  
Some connections are not worth making  
There's an old church bell no longer ringing  
Some old songs are not worth bringing  
North  
(Higher ground is not worth taking)  
North and south of the river
