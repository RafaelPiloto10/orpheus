There ain't no man gonna invade my territory  
There ain't nobody out there gonna mess with me  
Because I'm big and hard and battlescarred  
And getting long in the tooth desperate and hungry  
And got nothing to loose.  
  
Yeah I'm a lone wolf I've been chased  
And I've been bit. Yeah I'm a lone wolf.  
They like to shoot at me but they miss.  
Yeah I'm a lone wolf and I ain't never been trapped,  
And God help the people that think they got me cornered at last.  
  
I've been hunting.I've been tracking.  
I've been running since I was 3, born in Louisiana Swamp,  
Moved with the pack to Tennessee.  
Raised by black and white dogs to some country, some rock-n-roll.  
They said now boy your gonna have to quit your houlling so.  
Staying up all night and chasing Lassies by the moon  
Laying up all day on the porch playing guitar tunes.  
  
Yeah I'm a lone wolf and I no longer run with the pack.  
Yeah I am a lone wolf.I don't ever look back.  
Hey I am a lone wolf out here on the prowl  
And most of us have been penned up but I'm still running wild.  
  
Hey I'm a lone wolf.I've been chased and I've been bit.  
Yeah I am a lone wolf this ole dog knows all the tricks.  
Hey I'm a lone wolf. Still hungry and I'm on the prowl,  
And most of us have been penned up but  
Bocephus is running wild.  
You better watch out because I'm hungry and I'm on the prowl.
