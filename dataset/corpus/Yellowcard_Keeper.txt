I wanna love, I wanna leave  
I want you to love me, I want you to leave me  
I want to stand where I can see  
I'm watching you love me, I'm watching you leavin' me now  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something that's real  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
  
I wanna know if I could be  
Someone to turn to that could never hurt you  
But I know what you think of me  
Yeah, you had a breakthrough and now I'm just bad news for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I should've told you everything  
I never gave you anything  
I should've told you everything  
If I could give you anything  
Then I would tell you everything  
  
I wish I could be somebody else  
I wish I could see you in myself  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
And say what you really feel  
You know I need something that's real  
I wish there was something inside me to keep you beside me  
  
I should've told you everything  
I should've told you everything  
I should've told you everything
