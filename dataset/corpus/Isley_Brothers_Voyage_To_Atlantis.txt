Can I go on my way without you  
Whoa...how can I know  
If I go on my way without you  
Whoa...where would I go  
  
Set sail with me  
Misty lady, set my spirit free  
New love to find  
And though I leave another behind  
  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
  
She's my lady, now and ever  
Whoa...how can I know  
Can we go all the way together  
Whoa...let it be so  
  
So we'll say our last goodbye  
And we'll make it this time  
Hey...ho...set sail with me  
To a paradise out beyond the sea  
  
Atlantis (Is back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
Atlantis (Is back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
  
Atlantis (Is back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
Atlantis (Is back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
  
Atlantis (Is back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)  
I'll always (Come back to you)
