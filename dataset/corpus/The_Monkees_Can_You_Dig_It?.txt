Some thing doesn't change  
There is only one  
Always changing inside  
What does it become  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
Those who know it use it  
Those who start it die  
To sing that you can dig it  
Is to make your summer fly  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
There is only feeling  
In this world of life and death  
I sing the praise of never change  
With every single breath  
  
Can you dig it?  
Do you know?  
Would you care to let it show?  
  
Hey!...
