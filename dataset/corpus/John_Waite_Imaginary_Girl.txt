Do you think you have to act  
Like you're someone else with me  
Like a cover girl  
Or a barbie doll  
  
Or a beauty queen  
You'll be gone when I wake up  
To the Rolling Stones  
And the jukes and earls  
  
But I ain't looking for  
An imaginary girl  
Who are you really?  
Come on tell me  
  
Deep behind blue eyes  
And what's on today's agenda  
In your enterprise  
Do you weigh the odds before you speak  
  
Straighten out your curls  
But I'm not taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
Yeah  
  
Who are you trying to be  
Why are you so counterfeit  
What's your problem  
Who do you want to be anyway  
  
'Cause I need reality  
That's right  
Come on be straight with me  
You're like a damaged nerve  
  
You're like a dirt road curve  
Do you think you have to act  
Like your someone else with me  
'Cause I don't believe you  
  
You're an imaginary girl  
Don't believe you babe  
Thought I saw you once  
When you just let go  
  
And took your heart down off the shelf  
When you turned around and looked at me baby  
You were nobody else  
That's what I'm looking for deep inside of you  
  
That hidden precious pearl  
Not the act of love  
From an imaginary girl  
I can't buy into your imaginary world  
  
Yeah  
Won't be taken in  
By an imaginary girl  
So who are you saving it for  
  
In your imaginary world  
Yeah  
I guess I'm resigned to an imaginary girl  
I'm in love with an imaginary girl
