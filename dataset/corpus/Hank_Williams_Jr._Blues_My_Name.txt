Well you walked in here and took that stool right next to me  
And you just got through your sad life's history  
I'd like a few words before you start again friend  
  
Blues my name, heartbreak is my next of kin  
  
I'm living in a world of misery  
Life ain't been peaches and cream for me  
And I ain't smiled since I don't know when friend  
  
Blues my name, heartbreak is my next of kin  
  
Yes I know what it's like to love and loose  
I've stood and watched my golden dreams turn to blue  
I've lost my love to someone I called my best friend  
  
Blues my name, heartbreak is my next of kin  
Blues my name, heartbreak is my next of kin
