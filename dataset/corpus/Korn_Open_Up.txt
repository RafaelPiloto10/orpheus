What were you thinking?  
I guess I'll never know  
See your eyes blinking, pupils begin to grow  
Killing you softly  
Pulling you in  
Making your mind up of whats sick or a sin  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
I'm quite certain  
Say it ain't so  
You're corrupted by some sick fuck  
Oh no  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.  
  
What you been taking  
It makes you talk real slow  
How come I'm thinking you'd be the last to know (you'd be the last to know)  
  
Choking you gently  
Gaining control  
Hand you the shovel  
To dig your own hole  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
I'm quite certain  
Say it ain't so  
You're corrupted by some sick fuck  
Oh no  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.  
  
Choking you gently  
Gaining control  
Hand you the shovel  
To dig your own hole  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.
