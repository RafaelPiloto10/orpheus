I've been sittin' here talkin' at you all night long  
Now honey you still come off cool  
Well you could have walked away instead you're leadin' me on  
Lucy who you tryin' to fool  
  
Yeah, Lucy Dee  
You ain't got to run that line on me  
Well it's plain to see  
That you ain't all that you're made out to be  
Well you can tell all your friends  
That you finally met your equal, Lucy Dee  
  
You've known all along just what I'm talkin' about  
Well you knew someday there'd come a man  
Who wouldn't keep on givin' 'til he finally gave out  
Lucy, honey, here I stand  
  
Well you tell me you've known every thrill there is to know  
And nothin' in this life comes free, nothin'  
Well you tell me you've been every way there is to go  
Lucy you ain't been with me  
  
Poor Lucy Dee
