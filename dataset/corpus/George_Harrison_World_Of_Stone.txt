Wise man, you wont be  
To follow the like of me  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long way to go  
  
We may disagree  
We all have the right to be  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long way to go  
Such a long, long way from home  
  
And we may disagree  
We all have the right to be  
In this world made out of stone  
Its such a long, long way to go  
  
The wiser you may be  
The harder it can be to see  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long, long way to go  
Such a long way from home  
  
In this world made of stone  
Such a long, long way to go  
And such a long way from om
