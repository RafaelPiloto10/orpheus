I got a date with the night  
Burnin' down my finger  
Gonna catch the kids dry  
Gonna walk on water  
Buyin' out the fight  
We're sweatin' in the winter  
Gonna catch ya squeeze tight  
  
Chow chow chow chow chow chow chow chow chow chow...  
  
Don't tell me to fix her  
Don't tell me to fix her  
Just take a bite  
No hangin' no picture  
Flyin' out my sight  
Droppin' brides at the altar  
Gonna find ya squeeze tight  
  
Chow chow chow chow chow chow chow chow chow chow...  
  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off off  
  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off off off  
  
Buyin' out the fight  
Gonna walk on water  
Gonna catch the kids dry  
Gonna bend my finger  
Flyin' out my sight  
We're sweatin' in the winter  
Gonna grab squeeze tight  
Gonna grab squeeze tight
