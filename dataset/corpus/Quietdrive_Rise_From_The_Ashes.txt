I felt this way before  
I fell right through the floor  
And I am certain I've become  
Broken, bruised, and numb  
Would you restate your opinion  
And hold back your investigation  
Do you see the sins you're making  
Cause I've made them all before  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
And my only hope  
Is falling down  
  
And by my own admission  
You'll find that my condition  
Is worse than you imagined  
You're better off if you know  
But every time before that I  
Tried to measure pain inside  
You can't ignore it  
Right now I can't ignore it  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
  
Inside of me (x7)  
I'll take my heart  
And rip my feelings out  
Before they make me doubt  
And I'll fall down with flames burning  
Alive again  
As long as you know that  
  
I will now rise from the ashes  
Don't call me pretentious  
I'm sitting here making my own rules  
And if I fall from the ceiling  
You'll be down there waiting  
To finish me  
Finish me
