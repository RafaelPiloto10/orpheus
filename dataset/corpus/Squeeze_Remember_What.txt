I can't remember what happened last night  
Was there trouble or was there a fight  
I was out with what was her name  
What I did will I ever do again  
And if I did it then what did I do  
Would you let that happen to you  
I'll give this morning back to my bed  
I can't remember I might be dead  
Cupids arrow sliding through the sky  
See you tomorrow come around tonight  
I can't remember what your kiss is like  
I can't remember if you're black or white  
I wish I could, I wish I would remember what  
I can't remember what happened at all  
  
I found my suit all over the hall  
My telephones looking upside down  
Was there paint all over the town  
Is it sunny and is it July  
Does it matter and if so then why  
I'll give this morning back to my cot  
I can't remember if I've been shot  
  
I can't remember which body is mine  
Is it the left or is it the right  
Maybe I had an excess of drink  
What's this mess I find in the sink  
Ashtrays emptied all over my shoes  
Everytime I this booze  
Can't find time for words on the phone  
I'll leave today to play on its own
