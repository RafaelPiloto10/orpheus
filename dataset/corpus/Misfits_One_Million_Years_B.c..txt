There calling me creatures of the night, beautiful music,  
Animal instinct survived the serpents tongue.  
So ancient before the dawn of time, like the rock of ages,  
I'm the blood of mankind.  
Oooohhh I've seen it all.  
Oooohhh from grace men fall, babylon curse of all creation,  
Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity.  
One million years bc, one million years bc, one million years bc  
Ten thousand centuries ago, cast down from heaven to pilage below.  
The serpents eyes still watching for it's easy prey,  
Feed upon the hopeless the weak and afraid.  
Oooohhh I've seen it all.  
Oooohhh from grace men fall, babylon curse of all creation,  
Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity.  
One million years bc, one million years bc, one million years bc
