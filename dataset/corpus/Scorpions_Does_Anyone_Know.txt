Is this world out of control  
Say what is right what is wrong  
Do I know this world at all  
I think I do but then I don't  
I'm confused by what I see  
I try to understand  
But it makes no sense at all  
I'm confused by what I feel  
I thought that our love  
Was something that is real  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
So many things that I recall  
When we were young just flying high  
Can we turn our fate at all  
I wish we could say don't you cry  
I'm confused by what I hear  
Girl it seems to me  
We're losing after all  
I'm confused by what I feel  
I thought that our love  
Was something that is real  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
Another day has just begun  
Life goes on there's no return  
How can I trust anyone  
When honesty is such a dirty word  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
Yeah
