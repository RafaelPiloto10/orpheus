I have waited oh, so long  
Please don't tell me baby I was wrong  
Dreaming of you every night  
Holding back until the time was right  
  
I've counted the days, day after day  
Since we've been apart  
Now I've found my way, I've found my way  
Right back to your heart  
  
I've been searching for you every where  
Calling you, but you were never there  
Seeking in the dark of night  
Hoping one day you would shine a light  
  
I've counted each day, day after day  
Since we've been apart  
Now I've found my way, I've found my way  
Right back to your heart  
  
I have waited oh, so long  
Please don't tell me baby I was wrong  
Dreaming of you every night, every night, every night  
Holding back until the time was right  
  
Ooh, I have waited so long  
Aah, don't tell me I was wrong  
  
I dream of you, I'm dreaming of you baby  
  
Don't go away
