She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
  
Though her hands are cool they'll burn  
You may kiss her but you'll have to take your turn  
In her life you're just another bird in the sky  
When she says you must be ready to fly  
Ready to fly, up and fly away  
  
She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
  
This lady has no love  
Herself, perhaps, is who she puts above  
Everything, and of course, everyone  
Knows this lady thinks she's number one  
Number one, yes the only one  
  
She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
  
She's gonna fall on her face someday  
Find other men for her games to play  
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows  
What she is trying to do  
  
She's a face without a soul  
This lady's heart is gold  
She's a face without a soul
