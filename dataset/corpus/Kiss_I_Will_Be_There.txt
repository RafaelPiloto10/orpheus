Each and every day  
People turn away  
Change the things they feel  
Change the things they say  
  
We can never know  
Where our lives will lead  
Wherever you go  
Whenever you need  
  
I Will Be There  
want to be there  
I will hear you when you call  
Give you anything at all  
I Will Be There  
Anywhere  
Like a father to his son  
  
You are just a child  
All is yet to be  
Growing all the while  
Knowing when you leave  
  
I Will Be There  
want to be there  
Only blood will run so deep  
Seal the promise I will keep  
I Will Be There  
Anywhere  
Like a father to his son  
I can swear to only one  
  
Time moves quickly as the years go by  
All these moments slip away  
When I'm gone and life will carry on  
You will know someway  
  
I Will Be There  
I Will Be There  
I Will Be There  
want to be there  
Only blood will run so deep  
Seal the promise I will keep  
I Will Be There  
Like a father to his son  
I must swear to only one
