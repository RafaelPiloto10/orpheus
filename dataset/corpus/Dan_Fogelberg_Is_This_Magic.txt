Is it the voice of the whispering sea?  
Or is it the way we're dancing?  
Is it the way that the moon  
Hits your eyes?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Is it the way that you sway  
In my arms?  
Or is it the soft winds blowing?  
Is it the music that carries us off?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the rush of the surf  
That I hear?  
Or only our mad hearts beating?  
Will this be only a fleeting affair?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the voice of the whispering sea?  
Or is it the way we're dancing?  
Will this be only a fleeting affair?  
Or is this magic?...
