Whose eyes in my behind  
I don't recognize anything that I see  
Whose skin is this design  
I don't want this to be the way that you see me  
  
I don't understand anything anymore  
And this web that I'm tied up  
Is taking me right up these walls  
That I climb up to get to your story  
It's anything but ordinary  
  
And when the world is on its knees  
With me, its fine  
And when I come to the rescue,  
I get nothing but left behind  
Everybody seems to be getting what they need  
Where's mine?  
'Cause you're what I need  
So very but I'm anything but ordinary  
  
Can you save me from this world of mine  
Before I get myself arrested with these expectations  
You are the one, look what you've done  
What have you done  
This is not some kind of joke  
You're just a kid  
You weren't ready for what you did, no  
  
And when the world is on its knees  
With me, its fine  
And when I come to the rescue,  
I do it for you time after time  
Everybody seems to be getting what they need  
Where's mine?  
'Cause you're what I need  
So very but I'm anything but ordinary  
  
I think I'm trying to save the world for you  
You've been saving me too  
We could just stay and save each other  
  
I'm anything but ordinary  
I'm anything but ordinary
