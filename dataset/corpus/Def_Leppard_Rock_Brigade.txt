Well, in the middle of the night  
And the early morning light  
You can hear them a million miles away  
They'll be bangin' on their drums  
Bangin' on your door  
Waving their flags telling you to score  
  
Watch out for the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
Oh, no it's the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
Look out for the rock brigade  
Leading you away, away  
  
So when they hit your town  
You'd better get down  
I'm telling no lies to you mister  
'Cause they live for rock 'n' roll  
They'll try to steal your soul  
Might even try to steal your sister, oh  
  
So in the middle of the night  
Or the early morning light  
If you hear them comin' your way  
Well you'd better watch your step  
Don't step out of line  
'Cause here they come one more time  
Watch out for the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
Oh no it's the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
Look out for the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
You better watch out for the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
I say watch out for the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
Keep your eyes on the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
Don't let your eyes off the rock brigade  
(Rock brigade)  
They'll be leading you away, away, away
