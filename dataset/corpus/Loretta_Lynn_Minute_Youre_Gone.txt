The minute you're gone I cry the minute you're gone I die  
Before you walked out of sight I'm like a child all alone at night  
I stare into emptiness I'm filled with such loneliness  
My world goes from right to wrong the minute you're gone  
The minute you're gone I see just how lonely I'm gonna be  
My life would be oh so blue if I couldn't be with you  
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say  
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone  
  
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say  
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone
