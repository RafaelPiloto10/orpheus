You'll never know, what you've done for me  
What your faith in me, has done for my soul  
You'll never know the gift you've given me  
I'll carry it with me, yeah yeah  
  
Through the days ahead I'll think of days before  
You made me hope for something better  
And made me reach for something more  
  
You taught me to run  
You taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
You opened my eyes  
You opened the door  
To something I've never known before  
And your love, is the music of my heart  
(music of my heart)  
  
You were the one, always on my side  
(always on my side)  
Always standing by  
(always standing by)  
Seeing me through  
You were the song that always made me sing  
(made me sing)  
I'm singing this for you  
Everywhere I go, I'll think of where I've been  
And all of ones who knew me better then any One ever will again  
  
You taught me to run  
You taught me to fly  
Helped to free the me inside  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
You opened my eyes you opened the door  
To something I've never known before  
And your love, is the music of my heart  
  
What you've taught me  
Only your love could ever teach me  
You got through when no one could reach me before  
'Cause you always saw in me  
All the best that I could be  
It was you who set me free  
  
You taught me to run  
You taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
  
You taught me to run  
You taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside  
(me inside) Helped me hear the music of my heart  
(music of my heart)  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
You opened my eyes  
You opened the door  
To something I've never known before  
And your love, is the music of my heart  
  
Music of my heart  
Music of my heart  
Is the music of my heart
