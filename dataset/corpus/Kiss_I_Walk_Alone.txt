I know deep inside of me  
There's a place but it's not plain to see  
I belong, where no one else can be  
  
I'm searching for myself again  
And here I'm all alone and when  
I close my eyes, no one else can see  
  
I walk alone, can't you see?  
I don't belong, let me be  
Everything I dreamed of being is me  
  
And I got myself to lean on  
Got both my feet on the ground  
  
You don't know me, I don't know me  
I can't see you, you can't see me  
Close my eyes, leave the world behind  
  
So I got no heart, got no home  
I got no song where I belong  
I don't worry, everything's just fine  
  
I walk alone, can't you see?  
I don't belong, let me be  
Everything I dreamed of being  
  
And I don't belong, can't you see?  
I walk alone, let me be  
Everything I dreamed of being is me  
  
And I got myself to lean on  
I got both my feet on the ground  
  
So I got no heart, and I got no home  
And I got no song where I belong  
I don't worry, everything's just  
  
I got myself to lean on  
Got both my feet on the ground  
  
And I got myself to lean on  
Got both my feet on the ground  
  
Cause I know deep inside of me  
There's a place but it's not plain to see  
Where I belong, where no one else can be  
  
And I'm searchin' for myself again  
And here I'm all alone and when  
I close my eyes, and no one else can see
