State the obvious,  
I didn't get my perfect fantasy  
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me  
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy  
That's fine!  
I'll tell mine  
You're gay  
By the way  
  
I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
There's no time for tears,  
I'm just sitting here  
Planning my revenge  
There's nothing stopping me  
From going out with all of your best friends  
And if you come around saying sorry to me  
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be  
  
'Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
If you're missing me,  
You'd better keep it to yourself  
'Cause coming back around here  
Would be bad for your health  
  
'Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
In case you haven't heard  
  
I really really hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn  
Just another picture to burn  
Baby, burn
