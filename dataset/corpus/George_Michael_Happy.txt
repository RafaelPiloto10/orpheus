First you take of your hat  
Then you take of those brand new shoes  
Say 'Hey George, what've you got to lose?'  
With my hand on yur thigh  
I just look you in the eye and say  
'Not a whole lot baby  
But a whole lot more than you'  
  
I can make you happy (yeah, yeah)  
Don't you know that?  
She said  
I can make you happy  
  
Boys and girls  
The ones who kiss and tell  
Why should we have to believe them?  
No, I don't understand  
How any woman, how any man  
Can say 'Lay me down, lay me down'  
For that big stash-cheap cash-think about the money  
  
I can make you happy (yeah, yeah)  
Don't you know that?  
She said  
I can make you happy  
  
I've seen you in the corner  
With your rub-it-on tan  
Hitching a ride  
Could be a woman or a man  
Gonna get what you want before too long  
Gonna take your oppurtunities  
Right or wrong  
  
Some poor cow with a seven-year itch?  
You don't dig men  
But you'll fuch 'em if they're rich  
You can't be--with me  
You're a low life, daughterofasonofabitch
