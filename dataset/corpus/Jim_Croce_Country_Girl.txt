She was just a country girl  
Didn't have those New York City ways  
When she hopped a bus in Ohio  
Headin' for the crowded streets where no one says a word  
  
She was just a country girl living in the lonely city  
Met a man who learned her name  
She became a woman on a rainy New York night  
  
There's a new day dawnin' in the city  
She calls her Mama collect  
Sayin' Mama send bus fare back to Ohio  
Have somebody meet me at the depot  
  
She was just a country girl  
Spent some time in New York City  
Now she tells her friends about lonely New York City  
And her lonely New York night  
  
There's a new day dawnin' in the city  
She calls her Mama collect  
Sayin' Mama send bus fare back to Ohio  
Have somebody meet me at the depot  
  
She was just a country girl  
She was just a country girl
