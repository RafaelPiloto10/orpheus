There's a time for all our innocence  
When the tears aren't far away  
And a time to build a strong defense  
When the boy's too old to play  
And we learn the hard way  
Day by day  
Giving in but always coming back for more  
And we cry no more...cry no more.  
There's a time for games and visions  
And the stake is more or less  
There's a time for fast decisions  
When our dreams become success.  
We do anything to raise that score  
Cause the end will always justify the means  
And we cry no more.  
Cry no more...and we cry no more  
Our year's in misery  
Made dreams reality. Ohh  
And we cry no more  
Cry no more...and we cry no more
