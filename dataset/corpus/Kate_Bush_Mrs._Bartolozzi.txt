I remember it was that Wednesday  
Oh when it rained and it rained  
They traipsed mud all over the house  
It took hours and hours to scrub it out  
All over the hall carpet  
I took my mop and bucket  
And I cleaned and I cleaned  
  
The kitchen floor  
Until it sparkled  
Then I took my laundry basket  
And put the linen all in it  
And everything I could fit in it  
And all our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash  
And all your shirts and jeans and things  
And put them in the new washing machine  
Washing machine  
Washing machine  
  
I watched them go 'round and 'round  
My blouse wrapping itself in your trousers  
Oh the waves are going out  
My skirt floating up around my waist  
As I wade out into the surf  
Oh and the waves are coming in  
Oh and the waves are going out  
Oh and you're standing right behind me  
Little fish swim between my legs  
  
Oh and the waves are coming in  
Oh and the waves are going out  
Oh and the waves are coming in  
Out of the corner of my eye  
I think I see you standing outside  
But it's just your shirt  
Hanging on the washing line  
Waving its arm as the wind blows by  
And it looks so alive  
Nice and white  
Just like its climbed right out  
Of my washing machine  
Washing machine  
Washing machine  
  
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy  
Get that dirty shirty clean  
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy  
Make those cuffs and collars gleam  
Everything clean and shiny  
  
Washing machine  
Washing machine  
Washing machine
