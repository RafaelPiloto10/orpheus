Trained bodies in coordination  
Is that a better way for bunker soldiers  
But it's a nicer way to spend a war  
On lava beaches and sandy seaside  
The rusting bodies are surplus now then  
We never taught them how to fight like that  
The object's exercise is so compulsive  
It's not a better way but it still suits us  
I'd give up rice fields to fight like you

It's not a better way  
Though we are here to stay  
Well that might seem ok  
  
Waves of people  
In strange directions  
It's no use talking  
There's no decisions  
They gave up houses to be refugees  
The mud in ditches is over their knees  
The sand bagged trenches are over our heads  
This kind of warfare's become hide and seek  
Though khaki uniforms are universal  
Your propaganda is losing appeal  
I'd give up rice fields to fight like you  
I'd give up rice fields to fight like you
