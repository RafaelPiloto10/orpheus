From the fountains in the mountains  
Comes the water running cool and clear and blue  
And it comes down from the hills  
And it goes down to the towns and passes through  
When it gets down to the cities  
Then the water turns into a dirty gray  
It's poisoned and polluted  
By the people as it goes along its way  
Don't go near the water children  
See the fish all dead upon the shore  
Don't go near the water  
'Cause the water isn't water anymore  
I took my boy fishin' to my old favorite fishin' hole  
I had caught many a fish out of that deep clear water  
From the time I was a boy like him  
After we'd fished a few minutes  
He said, "Did you get a bite yet daddy?"  
I said, "I think I got a nibble son"  
"Me too", he said  
Then he said, "Daddy if we catch a fish can we eat him"  
I said, "Well there was a time son  
This water's bad now and I might not be safe to eat the fish  
But there was a time"  
There was a time the air was clean  
And you could see forever 'cross the plains  
The wind was sweet as honey  
And no one had ever heard of acid rain  
We're torturin' the earth  
And pourin' every kind of evil in the sea  
We violated nature  
And our children have to pay the penalty  
Don't go near the water children  
See the fish all dead upon the shore  
Don't go near the water  
'Cause the water isn't water anymore  
Don't go near the water children  
See the fish all dead upon the shore  
Don't go near the water  
'Cause the water isn't water anymore
