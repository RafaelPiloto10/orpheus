Loose lips on ships  
I'm getting to grips  
With what you said  
No it's not in my head  
I can't awaken the dead  
Day after day  
  
Why don't we talk about it  
Why do you always doubt that there can be a better way  
It doesn't make me want to stay  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't we break up  
There's nothing left to say  
I got my eye shut praying they won't stray  
Oh! When I sexed up  
That's what makes the difference today  
I hope you blow away  
  
You said we're fatally flawed  
When I'm easily bored, Is that okay?  
Write me off your list  
Make this the last kiss  
I'll walk away  
  
Why don't we talk about it  
I'm only here  
Don't shout it  
Given time we'll forget  
Let's pretend we never met  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Screw you I didn't like your taste  
Anyway, I chose you  
And that's all gone to wasted  
Saturday I'll go out and find another you  
  
Why don't we, Why don't we break up  
There's nothing left to say  
I got my eye shut praying they won't stray  
Oh! When I sexed up  
That's what makes the difference today  
I hope you blow away
