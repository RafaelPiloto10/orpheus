I'm so glad that I met you, baby  
I'm so proud when we walk in the room  
I know it's crazy to worry like I do  
I get this feelin' that I'm losing you  
  
[Chorus]  
I get these suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me, baby  
And I really shouldn't feel this way  
(Ooo, suspicions)  
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'  
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me  
  
When I go out to a party with you  
You always turn every head in the room  
And I just know what's on every man's mind  
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes  
  
I get these suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me, baby  
And I really shouldn't feel this way  
(Ooo, suspicions)  
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'  
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me  
  
Oh baby, oh darlin'  
  
When I'm with you, I feel so satisfied  
The way you touch me when you lay by my side  
That look in your eyes when we make love  
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of  
  
I get these suspicions  
Even though I know that you love me, baby  
And I really shouldn't feel this way  
(Ooo, suspicions)  
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'  
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me  
  
(Suspicions)  
Even though I know that you love me, baby  
And I really shouldn't feel this way  
(Ooo, suspicions)  
I can't help it, you're just so good lookin'  
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me  
(Suspicions) Oh baby, oh darlin'  
(Suspicions) 'Cause I love her, 'cause I love her  
I love her, and she loves me  
(Suspicions) Ain't nobody gonna take my girl from me  
(Suspicions)  
(Ooo, suspicions)  
(Ooo, suspicions)
