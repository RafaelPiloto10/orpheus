Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born,  
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud,  
Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone,  
All graceful instruments are known.  
  
When the windows all are broken and your love's become a toothless crone,  
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,  
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone.  
  
The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own,  
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud  
This ground on which the seed of love is sown,  
All graceful instruments are known.
