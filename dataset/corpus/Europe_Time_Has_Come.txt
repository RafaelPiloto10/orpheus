Long for the sailor, beneath the skies  
Long for the white dove, no matter where she flies  
Long for the stranger you know so well.  
  
Pray for the soldier, who's wounded bad  
Pray for the dreamer, he's still so sad  
Pray for the stranger you know so well.  
  
Cause I'm coming home.  
  
Now the time has come  
  
For me to come back home.  
  
Long for the eagle, on wings so strong  
Long for the hunter, he won't be long  
Long for the stranger you know so well.
