I wish I could go  
Off far away  
Where time moves too slow  
Day after day  
  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by  
  
I have a fixation with laziness  
Procrastination, is what I do best  
  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by  
  
Where has my ambition gone  
I haven't seen it for so long  
Am I a burden to someone  
  
Life, I am so tired  
Of everything  
All my desire  
Is vanishing  
  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by
