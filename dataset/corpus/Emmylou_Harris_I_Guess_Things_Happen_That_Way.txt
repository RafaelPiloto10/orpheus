Well, you ask me if I'll forget my baby  
I guess I will some day  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if I'll get along  
I guess I will some way  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
God gave me that girl to lean on, then he put me on my own  
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses  
I guess I will every day  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if I'll find another  
I don't know, I can't say  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
