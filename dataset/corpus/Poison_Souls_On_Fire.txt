It takes two to tango  
In the heat of the night  
You're gonna give it in  
No matter how you fight  
  
Hot nights, pretty women  
And a bottle of gin  
Fine floozy sitting pretty  
In the city of sin  
I'm knocking on your back door  
Baby let me in  
  
Chorus:  
I'll take you down  
Light your fuse baby  
Set your soul on fire  
Make your body sweat  
Soaking wet  
In the midnight hour  
  
Step closer my seniorita  
It's so nice to meet ya  
I see your eyes say no  
But your flesh is weak  
  
Well sweet salt shaker  
And rattle my bones  
One more inch I'm gonna drive it home  
Hate to see a pretty little woman all alone  
  
Chorus  
  
She said are you gonna nibble baby  
Or are you gonna take yourself a bite  
You invite me closer honey  
And I just might  
  
I don't want money or a big black car  
I just wanna know how I'm doing so far  
So far I'm gonna do you just right  
  
Chorus
