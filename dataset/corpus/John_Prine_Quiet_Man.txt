Strolling down the highway with my shoes in my hand  
I don't talk much I'm a quiet man  
Beauty and silence both run deep  
And running like crazy while you are alseep  
  
[Chorus]  
You got news for me,I got nothing for you  
Don't pin your blues on me  
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to  
Last Monday night I saw a fight  
  
Between Wednesday and Thursday over Saturday night  
Tuesday asked me what was going on I said,  
"Sunday's in the meadow and Friday's in the corn."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hocus-pocus, Maladjusted  
Don't you think my tears get rusted  
Steady losing means you ain't using  
What you really think is right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight  
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight  
Rays and beams of incredible dreams  
And I am a quiet man.  
  
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight  
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight  
Rays and beams of incredible dreams  
And I am a quiet man.  
  
Oodles of light what a beautiful sight  
Both of God's eyes are shining tonight  
Rays and beams of incredible dreams  
And I am a quiet man.
