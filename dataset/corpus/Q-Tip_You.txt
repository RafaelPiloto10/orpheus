Wait  
At the end of it all its you  
And at the end of it all its you  
And at the end  
It's you  
At the end of it all its you  
It's you  
It's you  
At the end of it all its you  
It's you  
It's you  
At the end of it all  
  
Looking, for how I see her  
When I finally realized couldn't believe it  
I couldn't, even swallow  
Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow  
I had a notion that things were fishy  
But everything was fine so why be pissy  
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get it in  
That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin  
Where you at?  
Where you going?  
That's what I get when I pick up the phone  
Not a hello or I miss you  
Or the renaissance, how does it do?  
Suspicious ones, go few  
Can stress out your brain  
It weighs on your man  
And helps your peep game, I thought it was me  
But then I could see  
  
It was you  
It's you  
At the end of it all it was you  
And at the end  
It was you  
At the end of it all it was you  
And at the end  
It's you  
It's you  
At the end of it all its you  
It's you  
It's you  
At the end of it all  
  
I couldn't take it  
But the spell of love  
I couldn't shake it  
Even though, I would discover  
That there was somebody else  
It was your lover  
You gave me up  
And managed to turn the tables  
And all your honest words they turn to fables  
The things that you would accuse me of  
It seem were the things you were doing love  
Get it? These things you projected  
And I don't want to be affected  
But when you get in love  
It's never easy love  
To make decisions of  
You've defected  
You were doing so much to try to pin me  
Going through all my stuff, but it was empty  
Answers, that I'm seeking  
Well it seem I'm getting close  
That I'm reaching  
And I was thinking, I had no reason  
Calling you a culprit, it was treason  
And the twinkle, in your eye  
It was kinda not for love  
And tell me why?  
We'll make amends if you admit it  
We can ascend if you're committed  
Your heart, is it in it?  
If it goes for many days  
Sweet love can decay from you  
  
It's you  
At the end of it all it was you  
And at the end  
It was you  
At the end of it all it was you  
And the end  
It's you  
It's you  
At the end of it all its you  
It's you  
It's you  
At the end of it all
