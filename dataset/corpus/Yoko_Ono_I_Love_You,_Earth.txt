I love you, earth, you are beautiful,  
I love the way you are.  
I know I never said it to you,  
But I want to say it now.  
I love you, I love you, I love you, earth.  
I love you, I love you, I love you now.  
  
I love you, earth, you are beautiful,  
I love the way you shine.  
I love your valleys, I love your mornings,  
In fact I love you ev'ry day.  
I know I never said it to you,  
Why, I'd never know.  
Over blue mountains, over green fields,  
I want to scream about it now.  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you, earth.  
I love you, I love you, I love you now.  
  
You are our meeting point of infinity,  
You are our turning point in eternity.  
  
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you) I love you, earth.  
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you) I love you now.  
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you) I love you, earth.  
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you) I love you now.
