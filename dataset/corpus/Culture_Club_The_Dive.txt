When I wake up feeling victimized  
There is nothing  
That can stop my eyes  
From crying  
  
When you put the pressure  
Down on me  
Cause I don't quite fit  
You imagery  
I'm trying  
  
Baby I'm no superman  
  
[Chorus:]  
Eyes like a deep blue sea  
To dive in  
Love that you give to me  
We're surviving  
Surviving  
When love is gone  
I can't carry on  
  
When you know that love  
Is on my mind  
It's a perfect chance  
To be unkind  
You do it  
  
Being sly you take a chance  
On crime  
But the master has a new design  
On loving, living  
Out and in the enemy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Eyes that open wide  
Do you do  
Love you give the child  
Do you do  
Why do you do that to me?  
  
When I wake up feeling victimized  
There is nothing  
That can stop my eyes  
From crying  
  
When you put the pressure  
Down on me  
Cause I don't quite fit  
Your imagery  
I'm trying  
  
I'm no superman  
  
[Chorus]
