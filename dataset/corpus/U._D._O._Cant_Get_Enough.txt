Again it's around seven  
I'm burning like a candlelight  
I don't know where I'm going  
But I'm ready for this night  
  
You'd better run for cover  
Before I start to smile  
No way there's time for wasting  
Never walk in a line  
Never walk in a line  
Oh yeah  
  
And I just keep going  
Forget these boring times  
And I'm hungry for desire  
No way to live in a line  
  
You'd better run for cover  
Before I start to smile  
No way there's time for wasting  
Never walk in a line  
  
Reckless and mean I'm ruling the scene - I never get enough  
Acting the night - I'm gone with the light - I can't  
get enough  
I never get enough  
  
Again it's around seven  
I'm burning like a candlelight  
I don't know where I'm going  
But I'm ready for this night  
  
Reckless and mean I'm ruling the scene - I never get enough  
Acting the night - I'm gone with the light - I can't  
get enough  
  
Reckless and mean I'm ruling the scene - I never get enough  
Acting the night - I'm gone with the light - I can't  
get enough  
I never get enough
