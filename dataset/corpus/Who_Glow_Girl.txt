Separates and lingerie, seven pairs of shoes,  
Lots of Woolworth's makeup, a pair of Black Watch trews,  
Your out-of-tune piano, sentimental photographs,  
A million little memories, a million little laughs.  
  
The wing of the airplane has just caught on fire,  
I say without reservation we ain't getting no higher.  
  
All you wanted from me, all I had to give,  
Nothing matters you'll see, when in paradise you live,  
The plane is diving faster, we're getting near the ground,  
Nobody is screaming, no one makes a sound.  
  
It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl [Repeat: x4]
