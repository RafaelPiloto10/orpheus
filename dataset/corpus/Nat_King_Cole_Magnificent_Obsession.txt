(frankie laine, fred karger)  
  
You're my magnificent obsession  
The greatest wonder on this earth.  
The taj mahal and other spendors  
To me really have no worth.  
  
You're my magificent possession,  
A treasure lent me from above.  
As long as I have breath within me,  
You'll be my one and only love.
