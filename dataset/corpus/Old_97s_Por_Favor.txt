What will you say to St. Peter  
When you meet him in the by and by?  
Will you grease your way into Heaven?  
Oh can you even look St. Peter in the eye?  
Oh will you tell him all your details of your sinnin'?  
Will you tell him all the loved ones you done lost?  
Will you name off all the broken hearted women?  
Or the one who double-crossed you and got herself double-crossed?  
I said, ?Dear Lord, por favor, I need a favor  
Well can You help me get back that what is no more?  
Well I double-crossed the woman who was two-timin' me  
She gave me one good reason, I gave her what for  
Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor"  
What will you say to your Savior  
When you meet Him in the promised land?  
Will you walk with Him through the valley?  
Or will you let your Savior lead you by the hand?  
Oh will you tell Him all the details of your sinnin'?  
Will you tell Him all the loved ones you done hurt?  
Will you name off all the broken hearted women?  
Or the one you buried three feet deep in wet East Texas dirt?  
I said, ?Dear Lord, por favor, I need a favor  
Well can You help me undo that what is done for?  
Well I double-crossed the woman who was two-timin' me  
She gave me one good reason, yeah I gave her what for  
Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor"  
Oh I said, ?Dear Lord, por favor, I need a favor  
Well can You help me get back that what is no more?  
Well I double-crossed the woman who was two-timin' me  
She gave me one good reason, yeah I gave her what for  
Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor"  
Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor  
Ah por favor, por favor, por favor
