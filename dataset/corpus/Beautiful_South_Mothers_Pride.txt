Here he comes  
Mother's Pride  
With the first ever satchel she bought him swinging by his side  
Here he comes Mother's Pride  
With a headful of 'get your laces tied' and 'woe betide'  
  
With a year's supply of sandwiches and fairy cakes  
That she provides for him to eat at dinner breaks  
It's no surprise at all, at ad the friends he makes  
His stomach aches  
he's Mother's Pride  
  
He's presentable, well looked after  
He's domestically disastrous  
He's adorable  
Mother's Pride  
  
Here he comes  
Father's Pride  
With a head filled up with devil dogs and genocide  
Here he comes  
Father's Pride  
He's showing all the kids his tickets for ringside  
  
He'll always roam the yard looking for a fight  
He'll pick on all the kids who're twice his height  
He's the reason dinner ladies toss and turn at night  
Teacher's Blight  
Father's Pride  
  
He's the image of his Dad  
Mickey Mouse meets Jack the Lad  
He's never sad  
Father's Pride  
  
Here he comes Mother's Pride  
Here he comes Father's Pride  
Here he comes Mother's Pride  
Father's Pride  
His Mother's Pride
