Well I was ruling the roost, had all the chicks to myself.  
And suddenly it happened, that funny little feeling I felt.  
Well I tried to outrun it, but it finally caught up with me.  
Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style,  
But I lost that race by a good old country mile.  
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high,  
And it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise.  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.
