I can see that look in your eyes  
You're in need of something you can't find  
You're tired of holding on to the pain  
You haven't got the strength to hold the reigns  
You are out of lane  
  
[Chorus]  
I know you can't take it  
I know you can't take it anymore  
I know you can't fake it  
I know you can't fake it anymore  
Now it's time for you to open a new door  
  
You fool yourself when you live a lie  
You spend all of your time getting high  
But drunken nights won't bury your fears  
All the drinks you had just turned to tears  
For too many years  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you think that nobody cares  
Close your eyes and know that God is there  
And if you reach out He'll do the same  
Just ask for what you need in Jesus name  
Don't be ashamed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it's time for you to open a new door
