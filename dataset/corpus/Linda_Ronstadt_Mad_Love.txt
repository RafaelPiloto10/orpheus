If I can't get away from you  
What am I gonna do  
Cause you hit me just like a dream  
Where there's no in-between  
Cause I just fall forever  
Fall forever in your eyes  
  
Cause it's a mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Can't help falling now  
Falling into mad love  
  
Well you're shorting out all my pride  
Like fireworks exploding inside  
You're just something I can't deny  
Why tell me baby why  
Cause I just fall forever  
Fall forever in your eyes  
  
Cause it's a mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Can't help falling now  
Falling into mad love  
  
If I can't get away from you  
What am I gonna do  
Now you call me up and you're so cool  
What d'ya what do you want me to do  
  
Cause it's a mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
I can't help it  
Mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Mad mad love  
Can't help falling now  
Falling into mad love
