Love is a flame that can't be tamed,  
And though we are its willing pray, my darling,  
We are not the ones to blame  
  
Trust is a word all lovers know,  
The glorious art of staining souls, my darling,  
We are not the ones to blame  
  
The more we have, the more we want,  
And the more it hurts our heart, my baby,  
It always ends up in tears  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heaven's worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
  
When doubts arise the game begins  
The one we will never win, my baby,  
It always ends up in tears  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heaven's worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right (c'mon) c'mon  
  
So keep on Pretending  
Our heaven's worth the waiting  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
So keep on Pretending  
It will be the end of our craving  
Keep on Pretending  
It's all right  
  
Love is a flame that can't be tamed,  
And though we are its willing pray, my darling,  
We are not the ones to blame
