One step hesitation  
One step into the night  
Don't mind the weather  
It's raining in my heart tonight  
  
Much more to living  
Two wrongs don't make a right  
You're gonna regret it  
When you're looking back  
On your life  
  
Don't go away  
Make the most of this love I'm giving  
Don't go away  
Better take another look at my face  
You can be what you wanna be, hm  
But don't go away  
  
Some dream of fortune  
Others dream of fame  
Seconds after leaving  
Life'll never be the same  
  
Fell for temptation  
It didn't mean a thing  
We'll last forever  
If you turn around  
Once again  
  
Don't go away  
Make the most of this love I'm giving  
Don't go away  
Better take another look at my face  
You can be what you wanna be, hm  
But don't go away  
  
Do you wanna be more than a picture hanging on the wall  
Something to remind me of how it all went wrong  
Do you wanna be more than a number forgotten in a book  
You're holding something special, so take another look  
  
You're gonna regret it  
When you're looking back  
On your life  
  
Don't go away  
Make the most of this love I'm giving  
Don't go away  
Better take another look at my face  
You can be what you wanna be, hm  
But don't go away  
  
Take a look  
Take another look on your way  
Take a look  
Take another look on your way  
  
Please don't go
