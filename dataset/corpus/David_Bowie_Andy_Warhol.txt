(This is Andy Warhole and it's take one, take one)  
It's, it's Warhol actually  
(What did I say)  
Whole, it's whole as in wholes  
(Andy Warhol)  
Wah, Andy War hol, Andy War hol (he)  
Like whole hub  
He  
Ha  
Are you ready  
(Yeah)  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Like to take a cement fix  
Be a standing cinema  
Dress my friends up just for show  
See them as they really are  
Put a peephole in my brain  
Two New Pence to have a go  
I'd like to be a gallery  
Put you all inside my show  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen  
Can't tell them apart at all  
  
Andy walking, Andy tired  
Andy take a little snooze  
Tie him up when he's fast asleep  
Send him on a pleasant cruise (hm hm hm)  
When he wakes up on the sea  
He sure to think of me and you  
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue  
What a jolly boring thing to do  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen  
Can't tell them apart at all  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen  
Can't tell them apart at all
