Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all  
Let me remember the things I've done  
Walk on the log where the catfish bite  
Walking along the river road at night  
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight  
I can hear the bullfrog calling me, "Ribbit"  
Wonderin' if my rope's still hangin' to the tree  
Ole Brody Junior took me over  
Said, "You're gonna find a well that's colder  
If I'm a bad boss, give some O'Green river", well  
Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all  
Let me remember the things I've done  
Walk on the log where the catfish bite  
Walking along the river road at night  
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight  
Well
