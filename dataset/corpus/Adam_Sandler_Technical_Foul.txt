If you're comin' from the street with dirty shoes on your feet  
That's a technical foul

That's a technical foul  
  
If you don't shut the door  
After using the frigerator  
That's a technical foul  
A technical foul  
  
If you touch the thermostat  
You'll get hit with a bat  
Cause that's a technical foul  
(You will feel my wrath)  
If your hair clogs the drain  
You'll know the meaning of pain  
Cause that's a technical foul  
(I'll show you no mercy)  
  
Ho, this is such bullshit-ah!  
Hey!  
In this house we say bull STICK  
Or it's a technical foul  
A technical foul  
  
If I don't spray Lysol after moving a bowel  
That's a technical foul  
If I decide to wash my ass with your monogram towel  
That's a technical foul  
(Please say hiney!)  
  
If I make fun of your crazy feeties  
Or give sugar cookies to Miss Diabetes  
That's not really a technical foul  
But possibly a homicide  
  
Can I sleep past three?  
If you do, you'll get a T!  
Take a whiz in those flowers?  
I'll say hit the showers!  
Use this horn as a bong?  
Adios, Tommy Chong!  
Make some long distance calls?  
You'll get a kick in the balls!  
Oops!  
  
Can I walk around with my morning erection?  
If you want an automatic ejection

There are certain rules which apply in one's life  
With your sister, friends, or imaginary wife  
  
(Adam)  
I can't believe I haven't killed myself  
Here with Wigs McGee and the Furry Elf  
She's (???) and he's so small  
How did I get stuck in this shit hole?  
Guess I'll have to deal with your demands  
But please don't touch me with your alien hands  
  
(Whitey)  
(??) carries over beyond my court  
Whether you're a Jewish guy, (???) or especially short  
I think I'll sing to my (???)  
My imaginary wife is named (???)  
  
(Elenore)  
They took my wig  
I remember the look in their eyes  
Why, oh why  
Won't someone retreive my wig, wig, wig  
  
I got no right to growl  
Watch out, she's on the prowl  
Without my wig, I look like an owl  
Hoo hoo!  
(Oh my God!)  
  
Don't laugh at her!  
Or it's a technical foul  
A technical foul  
A technical foul
