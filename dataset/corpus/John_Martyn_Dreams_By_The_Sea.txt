N-no, n-no, it can't be true  
N-no, n-no, it isn't you  
N-no, n-no, it's not the way you are  
N-no, n-no, it isn't you  
N-no, n-no, it can't be true  
N-no, n-no, it's not the way you are  
Bad dreams for me  
Bad dreams by the sea  
Dreamin', you've got a lover  
Dreamin', I got another  
Dreamin' that there's a killer in your eyes  
Dreamin', that you're a user  
Dreamin', that I'm a loser  
Dreamin' that there's a killer in my eyes  
Bad dreams for me  
Bad dreams by the sea  
Dreamin' about a place of shades  
Dreamin' about the ace of spades  
Dreamin' that it's takin' things too far  
N-no, n-no, it can't be you  
N-no, n-no, it isn't true  
N-no, n-no, it's not the way you are  
Bad dreams for me  
Bad dreams by the sea
