[Chorus]  
Heaven move me, move my soul  
Here comes the beat  
Here comes the beat patrol  
We will dance  
  
I will help you if I can  
I can change the way you feel today  
When your world turns upside down  
It's time to make the break and dance into another day  
  
And as the music starts to move you  
Then it's time to go  
Into the streets you dance  
And then you lose control  
  
Heaven move me, move my soul  
Here comes the beat  
Here comes the beat patrol  
We will dance, we will dance  
Heaven move me, move my soul  
Here comes the beat  
Here comes the beat patrol  
We will dance, we will dance  
  
This is the age when you must win  
'Cause there is no gold upon the streets today  
You must find it from within  
Music brings the dream machine your way  
  
And as the feeling starts to move you  
Then it's time to go  
Into the streets you dance  
And then you lose control  
  
Heaven move me, move my soul  
Here comes the beat  
Here comes the beat patrol  
We will dance, we will dance  
Heaven move me, move my soul  
Here comes the beat  
Here comes the beat patrol  
We will dance, we will dance  
  
A say yeah, a say yeah, yeah, yeah  
What you say here come the what  
Here come the beat, here come the beat patrol  
Here come the beat we will dance  
  
Heaven move me, move my soul  
Here comes the beat  
Here comes the beat patrol  
We will dance, we will dance  
  
Heaven move me I see it coming it won't be long now  
Here come the beat, here come the beat patrol  
We will dance, we will dance  
(Heaven move me move my soul  
Here comes the beat, here comes the beat patrol)
