When you're out there lying in the sun  
He's the one who keeps his clothing on  
You'd never know him on a train or a bus  
'cos he looks just like the rest of us  
In the middle of the night it's a different story  
Don't let him catch you all alone  
  
The real ripper  
... ... your pay packet (? )  
The real ripper  
Wearing a dinner jacket  
Ask anyone you meet and they'll say the same  
Noone is quite sure of his name  
  
Keep your hand on your heart but he's gonna get you  
He's gonna make you toe the line

And he invented high rise  
On the council they're respectable and ... (? )  
A bounce around the clock and turn away (? )  
Ask anyone you meet and they'll say the same  
Noone is quite sure of his name  
  
The real ripper  
He went to school today  
The real ripper  
Took all the books away  
Keep your hand on your heart but he's gonna get you  
He's gonna make you toe the line
