He's afraid he'll suffer his fathers fate  
Two sets of silver records and plates  
Two bloody hands and bleeding hearts  
Don't feel it's not to late to start  
  
Only the photographs on your wall  
Are chained and down your hall  
Reminding you of all the days  
When you collected hell to pay  
Well hell to pay  
I said it's not too late  
Not it's not too late  
incessant mace  
Oh God I can see it, you know it's incessant mace  
  
Leisure slacks and broken backs  
Are what you get for piling stacks  
Beneath your treasure chest  
You wonder why you're under stress
