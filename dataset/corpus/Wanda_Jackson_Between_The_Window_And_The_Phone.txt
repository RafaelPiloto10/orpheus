Today is a far cry from yesterday for yesterday the love was mine I need today  
I've walked on many miles since you've been gone  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window and the phone you'll find me waiting here all
alone  
I've thought about leaving but I'd go right on grieving  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
If the phone should ring I wonder what I'd say  
Would I tell you that I love you in the same sweet way  
If you look through the window I'll be home  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window...
