Gonna get back to basics  
Guess I'll start it up again  
I'm fallin' from the ceiling  
You're falling from the sky now and then  
  
Maybe you were shot down in pieces  
Maybe I slipped in between  
But we were gonna be the wildest people they ever hoped to see  
Just you and me  
  
So why'd you come home to this sleepless town  
It's a lifetime commitment  
Recovering the satellites  
All anybody really wants to know is...  
When you gonna come down  
  
Your mother recognizes all you're desperate displays  
And she watches as her babies drift violently away  
'Til they see themselves in telescopes  
Do you see yourself in me?  
We're such crazy babies, little monkey  
We're so fucked up, you and me  
  
So why'd you come home to this faithless town  
Where we make a lifetime commitment  
To recovering the satellites  
And all anybody really wants to know is...  
When are you gonna come down  
  
She sees shooting stars and comet tails  
She's got heaven in her eyes  
She says I don't need to be an angel  
But I'm nothing if I'm not this high  
  
But we only stay in orbit  
For a moment of time  
And then you're everybody's satellite  
I wish that you were mine  
  
So why'd you come home to this angel town  
It's a lifetime decision  
Recovering the satellites  
Everybody really knows for sure...  
That you're gonna come down  
That you're gonna come down
