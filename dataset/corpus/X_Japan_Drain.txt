Talk to my troubled brain  
If you can feel my pain  
So much hurting that's living in my head  
Now I can barely breathe  
And now my heart's disease  
And my name and my life has been stepped  
On and on' No no!  
You made fool out of me  
There is no way out  
I'm going down the drain  
The name of God in vain  
You pushed me I'm insane  
Dissolution is knocking on my door  
Can't stop my bitter tears  
Oh take away my fears  
Body and soul is blown up into pieces  
Oh Cry out I want to be free  
Dry out I want to know truth  
Let me drain my feelings out  
Lough like a drain My emotions scream  
Let me drain!  
So I can't speak my mind  
Anata sae mo blind  
I am left in a land with just solitude  
Has this become my fate  
Who's next be your bate  
Vicious cycle repeating on and on  
Cry out I want be loved  
Dry out I want see dreams  
Oh Cry out I want to be free  
Dry out I want to know truth  
Let me drain my feelings out  
Lough like a drain My emotions scream  
Let me drain my feelings out  
Lough like a drain My emotions scream  
Let me drain!
