Baby, I know it's a jungle out there  
Well if you can play it cool, I can play it debonair  
You were warm, but there was an inner ice  
And baby, it was like a rollin' dice  
Well I told you once, I told you twice  
Hey listen babe, there's trouble in paradise  
Well I found a lipstick stain of your kiss  
Well you can sink your teeth into this, bitch, so  
  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
  
Hey baby, can you pass this quiz  
Well, just put your money where your mouth is  
You're as sharp as a slap from a lover's hand  
Hey baby, baby, baby, this is all I can stand  
You played your hand, and now you lose, well listen bitch, I've got news  
Yes, I saw you with another man and you put me in disgrace, so  
  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
  
Dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
No cheap perfume can change my mind, no satin and lace  
Yes, I'm gonna dance all over your face  
No thigh high boots, forbidden fruits, no satin and lace  
Yes, I'm gonna dance, dance all over your face, I'm gonna dance
