Stranded at the drive-in  
Branded a fool  
What will they say Monday at school?  
  
Sandy can't you see I'm in misery  
We made a start now were apart  
There's nothing left for me  
Love has flown all alone  
I sit and wonder why-yi-yi-yi  
Why, you left me oh Sandy  
  
Oh Sandy baby someday when high-yi school is done  
Somehow, someway, our two worlds will be one  
In heaven, forever and ever we will be  
Oh please say you'll stay oh Sandy  
  
Sandy my darling you hurt me real bad  
You know it's true but baby you gotta believe me  
When I say I'm helpless without you  
Love has flown all alone  
I sit, I wonder why-yi-yi-yi  
Why, you left me oh Sandy  
  
Sandy, Sandy, why-yi-yi-yi-yi  
Oh Sandy
