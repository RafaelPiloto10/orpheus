I stayed up crying all night (all night)  
I knew the end was in sight (in sight)  
And now you're walking out on me (on me)  
You're wondering where the little tears can be (can be)  
Well, baby  
  
I'm all cried out, I'm all cried out  
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah  
Now, that you say we're through  
I'm all cried out over you  
  
Last night I knew we were through (we're through)  
It hurt 'cause I still loved you (loved you)  
Went home and couldn't fall asleep (asleep)  
Cause sleep just won't come into eyes that weep (that weep)  
And that's why  
  
I'm all cried out, I'm all cried out  
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah  
Now that you say we're through  
I'm all cried out over you, oh yeah  
  
I'm all cried out  
I just can't cry no more, no, no  
No, no, no, no, oh  
All cried out  
And that's why  
  
I'm all cried out, yes I'm all cried out  
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah  
Now that you say we're through  
I'm all cried out over you  
  
Listen to me when I'm a-going to say  
I'm all cried out, yeah, over you  
Listen to me when I'm a-telling you  
I'm all cried out, yeah, over you  
Over you
