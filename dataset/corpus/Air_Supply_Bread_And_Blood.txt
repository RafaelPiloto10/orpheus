I'm not afraid of losing you or saying good-bye  
If someone needs you more than me, I will understand why  
I'd never stand between someone who's holding your heart  
But I can't let a superstition tear us apart  
Who has the right to speak fire from above  
If heaven is away from you, that is the place I will give up  
For falling in love can't be taking these lips from the cup  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I'm not afraid to face the truth of what I believe  
If love was never meant to choose, it could never succeed  
And we may always stand alone in everyone's sight  
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  
Who puts a price on eternity's sin  
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again  
For you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I won't see you cry, should it make you cry  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood
