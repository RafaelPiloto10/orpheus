Everytime I wake up,  
Somewhere far away  
Drowning over minutes that were yesterday  
I wonder what you're doing  
Do you feel this way  
Are you thinking of me too?  
Looking in the mirror all I wanna see  
Is your pretty face smiling back at me  
There's nowhere in the world that  
I would rather be  
Than to be back home with you  
I'm on my way  
I promise you that I won't be long  
I just called  
Called you to say  
I miss every little little moment  
Without you  
And I can't wait  
For us to be alone.  
I'm almost in your arms.  
I'm coming home.  
And back when I'm alone  
I really miss your touch  
I hold on to your picture  
And it means so much  
To know that there is someone  
Out there just for me  
And  
You feel the same way too?  
Everywhere I go I'd wish  
That You were there  
Everything I know I'd wish  
That we could share  
Everywhere I go  
Makes me miss you so,  
I'm on my way,  
I promise you that I won't be long  
I just called, called you to say  
I Miss every little moment without you  
And I can't wait  
For us to be alone  
I'm Almost in your arms I'm Coming home.  
I can touch you  
Everytime I close my eyes  
Baby you can feel it,  
If you just believe I'm Coming  
Oooh I'm coming home  
And I can't wait  
For us to be alone.  
I'm almost in your arms.  
I'm coming home.  
I'm coming home (mmmm).  
Uh, I'm coming home
