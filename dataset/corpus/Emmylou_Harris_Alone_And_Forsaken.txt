We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold  
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold  
Our love was in flower as summer grew on  
He love like the leaves now has withered and gone.  
The roses have faded, there's frost at my door  
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore  
The grass in the valley is starting to die  
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry.  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand  
Oh, please understand.  
Oh, where has he gone to, oh, where can he be  
He may have forsaken some other like me  
He promised to honor, to love and obey  
Each vow was a plaything that he threw away.  
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray  
A hound in the distance is starting to "BAY"  
I wonder, I wonder what he's thinking of  
Forsaken, forgotten without any love.  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand  
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man  
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand  
Oh, please understand.
