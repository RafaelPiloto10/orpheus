I don't love you anymore  
We've all heard those words before  
Somebody takes your heart and then  
Leaves you the pieces  
  
Lying shattered on the floor  
They say that when you close a door  
Another one is waiting there  
For you to open, if you believe!  
  
[Chorus]  
Love will come back  
Hit you when you least expect it  
Fill in the cracks  
Of a broken heart you thought  
That you could never mend  
You, you can start again!  
  
When you're barely getting by  
And it's hard to find the strength to try  
And loneliness is all you've known  
If you let go, then you will find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, when you think you've lost the only way  
All you really need  
Is a little faith  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just let love return to you  
You can start again!
