At the end of it all  
We will be sold for parts  
We will try to rebuild  
But we ate it all away  
All ambitions now run dry  
Someone stop this thing, turn it off  
In search of new life  
Nothing will be left to walk this earth again  
Turn it off  
  
Our hopes and dreams  
Will be swallowed  
We always said it wouldn't end up like this  
We will be the new ice age  
We will be the new plague  
Disguised as a colony  
We will wipe them all away  
Feast your eyes  
Or just rip 'em out  
This is it for us  
It's time to panic  
We always said it wouldn't end  
It wouldn't end up like this  
We are the cancer  
We are the virus  
Tell me it's not too late
