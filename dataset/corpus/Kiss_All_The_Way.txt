One, two, three, four  
You've got a lot to say  
Every night and every sunny day  
It's the same thing you've been sayin' to me  
Every day  
You say it's within your heart  
You keep repeatin' that we'll never part  
I'm so finally glad to hear you stop  
For a day  
You just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
And (you wear it?) you're worried 'cause it fits you well  
Baby, baby, you're not hard to sell  
I'll tell you what you want to hear  
For a day  
So if you think you need advice  
Just come to me, don't compromise  
Baby, baby you're hypnotized  
Every day  
And you just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
Yes, you just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
Yes, you just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
You just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way  
You just keep talkin' louder  
Complain to your mother and father  
One of these days you'll push me all the way
