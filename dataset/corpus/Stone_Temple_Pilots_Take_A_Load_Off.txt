Summer med fly ruled the airways  
Mostly superstitious  
Now the kings of media  
Invent the swine flu visions  
  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
Take a load off  
  
Yeah, it's alright  
As we mosey on into the night  
Yeah, just set us free  
Could our shattered past just set us free?  
  
Give you all those diamonds  
Give you more and more  
Shattered all those lies I bought  
You from the record store  
  
Fleets of undergrounding artists  
Look for benediction  
Drive around waste gas and haul  
In every green addition
