Well if you've been a married woman  
And things didn't seem to work out  
Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free  
So you're gonna be talked about  
  
Everybody knows that you've loved once  
They think you'll love again  
You can't have a male friend  
When you're a has been of a woman you're rated X  
  
And if you're rated X  
You're some kind of goal  
Every man might try to make  
But I think it's wrong  
To judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake  
  
And when your best friend's husband says to you  
You've sure started lookin' good  
You should've known he would  
And he would if he could and he will if you're rated X  
  
Well nobody knows where you're goin'  
But they sure know where you've been  
All their thinkin' of is your experience of love  
Their minds eat up with sin  
  
The women all look at you like you're bad  
And the men all hope you are  
But if you go too far you're gonna wear the scar  
Of a woman rated X  
And if you're rated X  
You're some kind of goal  
Every man might try to make  
But I think it's wrong  
To judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake  
  
And when your best friend's husband says to you  
You've sure started lookin' good  
You should've known he would  
And he would if he could and he will if you're rated X
