Why are there so many  
Songs about rainbows?  
And what's on the other side  
Rainbows have visions  
And only illusions  
Rainbows have nothing to hide  
So we've been told  
And some choose to believe it  
I know they're wrong wait and see  
Someday we'll find it  
The rainbow connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me  
  
Who says that ev'ry wish  
Would be heard and answered  
When wished on a morning star  
Somebody thought of that  
And someone believed it  
Look what it's done so far  
What's so amazing  
That keeps us star-gazing?  
And what do you think we might see  
Someday we'll find it  
The rainbow connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me  
  
All of us under its spell  
We know that it's probably magic  
  
Have you been half asleep  
And have you heard voices  
I've heard them calling my name  
Is this the sweet sound  
That calls the young sailors  
The voice might be one and the same  
I've heard it too many times to ignore it  
It's something that I'm supposed to be  
Someday we'll find it  
The rainbow connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la
