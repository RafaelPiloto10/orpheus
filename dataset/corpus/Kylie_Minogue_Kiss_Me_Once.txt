We'll win a war  
We'll be ?  
Do you feel me  
  
There's a look in your eyes  
Something is up tonight  
I can feel it  
  
The air is thin  
We're scent of it  
And the dam won't break  
One tear falls, tension cracks the walls  
Then relief comes  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
We've got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all  
  
Look, we're still up  
Like twosome should do  
Do you feel me  
Come out for air  
It's dark in there  
Do you love me  
  
Am I broke up  
It's to my rocks  
Tell the face babe  
One tear falls falls, tension cracks the walls  
Then relief comes  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
We've got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
We've got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all
