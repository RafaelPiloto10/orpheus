Be not afraid at all, be not afraid to know  
And ride the wings of change, to a better time  
Come take the hand of hope, and learn the ways of man  
For you're the path that leads to the other side  
The skin upon our faces has melt the ice of ages  
Now our destiny is yours  
  
[Chorus]  
Children lift up your eyes to the heavens  
Send your vision out beyond  
Children take up the torch and we will follow  
You're the light of the world  
  
Hear echoes in the dark from voices of the heart  
You teach the song of life we take for granted  
We've given you the key, so you'll unlock the door  
We're looking through your eyes to another day  
You bring a change of season, something to believe in  
Now our destiny is yours  
  
Children lift up your eyes to the heavens  
Send your vision out beyond  
Children take up the torch and we will follow  
Bring some light into this world  
  
Be not afraid at all, be not afraid to show  
Your voices will be heard, wish I learned  
We shelter from the storm, we can't make it on our own  
So lift our spirit to the other side  
  
Children lead us away from the sorrow  
You're the arrows from the bow  
Another kingdom awaits your arrival  
Giving freedom to the soul  
  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
Let the children follow, let the children see  
All the children walk to the other side  
Let the children follow, let the children see
