Do you think she's swimming in your lies?  
Do you think it's all just murky green?  
Don't you think that she would realize?  
Yeah do you think she has never seen?  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low  
When the waves retire to the darkness below  
I know I know Ruby sees all.  
I know I know Ruby sees.  
I can feel the pressure building high.  
You should see you're headed for a storm.  
Don't you see it building in the sky?  
Don't you think it's time to swim to shore?  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low,  
When the waves retire to the darkness below,  
I know, I know Ruby sees all.  
I know, I know Ruby sees all.  
I know, I know Ruby sees.
