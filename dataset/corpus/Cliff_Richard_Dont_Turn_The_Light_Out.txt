On my way home I met an  
Old friend of mine  
We walked and we talked an' shared  
A bottle of wine  
  
We started to dance and my  
Intentions were good  
How could I know I'd be misunderstood  
I promised to call before the weekend  
  
Was through  
We'd all get together sho she could  
Meet you  
I was just being friendly, I met her  
  
By chance  
You gotta believe me - it's not a romance  
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see  
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me  
  
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright  
Don't turn the light out.....don't turn the light out  
You gotta see it from my point  
Of view  
  
The same situation could  
Happen to you  
I said it was over before she left  
Town  
  
I can't believe that you're putting me down  
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see  
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me  
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright  
Don't turn the light out.....don't turn the light out  
  
It would be easy if you'd lighten up  
Do it to please me, enough is enough  
All that we've been through, how can you doubt  
The ups an' the downs are what loving's about  
So don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see  
  
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me  
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright  
Don't turn the light out.....don't turn the light out
