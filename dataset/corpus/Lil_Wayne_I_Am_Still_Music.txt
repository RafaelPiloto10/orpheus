Everybody wanna be fly til you swat 'em  
But who am I to talk? I aint shittin' roses  
We in in the same picture but we all got different poses  
I'm looking in my rearview, I see the World in it  
I try to slow down, but I get rear ended  
PAUSE! Like a red light, I'm dead right!  
Highway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?  
They say you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it  
Well call me clueless cause I do this  
  
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star  
Life is a course and I'mma shoot for Par  
I'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow  
And I put that shit right back like I'll see when I find tomorrow  
Young Money CMR, Blood like a scar  
Weezy F baby and I do it all for y'all
