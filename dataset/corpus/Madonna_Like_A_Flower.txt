There's a hole in my heart  
No one else can fill it  
There's a feeling I have  
No one can replace  
There's a taste in my mouth  
No one else can give me  
There's a song that I hear  
No one can erase  
Why would I want them to  
I'm still looking back at you  
Why would I want them to be you  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
There's a strange melody  
Sends me straight to heaven  
There's a voice in my head  
No one else can hear  
There's a prayer that I say  
Always brings me closer  
To the presence of you  
To always have you near  
No one can take your place  
I'm still looking at your face  
No one can take the place of you  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
Like a flower you grow  
Why would I want them to  
I'm still looking back at you  
Why would I want them to be you  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
Like a flower you grow
