Capo: 3rd fret key: f play: d  
The [d] snow falls [g] 'round my [d] window  
But [g] it can't chill my [d] heart  
God [g] knows it died the [d] day you left  
My dream world [a7] fell a-[d] part.  
  
Chorus  
Weary [d] blu-ue-ue [g] ues from [d] waitin'  
Lord, I've been [e7] waitin' too [a7] long  
These [d] blues have [g] got me [d] cryin'  
Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, [a7] please come [d] home.  
  
Thru tears I watch young lovers  
As they go strollin' by  
Oh, all the things that might have been  
God forgive me if I cry.  
  
Chorus
