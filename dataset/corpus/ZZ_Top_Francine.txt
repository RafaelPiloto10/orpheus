Got a girl, her name's Francine  
Finest thing you ever seen  
And I love her, she's all that I want  
And I need her, she's all that I need  
  
Well, Francine, oh Francis, why  
Do you love me and make me cry?  
How I love her, she's all that I want  
How I need her, she's all that I need  
  
If I ever caught her with Stevie P  
I'd throw her back in the Penitentiary, now  
And if I caught her with my mother's son  
I'll call her daddy and get my gun  
  
My Francine just turned thirteen  
She's my angelic teenage queen  
And I love her, she's all that I want  
And I need her, she's all that I need  
And I love her, she's all that I want  
And I need her, she's all that I need  
And I love her, she's all that I want  
And I need her, she's all that I need
