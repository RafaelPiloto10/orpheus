Oh, say can you see  
By the dawns early light  
What so proudly we hailed  
At the twilights last gleaming?  
Who's broad striped and bright stars  
Through the perilous fight  
O'er the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rocket's red glare!  
The bombs bursting in air!  
Gave proof through the night  
That our flag was still there  
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave  
O'er the land of the free  
And the home of the brave?
