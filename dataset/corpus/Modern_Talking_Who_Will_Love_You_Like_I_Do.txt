Oh no matter where you are, you'll be my lucky star  
Oh every night, everyday, babe what can I say, oh  
I love the way you smile, I hate to waft a while  
Oh every night, everyday, tell me there's a way  
And I swear to you, baby I swear to you  
Oh hey you, oh baby  
Hey you, drive me crazy  
  
Who will love you like I do  
Who will make your dreams come true  
Keep shining, keep smiling, baby  
Who will love you everyday and night  
Who will kiss you in the morning light  
Keep shining, keep smiling, baby  
  
Oh no matter what I do, oh I do it just for you  
Oh every night, everyday, baby if you stay, oh  
Maybe I'm wrong tonight, but maybe I'm so right  
Oh every night, everyday, come hear me pray  
Oh I swear to you, baby I swear to you  
Hey you, oh baby  
Hey you, drive me crazy
