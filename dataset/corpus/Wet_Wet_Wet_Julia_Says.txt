And here I go again, through the back streets of my mind,  
It seems my life was standing still,  
Who's sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how I didn't notice  
  
Here we go again, fighting things we never win,  
It seems our love was standing still  
Oh I'm sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how (funny how)  
I don't feel the love,  
I just hear the words,  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know what it's all about  
She doesn't seem to care at all,  
Open your eyes and see  
Love hurts  
  
I won't be fooled again,  
Looking for the dream I couldn't find  
The dream for me was left behind  
Woh I'm sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how (funny how)  
I don't feel the love  
I just hear the words  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know what it's all about,  
She doesn't seem to care at all,  
Open your eyes and see, love hurts,  
Julia please, open your eyes and see  
  
Julia wants to be on her own,  
Sharing her thoughts, she is all alone,  
Dreaming of the things she wants to be,  
Where Julia don't belong  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know, what it's all about  
She doesn't know,  
Julia please open your eyes see  
C'mon Julie open your eyes and see  
She don't know what it's all about  
Julia please, Julia please  
Julia, you don't care at all  
Cause I want you  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Julie, Julie, Julie
