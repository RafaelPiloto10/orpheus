He's got a road map of Jupiter  
A radar fix on the stars  
All along the highway  
She's got a liquid-crystal compass  
A picture book of the rivers  
Under the Sahara  
  
They travel in the time of the prophets  
On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun  
Like lovers and heroes, and the restless part of everyone  
We're only at home when we're on the run  
On the run  
  
He's got a star map of Hollywood  
A list of cheap motels  
All along the freeway  
She's got a sister out in Vegas  
The promise of a decent job  
Far away from her hometown  
  
They travel on the road to redemption  
A highway out of yesterday, that tomorrow will bring  
Like lovers and heroes, birds in the last days of spring  
We're only at home when we're on the wing  
On the wing  
  
When we are young  
Wandering the face of the earth  
Wondering what our dreams might be worth  
Learning that we're only immortal  
For a limited time  
  
Time is a gypsy caravan  
Steals away in the night  
To leave you stranded in dreamland  
Distance is a long-range filter  
Memory a flickering light  
Left behind in the heartland  
  
We travel in the dark of the new moon  
A starry highway traced on the map of the sky  
Like lovers and heroes, lonely as the eagle's cry  
We're only at home when we're on the fly  
On the fly  
  
We travel on the road to adventure  
On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun  
Like lovers and heroes, and the restless part of everyone  
We're only at home when we're on the run  
On the run
