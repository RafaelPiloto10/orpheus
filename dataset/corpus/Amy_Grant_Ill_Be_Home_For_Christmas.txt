I'm dreaming tonight of a place i love  
Even more than i usually do  
And although i know  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams
