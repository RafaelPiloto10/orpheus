Love is colder than death, they say  
To warm your heart to the bone  
Hold me closer, don't dare to speak  
For soon my love, I'll be gone  
  
Cherish the moment with me  
Love for all  
Love for all  
All eternity  
  
Go and dance with the moon tonight  
The starlight to serenade you  
  
Venus, the goddess of love  
Loved for all  
Loved for all  
All eternity  
  
Loved for all  
Loved for all  
For all eternity
