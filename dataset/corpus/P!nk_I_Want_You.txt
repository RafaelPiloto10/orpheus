I have a horrable dream  
That you were never here with me  
'Cause I'm so alone that's why  
And I'll never tell a lie  
  
Chorus:  
  
You know I want you baby  
There's nothing I can do  
Without you, the world will  
Never know who I am  
I'm not the one to want you  
I am the girl.. I am the girl  
I want you  
  
I am the person who is always treating  
You this way.. I am the girl who is happy all  
The way and I'm not gonna be with you not  
Anymore baby, I'm so disappointed in you  
Oh, I am never gonna see you again  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Oh, I never know,  
If you are my baby  
Yes, I will never know  
If you are never my baby (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
(Fade Chorus)
