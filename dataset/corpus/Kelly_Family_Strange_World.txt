Flowers and lights are taking my feet of the ground  
And I'm flying speeds completely unknown to man  
No one can help me once I'm off to dreaming time  
I've entered that world and I'm on my own  
And I feel it all right  
chorus:  
It's a strange, strange world  
That I live in  
It's a strange, strange world  
At night  
Mama Mary, what you got cooking for me this time  
I swear I saw the devil running across the room last night  
Doctors an dioxine ain't gonna medicate me, no  
Darling in your arms I'll be fine with a cup of tea  
chorus  
Well I, I'm a parnanoia schizophrenic being  
What about the monkey talking nonsense on tv  
chorus
