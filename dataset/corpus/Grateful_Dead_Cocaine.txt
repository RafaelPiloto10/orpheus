Take a snip of this then play a little riff, don't be afraid to try  
Don't need no airplane to get off the ground there's more than one way to fly  
Have a little taste, Baby, don't hesitate, every hit don't have to be a song  
Gonna take you to the cosmos, Baby, and boogie with you all night long  
Riding out on a rail, feels so fine  
Talking 'bout that cocaine express, mainline, got a good head of steam  
Never lived down on the Bayou, but I been busted in New Orleans, New Orleans  
I can roll all night with you, Baby got a land? I'm just in from Marin  
Can't get it off, but I can get it on and we'll be truckin' 'till the break of
day  
Here comes the doo-dah dealer on his Hog three wheeler, 250 pounds of sin  
He's made your car the main attraction. You wanna beef up his action  
But he will cut you, before he would cut you in, the only place to win  
Riding out on a rail, feels so fine  
Talking 'bout that cocaine express, mainline, taking a midnight cruise  
Never lived up in the Northlands, but I been snowblind out in Sandford Dew  
Snowblind in Sanford Dew, that's enough for you, snowblind
