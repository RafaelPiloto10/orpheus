It's a nine mile walk from the office to the pumps  
Sometimes you think you're gonna drop  
In the end you're filthy dirty, horny, and pissed off  
And before you can leave you gotta sweep the fuckin' shop  
  
It's a real real bitch to be workin' for the man  
But shit, I do it well, so what the fuck  
I could probably wash dishes at some other fuckin' dump  
But it's all the same to me, bustin' ass to make a buck  
  
So read 'em up and stick 'em  
Pump that fucker good  
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump  
Get your fingers outta your ass  
And pump some fagot's gas  
And think about how bad New Hope sucks  
  
And it's a piss poor life when the ladies fire you up  
And then you check their oil and know you're fucked  
'Cause no one wants a loser who works for 5 an hour  
Smells like gas, looks like shit, works in the rain and rude as hell  
  
Now I can fix a tire like Hurricane Melinda  
I know that I'm the best for what it's worth  
So if I choose to help you don't look like you expect it  
'Cause it's a gift that God gave me at birth  
  
So read 'em up and stick 'em  
Pump that fucker good  
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump  
Get your fingers outta your ass  
And pump some fagot's gas  
And think about how bad New Hope sucks, woo hoo!
