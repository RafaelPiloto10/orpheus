Tears of the feeble  
Hands of the Slaves  
Skin of the mothers  
Mouths of the babes  
Building the towers  
Belongs to the sky  
When the whole thing  
Comes crashing down  
Don't ask me why  
  
Under the shelf  
The shelf of the sky  
Two eyes, two suns  
Too heavenly blinds  
Swallowing rivers  
Belongs to the sea  
When the whole thing washes away  
Don't run to me  
  
I'll be going down  
For the rest of the slide  
While the rest of you  
Harvest the gold  
  
And the wreck of you  
Is the death of you all  
And the wreck of you  
Is the break  
And the fall  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the death of you all  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the break and the fall  
  
Under the red  
Break of the lights  
Heroes in the stretches  
Inch to the site  
Blowing the pieces  
Belong to the wind  
When the whole thing  
Blows away  
I won't pretend  
  
I'll be going down  
For the rest of the slide  
While the rest of you  
Harvest the souls  
  
And the wreck of you  
Is the death of you all  
And the wreck of you  
Is the break  
And the fall  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the death of you all  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the break and the fall  
  
Behind the blood red break of the lights  
Lies the wreck of you for the rest  
Of your life  
  
And the wreck of you  
Is the death of you all  
And the wreck of you  
Is the break  
And the fall  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the death of you all  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the break and the fall
