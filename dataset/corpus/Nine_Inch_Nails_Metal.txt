We're in the building where they make us grow  
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers  
Like you  
  
My Mallory heart is sure to fail  
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real  
Like you  
  
The sound of metal I want to be you  
I should learn to be a man  
Like you  
  
Plug me in and turn me on  
Oh everything is moving  
  
I need my treatment it's tomorrow they send me  
Singing "I am an American"  
Do you?  
  
Picture this if I should make the change  
I'd like to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you?  
  
And who are you and how can I try  
Here inside I like the metal  
Don't you?  
  
All I know is no one dies  
I'm still confusing love with need
