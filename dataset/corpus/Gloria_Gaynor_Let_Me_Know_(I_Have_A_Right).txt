I get a little peck and you're off to bed  
No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead, oh  
Just love me and mean it, I'll follow you blind  
Lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just can't stand still till you make up your mind  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
I'll take it, I'll make it  
Ooh, yes, I will  
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Listen, listen  
I'm livin' each minute with all that I've got  
Each breath is important, each heartbeat is hot  
That's the way we were way back, you forgot [He forgot, he forgot],  
ooh  
You leave me so empty, it's makin' me sad  
To know that a good thing has turned for the bad  
Both of us are here, but where's the love we had  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite  
Let me know, let me know  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite
