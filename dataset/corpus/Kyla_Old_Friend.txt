A million times or more I thought about you  
The years, the tears, the laughter, things we used to do  
Are memories that warm me like a sunny day  
You touched my life in such a special way  
  
I miss the way you'd run your fingers through my hair  
Those crazy nights we cuddled in your easy chair  
Oh no, I won't let foolish pride turn you away  
I'll take you back whatever price I pay  
  
Old friend  
It's so nice to feel you hold me again  
No, it doesn't matter where you have been  
My heart welcomes you back home again  
  
Remember those romantic walks we used to take  
You held my hand in such a way my knees would shake  
You can't imagine just how much I've needed you  
I've never loved someone as I love you  
  
Old friend  
It's so nice to feel you hold me again  
No, it doesn't matter where you have been  
My heart welcomes you back  
  
Old friend  
This is where our happy ending begins  
Yes, I'm sure this time that we're gonna win  
Welcome back into my life again  
  
Yes, I've tried to live my life without you  
Knowing I had lost my closest friend  
And though I'm feeling low from time to time  
Knowing I will never find the kind of love I had when you were mine  
  
Old friend  
It's so nice to feel you hold me again  
No, it doesn't matter where you have been  
My heart welcomes you back  
  
Old friend  
This is where our happy ending begins  
Yes, I'm sure this time that we're gonna win  
Welcome back into my life again  
  
Again..
