Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
There's a river running underground  
That roll along the clay  
That took my body when I laid it down  
And carried it far away  
It's too damned dark for you to see  
So I did not protest  
My soul shook free, you can't have me  
But you may keep the rest  
The waters weep, the sickles reap  
My hands are cold with sweat  
The eagle screams with frightened wings  
The dust does not forget  
There's a river running underground  
That rolls along the clay  
That tempts the sould to the ocean cold  
To with the body lay
