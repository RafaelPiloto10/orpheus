Listen, I've got the sickest ambition.  
Deep in the mirror I am scared,  
Don't know who the hell is there.  
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection.  
  
Obsession  
  
The thing it's our new religion.  
Each model and celebrity  
Changes how I look at me.  
Oh, don't tell me, don't tell me  
I'll never be  
  
A superstar 'cause I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Hollywood, Hollywood  
In Hollywood, In Hollywood  
  
Women, let's talk about our condition.  
How beauty's a commodity,  
Women don't get the best things,  
Battered liver though, with poison.  
  
I am the bill.  
In the world without me, this vision.  
Sure Hollywood's commercially amorous  
But naturally, me? Quite ugly as hell.  
Tell me I'm not sixteen!  
  
Like a superstar, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Hollywood, Hollywood  
Hollywood, Hollywood  
  
Within a year I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Like a superstar, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
  
Within the year I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Like superstars, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
In Hollywood, Hollywood  
Hollywood, HollywoodLike a superstar, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
  
Within the year I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
Like superstars, yeah I know I could  
Look like a girl in Hollywood.  
In Hollywood, Hollywood  
Hollywood, Hollywood
