Feeling out, feeling down  
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone  
Then up came-a one that said (hey, Dread)  
"Hey, Dread, dry, Natty Dread, and smile!"  
  
You're in Jamaica: c'mon and smile!  
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, y'all!  
(In Jamaica) Get it together, now!  
In Jamaica, y'all  
  
Soulful down, soulful people  
Said, I see you're having fun,  
Dancin' to the reggae rhythm,  
O island in the sun  
O smile!  
  
(In Jamaica) c'mon and smile!  
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, right now!  
(In Jamaica) Get it together, children!  
(In Jamaica, y'all)  
  
We're gonna help our people, help them right  
O Lord, help us tonight!  
Cast away that evil spell  
Throw some water in the well,  
And smile!  
  
(In Jamaica) c'mon and smile!  
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get things together, right now!  
(In Jamaica) Get it together, right now!  
(In Jamaica, y'all)  
  
Riddim wise (wise),  
Dub-a wise (wise),  
And other wise (wise)  
Can't criticize (wise) our smile.  
  
(In Jamaica) You're gonna smile!  
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, right now!  
(In Jamaica) Get things together, right yow!  
(In Jamaica, y'all)  
  
Help the people, help them right!  
O Lord, help us tonight!  
Cast away evil spell  
Throw some water in the well,  
And smile!  
  
(In Jamaica) You're gonna smile!  
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, children!  
(In Jamaica) Get things together, right yow!  
(In Jamaica, y'all)  
  
Soulful down, soulful people,  
Said, I know - I know that you're having fun!
