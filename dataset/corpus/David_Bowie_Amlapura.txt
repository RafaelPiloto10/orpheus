Hey-hey it's the tall sail  
On a beach reach for java  
Make way for to Java  
Watching for Boogies  
Hey-hey it's a dreaming  
I would burn you if you should die  
Hey-hey I would burn too  
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre  
  
[Chorus]  
I dream of Amlapura  
Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel  
I dream of Amlapura  
Of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone  
  
Hey-hey golden roses around  
A rajah's mouth  
Hey-hey all the dead children buried standing  
A flying Dutchman  
Smoking gun and spice wind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I dream of Amlapura  
Of a princess in stone  
Hey-hey it's a tall ship  
Hey-hey  
Hey-hey  
Amlapura
