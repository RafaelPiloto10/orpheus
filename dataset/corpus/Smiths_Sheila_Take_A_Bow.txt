Is it wrong to want to live on your own?  
No, it's not wrong - but I must know  
How can someone so young  
Sing words so sad?  
  
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow  
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear  
And don't go home tonight  
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you  
The one that you love and who loves you  
Oh...  
  
Is it wrong not to always be glad ?  
No, it's not wrong - but I must add  
How can someone so young  
Sing words so sad ?  
  
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow  
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear  
And don't go home tonight  
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you  
The one that you love and who loves you  
  
Take my hand and off we stride  
Oh, la...  
You're a girl and I'm a boy  
La...  
Take my hand and off we stride  
Oh, la...  
I'm a girl and you're a boy  
La...  
  
Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow  
La...  
Throw your homework onto the fire  
Come out and find the one that you love  
Come out and find the one you love
