Country is sittin' on the back porch listen to the whippoorwills late in the
day  
Country is mindin' your business helpin' a stranger if he comes your way  
Country is livin' in the city knowin' your people knowin' your kind  
Country is what you make it country is all in your mind  
  
Country is workin' for a living thinkin' your own thoughts lovin' your town  
Country is teachin' your children find out what's right and stand your ground  
Country is a havin' the good times listen to the music singing your part  
Country is walkin' in the moonlight country is all in your heart
