Whatever happened  
To the teenage romance  
Is it hidden in a tacky magazine  
Everybody's talking  
Saying trash is neat  
You think it's good fun  
But it's never that free  
Who is the man of the moment  
Does his image stand ten feet tall  
Or is he just a cardboard hero  
Staring down at you from your wall  
  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
  
Friday night  
Out on the town  
It's a special date  
First time around  
You read all about the story book romance  
He stands there waiting  
And you want to hold his hand  
Saturday  
You're broken down  
Your heart is lying somewhere  
Is it lost or found  
  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
If this is love it's not enough  
  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You can dream but not too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
You want a love that costs too much  
You can dream but you can't touch  
If this is love it's not enough  
You can dream of tender touch  
Don't let your heart be lost to love
