Stupid man, hitchhiking out of a good life  
He says: "Catch you when ..."  
And he thinks he's got big, big planes  
Gonna build a house upon some land  
Oh, Casey, don't it make you crazy  
Oh, when you're living all alone by that damp water  
Oh, Casey, don't it make you crazy  
When you're living all alone by those still waters  
Please say hello, please say hello  
To my little baby daughter  
Oh, Casey, tell her that her father's gonna be coming home  
So soon, so soon to see her  
Well, I'm shooting down the turnpike  
With a driver doing ninety-five or maybe more  
Don't you think he's loaded, drunk  
Or the many things that lifes are for  
Oh, Casey, oh, Casey, don't you know  
I'll make you so damn crazy  
Living all alone by those waters  
But please say hello  
But please say hello to my little baby daughter  
Please, please, won't you just give her a great, big kiss  
And tell her daddy, stupid daddy will be coming home soon  
Oh, Casey, oh, Casey don't you know, I make me so damn crazy  
When I was living there, all alone by those still waters  
But please tell, please tell my baby baby baby daughter  
That I'm tied up now,  
But I'll be home soon, I'll be the daddy that I oughta  
Please say hello, oh Casey, please say hello  
From a stupid man  
Still my little baby daughter a big, big, big kiss  
And tell her that her daddy will be coming home soon  
But, Casey, don't you know I make me so damn crazy  
When I was living there all alone  
But won't you please give my,  
Give my baby daughter a great, big, stupid kiss  
And tell her that her stupid father will be coming home soon  
Stupid man
