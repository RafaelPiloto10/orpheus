Gambling on instincts well here's what I found  
Voice from my pocket starts pulling me down  
Tells me my bucks ain't enough  
And life doesn't have to be rough  
  
But a little white cloud  
Tells me what I crave  
And the way I feel  
Means my heart is saved  
And the money goes 'round  
And the babes are babes  
And the way I feel  
Means my heart is saved  
  
Personally I like Midwestern tows  
I like the girls there and even the clowns  
But now I've been out on the wheel  
Out where you're worth what you steal  
And I can't go back to a yesterday  
No I can't turn back 'cause my heart is saved  
And I gotta believe all night and all day  
And when I believe my heart is saved  
  
I'm weird and half-dead  
There's a fortune in my head  
Don't touch me  
My heart is saved
