(Kenny Rogers On Vocals)  
  
I saw you tonight  
In the room where love had started once before.  
And we opened up the skies.  
With your loving eyes  
You take me back where you belong in my heart.  
  
One love frozen in time.  
Never be a bad love.  
Yours and mine.  
But I still remain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you.  
And then being close to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
You are inside of me.  
One more time.  
Don't you remember me.  
And the days that lie ahead  
May all go wrong.  
  
But tonight, my love,  
There's no question in my mind where we should be.  
It's clear that you're alone and I'm alone.  
And all the fools have gone.  
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes.  
  
True love can never die.  
We can make it one day, if we try.  
Be there, sunshine or rain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
I got a memory  
For all time.  
Don't you remember me.  
Now my dream will come true  
If you love me.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.
