Every single night and every single day  
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing  
So don't you worry about me I'll be okay

And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my thing,

Bang bang

Look at me, I'm high up off the ground baby  
Oh shoot, pass that shit around baby  
That shit true, but I don't hear a sound  
I'm a southern belle crazier than hell  
Getting wild up in here  
Getting live up in here  
Burning up up in here  
Turnt up up in here  
We tear the roof up now we up out of here  
  
We do it, we do it  
We don't give a fuck  
Only thing we think about is turning up, turning up  
We do it, we do it  
We do it all the way  
Alive so everybody hands to the sky 'cause  
  
Every single night and every single day  
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing  
So don't you worry about me I'll be okay  
I'mma do my thing, 'cause I'mma do my thing  
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my thing,  
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my  
I'mma do my thing  
I'mma do my thing  
I'mma do my thing  
  
Bang bitch  
You think I'm strange bitch  
It's bananas like a fucking 'rangatang bitch  
Don't worry 'bout me  
I got it all arranged bitch  
Mind your business, stay in your lane bitch  
Oh yeah I'm a southern belle  
I told ya'll once before I get crazier than hell  
Get wild up in here  
Get live up in here  
Turnt up up in here  
Burning up up in here  
  
We do it, we do it  
We don't give a fuck  
Only thing we think about is turning up, turning up  
We do it, we do it  
We do it all the way  
Alive so everybody hands to the sky 'cause  
  
Every single night and every single day  
I'mma do my thing, I'mma do my thing  
So don't you worry about me I'll be okay  
I'mma do my thing, 'cause I'mma do my thing  
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my thing  
And I'mma I'mma I'mma do my
