I know just how much I love you  
But there is no time to explain  
I realize just what I'd give to  
Get you back in my arms  
  
And I see you hand in hand with another man  
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go  
  
So if you're gonna lie  
At least you could just let us die  
And if you're gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just say goodbye  
  
And I'm caught between myself and me  
And I can't find the bridge  
From my mind to reality  
I'm trying to find a place in the sun  
But I'm drowning in the rain  
That's falling every place I run  
  
And I see you hand in hand with another man  
And I don't know what you see in him and why you let us go  
  
So if you're gonna lie  
At least you could just let us die  
And if you're gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just say goodbye  
  
Well I'm not gonna sit around just waiting for you to get overhim  
So oh, no, no, no  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye now  
  
Well if you're gonna lie  
Well at least you could just let us die  
And if you're gonna cry to me baby  
At least you could just said goodbye  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Won't you say goodbye  
Won't you say goodbye now  
Won't you say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye now  
  
Won't you kiss me goodbye  
You've gotta tell me goodbye  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye now
