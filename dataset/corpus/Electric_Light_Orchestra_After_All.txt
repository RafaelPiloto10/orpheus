The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, you had to slip away  
After all that spark  
You, said all that you could say  
And slipped into the dark  
I could not let you go  
Alone into the night  
I had to let you know  
The magic there, in the night air  
  
The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, somewhere out in the dark  
Runs a wounded heart  
You, stumbling in the night  
In the air of after light  
You take along the fears  
Did you waste these years  
And did they warn you  
Of the night zone all alone  
  
Sometimes it takes a fight  
To keep everything on track  
And sometimes it takes a starry night  
To bring the magic back  
This was the time  
And this was the place  
With starlight on your face  
And the moon on the rise  
The night has a thousand eyes
