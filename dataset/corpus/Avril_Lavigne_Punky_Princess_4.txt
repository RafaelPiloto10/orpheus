I saw you at the mall  
Trying on the clothes  
In that little blue stall  
I was watching your feet  
Then a piece of cheese hit the floor  
Ohhh yeah Floor  
Chorus:I'm just a punk princess  
Trying to make it through this life  
Trying to make everything alright  
But all I can picture is the cheese  
Ooh yeah cheese  
Why must you make me hurt so much?  
Why must you eat so much cheese at lunch?  
Why don't you just die, and leave me here like I was  
DIE! DIE!! DIE!!! DIE!!!!!! Die like the Japs at Hiroshima when the atom  
Bomb hit their face and then they died  
(chorus)  
Actually don't die because that's mean,  
And because MTV will break their contract with me  
So don't die  
Pleash?  
Pleash is a word, invented in Spain  
Pleash was invented to symbolize the pain  
The pain that you've put me through  
The pain that I've gained  
But if you die, it will all go away  
All go away  
All go away  
But actually don't die pleash, because I kinda like you a little still  
But not a lot, just a speck  
Like the cheese that's left after I've raided through the fridge  
Why must you remind me of cheese?  
I love cheese but not you  
I only love you a little  
Only a speck  
(chorus)  
(chorus)  
(chorus)
