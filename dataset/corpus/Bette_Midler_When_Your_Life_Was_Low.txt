Always remember my friend  
The world will change again  
And you may have to come back  
Through everywhere you've been  
  
When your life was low  
You had nowhere to go  
People turned their backs on you  
And everybody said that you were through  
  
I took you in, made you strong again  
Put you back together  
Out of all the dreams you left along the way  
You left me shining  
  
Now you're doing well  
From stories I hear tell  
You own the world again  
Everyone's your friend  
  
Although I never hear from you  
Still it's nice to know  
You used to love me so  
When your life was low  
  
I took you in. I made you strong again  
I put you back together  
Out of all the dreams you left along the way  
You left me shining  
  
Now you're doing well  
From stories I hear tell  
You own the world again  
Everyone's your friend  
  
Although I never hear from you  
Still it's nice to know  
You used to love me so  
You used to love me so  
When your life was low  
  
But always remember my friend  
The world will change again  
And you may have to come back  
Through everywhere you've been  
The world will change again
