Somewhere between the lies and truths, borderlines get shady  
Somewhere between the yes's and no's you can find the maybe  
Somewhere between the highs and lows you can spot the middle  
Somewhere betweens the questions and clues you can solve the riddle  
Somewhere along the road you might need a place to stay  
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to pass away  
And somewhere in space you still remind me of a reason  
And summertime you still smell like my favorite season  
And it feels like pain, it's just like pain  
Love is like pain, some people like pain  
Somewhere between the mountain and sea, a river is flowing  
Somewhere between the Earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing  
Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing  
Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing  
Somewhere along the road you might want to hitch a ride  
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride  
Somewhere inside you still remind me of a feeling  
Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing  
And it feels like pain, it's just like pain  
Love is like pain, some people like pain  
Put your nails in my hand, pain  
Fill my eyes up with sand, pain  
Papercuts on my tongue, pain  
We're right now where we begun, pain  
Somehow I only hurt the ones who really mattered  
Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered  
Someday soon I know my ashes will be scattered  
Someday soon I know my former becomes latter  
And it feels like pain, it's just like pain  
Love is like pain, some people like pain
