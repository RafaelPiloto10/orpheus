Out on the wiley, windy moors, we'd roll and fall in green  
You had a temper like my jealousy, too hot, too gready  
How could you leave me, when I needed to possess you  
I hated you, I loved you too  
Bad dreams in the night  
You told me I was going to lose the fight  
Leave behind my  
  
Wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
  
Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely  
On the other side from you  
I pine a lot, I find the lot falls through without you  
I'm coming back love, cruel heathcliff  
My one dream, my only master  
  
Too long I roam in the night  
I'm coming back to his side to put it right  
I'm coming home to  
  
Wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
  
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away  
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away  
You know it's me, cathy  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
So cold
