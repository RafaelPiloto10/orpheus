When you're fed up and lonely  
And nothing else seems to matter really  
  
I'll be here waiting for the  
Black cloud to leave you  
I'll be here to hold your hand  
When you're tired and lonely  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
She can't eat  
She can't sleep  
She's not well (she's lonely again)  
She can't breathe  
She's in bed  
She's in hell  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her  
  
Hold your breath underwater  
And know you'll rise to the surface slowly  
  
Think of me as a ship that might hold you  
Carry you to the shore  
When you're tired and lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But she'll never really be alone  
As long as I'm beside her
