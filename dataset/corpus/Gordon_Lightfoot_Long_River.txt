Where the long river flows  
It flows by my window  
Where the tall timber grows  
It grows 'round my door  
Where the mountains meet the sky  
And the white clouds fly  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
There's a tiny bird that calls  
And he calls by my window  
There's a lonely tear that falls  
And it falls 'round my door  
But when the sun is high  
There's no time to cry  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
Now if only you could see  
The closin' of the day  
If only you could be  
Where the dawn breaks away  
By the white cascade  
Oh down in the glade  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
Well when this land was made  
It was made full of wonder  
But one woman's love  
I can't understand  
And I'd give it all to you  
If her love were true  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
Where the long river flows  
By my window
