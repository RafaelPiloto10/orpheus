Your head spins round on a Monday  
And the daylight's in your eyes  
How you laughed and cursed tomorrow  
Now he's standing by your side  
You touched the stars at midnight  
The whole world seem to shout 'Hello'  
Now your throat is tired and heavy  
And only one can go  
  
I'll be all right though I may cry  
The tears that flow they always dry  
It's just that I would rather be with you now  
And every time I see that star  
I will say a prayer for you  
Now and forever September blue  
  
I'll be all right though I may cry  
The tears that flow they always dry  
It's just that I would rather be with you now  
And every time I see that star  
I will say a prayer for you  
Now and forever September blue  
'cause I'll always love you  
September blue
