Taunting from the hill tops, just out of reach  
Smiling pretty smiles, telling your white lies  
Stringing me along on your sweet promises  
Humi you sure know how to Tantalize  
  
You give yourself to those who don't deserve you  
You go where you are not supposed to be  
I know someday that I am going to have you  
Someday you'll have to give yourself to me  
  
Amandla, Amandla dancin in the distance, sayin I'll be free  
Amandla, Amandla it's time to change your partner  
it's time to dance with me  
Amandla, Amandla you're hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
Amandla, Amandla don't lose all your self-respect  
You know just what I mean  
  
Standin on Commissioner street, in the pouring rain  
Tappin my toe, tappin my toe  
This time I was so sure that you would be here  
But once again you decided not to show  
  
Amandla, Amandla dancin in the distance, sayin I'll be free  
Amandla, Amandla it's time to change your partner  
it's time to dance with me  
Amandla, Amandla you're hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
Amandla, Amandla don't lose all your self-respect  
You know just what I mean  
  
you're running with the fools,  
You know Im more your style  
Driving me crazy with that someday smile  
  
Amandla, Amandla dancin in the distance, sayin I'll be free  
Amandla, Amandla it's time to change your partner  
it's time to dance with me  
Amandla, Amandla you're hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
Amandla, Amandla don't lose all your self-respect  
You know just what I mean  
  
you're hanging with the wrong crowd  
You need a change of scene  
don't you lose your self-respect  
You know just what I mean  
  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla  
Amandla
