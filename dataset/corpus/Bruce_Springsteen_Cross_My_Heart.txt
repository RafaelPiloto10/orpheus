First time I crossed my heart  
I was begging baby please  
At your bedside  
Down on my knees  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart  
I crossed my heart,  
Pretty baby over you  
  
Second time I crossed my heart  
Rain came in from the south  
I was lying there with something sweet and salty in my mouth  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart  
When I crossed my heart, pretty darling over you.  
  
Well you may think the world's black and white  
And you're dirty or you're clean, son  
You better watch out you don't slip  
Through them spaces in between  
  
Well the night gets sticky  
And the sky gets black  
I grabbed you baby, and you grabbed me back  
And we crossed our hearts  
Mmm we crossed our hearts  
Yeah, I crossed my heart  
Mmmhmmmhmmmm  
  
Well little boys little girls  
Hell they don't know wrongs from their rights,  
And once you cross your heart, you ain't ever supposed to lie  
Well life ain't nothing but a cold, hard ride  
I ain't leaving til I'm satisfied.  
I cross my heart  
Yeah I cross my heart  
Well I cross my heart  
Pretty darling over you  
  
Oohoooohoooh
