See these eyes so green  
I can stare for a thousand years  
Colder than the moon  
Well, it's been so long  
And I've been running on fire  
With gasoline  
See these eyes so red  
Red like jungle burning bright  
Those who feel me near  
Pull the blinds and change their minds  
It's been so long  
Still this pulsing night  
A plague I call a heartbeat  
Just be still with me  
But you wouldn't believe what I've been through  
You've been so long, well, it's been so long  
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline  
Putting out the fire with gasoline  
See these tears so blue  
An ageless heart that can never mend  
Tears can never dry  
A judgement made can never bend  
See these eyes so green  
I can stare for a thousand years  
Just be still with me  
You wouldn't believe what I've been through  
Well you've been so long, it's been so long  
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline  
Putting out fire with gasoline  
Putting out fire  
I've been putting out fire  
Well it's been so long, so long, so long  
Yes it's been so long, so long, so long  
I've been putting out fire  
Been so long, so long, so long  
Been so long, so long, so long  
Been so long, so long, so long  
...
