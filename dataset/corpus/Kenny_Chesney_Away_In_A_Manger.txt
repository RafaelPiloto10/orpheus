Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus lays down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lays  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes  
I love thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle 'till morning is nigh  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lays  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
