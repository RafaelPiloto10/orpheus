Now you say you're lonely  
You cried the whole night through  
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me and  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shared a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me and  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
I cried a river over you  
I cried a river over you
