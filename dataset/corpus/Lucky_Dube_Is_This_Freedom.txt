She got outside one morning  
To see what' s going on  
'Cause she heard all the noises  
In the night, It' s a celebration  
Even though she was old and grey  
It didn't mean she was deaf and dumb  
She looks one look at the man  
Throws her hands in the air  
And said God help us all  
Too much power in one mans hands  
Is dangerous  
She has never tasted freedom  
And all the things  
We take for granted  
Then she looked at me and said  
Son, Is this the end of our suffering?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is this freedom?  
Is this freedom?  
  
We have just witnessed the  
Change of power from one fool  
And liar to another  
Our lives on the line again  
She had lived through the wars  
She didn't want to go through it all again  
She has seen injustice  
She has seen corruption  
She has seen racism  
And any other kind of suffering  
You can think about  
Then she said to me  
Son, Is this the end of suffering?  
  
[Chorus till fade]
