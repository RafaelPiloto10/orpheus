Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the words of everyone you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal  
How I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other's arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dream  
Mama, it's over my head  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the words of others you've heard  
Mama, I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart, yes, the words in my heart reveal  
How I feel about  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other's arms may hold a thrill  
Please do nothing till you hear it from me  
Mama, you never will
