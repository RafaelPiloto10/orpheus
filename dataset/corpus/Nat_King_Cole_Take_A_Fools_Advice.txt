(charles singleton)  
  
If you love her  
And she makes one mistake,  
Please don't leave her  
It would make your heart ache.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
If you need her  
But you're letting her go,  
Please don't do it  
You'll be sorry, I know.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
Truly,  
She's caused you to doubt her,  
Truly,  
She's broken the rules.  
But life's not worth living without her,  
So listen to the wisdom of a fool.  
  
Think it over  
And forgive her this time,  
I was foolish  
I lost the love that was mine.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.
