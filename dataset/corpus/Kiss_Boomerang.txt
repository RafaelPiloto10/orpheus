Gonna throw down the dice on a roll, it's a showdown, gonna walk on hot coals  
Cut the deck, better place your bet, 'cause the game ain't over yet  
  
Want to keep you under lock and key, can't you see what you do to me  
Get the noose, I know I'm gonna hang, 'cause you're like a boomerang,
boomerang  
  
On the way up, you change your tune, so pay up, and it ain't too soon  
Can't make up or break up, can't feel a thing, you want a piece of everything  
  
First you're cold and then you're hot, you're in the mood and then you're not  
Yeah, I know I'll get a bang, 'cause you're like a boomerang, boomerang  
  
You can slip and you can slide, but there ain't nothin' you can hide  
You just can't say no, well here I come, baby, and here I go  
  
A boomerang, a boomerang
