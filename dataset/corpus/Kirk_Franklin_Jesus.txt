[Verse 1:]  
Ooh, superstar  
Never drove around in a fancy car  
Kids looked at me funny  
Momma she had no money but she always told me, "baby, know who you are"  
I say ooh, don't you know  
It was hard always wearing my cousin's clothes  
Can you hand me down a dream with those hand-me-down jeans?  
Thought I'd never make, but I made it y'all, 'cause I had...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jesus  
When I had nothing, had to struggle, and was up to no good  
Jesus  
The reason I'm still breathing is 'cause  
Jesus[x3]  
I's crazy how you love me even when I don't love you like I should  
Jesus[x3]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ooh, look at me  
I know I'm now all I'm supposed to be, I'm gonna get it right, didn't get here
overnight, so while you're waiting please wait patiently  
I say ooh, it's so sweet to know that you were always in love  
Thought my game was clever, but no one can play me better than you  
You know you always win cause you're  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Ooh  
When I think about your name I go  
Ooh  
How you took away my pain I go ooh  
Every night at the club  
Ain't no wife at the club  
That Jesus he be showing me love  
They said I wasn't gon' make it kirk  
I know how that sound  
It's only by his grace I can say 'look at me now' if you love this joint right
here  
I want you to call your radio station in the morning  
And I want you to tell'em hey Mr. DJ  
Can you play my favorite song? (will you play my favorite?)  
I heard it say it's gonna get better we gon' make it out the hood someday  
Hey Mr. DJ  
I wanna hear that song about Jesus  
I heard my mama crying, I gotta let her know he's gonna wipe her tears away  
You are listening to the sound of a brotha' who should be dead right now  
But I'm so glad god didn't give up on me!  
Ain't you glad he didn't give up on you?  
What's his name?  
  
[Chorus:]
