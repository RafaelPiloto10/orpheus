Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go  
Let's look at the snow  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
(We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land)  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
(There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray)  
(It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day)  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts  
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie  
  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Whoo, whoo there now  
Steady, easy, whoo, everybody out
