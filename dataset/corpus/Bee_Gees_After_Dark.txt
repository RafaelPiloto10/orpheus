There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind  
Where you are, there is a different feeling  
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin', opens up your eyes  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]  
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low  
I wanna be there, I wanna be there  
We leave immediately  
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low  
I wanna be there, I wanna be there  
We leave immediately, after dark  
  
There is no limit that I would not go if I could lie beside  
Where you are, there is a different world out there  
Love in the jungle can be hard to realize  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind  
Where you are, there is a different feeling  
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin', opens up your eyes  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]
