I still recall the taste of your tears.  
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears  
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.  
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore.  
  
You make this all go away  
You make this all go away  
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself  
You make this all go away  
You make it all go away  
I just want something  
I just want something I can never have  
  
You always were the one to show me how  
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now.  
This thing is slowly taking me apart.  
Grey would be the color if I had a heart.  
  
You make this all go away  
You make this all go away  
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself  
You make this all go away  
You make it all go away  
I just want something  
I just want something I can never have  
  
In this place it seems like such a shame.  
Though it all looks different now,  
I know it's still the same  
Everywhere I look you're all I see.  
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be.
