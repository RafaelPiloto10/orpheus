Fun baby...  
  
Freeze... Rock!  
  
Bass..  
  
Oh white... White(repeat 3x) ooooo..  
  
(chorus 1)  
White lines (vision dreams of passion)  
blowin through my mind (and all the while I think of you)  
Pipe cries (a very strange reaction)  
for us to unwind (the more I see, the more I do)  
something like a phenomenom (baby)  
tellin your body to come along, but white lines, blow away....  
  
Blow... Rock it... Blow..  
  
Ticket to ride, white line highway  
tell all your friends that they can come my way  
pay your toll  
sell your soul  
pound for pound cost more than gold  
the longer you stay, the more you pay  
my white lines go a long way  
either up your nose or through your veins  
with nothing to gain except killin your brain  
  
Freeze... Rock (repeat 4x) ... Go  
  
Get higher baby  
get higher baby  
and don't ever come down... Freebase  
  
Arang-dig-dangity-dang-gitang  
arang-dig-dangity-dang-gitang  
arang-dig-dangity-dang-dang-gity-dang-itang  
  
Pipe cries (pure as the driven snow)  
connected to my mind (and now I'm havin fun baby)  
pipe rides (its getting kind of low)  
cuz it makes you feel so fine (i need some one-on-one baby)  
  
Don't let it blow yor mind away (baby)  
And go to a little hide away  
cuz whitle lines, blow away....  
  
Blow... Rock... Blow...  
  
A million magic crystals  
painted pure and white  
a multi-million dollars  
Almost over night  
twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt  
and if you get hooked baby  
its nobodyelses fault, so don't do it!  
  
Blow... Rock (repeat 4x)  
  
Higher baby  
get higher baby  
get higher baby  
And don't ever come down... Freebase!  
  
Don't you get to high (don't you get to high baby)  
Turns you on (you really turn me on and on)  
told you to come down (my temperature is risin)  
when the thrill is gone (no, I don't want you to go)  
  
A street kid gets arrested  
gonna do some time  
he got out three years from just to commit more crime  
a business man is caught, with 24 kilos  
hes out on bail and out of jail  
And that's the way it goes... Rrrhuh!  
  
Sugar... Cane (repeat 2x)  
  
Ahletes reject it  
governors correct it  
ganstars, thugs and smugglers are throully respected  
the money gets divided  
The women get excited  
now I'm broke and its no joke  
Its hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it  
  
Freeze... Rock (repeat 4x)rrruh.. Go  
  
Get higher baby  
Get higher girl  
get higher baby.. C'mon! Rruh  
  
(repeat chorus 1)  
  
Little jack horner  
sittin in a corner  
with no shoes or clothes  
this aint funny  
but he took his money  
And sniffed it up his nose  
  
(repeat chorus 1)
