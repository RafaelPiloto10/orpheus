Shivers run through the spine  
Of hope as she cries  
the poison tears of her life delight  
In the raven black night  
Holding hands with  
  
Dark light  
Comes shine over all stars tonight  
And blind  
All fears that haunted you  
Your smile  
Dark Light  
  
In oblivious garden  
The bodies of fire  
Writhing to warmth the angel devine  
To learn how to die  
In peace with her heart  
  
Dark light  
Come shine over all stars tonight  
And blind  
All fears that haunted you  
Your smile  
Dark Light
