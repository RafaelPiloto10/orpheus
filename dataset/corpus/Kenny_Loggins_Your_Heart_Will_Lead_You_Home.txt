Sunny days and starry nights  
And lazy afternoons  
You're counting castles in the clouds  
And humming little tunes  
  
But somehow right before your eyes  
The summer fades away  
Everything is different  
And everything has changed  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
Funny how a photograph can take you back in time  
To places and embraces  
That you thought you'd left behind  
  
They're trying to remind you  
That you're not the only one  
That no one is an island  
When all is said and done  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
There'll come a day when you're losing your way  
And you won't know where you belong  
  
They say that "home is where your heart is"  
So follow your heart and know that you can't go wrong  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead where you belong  
I know your heart will lead you home
