Love can be a moment's madness  
Love can be insane  
Love can be a life of sadness and pain  
  
Love can be a summer shower  
Love can be the sun  
Love can be two hearts that flower as one  
  
It can be, fine and free  
But that kind  
Is not so very easy to find  
  
Love can be a dying ember  
Love can be a flame  
Love pledged in September  
May be dead in December  
You may not even remember it came  
  
Love can be a joy forever  
Or an empty name  
Love is almost never ever the same  
  
Love can be an evil-doer  
Love can be a fog  
Love can make you feel like you were a dog  
  
Love can be a snow-capped mountain  
Love can be the truth  
Love can be an endless fountain of youth  
  
It can be ecstasy  
But it's true  
It doesn't always happen to you  
  
Love can be a four-score failure  
Love can bring you fame  
Love fresh as the morning  
May be wild when it's 'borning  
And then without any warning, it's tame  
  
Oh love can be a sweet endeavor  
Or a dirty shame  
Love is almost never ever, the same!
