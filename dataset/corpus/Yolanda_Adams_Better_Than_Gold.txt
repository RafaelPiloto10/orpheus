Sun comes up, moon goes down  
Heaven shine all around  
It feels my heart and moves my soul  
Because loving Him is better than gold  
  
(In His arms)  
Dreams comes true  
(And in His eyes)  
The world is new  
  
(Diamonds beam)  
And yes silver glows  
(It glows)  
(But loving Him is better than gold)  
  
He came when hope was  
(My way, gone)  
I never I could love  
(Knew, so strong)  
  
I've walked some lonely roads before  
(But now I search)  
No more  
  
Cause this feels right, I know it?s real  
(The deeps truth has been revealed)  
(All the joy that a heart can hold)  
Oh yeah, yeah, than gold  
(Loving Him is better)  
  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Than gold  
(Better than gold)  
  
I've walked some lonely roads before  
(But now I search no more)  
(This feels right, it's real)  
I know  
  
(The deeps truth has been revealed)  
(He's all I need and all I know)  
All I know is, than gold  
(Loving Him is better)  
(Loving Him is better)  
Than gold  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh
