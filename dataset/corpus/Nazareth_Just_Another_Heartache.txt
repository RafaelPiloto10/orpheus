Who took the smile out of your face  
Who put the tears and sadness in its place  
Who took the sun out of your sky  
don't turn around or ask for reasons why  
No place to run, nowhere to hide  
Its just another love turned bad  
Some smoke that's gettin in your eyes  
  
Its just another heartache, just another heartache  
Just another hurt to take  
Another bridge for you to cross  
Its nothing but a heartache, nothing but a heartache  
Just another big mistake  
Another game you have lost  
It aint nothing but a heartache  
  
Always wore your heart out on your sleeve  
You said youd always cared and needed to believe  
There comes a time to give, there comes a time to take  
But a sentimental heart will be the first to break  
don't try to run  
don't try to hide  
Its just another love turned bad  
Some smoke that's clouded up your eyes.
