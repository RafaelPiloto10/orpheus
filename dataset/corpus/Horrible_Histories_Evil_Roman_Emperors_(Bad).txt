Lead 1:  
The famous Roman Empire,  
  
Lead 2:  
Was the biggest, meanest neighbourhood.  
Lead 3:  
We four were the baddest emperors,  
  
Lead 4:  
And by Bad we don't mean Good!  
  
Lead 1:  
My name is Caligula  
A rotten, Roman pig-ula  
If you told me a fib-ula  
I'd hack your hands to stumps!  
One time, I killed a priest  
Who'd come to sacrifice a beast  
You'd think it's sad that he's deceased  
We all laughed like chumps!  
  
I'm very hairy, but take note  
If you so much as whisper "Goat!"  
With an iron rod you will be smote  
In a good mood today, so I won't slit your throat!  
  
I'm bad!  
  
Lead 2-4:  
He's bad!  
  
Lead 1:  
A shameless rotten cad!  
Do you still have limbs since meeting me?  
Then I guess you should be glad!  
  
Lead 2:  
Your nastiness was fabulous  
But my name's Elagabalus  
And I was far, far worse  
Just listen to my verse  
I was quite notorious  
For catapaulting venomous  
Snakes at Rome's enormous  
Crowds, oh, how they fled  
If you won a lottery prize  
I'd give you bees, dead dogs and flies  
My house guests got a nice surprise  
A lion in their bed!  
  
You'd think to children, I'd be cuter  
No, I was their biggest executor  
Used their guts to read the future  
Says here I should get a job as a school tutor!  
  
I'm bad!  
  
Lead 1,3,4:  
He's bad!  
  
Lead 2:  
Could argue I was sad!  
Hated through our empire  
From Great Britain to Baghdad!  
  
Lead 3:  
Afraid your claim is bogus  
'Cause my name is Commodus  
And no one else could be  
A worse emperor than me  
There never was a greater  
Pretend gladiator  
If the booing got too loud  
Made the lions fight the crowd  
Just one man was grander  
Julius Alexander  
So I killed him, see  
'Cause I'm the emperor, me  
  
I'm bad!  
  
Lead 1,2,4:  
He's bad!  
  
lead 3:  
My actions truly rad!  
You only got the emperor job  
'Cause you were chosen by your dad!  
  
Lead 4:  
To me, you all score zero  
My name is Emperor Nero  
Evil men you're not  
I'm the worstest of the lot!  
My rule was full of fear-o  
Yes, men from far and near-o  
Called me a fighting hero  
Or I would have them slayed!  
Changed the Olympic season  
So the medals went to me, son  
Burned Christians for no reason  
Just a fun game I played, you know  
  
Poisoned my stepbrother  
Ordered men to kill my mother  
Tried to drown her but she fled  
So I had her stabbed instead  
Wait! There's more!  
With my first wife, dear Octavia  
I showed truly bad behaviour  
Chopped her head off, gave it to  
My girlfriend who I then killed too  
  
I'm bad! So baddy!  
Of badness, I'm the daddy!  
Come on, I want to see  
A more evil bloke than me!  
  
Lead 1,2,3:  
You're bad! Real bad!  
Nothing more to add!  
We all thought that we were awful  
But you were really, truly mad!  
  
Lead 4:  
I'm the baddest emperor the Romans ever had.
