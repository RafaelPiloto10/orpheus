Do you enjoy your sight inside?  
  
Disconnect and let me drift,  
Until my upside down is right side in.  
Society must let the artist go,  
To wander off into the nebula.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wander off into your nebula, see your nectarine of multiplicity  
Cum like orgasmatron on overdrive!  
Wander in off to your nebula,  
Your tangerine of electricity is ripe and on a vine,  
So pick your prize!  
  
In little, black book do I confide.  
  
Upon return, I conjure what was seen.  
I let it pulse and boil within my limbs.  
I lay my pencil to the porous page,  
And let my lunatic indulge itself.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Disconnect and let me drift,  
Until my upside down is right side in.  
Society must let the artist go,  
To wander off into the nebula.  
  
[Chorus]
