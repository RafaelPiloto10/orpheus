I've been working at my job, slaving like a dog all day  
And I've been thinking about you, girl  
And watching the minutes slip away  
Yeah, and I know there's someone inside me that nobody sees  
And I know in the darkness you're gonna be reaching for me  
I'm a legend tonight  
Gonna make you feel right  
When you reach for the light  
I'm a legend tonight  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight  
  
You know they try to slow me, sometimes I think I'm gonna stop  
But I gotta keep on going, believing in 5 o' clock, yeah  
And on the edge of the darkness we'll be living in another world  
And I know that a part of you's gonna be part of me, girl  
  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight  
Look at me  
  
I don't know what happens when the race is run  
I don't know what tells me if I've lost or won  
But I know that I'll make it through the day alright  
And girl, you're gonna find out  
  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend  
Gonna make you feel right, legend  
When you reach for the light, legend  
I'm a legend tonight, legend
