Yeah  
  
Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi  
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight  
And sometimes the butterflies still get me  
When I'm in the spotlight  
  
And some people seem to think that I've changed  
That I'm different than I was back then  
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way  
That I've really always been  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways  
Just 'cause everybody knows her name  
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame  
I still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around the world  
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl  
  
Woo!  
  
Well, I spent a few weeks in California  
They put my face on the big movie screen  
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from  
That's just me chasing dreams  
  
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways  
Just 'cause everybody knows her name  
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame  
I still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around the world  
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl  
  
Woo!  
  
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways  
Just 'cause everybody knows her name  
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame  
Still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around this world  
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi, girl  
  
Mississippi girl!  
Oh oh  
Mississippi girl!  
Mississippi girl!  
Yeah, yeah, oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Mississippi girl!  
Na,  
Na
