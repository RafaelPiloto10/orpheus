Just when I wake up and baby you call  
You're driving my mind up the side of a wall  
I'm giving you my best now I'm begging you please  
I'm not in the mood to see you on your knees  
Sayin' you won't run on the street again  
Sayin' you will come back runnin' back again  
Saying you won't buy on the street again  
Sayin' you will come runnin' back again  
But you better not call me  
You'd better not cry  
You'd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin' me lies  
No you had better not call  
I used to call her  
Call!  
I used to call her  
Just when I'm knocked out, and baby you call  
I look in your eyes and you're not there at all  
Sayin' you won't run on the street again  
Sayin' you will come back runnin' back again  
Saying you won't buy on the street again  
Sayin' you will come runnin' back again  
But you had better not call me  
You'd better not cry  
You'd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin' me lies  
No you better not call me  
You'd better not cry  
You'd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin' me lies  
No you had better not call  
I used to call her  
Call!  
I used to call her  
Sayin' you won't run on the street again  
Sayin' you will come back runnin' back again  
But you better not call me  
You'd better not cry  
You'd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin' me lies  
But you better not call me  
You'd better not cry  
You'd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin' me lies  
No you had better not call  
I used to call her  
Call!  
I used to call her
