Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
  
It's never too late  
To try and reach for your desires  
Even when your luck is down  
You still got chances of turning around  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
  
It's never too late  
To hold the power in your hands (power in your hands)  
You will find a good, good feeling  
Makin' new plans and starting again  
It's never too late  
No, it's never too late  
No, it's never too late no, no, no, no  
  
No, it's never too late  
No, it's never too late  
No, it's never too late  
It's never too late  
  
Time keeps changin' everything  
Sometimes tearin' down  
The treasures that it brings  
Ever strong  
You'll make it through  
The secret lies in knowing  
That it's up to you  
Say it with me now  
  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
  
We got the time  
There's no doubt in my mind  
That it's never too late  
  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late  
Get the message  
Oh, it's never too late
