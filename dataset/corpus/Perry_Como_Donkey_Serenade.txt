There's a song in the air,  
But the fair senorita  
Doesn't seem to care  
For the song in the air.  
So I'll sing to my mule  
If you're sure she won't think that  
I am just a fool  
Serenading a mule.  
  
Amigo mio, does she not have a dainty bray?  
She listens carefully to each little word we play.  
La bella Senorita?  
Si, si, mi muchachito,  
She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way.  
But try as she may,  
In her voice there's a flaw!  
And all that the lady can say  
Is "E-E-AW!"  
  
There's a light in her eye,  
Tho' she may try to hide it,  
She cannot deny,  
There's a light in her eye.  
Oh! the charm of her smile  
So beguiles all who see her  
That they'd ride a mile  
For the charm of her smile.  
  
Amigo mio, is she listenin' to my song?  
No, no, mi muchachito, how could you be so wrong?  
La bella Senorita?  
Si, Si, la senorita,  
If she knew all the words,  
  
Well, maybe she'd sing along,  
  
Her face is a dream  
Like an angel I saw!  
But all that my darlin' can scream  
Is: "E-E-AW!"  
Senorita donkey sita, not so fleet as a mosquito,  
But so sweet like my Chiquita,  
You're the one for me.  
  
You're, the one, for me!
