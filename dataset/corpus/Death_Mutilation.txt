Massacred, hacked to death, my revenge  
Slicing deep, into your flesh, the pain intense  
Dreams of hate, misery, fill my mind  
Puke in your face in disgust, it's time to die  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
  
Staring your severed head in the face  
I celebrate a faggot's death, human disgrace  
Hanging your mangled corpse for display  
My revenge was fulfilled upon this day  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation
