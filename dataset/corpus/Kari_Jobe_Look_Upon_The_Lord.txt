Look upon the Lord  
Stand in awe of His beauty  
Look upon the Lord  
Seated high, He is Holy  
  
Let the glory of our God from Heaven come down  
Let the house of the Lord be filled with the cloud  
  
You are good and Your mercy will endure  
You are good and forever we are Yours  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Listen for the Lord  
Hear the voice of His spirit  
Call upon His name  
He is near  
He is with us
