We're caught in a trap  
I can't walk out  
Because I love you too much baby  
  
Why can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
When you don't believe a word I say?  
  
We can't go on together  
With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)  
And we can't build our dreams  
On suspicious minds  
  
So if an old friend I know  
Drops by to say hello,  
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?  
  
Here we go again  
Asking where I've been  
You can't see the tears are real  
I'm crying (yes I'm crying)  
  
We can't go on together  
With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)  
And we can't build our dreams  
On suspicious minds  
  
Slane! That's true that I've been in all the castles,  
But for now on you're the only castle in my life.  
I'm your's for life baybe! Here we go.  
  
We're caught in a trap  
I can't walk out  
Because I love you too much baby  
  
Why can't you see  
What you're doing to me  
When you don't believe a word I say?  
  
We're caught in a trap,  
I can't walk out x6
