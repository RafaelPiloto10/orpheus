Can't you feel the change  
aka People Oh People  
People Oh People  
There are mountains in our way  
We got brother against brother  
How will we stand on judgment day?  
  
Oh People oh people  
We gotta find a better way  
If we keep fighting  
If we keep dividing  
Tell me where will the children play?  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't you feel the change  
Can't you feel the change  
Can't you feel the change  
  
People oh people  
Hear every word I say  
We come in all different colors  
No one's above the other  
We are all the same  
  
People oh people  
Let's put hatred to an end  
In our hearts we have the answer  
In our souls we have the power  
Together we can make a change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People,  
Can't you see the walls tumbling down?  
People can't you feel the chains breaking down?  
A revolution is going down  
A revolution is going down
