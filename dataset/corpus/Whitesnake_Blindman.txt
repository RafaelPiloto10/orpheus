I was dreaming of the past,  
Why do good times never last  
Help me Jesus, show the way  
I can't hold on another day  
  
I was hungry, felling low,  
I just couldn't make out which way to go  
Chasing rainbows that have no end,  
The road is long without friend  
  
Be my friend, be my brother,  
Be the piper, play the call  
Across the seven seas of wonder  
Be the guardian of my soul  
  
Just a young man looking homeward,  
Watching the sun go down again  
Across the water, the sun is shining,  
But, will it ever, will it ever be the same  
  
Be my friend, be my brother,  
Be the piper, play the call  
Across the seven seas of wonder  
Be the guardian of my soul  
  
I need somebody, I need someone,  
I need somebody to call my own  
Like a blindman, I can feel the heat of the sun,  
But, like a blindman  
I don't know, I don't know,  
I don't know where it's coming from  
  
Be my friend, be my brother,  
Be the piper, play the call  
Across the seven seas of wonder  
Be the guardian of my soul  
  
I need somebody, I need someone,  
I need somebody to call my own  
Like a blindman, I can feel the heat of the sun,  
But, like a blindman  
I don't know, I don't know,  
I don't know where is coming from
