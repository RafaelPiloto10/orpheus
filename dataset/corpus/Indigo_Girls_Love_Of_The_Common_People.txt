Living on free food tickets  
Theres water in the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came in  
But what can you do  
  
Well you got tears from your little sister  
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch  
For the party to go  
Oh but you know that shes gonna get by  
  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to  
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can  
As she can  
Oh yeah  
  
And its a good thing you don't have bus fare  
It would fall through the whole in your pocket  
And youd lose it in the snow on the ground  
You better walk to town and find a job  
  
Oh and you try to keep your hands warm  
The hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills you to the bone  
Youd better go home where its warm  
  
You can live in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to  
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can  
As she can  
Oh yeah  
  
Living on a dream aint easy no  
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit  
And the chills stay away  
We like to keep them in stride for family pride  
  
Faith is your foundation  
Got a whole lot of love and a long conversation  
But don't forget to pray oh no  
Its keeping us strong where we belong  
  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to  
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can
