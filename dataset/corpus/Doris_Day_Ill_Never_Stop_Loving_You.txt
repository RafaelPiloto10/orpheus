I'll never stop loving you  
Whatever else I may do  
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through  
I'll never stop wanting you  
And when forever is through  
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet  
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies  
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes  
Of this I'm more than just sure  
My love will last and endure  
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you  
  
I'll never stop loving you  
Whatever else I may do  
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through  
I'll never stop wanting you  
And when forever is through  
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet  
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies  
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes  
Of this I'm more than just sure  
My love will last and endure  
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you
