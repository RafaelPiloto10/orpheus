E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A  
That's the new word for today  
E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A  
It's very easy to say  
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start  
You can close your eyes  
And see the world with your heart  
  
Do what you wish, be what you are  
What a victorious thrill  
Wearing a smile, all of the while  
Feeling the world standing still  
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers  
Then dial a star  
Anything's in your powers  
  
Euphoria  
Full euphoria  
Knowing no ills, needing no pills  
Singing a rock and roll hymn  
Feeling glorious, full of love  
Fine from the start  
You can close your eyes  
And see the world with your heart  
  
How good to be happy and free  
Living the way that you choose  
Healthily and clean  
Can't understand anyone having the blues  
Euphoria never to feel frustration  
How great to give euphoria invitation  
Euphoria, euphoria  
Long as we love each other
