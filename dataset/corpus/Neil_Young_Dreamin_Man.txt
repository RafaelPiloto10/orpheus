I'm a dreamin' man, yes, that's my problem  
I can't tell when I'm not being real.  
In the meadow dusk I park my Aerostar  
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you.  
  
I'll always be a dreamin' man  
I don't have to understand  
I know it's alright.  
  
I see your curves and I feel your vibrations  
You dressed in black and white, you lost in the mall  
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations  
Another sleepless night, a sun that won't fall.  
  
I'll always be a dreamin' man  
I don't have to understand  
I know it's alright.  
  
Now the night is gone, a new day is dawning  
And our homeless dreams go back to the street  
Another time or place, another civilization  
Would really make this life feel so complete.  
  
I'll always be a dreamin' man  
I don't have to understand  
I know it's alright.  
  
Dreamin' man  
He's got a problem  
Dreamin' man  
Dreamin' man  
He's got a problem  
Dreamin' man.
