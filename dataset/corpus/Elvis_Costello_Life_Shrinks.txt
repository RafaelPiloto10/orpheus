Shall I wear a buttonhole to jog your memory?  
So you'll recall the promise  
That I swore you made to me when we were younger  
You look sorry for yourself but what about?  
I'm some idea you're not without a doubt  
So you can put away that tongue  
I don't know who I'm trying to kid  
I'll find another name for you  
I'll try to put the blame on you  
For everything we did  
Life shrinks and before you know it  
You have forgotten all the cuts and bruises  
Just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons  
And you know by now who loses  
  
You're only half awake because you never go to bed  
And when he hears about it  
You know then the both of you's is dead and that's a promise  
You'll be sorry because I won't tell you again  
You'll stick like that one day  
And if you don't believe me go and ask St. Thomas  
I don't know where it's going to stop  
Spend your whole time trying to stay  
From breaking down or running away  
Or trying to keep up
