Oh you,you're so hard to get to,  
Oh you,you don't want to play,  
You were no better before,  
I sent a letter before,  
I sent a dream to you last night  
From the end of the world.  
  
Oh you,you keep me hangin' 'round and 'round  
And 'round,  
Oh you,look at the trouble I've found  
You were no better before  
I sent a letter before,  
I sent a dream to you last night  
From the end of the world.  
  
I saw you last night but you couldn't answer,  
You were a lonely little sidewalk dancer,  
When I woke up I could not stand it  
You were gone but I got to hand it to you.  
  
Oh please if this is a game I wish someone would win  
Oh please just let it fly to be upon the wind  
You were no better before,I sent a letter before  
I sent a dream to you baby last night  
From the end of the world
