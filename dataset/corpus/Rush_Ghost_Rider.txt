Pack up all those phantoms  
Shoulder that invisible load  
Keep on riding north and west  
Haunting that wilderness road  
Like a ghost rider  
  
Carry all those phantoms  
Through bitter wind and stormy skies  
From the desert to the mountain  
From the lowest low to the highest high  
Like a ghost rider  
  
Keep on riding North and West  
Then circle South and East  
Show me beauty, but there is no peace  
For the ghost rider  
  
Shadows on the road behind  
Shadows on the road ahead  
Nothing can stop you now  
  
There's a shadow on the road behind  
There's a shadow on the road ahead  
Nothing can stop you now  
  
Sunrise in the mirror  
Lightens that invisible load  
Riding on a nameless quest  
Haunting that wilderness road  
Like a ghost rider  
  
Just an escape artist  
Racing against the night  
A wandering hermit  
Racing toward the light  
  
From the White Sands  
To the Canyonlands  
To the redwood stands  
To the Barren Lands  
  
Sunrise on the road behind  
Sunset on the road ahead  
There's nothing to stop you now  
Nothing can stop you now
