The season is upon us now  
A time for gifts and giving  
As the year draws to its close  
I think about my living  
  
The Christmastime when I was young  
The magic and the wonder  
But colors dull and candles dim  
And dark my standing under  
  
Oh little Zachary, shining light  
You've set my soul to dreaming  
You've given back my joy in life  
And filled me with new meaning  
  
A savior king was born that day  
A baby just like you  
And as the wise men came with gifts  
I've come with my gift too  
  
That peace on earth fills up your time  
That brotherhood surrounds you  
That you may know the warmth of love  
And wrap it all around you  
  
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told  
From days when I was young  
Merry Christmas little Zachary  
Merry Christmas everyone  
  
Merry Christmas little Zachary  
Merry Christmas everyone
