Every life, every beating heart  
Has a searching soul inside  
Ever needing, ever seeking out  
The meaning to life  
  
I refuse to believe that we're only here to live and die  
In the futile days of a faithless haze  
Never asking why, why would I  
When I've felt the hand of eternity  
It's a legacy I will leave, I want to leave  
  
For the chilrden of the world  
Every single little boy and girl  
Heaven plants a special seed  
And we must have faith for these  
  
I will stand for the truth I've seen  
So the truth is seen in me  
I will give from the source of love  
So all that I believe is handed down  
For the road that's yet to be travelled on  
By the ones who will carry on, I'll carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
For the chilrden of the world  
Every single little boy and girl  
Heaven plants a special seed  
And we must have faith for these  
Red and yellow, black and white  
They are precious in the father's eyes  
Like the father may we see  
That they have a destiny  
And give them the light of love to lead  
  
Through the darkness around us now  
To a place where hope is found  
  
[Chorus: x 3]  
  
For the children of the world
