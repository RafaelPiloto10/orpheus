Once upon a time, I had a little money  
Government burglars took it along  
Before I could mail it to you  
Still you are the only one  
Now I can't let it slip away  
So if the man with the ticker tape, he tries to take it  
Well, this is what I'm gonna say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Blame it on Cain  
Don't blame it on me  
Oh-oh, oh, it's nobody's fault  
But we need somebody to burn  
  
Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup  
And the money got low, we could always heat it up  
Or trade it in  
But then the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse  
And you can run down the waveband  
Coast-to-coast, hand in hand  
Bad to worse, curse for curse  
Don't be dissatisfied, so if you're not satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I think I've lived a little too long on the outskirts of town  
I think I'm going insane from talking to myself for so long  
Oh, but I've never been accused  
When they step on your face, then wear that good-look grin  
I gotta break out one weekend before I do somebody in  
But every single time I feel a little stronger  
They tell me it's a crime, well, how much longer?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Blame it on Cain,  
Oh-oh, oh, please don't blame it on me  
It's nobody's fault  
But it just seems to be his turn
