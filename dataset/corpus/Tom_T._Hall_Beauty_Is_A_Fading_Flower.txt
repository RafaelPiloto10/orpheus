Beauty is a fading flower tomorrow it may be gone  
Beauty is a fading flower love goes on and on  
Today everybody wants you brand new is better than old  
Who will want you tomorrow there's beauty in your soul  
Beauty is a fading flower...  
You have never known love you've never learned to hate  
When these emotions find you they'll leave lines in your face  
Beauty is a fading flower...  
Love is not all beauty love is not all form  
Winter wilts the flowers love can keep you warm  
Beauty is a fading flower...
