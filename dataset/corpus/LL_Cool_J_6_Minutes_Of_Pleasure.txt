Six minutes, six minutes  
Six minutes, six minutes  
  
I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Hey yo, baby, I know why you're here  
I know what you're doing  
I can see it in your eyes, you're up to somethin'  
I know what it is, but we're still cool  
And we can socialize, I'm peepin' ya, baby  
I'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go  
Cause a fool doesn't have a shoulder to cry on  
So give me a kiss and your service  
Whether you like a mister or a miss  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Baby, you're my dear, I know why you're here  
I know why you came, I know what you're thinkin'  
I know what you need, and that's what I've got  
You think I'm goin' crazy, no, I'm not drinking  
I know what you want, I made ya want it  
Take my hand, listen to the man  
You have a plan, don't even risk it  
What do you want, a biscuit?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Six minutes, six minutes  
Six minutes, six minutes  
(I ain't sayin' nothin')  
Six minutes, six minutes  
  
Honey, I know what you're up to, I know how you're livin'  
I know where you go when you leave my house  
I know what your dreams are, but I dream too  
You're with a man your, not with a mouse  
I see how you stare, I see how you smile  
I see right through, now act like you knew  
I know all about where you been runnin'  
Wipe your feet before you come in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, that's smooth, let's just sit here and relax  
While my man plays the piano for us  
Sip somethin' mellow  
And it's us while you're here  
But of course I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Okay, now that you know I know you know that I know you know  
And that's the move, so sit right here  
Whisper in my ear, caress my chest  
And say somethin' smooth, but don't forget  
I'll know what you'll say  
Just what I thought, I know the routine  
I know the routine, just what I thought  
I know you tell the truth, I know you don't lie  
Shh, close your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't tell if you won't tell  
It's cool with me, I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know you don't love me  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
(I know why you're here)  
I ain't sayin'
