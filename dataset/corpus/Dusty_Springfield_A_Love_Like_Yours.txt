I broke your heart  
And I made you blue  
Instead of hurting back  
You said I love you  
That very day you won my heart  
And my love for you shall never part  
  
You have such an understanding way  
And I appreciate you need what I say  
'Cause a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
  
Although I treated you bad from the start  
Without question you gave me your heart  
No, a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
  
It's the little things you do  
Oh, that mean so much  
So very, very much  
(Consideration), I never knew  
That is, until I met you  
Believe me  
  
You made my life complete  
And I know our love with all of my mind  
You can believe going to hold on tight  
'Cause a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
  
No, a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
  
It's the little things you do  
That mean so much  
So very, very much  
(Consideration), no I never knew  
That is, until I met you  
Believe me  
  
You made my life complete  
And I know our love with all of my mind  
You can believe going to hold on tight  
'Cause a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
I said a love like yours, it don't come knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
I said a love like yours, it don't come, it don't come knocking  
Knock, knocking everyday  
'Cause a love like yours, it don't come knocking
