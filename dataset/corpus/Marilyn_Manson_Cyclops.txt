Cyclops woman got one eye in her head  
Mascara clotted vision she is fed  
Cyclops woman can't see nothing at all  
She got a pin prick spiral hole  
She can't see nothing nothing at all  
She can't see nothing nothing at all  
Cyclops woman dying in her shell  
Guilt got her trapped in her nailed well  
Cyclops woman is the eye of the world  
Who's reflection's in the retina?  
She can't see nothing nothing at all  
She can't see nothing, nothing at all  
Dilate, Dial-ate
