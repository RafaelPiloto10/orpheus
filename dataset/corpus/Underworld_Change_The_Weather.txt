Look at these eyes admit that you're killing me but you can never see  
The damage that you do! look at this fool in tears on his stupid knees  
You treat me like disease how can I please you? I'd change the weather  
I'd change the weather for you now I'd change the weather I'd get down  
On my knees and pray for you I'd change the weather I'd change the  
Weather for you now I'd change the weather I'd get down on my knees  
Forever! and if I could I'd kiss you and run away now shut your mouth  
And pray it's something that I'll do but I'm a fool a magnet to your  
Vicious words to you I look absurd but I'm in love with you
