Hey Joe!  
Where'd ya find that pearly girlie  
Where'd ya get that jolly dolly  
How did ya rate that dish I wish was mine  
Hey Joe!  
  
She's got skin that's creamy dreamy  
Eyes that look so lovey-dovey  
Lips as red as cherry berry wine  
Now listen Joe, I ain't no heel  
But oh buddy let me tell you how I feel  
She's a honey, she's a sugar pie  
I'm warnin' you I'm gonna try to steal her from you  
Hey Joe!  
Though we've been the best of friends  
This is where that friendship ends  
I gotta have that dolly for my own.  
  
(Hey Joe!)  
(Hey Joe!)  
  
Hey Joe!  
Come on let's be buddy buddies  
Show me you're my palsy-walsy  
Introduce that pretty little chick to me  
Hey Joe!  
  
Quit that waitin', hesitatin'  
Let me at 'er, what's the matter  
You're as slow as any Joe can be  
Now come on Joe let's make a deal  
Let me dance with her to see if she is real  
She's the cutest girl I've ever seen  
An' I tell ya face to face I mean to steal her from you  
Hey Joe!  
  
We'll be friends until the end  
But this looks like the end my friend  
I gotta have that dolly for my own  
I've gotta have that dolly for my own  
(Hey Joe, Hey Joe)
