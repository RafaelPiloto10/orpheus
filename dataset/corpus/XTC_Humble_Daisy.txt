Humble Daisy  
Form a chain to hold all battleships in check  
Humble Daisy  
Knit a ladder down to nature's sunken wreck  
Ragged rug unbound  
Tangle trip the lovers  
Royal barge aground  
Brighter than all of the others on the window sill  
I'll sing about you if nobody else will  
Humble Daisy  
Cast the milk and coins of morning's cash about  
Humble Daisy  
I fell down to heaven as you picked me out  
We'll look up together  
Browsing through some old sky  
Sipping in the weather  
You've got me dizzy, the fly that climbed the sugar hill  
I'll lay upon you 'till somebody else will  
Humble Daisy  
We'll look up together
