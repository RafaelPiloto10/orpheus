Sleep and dream of this  
Death angel's kiss  
Brings final bliss  
Don't believe it!  
  
Empty they say  
Death, won't you let me stay?  
Empty they say  
Death, hear me call your name?  
Oh, call your name!  
Suicide, I've already died  
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for  
Cyanide, living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Wait, wait patiently  
Your death-black wings  
Unfolding sleep  
Treading on me  
  
Empty they say  
Death, won't you let me stay?  
Empty they say  
Death, hear me call your name  
Oh, call your name!  
Suicide, I've already died  
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for  
Cyanide, living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Say, is that rain or are they tears?  
That stained your concrete face for years  
Crying, weeping, shedding strife  
Year after year, life after life  
A narrow freshly broken ground  
A concrete angel laid right down  
Upon the moon that swallows fast  
It's peace at last  
Oh, peace at last  
  
Empty they say  
Death, won't you let me stay?  
Empty they say  
Death, hear me call your name  
Oh, call your name  
Suicide, I've already died  
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for  
Cyanide, living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Forevermore!  
Forevermore!  
It's the funeral I've been waiting for!
