  
There's a flame, flame in my heart  
And there's no rain, can put it out  
And there's a flame, it's burning in my heart  
And there's no rain, ooh can put it out  
So just hold me, hold me, hold me  
  
Take away the pain, inside my soul  
And I'm afraid, so all alone  
Take away the pain, that's burning in my soul  
Cause I'm afraid that I'll be all alone  
So just hold me, hold me, hold me  
  
Hold on to my heart, to my heart, to me  
Hold on to my heart, to my heart, to me  
And oh no, don't let me go cause all I am  
You hold in your hands, and hold me  
And I'll make it through the night  
And I'll be alright, hold on, hold on to my heart
