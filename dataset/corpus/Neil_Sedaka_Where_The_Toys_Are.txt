Where the toys are  
That's where dad will be  
Without a clue or what to do  
He still insists on building stuff for me  
Where the toys are  
Who knows what I'll see  
A wobbly bite, a flightless kite  
To games that still need batteries  
In a box with a million pieces  
Are instructions he won't read  
And he never lets me help him  
No matter how I plead  
Till I'm older I'll wait so nervously  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
That's where dad will be  
In a box with a million pieces  
Are instructions he won't read  
And he never lets me help him  
No matter how I plead  
Till I'm older I'll wait so nervously  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
That's where dad will be  
That's where dad will be  
That's where dad will be  
Oh no, that's where dad will be  
I know he's trying  
That's where dad will be  
Doesn't look good  
That's where dad will be  
Oh no, oh no, oh no
