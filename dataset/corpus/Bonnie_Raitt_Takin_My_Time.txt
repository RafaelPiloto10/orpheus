Bonnie Raitt-Takin' My Time  
(Bill Payne)  
I'm takin' my time  
So please don't rush me.  
Tryin' to sort out some things I didn't know existed.  
I've been here before,  
I know where the traps lie.  
You only take what's there 'cause the rest doesn't matter.  
Well I'm tired of talk,  
So please don't push me.  
You know I want the same kinda things that you do.  
You're wasting your time,  
The way you come to me.  
Slow down your rhymes and try to reason  
Can't make things move any faster,  
By second wishing them to death.  
You seem to be living on the level.  
It's decent enough,  
You got what you wanted.  
So why do you tell me, that I'm on the wrong track?  
I'm doin' the best I can do.  
I try to out guess  
The situation  
That I know your not even fully aware of.  
And I want you to know,  
If it keeps on this way,  
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.  
Can't keep on letting you bring me down.
