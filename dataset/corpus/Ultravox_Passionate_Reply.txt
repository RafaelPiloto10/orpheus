Suddenly you'll find  
Yourself waiting for a long time  
Your back's to the wall  
But now you must go  
Painting scenes from magazines  
Sucking breath from nicotine  
Standing tall against the crowd we sigh  
Taking turns on telephones  
Living lives in other homes  
Listening for the passionate replies  
Suddenly we find  
Ourselves talking for a long time  
Our voices are low  
But now you must know  
Giving all you have to give  
Taking all you've got to live  
Plotting all mistakes along the way  
Find it hard to take it all  
Reading names on other walls  
Writing down the words we tried to sing  
Suddenly you'll find  
Yourself waiting for a long time  
Your back's to the wall  
But now you must go  
Suddenly you'll find  
Yourself waiting for a long time
