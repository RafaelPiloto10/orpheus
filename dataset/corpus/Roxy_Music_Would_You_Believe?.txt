Would you believe in what I do  
When the things that I make are all for you?  
And in a while I'll come to you  
Showing showing why what I think will all come true  
Well I'm sure I'll love you all my life  
And in the morning too  
Everything you have is out of sight  
But baby I can see through you  
And in a while I'll come to you  
Showing showing why what I think will all come true  
Would, would you believe in what I do  
When the things that I make are all for you?
