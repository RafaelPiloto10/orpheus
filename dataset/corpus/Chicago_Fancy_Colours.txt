Going where the orange sun has never died  
And your swirling marble eyes shine  
Laughing  
Burning blue the light  
Bittersweet the drops of life  
Memories only fading  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever did see  
When we're down at the sea  
We see things so very clear at the sea  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever can do  
The morning covered with dew  
We do things so very fine in the dew  
  
Fancy colors  
Fancy colors  
  
All we ever do hear  
But whether we're here or there  
We hear things so very fine when we're there
