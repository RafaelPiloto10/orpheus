My girls wear lipstick while they're making my beats  
They got guitar picks in their purses, Louboutins on their feet  
They got no time for waiting in lines  
They got sex and 808s running through their dirty minds  
  
My girls, we're running the show  
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go  
My girls, 'cause that's the way that we roll  
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control  
  
Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one  
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (come on!)  
  
My girls headed to the city, y'all  
We got Cosmo on the dash and tickets on the floor  
We got Sia, and Rhonna, and Peaches too  
We got Johanna and JD and we're coming for you  
  
My girls (my girls)  
  
My girls, we're running the show  
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go  
My girls, 'cause that's the way that we roll  
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control  
  
Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one  
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (come on!)  
  
My girls are screaming, and yelling, and getting loud  
My girls are shaking up the party while you're getting down  
My girls are singing, and dancing and having fun  
My girls are cooking up a beat, and they want you to come  
  
I like my girls hot, sweet, tough, or play me  
Either way trainable primate  
Self reliant, giant, death defiant,  
No Colby Briant  
I take it both for you, if you give me a taste  
I wreck a mullet or two yeah below the waist  
You're my bff, you're my 606  
303 am I swingin'  
  
My girls stay close when they see trouble around  
They got jewels on their fingers, it's about to go down  
We got no time for haters you know, we just came to party  
Come on, now here we go  
  
My girls, we're running the show  
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go  
My girls, cause that's the way that we roll  
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control  
  
Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one  
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun  
My girls we're stronger than one  
Now shout, and sometimes  
Now shout, we gotta have fun
