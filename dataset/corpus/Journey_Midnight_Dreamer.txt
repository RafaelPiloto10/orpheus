All alone through the countryside  
Clouds in my brain, vision in my eyes  
Thoughts are on the wall  
Like oceons on the sand  
Midnight dreamer, take me if you can  
You can't deny, it seems so easy to do  
But women trade in black  
And now she's sinning on you  
Giving you my heart, there's nothin' you can do  
Midnight lover, I'm in love with you  
She's my midnight lover, wild and fancy free  
Standing in the shadows in the palace of my dreams  
You're a pretty thing, like fire from the sun  
You've got to catch her while she's shining before the morning comes  
Could this be a dream  
Dream on, dream on, dream on
