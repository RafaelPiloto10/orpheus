Even as the world began the stars they sang  
And all the angels shouted for joy, shouted for joy  
And looking back through history  
Your people they have always had  
A song they must sing, a song they must sing  
We are the people of God  
We'll sing Your song  
Here on the earth  
All over the world Your song will resound  
All over the world Your praises ring out  
We're living to see Your name and renown  
All over the world  
Young and old, near and far  
There's a place for every heart  
To join in Your song, join in Your song  
Every nation, tribe and tongue  
Come together, join as one  
Give glory to God, glory to God  
We are the people of God  
We'll sing Your song here on the earth  
Great is Your name and great will be Your song  
Great is Your name and great will be Your song  
We lift up our hands and pray  
Lift up our hands and pray  
For holy is Your name
