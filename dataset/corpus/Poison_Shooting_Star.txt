A small town girl with big time dreams  
But nothing's ever as it seems  
A mother waves her girl goodbye  
Then slowly hangs her head and cries  
Hollywood hills and the big city lights  
Outside her window they burn bright  
Someday the world will praise her fame  
They'll know her face they'll shout her name  
  
They'll shout it real loud  
She'll make her mama real proud  
She'll stand above the crowd  
  
I am someone  
Look what I've done  
Stare into the sun  
I am a shooting star  
I am something  
I am someone  
Look what I've done  
I am a shooting star  
  
She looks down at the stars, lying on the streets  
Says to herself "that will be me"  
A big time dream, a small town mind  
Searching for a break, she may never find  
Streets of gold, they turned to grey  
Just one more chance, just one more day  
Someday that world will know this face  
She swears they'll never fall from grace  
  
They'll shout it real loud  
She'll make her mama real proud  
She'll stand above the crowd  
And shout  
  
She stands out on the streets in the pouring rain  
Strangers walk by they don't know her name  
As the silver screen slowly fades to black  
She'll never give in, she can never go back  
  
Someday you'll see me  
Don't you need me  
Everybody will believe me  
I am a shooting star  
  
I will stand strong  
I will hold on  
It's not my last song  
I am a shooting star
