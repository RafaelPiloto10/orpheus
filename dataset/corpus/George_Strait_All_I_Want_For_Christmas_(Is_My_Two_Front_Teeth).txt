Everybody stops and stares at me  
These two teeth are gone as you can see  
I don't know just who to blame for this castastrophe  
But my one wish on Christmas Eve is as plain as can be  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, "Merry Christmas"  
It seems so long since I could say  
"Sister, Susie sitting on a thistle!"  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be, if I could only whistle  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, "Merry Christmas"  
It seems so long since I could say  
"Sister, Susie sitting on a thistle!"  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be, if I could only whistle  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, "Merry Christmas"
