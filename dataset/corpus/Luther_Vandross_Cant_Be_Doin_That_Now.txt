Ready or not  
You're gonna get a taste of love  
Just like you want it to  
Your wish is gonna come to you  
  
So, if you've got a change of heart  
Stop that before you start  
None of this holding back  
I thought you knew that  
  
You can't be doin' that now  
Stop it right away  
You can't be doin' that now  
'Cause I need a little kindness  
A little, a little tenderness  
A little love somehow  
  
Other loves you've had  
Are just a thing of the past  
All a part of yesterday  
Forever and far away  
  
But, never will I disappear  
My love is gonna stay right here  
So, none of this pulling back  
I thought you knew that  
  
What's it about, my love, my love  
What's on your mind, now baby love  
Answer my call, I'm callin'  
Don't stop now that I've fallen  
  
Don't let a good thing get away  
We've got forever and a day  
To make the whole thing better  
That's why I'm gonna leave you never
