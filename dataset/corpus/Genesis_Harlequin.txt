Came the night a mist dissolved the trees  
And in the broken light colors fly, fading by.  
Pale and cold as figures fill the glade  
Grey is the web they spin, on and on, and on and on.  
Through the flame still summer lingers on  
Though her pictures soon shatter.  
  
All, always the same.  
But there appears in the shades of dawning,  
Though your eyes are dim,  
All of the pieces in the sky.  
  
There was once a harvest in this land.  
Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin,  
Dancing round, three children fill the glade,  
Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream, and in between.  
Close your door, the picture fades again  
From the flames in the firelight.  
  
All, always the same,  
But there appears in the shades of dawning,  
Though your eyes are dim,  
All of the pieces in the sky.  
  
All, all is not lost,  
And light appears in the shades of dawning  
When your eyes can see  
Order the pieces, put them back, put them back.
