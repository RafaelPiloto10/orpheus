Lucy jumped from the thirty ninth floor  
Said, she just couldn't face another poor man  
Every juke box stuck on, "Who's next"  
They almost got me when Jimmy said  
  
Let's get lost  
But we're gonna fall  
A change of weather couldn't do you no harm  
Let's get lost  
Pick up your feet  
Don't tempt late, boy, get a pair of cheap skates  
  
Penny walked in with that love in vain look  
Said, 'Every last man should be hangin' from a meat hook'  
She looked in my eye singin', "Marry me Bill"  
I loosened my tie just as Jimmy said  
  
Let's get lost  
Go work on a farm  
A change of weather couldn't do you no harm  
Let's get lost  
Pick up your feet  
Don't tempt late, boy, get a pair of cheap skates  
  
And I was so depressed today  
Yeah, I was so depressed today  
  
Bobby said, "We're goin' to get rich quick"  
You buy a brand new car, you get automatic cash back  
Pick up a parkin' lot, no money down  
He was countin' the cost just as Jimmy said  
  
Let's get lost  
Go work on a farm  
A change of weather couldn't do you no harm  
Let's get lost  
Pick up your feet  
Don't tempt late, boy, get a pair of cheap skates  
  
Get lost, let's get lost  
Come on, let's get lost  
Let's get lost  
Go buy a pair of cheap skates
