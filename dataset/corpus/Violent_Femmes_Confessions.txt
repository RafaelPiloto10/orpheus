People worry  
What are they worryin' about today  
Seems like there's a good reason  
To worry worry worry  
  
I'd sit around listening to you story  
If I wasn't in such a  
Hurry hurry hurry  
And I'm so lonely  
  
I just don't think I can take it anymore  
And I'm so lonely  
I just don't know what to do  
And I'm so lonely  
  
Feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die  
And I'm so lonely  
Feel like I'm gonna  
Hack hack hack hack it apart  
  
Seems like there's a good reason to be  
Lonely lonely lonely  
I gotta get someone or something  
To make me feel less  
  
Lonely lonely lonely  
I know I could do it  
I know if I wasn't so  
Lonely lonely lonely  
  
Have we got an army  
We'll teach you how to act like to act like a man  
Have we got an army  
Man I mean to tell you we can fight  
  
Have we got an army  
And were gonna do it tonight  
Do do do it tonight  
Yeah they're gonna  
  
Pay pay pay pay it tonight  
Do do do it tonight
