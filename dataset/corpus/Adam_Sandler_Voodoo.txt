Keep it down for goodness sake  
It's way too early in the morning  
Can't you please use your wooden rake?  
You choose to ignore I  
Even though me hungover  
That's not being nice  
So tonight, your head will be covered in lice  
  
Voodoo spell on you  
Voodoo Voodoo  
You shouldn't have given that dirty stare  
Voodoo Voodoo  
Too late for sorry, go cut off your hair  
  
Hey there old, old woman  
Shopping for food at the store  
Why'd you run your cart into I  
And knock me eggs on the floor  
Then took the last unbruised cantelope  
And laughed so loud with glee  
But you won't be laughing  
'cause from now on it'll burn when you pee  
  
Voodoo spell on you  
Voodoo Voodoo  
You couldn't have made I any madder  
Voodoo Voodoo  
That's why I put a curse on your bladder  
  
Boodaloo Boodalay  
Boodalee Boodalie  
Are the words that he say  
When you fuck with I  
Voodoo  
  
Hey there Mr. State Trooper  
Me was only going 58  
Please don't you write up that ticket  
It'll ruin me insurance rate  
You say you have a quota to meet  
So straight to hell with I  
Me have only one response  
Boodalee Boodalie  
  
Voodoo spell on you  
Voodoo Voodoo  
You cost I 80 dollars cash  
Voodoo Voodoo  
Me hope you like your new skin rash
