Something's wrong in this house today  
While the master was riding the servants decided to play  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
While the sorcerer slept the apprentice decided to play  
While the master was hiding the servants decided to play  
Might be too much sun or too much of something in the air  
Whatever's happening nobody else is aware  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay
