I can't let nothing come in between the two of us  
Cause it's like your all I need  
Since we been together and,  
Whenever I'm in need of a little love  
It's OK for me to open up  
But I just can't give me heart to anyone cause  
  
[Bridge]  
Some only come in your life for a season  
And stay a while to give you a reason  
To take time to the very end  
And to think that its forever  
But you've given me someone that I  
Can believe in I know there will be times  
We can't come to an agreement  
But I know that we'll figure out the ups and down  
Tell me are you willing to take a chance? Baby if so  
  
[Chorus]  
Here we go (here we go)  
Let me put you in my hand,  
C'mon (c'mon)  
I wanna be your man  
Lets do it right,  
So that you'll be with me a lifetime  
You know and I know  
Don't think that I'm talking crazy,  
Your mama and my mama want some grand babies tonight  
Would you be with me a lifetime  
  
I used to think that it was hopeless  
And that I should just give it up (give it up)  
But I couldn't stop until I found myself a good girl  
To be in love  
  
I checked every state and city  
And looked all around the world  
And I'm proud to say that my search ends here  
Cause your one in a million to me and I can't let you go  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen, season are truly meant to change  
However, love can be the reason you fall  
But when you find that special someone  
You'd be willing to give them a lifetime, I love you and I choose you,  
Follow me.  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
