Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky  
You mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry  
Spread a little happiness as you go by  
Please try  
  
What's the use of worrying and feeling blue  
When days are long keep on smiling through  
Spread a little happiness till dreams come true  
  
Surely you'll be wise to make the best of every blues day  
Don't you realize you'll find next Monday or next Tuesday  
Your golden shoes day  
  
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky  
You mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry  
Spread a little happiness as you go by  
  
I've got a creed for every need  
So easy that it must succeed  
I'll set it down for you to read  
So please, take heed  
Keep out the gloom  
Let in the sun  
That's my advice for everyone  
It's only once we pass this way  
So day by day  
  
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky  
You mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry  
Spread a little happiness as you go by  
Please try  
  
What's the use of worrying and feeling blue?  
When days are long keep on smiling through  
Spread a little happiness till dreams come true  
  
Surely you'll be wise to make the best of every blues day  
Don't you realize you'll find next Monday or next Tuesday  
Your golden shoes day  
  
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky  
You mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry  
Spread a little happiness as you go by  
  
Surely you'll be wise to make the best of every blues day  
Don't you realize you'll find next Monday or next Tuesday  
Your golden shoes day  
  
Even when the darkest clouds are in the sky  
You mustn't sigh and you mustn't cry  
Spread a little happiness as you go by
