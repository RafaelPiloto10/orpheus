Would I Lie To You?  
  
Would I lie to you?  
Would I lie to you honey?  
Now would I say something that wasn't true?  
I'm asking you sugar  
Would I lie to you?  
  
My friends, know what's in store.  
I won't be here anymore.  
I've packed my bags  
I've cleaned the floor.  
Watch me walkin'.  
Walkin' out the door.  
  
Believe me, I'll make it make it  
Believe me, I'll make it make it

Tell you straight, no intervention.  
To your face, no deception.  
You're the biggest fake.  
That much is true.  
Had all I can take.  
Now I'm leaving you  
  
Believe me, I'll make it make it  
Believe me, I'll make it make it
