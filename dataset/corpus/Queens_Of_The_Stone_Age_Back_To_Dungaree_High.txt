I didn't mean to turn you on, no way  
Just wanna dance and sing my song, oh okay  
Clocking in, clocking out,  
No I don't mind it at all  
Me and the danger dudes  
Were on the news, so just don't bother to call, because  
  
It's just a way to stay alive, boy  
It's such a trip just to survive  
  
So it's back, back to dungaree high  
Just to get high, back to dungaree high  
Just a great big boy  
With a teeny-weeny alibi  
  
Just a soul on ice  
With a mirror and a blade  
And a pocket full of mice  
Cheap thrills done and the dirt cheap ants  
'cause I got a headache in my pants  
  
I got a headache in my pants  
I got a headache in my pants  
I got a headache in my pants, because  
  
It's just a way to stay alive, boy  
It's such a trip just to survive  
So it's back, back to dungaree high  
Just to get high, back to dungaree high  
Just a great big boy  
With a teeny-weeny alibi  
  
It's just a way to stay alive, boy  
It's such a trip just to survive, boy  
It's just a way to stay alive, boy  
It's such a trip just to survive, boy  
It's just a way to stay alive, boy  
It's such a trip just to survive  
Back to dungaree  
Back to dungaree  
Back to dungaree high
