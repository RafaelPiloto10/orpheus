I'm not afraid of anything in this world  
There's nothing you can throw at me that I haven't already heard  
I'm just trying to find a decent melody  
A song that I can sing in my own company  
  
I never thought you were a fool  
But Darling, look at you,  
You gotta stand up straight  
Carry your own weight  
These tears are going nowhere, baby  
  
You've got to get yourself together  
Youv'e got stuck in a moment  
And now you can't get out of it  
Don't say that later will be better  
Now you're stuck in a moment  
And you can't get out of it  
  
I will not forsake the colours that you bring  
The nights you filled with fireworks, they left you with nothing  
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me  
I listen through your ears, through your eyes I can see  
  
And you are such a fool  
To worry like you do  
I know it's tough  
And you can never get enough  
Of what you don't really need now, my, oh my  
  
Youve got to get yourself together  
Youve got stuck in a moment  
And now you can't get out of it  
Oh love, look at you now  
Stuck in a moment  
And you can't get out of it  
  
I was unconscious, half asleep  
The water is warm till you discover how deep  
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall  
It's a long way down to nothing at all  
  
Youve got to get yourself together  
Youve got stuck in a moment  
And you can't get out of it  
Don't say that later will be better  
Now you're stuck in a moment  
And you can't get out of it  
  
And if the night runs over  
And if the days wont last  
And if your way should falter  
Along that stony pass  
It's just a moment (that you are a fool to cry)  
This time will pass
