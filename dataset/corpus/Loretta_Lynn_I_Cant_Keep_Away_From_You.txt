By your side each minute's where I wanna be  
Can't get you off my mind and let it rest in peace  
So every step you make I wanna make it too  
Oh I can't keep away from you  
Well I don't care where you are as long as you're with me  
You're every dream I dream you're every breath I breathe  
My shadow follows you love's everything you do  
Why I can't keep away from you  
Oh I can't keep away from you I couldn't if I wanted to  
No matter how hard I try or what I do  
You've got my heart and soul that's why I need you so  
You're holding on to me I know I can't let go  
But oh would I go through to prove my love is true  
Oh I can't keep away from you  
[ steel ]  
Baby I can't keep away from you
