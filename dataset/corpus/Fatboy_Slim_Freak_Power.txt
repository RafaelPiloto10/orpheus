A man, a plan he doesn't understand,  
He can't live the life he wants to lead,  
Dealin with fools and brother ridicule,  
Every day he got new rules to read.  
Stop and fight man,  
Make it right man,  
Change the things you really hate.  
The life he leads turns him inside out,  
Coz' he's livin in a master state.  
  
Freak Power  
Riding the freak wave.  
Freak Power,  
True, bein' a freak slave.  
Freak Power,  
Walking the freak walk.  
Freak Power,  
Talking like a freak talks.  
  
A woman can't walk alone, she's on her own.  
Takin it home.  
Footsteps in an alleyway, but she's got no other way to go.  
Stop and think man! Watcha doing man?  
Can't you let your sister breathe?  
She got the right 2 wnader day and night,  
And move where she please.  
  
Some people say, and some people do,  
All I want to know, is which one are you?  
People stand around, doggin' on their brother,  
Part 1 of the plan, respect each other...
