We have to take our chances, we have to keep it down  
We have to steal our kisses when nobody's around  
We have to hide the tenderness inside  
To make love on the sly, you say it's for the better  
  
We have to speak in riddles to cloak the things we say  
We have to watch our whispers, not to give ourselves away  
We have to run in shadows in the dark  
We have to stand apart when they see us together  
  
So we're livin' like silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night  
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows  
We're silent partners, never come to the light  
It'll never be right, whatever we do  
You need me too much and I'm just not givin' up on you  
  
We have to keep the secret burnin' on our lips  
We'd both be hurting someone if they caught us here like this  
We have to bear this burden that we share  
Knowin' our affair just can't go on forever  
  
And we're livin' like silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night  
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows  
We're silent partners, never come to the light  
It'll never be right, whatever we do  
You need me too much and I'm just not givin' up on you  
  
Silent partners  
I can't let it show, we gotta keep it low, so no one knows  
We're silent partners, are we ever gonna come to the light?  
It'll never be right, whatever we do  
You need me too much and I'm just not givin' up  
  
Silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night  
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows  
We're silent partners, are we ever gonna come to the light?  
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows  
We're silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night  
Can't let ... [fade out]
