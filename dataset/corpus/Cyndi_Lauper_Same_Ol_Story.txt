People slippin' in the rain  
I watch them get up again  
It makes me feel like I can too  
Hey hey ya  
  
Just when I get off the ground  
Your back tryin' to put me down  
Like some simpleton you can use  
Hey  
  
[Chorus]  
Well It's the same old fucking story  
With your two different sets of rules  
The same old fucking story  
One for me two for you  
It's the same old fucking story  
It's the same old fucking story all around yeah  
  
Still some glory in my eyes  
Much to everyone's surprise  
After everything you put me through  
Yeah well  
Friends tell me you've been around  
Big fish in a big ol' town  
Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
  
Still some glory in my eyes  
Much to everyone's surprise  
After everything you put me through  
Yeah well  
Friends tell me you've been around  
Big fish in a big ol' town  
Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's the same fucking story know damn well it's true  
Same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol'  
  
[Chorus]
