Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door  
Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door  
And I said, "Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go"  
Me and the Devil, was walkin' side by side  
Me and the Devil, was walkin' side by side  
I'm goin' to beat my woman, until I get satisfied  
She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round  
Now, baby, you know you ain't doin' me right, now  
She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round  
It must be that old evil spirit, so deep down in the ground  
You may bury my body down by the highway side  
I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone  
You may bury my body down by the highway side  
So my old evil spirit can take the Greyhound bus and ride
