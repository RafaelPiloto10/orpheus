Sundown and sorrow have found me  
Memories are makin' me blue  
Here with the shadows around me  
I can't forget lovin' you  
  
Nothing but daydreams to haunt me  
Dreams that will never come true  
It's hard to know you don't want me  
I just can't help lovin' you  
  
Forever, so long I've been yearnin'  
Wondering what I could do  
Deep in my heart, there's a burnin'  
I just can't help lovin' you
