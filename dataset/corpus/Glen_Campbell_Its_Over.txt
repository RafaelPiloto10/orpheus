If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This hour of love we share would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
To shine a morning light  
Make us realize our night  
Is over  
  
When you walk away from me there  
Is no place to put my hand  
Except to shade my eyes against the sun  
That rises o'er the land  
I watch you walk away somehow  
I have to let you go now  
It's over  
  
If you knew just how I really  
Feel you might return and yet  
There are so many times that people  
Have to love and then forget  
Though there might have been a way  
I have to force myself to say  
It's over  
  
So I turn my back and  
Turn my collar to the wind  
Move along in silence  
Tryin' not to think at all  
Send my tired feet before me  
Walk the silent street before me  
It's over  
It's over
