Two girls for every boy  
  
I bought a '30 Ford wagon and we call it a woodie  
(Surf City, here we come)  
You know it's not very cherry, it's an oldie but a goodie  
(Surf City, here we come)  
Well, it ain't got a back set or a rear window  
But it still gets me where I wanna go  
  
And we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now  
Two girls for every boy  
  
You know they never roll the streets up 'cause there's always somethin' goin'  
(Surf City, here we come)  
You know they're either out surfin' or they got a party growin'  
(Surf City, here we come)  
Yeah, and there's two swingin' honeys for every guy  
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye  
  
And we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now  
Two girls for every boy  
  
And if my woody breaks down on me somewhere on the surf route  
(Surf City, here we come)  
I'll strap my board to my back and hitch a ride in my wetsuit  
(Surf City, here we come)  
And when I get to Surf City I'll be shootin' the curl  
And checkin' out the parties for a surfer girl  
  
And we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now  
Two girls for every boy
