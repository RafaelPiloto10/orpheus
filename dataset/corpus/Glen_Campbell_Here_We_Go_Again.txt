Here we go again she's back in town again  
I'll take her back again one more time  
Here we go again the phone will ring again  
I'll be her fool again one more time.  
  
I've been there before and I'll try it again  
But any fool knows that there's no way to win  
Here we go again she'll break my heart again  
I'll play the part again one more time.  
  
Here we go again she'll break my heart again  
I'll play the part again one more time.  
  
I'll play the part again one more time
