I had wrists donning slits  
Flowing constantly  
My broken body in a wreck  
Wrapped around a tree  
A crosswalk hit and run  
The finish line for me  
People clutter in the gutter  
Take a look and see  
  
No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin o'my teeth  
  
My blood flows through the streets  
Deluge from the wounds  
Empty jars of sleeping pills  
On the dresser in my room  
My wet brain neighbor cranes  
His neck to see... in time  
The white lights a train  
Bearing down on me  
  
No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin o'my teeth  
  
[Solo - Marty]  
  
I won't feel the hurt  
I'm not trash any longer  
That that doesn't kill me  
Only makes me stronger  
I need a ride to the morgue  
That's what 911 is for  
So, tag my toe and don't forget  
Ooh to close the drawer  
  
No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin o'my teeth
