We're living in a different reality, we're toeing the same line  
We give in we call it neutrality, a joke with no punchline  
The silver plated hero meets the golden hearted whore  
The odds'll give you zero, she'll be leaving in a few days more  
Movin' on forever  
Maybe she don't care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just ain't there  
You're dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore  
We are the same with no similarity, talk at the same time  
We believe in freedom and charity as long as I get mine  
The ivory Madonna is walking through the door  
You watch her from a window, it doesn't matter anymore  
Movin' on forever  
Maybe she don't care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just ain't there  
You're dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore  
Movin' on forever  
Maybe she don't care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just ain't there  
You're dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore  
Dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore
