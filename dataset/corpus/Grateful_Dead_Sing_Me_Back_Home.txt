The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom  
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest  
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell  
Let my guitar playin' friend fill my request  
Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come
alive.  
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me home before I die.  
I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street  
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs  
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang  
Can I hear it before you travel on.  
Sing me back home a song I used to hear. Make my old memories come alive.  
Sing me away and turn back the year. Sing me back home before I die
