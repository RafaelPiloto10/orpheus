(Hoo, hoo, hoo) Mmm (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Growing up wasn't easy for Annie Mae  
(Hoo, hoo, hoo)  
A little girl in a great big world  
Annie Mae (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
No one knew about her past  
Some people swore she'd never last  
She was (growing up much too fast)  
Growing (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Just a little too fast (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Never had her a Mamma, no, no  
Annie Mae (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Rarely heard a kind spoken word  
Annie Mae (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Looking at life through an empty shell  
And all the time she's catching hell  
She was growing  
(Growing up much too fast) up much too fast  
Does anybody know where is Annie Mae today  
Where oh where is Annie Mae  
All you got to do is look into the faces of  
All the young girls  
On the avenue (young girls!)  
Oh, well, (hoo, hoo, hoo) ha  
In the night hear her cry, Annie Mae (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Hurt and pain keeps coming again  
And again, and again, Annie Mae (hoo, hoo, hoo)  
Trippin' and runnin' is blowin' her mind  
Tryin' to decide if she'll make it this time  
She was (growing up) oh, yeah (much too fast)  
She was (growing up much too fast)  
Somebody got to stop her, oh Annie, Annie  
(Ooh) (hoo, hoo, hoo) (where is Annie Mae)  
Annie, Annie  
Somebody  
(Ooh) (hoo, hoo, hoo) (where is Annie Mae)  
Got to stop her, oh, Annie, Annie,  
(Ooh) (hoo, hoo, hoo) (where is Annie Mae)  
Annie, Annie  
She's runnin', she's runnin'  
Growin' up too fast, oh, oh  
(She's running') oh, oh  
Growin' up too fast, oh, oh  
(She's runnin') oh, oh  
Growin' up too fast, oh, hey  
(She's runnin') Annie, Annie Mae, yeah  
(She's running) Where you goin' Annie  
(She's runnin') Don't you think somebody aught to stop you  
(She's runnin') Somebody aught to stop you  
(She's runnin') Don't you think I'm gonna try to stop you
