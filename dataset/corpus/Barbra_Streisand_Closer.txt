As close as the sea is to the seashore  
Tide still rises twice a day  
That's just the ocean's way of getting  
Closer, closer.  
  
As close as today is to tomorrow  
At midnight they can finally touch  
'Cause every minute brings them that much closer  
Closer  
  
So on this silent night  
I call your name  
And suddenly all time and space disappears  
I see your face in firelight  
  
I hold you close in memory  
And even though you're gone  
I know you're here  
As close as the glow is to the ember  
  
You've always been a part of me  
Now living in my heart you're even closer  
Closer.  
I see your face in firelight  
  
I hold you close in memory  
And even though I know you're gone  
I know you're here....  
As sure as there's snowfall in December  
  
Your love lives in everything  
Summer Winter Fall or Spring  
Every thought of you will bring us closer  
The distance may be large or small  
  
Someday I pray that we may all be  
Closer...  
Closer.
