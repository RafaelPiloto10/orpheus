Funny  
Did you hear that?  
Funny  
Yeah, the guy said  
  
"Honey, you're a funny girl."  
That's me  
I just keep them in stitches  
Doubled in half,  
  
And though I may be all wrong for a guy,  
I'm good for a laugh,  
I guess it's not funny,  
Life is far from sunny,  
  
When the laugh is over  
And the joke's on you,  
A girl ought a have a sense of humor  
That's one thing you really need for sure  
  
When you're a funny girl  
The fella said "A funny girl"  
Funny  
How it ain't so funny,  
Funny girl
