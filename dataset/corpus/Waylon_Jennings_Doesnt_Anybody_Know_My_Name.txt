I've been away for so long fought a war that's come and gone  
Doesn't anybody know my name  
My sister upped and wed mom was sick and took to bed  
And my old dog Red's gone lame  
Please tell me if you can what time the trains roll in  
(Two ten six eighteen) ten forty four  
This old house is falling down there ain't no need in me for hanging round  
Doesn't anybody know my name  
The girl I left behind she's gone with this friend of mine  
I don't have to see a sign to know things ain't the same  
Please tell me if you can...  
You can't get far away on just a soldier's pay doesn't anybody know my name  
Used to be when I could see everybody wanted me  
Guess nobody cares to see a blind man catch a train  
Please tell me if you can...
