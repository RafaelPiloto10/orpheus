Born with the moon in Cancer  
Choose her a name she will answer to  
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her  
Call her green for the children who've made her  
Little green, be a gypsy dancer  
  
He went to California  
Hearing that everything's warmer there  
So you write him a letter and say, "Her eyes are blue."  
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you  
Little green, he's a non-conformer  
  
Just a little green  
Like the color when the spring is born  
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow  
Just a little green  
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform  
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes  
And sometimes there'll be sorrow  
  
Child with a child pretending  
Weary of lies you are sending home  
So you sign all the papers in the family name  
You're sad and you're sorry, but you're not ashamed  
Little green, have a happy ending  
  
Just a little green  
Like the color when the spring is born  
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow  
Just a little green  
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform  
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes  
And sometimes there'll be sorrow
