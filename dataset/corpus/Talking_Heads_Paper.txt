Hold the paper up to the light  
(some rays pass right through)  
Expose yourself out there for a minute  
(some rays pass right through)  
  
Take a little rest when the rays pass through  
Take a little time off when the rays pass through  
  
Go ahead and mess it up...Go ahead and tie it up  
In a long distance telephone call  
  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on because it's been taken care of  
Hold on to that paper  
  
See if you can fit it on the paper  
See if you can get it on the paper  
See if you can fit it on the paper  
See if you can get it on the paper  
  
Had a love affair but it was only paper  
(some rays they pass right through)  
Had a lot of fun, could have been a lot better  
(some rays they pass right through)  
  
Take a little consideration, take every combination  
Take a few weeks off, make it tighter, tighter  
But it was never, it was never written down  
Still might be a chance that it might work out (if you)  
  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on because it'll be taken care of  
Hold on to that paper  
  
Don't think I can fit it on the paper  
Don't think I can get it on the paper  
Go ahead and rip up, rip up the paper  
Go ahead and tear up, tear up the paper
