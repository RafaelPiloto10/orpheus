[Verse 1]  
We were weavers highly skilled  
To things were mechanised  
Craft and artisanship killed  
A threat to all our lives.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Machines meant the workforce shrunk.  
You think you'd see us settle  
When bosses said 'Lets junk each punk  
And replace you... With heavy metal  
  
[Chorus]  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
The working man was sacrificed  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Turned us in to anar-chists  
  
[Verse 3]  
Industrial reolution  
Our old life over thrown  
So we came up with a solution  
A revolution of our own  
  
[Verse 4]  
Met in the hills and planned to smash  
Their weaving machines of gloom  
Hear that sweet music as we bash  
A wop bam a loom ahh A wop bam boom  
  
[Chorus]  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Industrial weaving it's a stitch up  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Break the device and smash my swtich up  
  
[Verse 5]  
We named our movement after ned ludd  
A folk hero who myth proclaimed  
Once reacted in a fit of rage  
By smashing up some knitting frames  
  
[Verse 6]  
So we formed the new luddite army  
Started to riot  
It all went barmy  
  
[Verse 7]  
Laws were passed to shake our wills  
Sent solders armed with guns  
All though we tried to break things still  
We fought the law but the law won  
  
[Verse 8]  
Trial and punisments were seen  
It's clear we lost the fight  
But thanks to our rage against the machine  
Now carries the name  
Ludd-ite  
  
[Chorus]  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
This band struggles carries on  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Wont rest to machines are all gone  
  
[Outro]  
Solo  
On what exactly?
