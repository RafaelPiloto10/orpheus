Why should I bend down my head and cry?  
Why should I bend down my head and cry?  
The old world has ended,  
The new world has just begun.  
And all them people that live therein  
Shall live on and on.  
One more thing:  
Got to get what I need,  
Got to get what I want.  
Got to get what I need,  
Got to get what I want.  
Got to get satisfaction,  
Got to get the action.  
Got love and affection.  
One more thing:  
Once there was two roads before us  
To pick our choice.  
But good has overcome bad.  
The sheep has heard their master's voice.  
So tell me why.  
Why should I bend down my head and cry?  
No reason why.  
Why should I bend down my head and cry?  
(Got to move) Got to groove.  
Got to get what I want.  
What did you say?  
Got to get it.  
Got to get what I need.  
Got to get what I want.  
Like I say, got to get it.  
Got to get what I need... Satisfaction.  
The old world has ended,  
The new world has just begun.  
And all them people that live therein  
Shall live on and on.  
One more thing:  
Why should I bend down my head and cry?  
My father is a king.  
Why should I bend down my head and cry?  
All the riches in the earth.  
So tell me why,  
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
