She is everywhere I am  
Yeah when I don't want her to be there  
I kinda want to leave in a hurry  
She's walking on the city  
Heavy in her monster boots  
I hear her calling my name  
  
I hide behind the people that I want to be  
I hear her calling my name  
I can see the future when she tells me how it's going to be  
She is perpetual Kathy  
All shake and happy in her brand new skin  
She is perpetual Kathy  
She is always the same  
  
She is everything that I'm not  
Strong and happy with the sound of the rhythm inside  
I do not want to be a broken record,  
But I don't want to live in the shadow of a twelve-step  
  
I hear her calling my name  
Next thing you know I think I'll want to be a better man  
I hear her calling my name  
Yeah, I used to be a devil but they never seemed to give a damn
