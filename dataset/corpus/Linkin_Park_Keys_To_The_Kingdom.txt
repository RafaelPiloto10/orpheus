No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
Its our Final war  
Tell me what's worth fighting for  
When we know there's nothing more  
Take the hand or fist  
Just to sell ourselves for this  
The path we least resist  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
[Verse 2 - Mike]  
Uh, I give you what you came for  
This is not the same though  
Got a different method  
But I still can bring the pace so  
Not all give the same though  
I got down the same flow  
I ain't shock and get you  
Never really in my range, though  
Somehow they ain't grow. High five, bango  
All pride childs. Mama let the bass bang though  
All you fucking lames go  
Yelling out the names though  
Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for  
(Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for)  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
I'm my own casualty
