I went away for a whole lot of days  
And stripped the soul right outlaw me  
Lead away in a crimson haze  
The red was rain over me  
  
There ain't no way outta here  
I try to scream, I can't even speak  
Why am I the only one  
I can't get out and I can't go on  
There ain't no way out of here  
Forever red and I'm never free  
Climb the wall, I can't hold on I can't go back and I can't go on  
  
There were faces in the dark and  
In me I could not see  
The mirror cracked in a million pieces  
And so did I cause Johnny's me  
  
I'll fade forever black away  
I'll give all my tomorrows for just one good today  
I'm numb to feel, don't know what's real  
The ghost is killing me
