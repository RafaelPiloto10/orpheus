Ooh! Dark meditation,  
Your second sight can show my light  
In a crystal ball.  
Sweet are the days, intoxication  
Crow-black the nights caging my mind  
Behind the wall.  
  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Into the rock to find the cream  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Pictured life from yesterday.  
  
Ooh! Dark meditation,  
Deep down inside a stream of light  
Begins to flow.  
Sweet are the days, intoxication  
Crow-black the nights caging my mind  
Behind the wall.  
  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Into the rock to find the cream  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Pictured life from yesterday.  
  
Pictured life, pictured life  
Pictured life from yesterday
