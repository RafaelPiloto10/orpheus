The meeting of the waters makes a sound  
In her eyes, you sit around in your room  
The meeting of the waters raises towns  
Baptized in every drop we found  
  
They can seize us as we are now  
Singin, dancin, in the small town  
Celebrate the days into the night  
Look at me with wild eyes  
  
Leave at home your attitude  
Don't forget to write  
Some things are better left unsaid  
  
Meeting of the waters makes a sound  
In her eyes, you set aground in your room  
Meeting of the waters, raised these towns  
Baptized in every drop we found  
  
They can see us as we are now  
Singin', dancin' in the small town  
Celebrate the days into the night  
Look around with wildest eyes  
  
Leave at home your attitude  
Let's forget the fight  
Some things are better left unsaid  
  
Don't forget to feed the animals  
Lock up for the night  
You know how we both feel about long goodbyes
