Up in the shadows where the skeletons hide  
We all live in fear of the door and what's behind  
A door you dare not open, 'cause what you'll find  
A close encounter of the sexual kind  
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Batten down, baby, lock all doors  
You've got the love that I'm coming for  
Your hait's so straight, I can make it curl  
There's a little bit of bad in every good little girl  
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Is it really what you want,  
One more broken heart  
One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
When it happens, it'll be magical  
I'm not knocking, it here's to the magic  
When it happens, it'll be magical  
I'm not knocking it, here's to the magic  
  
Pull up the blankets, you won't hear a sound  
The pounding's like thunder when it shakes the ground  
You got a hunger only I can feed  
You try to fight it off but you're in too deep  
Love in the shadows, love in the shadows, like a smoking gun  
  
Is it really what you want,  
One more broken heart  
One more lost and lonely  
Is it really what you need,  
Another broken heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Heat, flame, embers- it can be magical  
Heat, flame, embers- smoking, smoking  
[Repeats 2x]  
  
Fire keeps burning up,  
Fire keeps burning
