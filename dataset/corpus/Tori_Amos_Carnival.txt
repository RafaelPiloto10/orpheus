I sing to the sun in the sky  
I sing to the sun raised high  
  
Carnival dancer, magical time of youth  
And as the day draws nigh  
Dreams fill my heart  
I'll sing while he raises guitar  
I'll sing as the night wakes the dawn  
Will love come my way on this magical day?  
And will hope stay in my heart?  
  
Carnival dancer, magical time of youth  
And as the day draws nigh  
Dreams fill my heart and  
Sing while he raises guitar  
I'll sing my dream from afar  
Will love come my way on this magical day?  
And will hope stay in my heart?  
Will true love come my way on this magical day?  
Overlook, oh my love  
In my  
  
Stay (oh, dear)  
Stay (oh, dear)  
Stay  
In my  
You  
You  
(stay again)  
The way you're walking and walk, the way you can  
The way you're telling me you're not a danger  
This man, I said again, I say again  
I'm not too kind [to the] moon  
Telling me, well I watch you  
Kin to you  
You
