Here I am, there you are  
If you ask me to walk a thousand miles  
Just to be where you are  
I can't say no if you ask me  
If I had a dime, it's yours as well as mine  
I'd keep the penny, you know I would  
And gladly give you the nine  
I can't say no if you ask me  
If you told me tonight to get up  
Pack my bags, let's go away  
I wouldn't even care what my mommy  
What my daddy might have to say  
'Cause I can't say no if you ask me  
No, you're too beautiful to be, to be  
No, you mean everything to me  
No, and that's why I, that's why I, that's why I  
I can't say no if you ask me  
Sometimes I get so angry with him  
I walk around and I pout all day  
And then he kisses me and asks me, do I love him  
In a sweet, soft, sexy kind of way  
I can't say no if he asks me  
Ooh, no, I can't say no if he asks me  
I can't say no if you ask me  
I can't say no if you ask me  
I can't say no if you ask me  
...
