When you hear this sound a-comin'  
Hear the drummer drumming  
Won't you join together with the band  
We don't move in any 'ticular direction  
And we don't make no collections  
Won't you join together with the band.  
  
Do you really think I care  
What you eat or what you wear  
Won't you join together with the band  
There's a million ways to laugh  
Ev'ry one's a path  
Won't you join together with the band.  
  
Everybody join together  
Won't you join together  
Come on and join together with the band  
We need to join together  
Won't you join together  
Come on and join together with the band.  
  
You don't have to play  
You can follow or lead the way  
Won't you join together with the band  
We don't know where we're going  
But the season's right for knowing  
Won't you join together with the band.  
  
It's the singer not the song  
That makes the music move along  
Won't you join together with the band  
This is the biggest band you'll find  
It's as deep as it is wide  
Won't you join together with the band.  
  
Ev'rybody join together  
Won't you join together  
Come on and join together with the band  
We need to join together  
Won't you join together  
Come on and join together with the band.
