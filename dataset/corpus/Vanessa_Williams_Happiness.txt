I don't believe what I'm hearin'  
You can't impress me by what you show me  
Don't think I'm goin' through changes  
Or you might see me change for the last time  
  
Having a bad day  
Better deal with it  
If you're playin' games  
No time for it  
If you're bringin' pain  
Gonna run from it  
Don't mess up my day  
  
I'm the only one who's responsible  
For me havin' fun  
And you can't take my  
  
[Chorus:]  
Happiness is what my life's about  
Happiness no I can't do without  
Happiness nothing can stop me now  
Through ups and downs I'm still happy  
  
Life is good as I make it  
I can't sit while you make it for me  
I like those jewels you gave me  
But I want to buy some jewels for myself  
To lose the ball and chain  
Gotta reach for it  
To realize my dreams  
Gotta reach for it  
Nothin' comes for free  
Gotta reach for it  
No I'm not gonna have to depend on you  
  
I'm the only one  
Who's responsible  
For me havin' fun  
And you can't my  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the only one  
Who's responsible  
For me havin' fun  
And you can't my  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Happiness  
Happiness
