I was born on the bayou thirty miles of Lafayette's  
My daddy was a Cajun man, Lord he thought us how to plow  
I remember Mama's breakfast cush cush and a kaye  
Being served on a banyee Lord, I wish I had some now  
I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred  
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead  
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou  
We went to church every Sunday we had a French speaking preacher man  
Joked about the preacher man 'cause we thought he wore a dress, yes  
After church we had a party we played the music on the phonograph  
We had a man singing Jole Blon oh made a sinner out of me  
I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred  
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead  
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou  
When I'm ready to be married going to be this Cajun lady  
Someone sort of like my Mama  
'Cause I ain't know other kind, don't know other kind  
Wherever fortune takes me, if it makes me or it breaks me  
It's memories will forsake me, Louisiana on my mind  
I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred  
And when I die I'm a Cajun dead  
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou  
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find it's way back to the bayou
