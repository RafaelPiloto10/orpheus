I'm gettin' heavy on your love  
Every night  
Gettin' ready for your love  
With all of my might  
I was crazy for your love  
Never stayed around you love  
Aw but you make me deadly  
  
I was lost but now I've found  
Havin' you around has made me heavy,  
Heavy on your love.  
  
Heavy on your love,  
Old enough to wait  
Got a letter full of love  
And it's just about to break  
Cause my love was never real  
I could touch but never feel  
Ah, but you make me deadly  
  
I was lost but now I've found  
Havin' you around has made me heavy,  
Heavy on your love
