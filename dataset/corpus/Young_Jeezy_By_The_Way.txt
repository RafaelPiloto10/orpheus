Yeah  
Just call me young nigga  
Our money grown doe  
By the way  
Lets go yeah  
You already know what time it is lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
I said I'm young by the way  
The one by the way  
I ain't trippin'  
I just do this shit for fun by the way  
The truth by the way  
The proof by the way  
Mr. front up on me  
Know I'm gonna shoot by the way  
I said it's on by the way  
I'm in the zone by the way  
And You can call me  
Mr. get em gone by the way  
I did it by the way  
I was with it by the way  
I talk it like I did it  
Cause I lived it by the way  
  
[Verse 1]  
Young, the boy might go nuts  
Holes in niggas just like donuts  
Creme be crispy these niggas cant hear me  
Must be the wrong size  
Cause these niggas cant fit me  
Never let em play me  
Never let em bullshit me  
If they ever bullshit me  
Send the coroner to get me  
And when the coroner come to get me  
I'ma take you pussy's with me  
And I ain't trustin' 12 shots  
No I keep them choppers with me  
And I don't trust you from a ??  
Gotta keep them shottas with me  
Cant let the goons get bored  
Gotta keep them niggas busy  
And I ain't trustin' nobody  
So I took my money with  
Cause last time they got me, get me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Stay on it by the way  
I want it by the way  
Take it to your mommas momma house  
Where everybody stay  
Where everybody sleep  
Leave everybody sleep  
Have a baby by who  
Thats everybody freak  
Baby like a dry cleaner  
Seen everybody's sheets  
Take em straight to the hood  
Then everybody eat  
They went down, I went down  
Now everybody cheap  
Or should I say cheaper  
Or maybe ever lower  
You niggas gettin' this shit  
Should I talk any slower  
Any slower it be screwed  
And that would be rude  
I'm a man no respect  
And Plus I got a sack  
Got the west side crackin'  
Ask about 'em in the trap  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Turned a brick into a clothing line a boost commercial  
And he's still talkin' yo "so who's commercial?"  
Young like Noah move them birds by the two  
Daddy need to smoke the coupe need a pair of shoes  
Got my A.R. on 'em still wont cross over  
I gotta half a box left think I need more soda  
Still rain man sosa,  
Just brought this thing in its too big for a holster  
They say I'm bipolar, so indecisive  
So motherfucking what, I know some bitches that like it  
The real niggas recite it, the real bitches they love it  
Its just he way that I strut it, they just like I want 'em so fuck it  
  
[Chorus]
