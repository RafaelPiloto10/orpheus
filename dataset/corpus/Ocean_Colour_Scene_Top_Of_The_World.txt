For all of her diction, her self medication  
She fell down and dented her nose  
And laughed at the coroners  
Desperately warning her  
Watch now the way that it goes  
And she knows  
  
She's living at the top of the world  
In need of salvation she spoke to her mother  
Who died in the service of king  
What is the meaning of wallflowers receiving a glance  
It would mean everything  
And she thinks  
  
She's living at the top of the world  
Three minutes later she looked in the mirror  
And cracked half a smile at her toes  
And she knows, she knows  
  
She's living at the top of the world
