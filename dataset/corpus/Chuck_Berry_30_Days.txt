I done talked to the judge in private early this morning  
And he took me to the sheriff's office to sign a warning (warrant?)  
Gonna put a false charge again ya (against ya)  
That'll be the very thing that'll send ya  
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days

If I don't get no satisfaction from the judge  
I'm gonna take it to the FBI and voice my grudge  
If they don't give me no consolation  
I'm gonna take it to the United Nations  
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days  
Oh Thirty Days! (thirty days)
