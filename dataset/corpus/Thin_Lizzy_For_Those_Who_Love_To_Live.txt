Up jumped Jack on the railroad track  
Said "I've got to get out of town"  
"It's been really nice knowing you"  
"Hope to see you around"  
  
Oh the boy he could boogie  
Oh the boy can kick a ball  
But the boy he got hung up  
Smooching in the stalls  
  
You've got to give a little love  
To those who love to live  
You've got to take a little hate  
From those who have to wait  
  
Up jumped John putting his trousers on  
Saying "I've got to get out of here"  
"Hear your lover's footsteps"  
"They're coming to near for me my dear"  
  
Oh the boy he could boogie  
Oh the boy can kick a ball  
But the boy he got hung up  
Making love against the wall  
  
You've got to give a little love  
To those who love to live  
You've got to take a little hate  
From those who have to wait
