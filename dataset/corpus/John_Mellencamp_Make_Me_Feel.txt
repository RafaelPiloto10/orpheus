This ain't no make believe  
I ain't foolin around this time  
You can believe what you want to believe  
It's a sin the way we've wasted our time  
  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Baby tear this pain from my heart  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Make me feel like I did in the start  
  
Maybe it's a change of plan  
Now that your dreams have left me behind  
Or is it another man  
Who didn't care that you were mine  
  
Baby this could be our last chance  
Now you're actin like it's no big deal  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Make me feel like I did in the start  
  
I can hear, I can hear, I can hear  
The radio playin' your favorite song  
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care  
I know that something had to go wrong  
  
Baby don't you walk away  
Stay here and listen to my plans  
You can leave, make it another day  
Stay tonight and hold me in your hands
