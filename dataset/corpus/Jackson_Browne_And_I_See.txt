Just like a leaf that's just been rained on  
Something of a cloud above, a soon-awaking sun  
And I see the day has just begun  
Feeling windblown, reeling  
I have grown out of my time  
  
And like a circle casting shadows  
Rolling over growing clover fields so far below  
And I see I've just begun to grow  
Climbing, spinning, rhyming  
I am pinning down my time  
  
And like a river flowing seaward  
Bounding down, surrounding things that have puzzled me before  
And I see the ever-open door  
Flirting pure love, certainly  
I'm sure of what I know  
  
Just like a leaf that's just been rained on  
Something of a cloud above, a soon-awaking sun  
And I see the day has just begun  
Feeling windblown, reeling  
I have grown out of my time
