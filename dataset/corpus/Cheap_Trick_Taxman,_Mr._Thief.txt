You work hard, you make money  
There ain't no on in the world who can stop you  
You work hard, you went hungry  
Now the Taxman is out to get you  
  
You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
Break your back sweat a lot  
Well, it's just not fair  
  
He hates you, he loves money  
And he'll steal your shit and think that it's funny  
Like the Beatles he ain't human  
Now the Taxman is out to get you  
  
You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
You played  
And you played and played for years  
  
Taxman, Mr. heath (he's a thief)  
He's looking for run-in, yeah  
Taxman, mr. heath (he's a thief)
