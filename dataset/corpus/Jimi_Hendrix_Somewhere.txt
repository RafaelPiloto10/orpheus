Oh uh  
I see fingers, hands and shades of faces  
Reachin' up and not quite touchin' the promised land  
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper sayin'  
Oh, Lord, please give us a helpin' hand  
Yeah yeah  
  
Way down in the background  
I can see frustrated souls of cities burnin'  
And all across the water, baby  
I see weapons barkin' out the sting of death  
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs jumpin' themselves  
Laughin' they sayin'  
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess  
  
Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink  
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor  
But as far as I know, they may even try  
To wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me  
Brother sell me, and don't worry about lookin' at the score  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
