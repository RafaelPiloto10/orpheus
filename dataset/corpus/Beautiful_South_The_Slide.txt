When you're too old for the swings  
You tend to choose the slide  
And they never seem to warn you  
The slide's your final ride  
And when you're at the top of it  
And you cannot see the end  
Either don't let go son - Or grab the nearest friend  
The slide is no respecter of dignity or class  
As soon as you sit down on it  
That slide has got your ass  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A broken soul at the bottom lies denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
  
When the slide was invented  
A thousand drinkers sighed  
They thought they had the copyright  
On the very word the slide  
It's a picture of innocence  
On which the innocent have fried  
Take the helter skelter son  
It's easier than the slide  
Advice to listening parents  
Or the father of the bride  
Let them marry anyone  
But don't let her take the slide  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A broken soul at the bottom lies denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
  
It'll take you much much lower  
Than you ever would have asked  
'Cause as soon as you sit down on it  
The slide has got your ass - It's customers are fools  
And every one of them deceased  
The long and silver murderer  
The devil must have greased  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A pile of broken souls at the bottom it denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A broken soul at the bottom it denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide
