Oh, hello and goodbye  
So fast it's gone  
I can't get your face from my mind  
Can't get your eyes from my  
Can't stop your voices  
On that day you told me directions to  
Where I don't know now  
It all flew by me  
So all I can do is hope that you  
Come my way  
Oh and you're nowhere near me  
That you'll be there and hope that  
With luck, I'll see you again  
  
Oh I didn't get your name  
Nor you mine  
Or the time of day  
But you're stuck on me like a fly on a table  
Oh I'm waiting here where we stood for just a moment  
And you stole my way  
And I, and I wonder will I see you again  
And way, way  
Without the smile, the smile that blows away  
The wait is too long  
I want this thing to go on  
And there's no way that I might find you again  
I must walk a way  
  
I'm all released by time  
Bump into each other  
It seems so right  
And say hey aren't you the  
Weren't you the  
Don't you think  
But I don't think it's going to happen today  
I fear you'll remain a dream  
Rain, rain on me, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Your life is burned  
Your life burned into me  
It did it  
Will I ever
