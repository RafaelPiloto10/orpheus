Each day through my window  
I watch her as she passes by  
I say to myself  
You're such a lucky guy  
To have a girl like her  
Is truly a dream come true  
Out of all the fellas in the world  
She belongs to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me-once again  
Seems it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me  
  
Soon we'll be married  
And raise a family, oh yeah  
Have a cozy little house out in the country  
With two children maybe three  
I tell you I can visualize it all  
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me-once again  
Seems it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me  
  
Every night on my knees I pray  
Dear Lord hear my plea  
Don't ever let another take her place with me  
For I would surely die  
Her love is heavenly  
When her arms enfold me I hear a tender rhapsody  
But in reality, she doesn't even know me  
'Cause it was  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me-once again  
Seems it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me
