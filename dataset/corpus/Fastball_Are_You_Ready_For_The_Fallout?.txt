I was wondering how you're feeling  
I thought I saw you kneeling  
And holding your gut last night  
It looked like you were praying  
But I heard someone saying  
You had been in an awful fight  
You get the worst of it everytime  
Lashing out with no reason or rhyme  
To lose all this rage, at so tender an age  
Little baby growing up in a rat cage  
  
Are you ready for the fallout?  
Who you gonna call out?  
When does it finally come to blows?  
I think that you're forgetting  
The blood that you'll be letting  
Has a price on it, no one knows it  
You may be suffering in your sleep  
You may be getting in too deep  
And you may not care for advice that I share  
If you want it then I'll be there  
  
Soon you will learn how to swallow a tear  
So when you're old you can cry in your beer  
Do you spit at the face staring back in the mirror?  
Do you have any self respect?  
  
Soon you will learn how to swallow a tear  
So when you're old you can cry in your beer  
Do you spit at the face staring back in the mirror?  
Do you have any self respect?  
  
Well what the hell did you expect?  
  
Are you ready for the fallout?  
Who you gonna call out?  
When does it finally come to blows?  
I think that you're forgetting  
The blood that you'll be letting  
Has a price on it, no one knows it  
You may be suffering in your sleep  
You may be getting in too deep  
And you may not care for advice that I share  
If you want it then I'll be there  
  
Are you ready for the fallout?  
Who you gonna call out?
