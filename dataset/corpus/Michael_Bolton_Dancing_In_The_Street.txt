Calling out around the world  
Are you ready for a brand new beat  
Summer's near and the time is right  
For dancing in the streets  
All over the world  
  
Chorus  
All we need is music, sweet music  
There'll be music everywhere  
Swinging, swaying, records playing  
Dancing in the streets  
  
It doesn't matter what you wear  
Just as long as you are there  
Come on, every guy, grab a girl  
Everywhere, around the world  
Dancing, dancing in the streets, yeah  
  
This is an invitation, across the nation  
A chance for the folks to meet  
Laughing, singing, records swinging  
Dancing in the streets  
They're doing it in Chicago  
Down in New Orleans  
Don't forget New York City  
  
Chorus  
It doesn't matter what you wear  
Just as long as you are there  
So come on, every guy, grab a girl  
Everywhere, around the world  
Dancing, dancing in the streets  
  
This is an invitation, across the nation  
A chance for the folks to meet  
Summer's near and the time is right  
For dancing in the streets  
  
It doesn't matter what you wear  
As long as you are there  
Come on, every guy, grab a girl  
Everywhere, around the world  
  
Dancing in the streets  
Philadelphia, Pa.  
Baltimore in dc  
Don't forget New York City  
All over the world  
Dancing in the streets
