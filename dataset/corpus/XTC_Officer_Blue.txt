Officer Blue  
Really love the things you do  
Even when I was just eight years old (eight years old)  
Officer Blue  
Is it true what they say?  
That when you work you're still at play (still at play)  
Oh Officer Blue  
I really love the things you do  
It's magical  
People in a human zoo  
Officer Blue  
Cast a shadow on the wall  
But by torchlight even mice look tall (they don't fall)  
Officer Blue  
In a blaze of human form  
And your stripes and badges to conform (you conform)  
Officer Blue  
Really love the things you do  
Even when I was just eight years old (eight years old)  
Officer Blue  
Is it true what they say?  
That when you work you're still at play (still you play)
