Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Where's the air?  
Where's the air?  
Where's the, where's the, where's the air?  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz  
Sealed away from my scents  
I'd have the music high going ninety five  
Too much too much too much too much  
  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Don't you care?  
Don't you care?  
Don't you, don't you, don't you care?  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I wasn't just a pedestrian  
Breathing all this in  
I look up at that grey sky  
It makes me want to (oh)  
Too much too much too much  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear.
