I've got to do something  
About this loathsome  
State I'm in  
  
Dis con nec ted.  
Dis con nec ted.  
Dis con nec ted.  
  
Everywhere, I see decay.  
Mechanized and sterilized  
Visions in replay.  
I must release my rage.  
  
Oh  
Dis con nect ted.  
I'm  
Dis con nec ted.  
Feeling so  
Dis con nec ted.  
Down  
  
Maybe all I need  
Besides my pills  
And the surgery  
Is a new metaphor for reality.  
  
I'm  
Dis con nec ted.  
Feeling so  
Dis con nec ted.  
Oh  
Dis con nec ted.  
You know.
