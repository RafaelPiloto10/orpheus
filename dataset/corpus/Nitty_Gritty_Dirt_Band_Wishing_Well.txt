Wishing well, wish me well  
On a dream bought with a penny  
Wishing well, time will tell  
I can see that there are so many  
Lonely faces stare from your pool  
And I can't bear to see a fool tonight  
So make it right wishing well  
Wishing well, could you tell, as I stood beside her  
Did you know she would go  
Then why did you hide it  
If you knew then I'd be without her now  
You could have let me know somehow  
Can't wish and tell, wishing well  
Wishing well, cast a spell, send her love's sweet emotion  
Do your part, touch her heart with truest devotion  
If there's a chance, I won't believe we're through  
Show me wishes still come true  
It's up to you, wishing well  
Show me wishes still come true,  
It's up to you, wishing well  
Its up to you, wishing well  
It's up to you, wishing well
