Lover please please come back don't take a train comin' down the track  
Don't please don't please don't leave me don't leave me in misery  
You would never hold me near you would never call me dear  
Don't you know I'd die for you now you're gone that's what I'll do  
Lover please please come back...  
[ guitar ]  
Old love story not too long about a love that went all wrong  
Girl left the boy boy went bad now he's gone she's so sad  
Lover please please come back...  
Lover please please come back...  
[ guitar ]  
Lover please please come back...
