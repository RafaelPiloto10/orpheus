You kiss me awake in the mornin'  
Now what a way to start the day  
With love notes that you leave me  
Written in your own special way  
  
You call me up for nothin'  
I hear your voice on the line  
We start talkin' 'bout lovin'  
You get to me everytime  
  
It's those little things you do that make me love you so  
Little things that only you and I could ever know  
You don't have to lay the whole wide world here at my feel, oh no  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me  
  
Lyin' in the bed beside you  
Touchin' in the middle of the night  
No you don't have to do any talkin'  
To tell me everything is all right  
  
It's those little things you do that make me love you so  
Little things that only you and I will ever know  
You don't have to lay the whole wide world here at my feel, oh no  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me  
  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me
