You really in Beverly hills  
And so Drama beats.  
  
Damn rich, peanut butter guts and a Lamorghini, whoa  
You must have white brea, lets make a sandwich  
Now, I ain't never seen money you got  
Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks  
So if you take me up show me the Balcony look over  
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop  
Pop stars like you, you need a dude like me  
To appreciate your wealth  
I know you got an elevator in your house  
But with me you appreciate the steps  
Act like you don't wanna see how much it is Jack Daniels you can handle  
You can drink and get cut like Rambo  
Let me drive your Daddy's Lambo  
  
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion  
Let me see Hollywood for real  
Lights, camera, action  
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel  
One thing I gotta know  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
  
Your young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace  
Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink  
Wanna go get breakfast  
Though you ain't never been to waffle house  
Always hanging in guys and dolls  
If you came to the shop, I'll put you in a Chevy AM  
Reach out to the mall  
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and DTA hoody  
But I'm off to the party with rogue status looking for Beverly Hills goody's  
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy  
Got more bounce than a salama boy  
Meet a rich girl I can't need a headache  
But I can take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy  
  
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion  
Let me see hollywood for real  
Lights, camera, action  
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel  
One thing I gotta know  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
  
What you got in that toe bag  
That one of a kind Prada  
That beautiful behind inspires me  
Makes one of my rhymes harder  
Your dadda made a fine daughter  
Make me wanna turn this wine from water  
Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping cause Drummer made a beat
that'll climb the chart  
Money, money, money, money, money ain't it funny what a hunny and a
Lambourghini will do  
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill and drill a dick anytime, unhappy
with a 24 inch shoes  
But come and explore this dude  
Analyse my swing  
It's slick rick and Bobby baby  
Gotta let me drop that thing, come on  
  
Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion  
Let me see Hollywood for real  
Lights, camera, action  
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel  
One thing I gotta know  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Your Daddy's Lambo?  
Lambo-o-oh  
Lambo-o-oh  
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?  
  
Just whip it around you know  
Up the hills  
I ain't gon' wreck it, I promise
