Change in the light  
Change with the light - turn turn turn around  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Smile on my face like Dr. Jekil and Mr. Hide  
I am changing, I changed with the light  
I've been away, running from reality  
Who am I, am I an actor in this game?  
  
Change with the light  
Turn turn turn around, be my baby  
Stay for the night  
Do it right, feel my vibrations  
I'll be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk, be mine, never stop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Morning has come as the sun catches my face  
I Realize that I'm alone with myself  
Yesterday all was dark, I was dancing on the floor  
In this light I am complete another me  
  
Change with the light  
Turn turn turn around, be my baby  
Stay for the night  
Do it right, feel my vibrations  
I'll be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk, be mine, never stop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Rocking to the beat while you're shaking my mind  
Change your mind ? 'cause you are are mine  
Excited by your beauty, makes me pull up a blind  
Hypnotized ? it's up my mind  
  
All the voices, I can't resist my inside  
All the choices that the daylight brings  
Like a diamond, sparkling and shining  
All the hours  
  
Stop, don't stop the music  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Oho, change with the light  
Turn turn turn around, be my baby  
Stay for the night, do it right (feel my vibrations)  
I'll be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk, be my never-stop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Change with the light  
Turn turn turn around, be my baby  
Stay for the night, do it right (feel my vibrations)  
I'll be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk, be my never-stop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light, change in the light  
  
Change with the light  
Tell me what the daylight brings  
Stay for the night  
Do it right (change with the light)  
Oh change with the light  
Feel my body talk, be my never-stop  
Shake it right in the night (change with the light)  
  
Change with the light  
Tell me what the daylight brings  
Stay for the night
