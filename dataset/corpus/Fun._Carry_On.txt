Well I woke to the sound of silence the cries  
Were cutting like knives in a fist fight  
And I found you with a bottle of wine  
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July  
  
You swore and said we are not  
We are not shining stars  
This I know  
I never said we are  
  
Though I've never been through hell like that  
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back  
  
If you're lost and alone  
Or you're sinking like a stone  
Carry on  
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground  
Carry on  
  
Carry on, carry on  
  
So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night  
At a bar off seventy five  
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die  
All our neighbors and wives  
  
But I like to think  
I can cheat it all  
To make up for the times, I've been cheated on  
And it's nice to know  
When I was left for dead  
I was found and now I don't roam these streets  
I am not the ghost you want of me  
  
If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone,  
Carry on  
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and  
Carry on  
  
Woah my head is on fire  
But my legs are fine  
After all they are mine  
Lay your clothes down on the floor  
Close the door  
Hold the phone  
Show me how  
No one's ever gonna stop us now  
  
'Cause we are  
We are shining stars  
We are invincible  
We are who we are  
On our darkest day  
When we're miles away  
So we'll come, we will find our way home  
  
If you're lost and alone  
Or you're sinking like a stone  
Carry on  
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and  
Carry on  
  
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)  
(No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop, no one's ever gonna stop us now)  
(No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop , no one's ever gonna stop)  
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
