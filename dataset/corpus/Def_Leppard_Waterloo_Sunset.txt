Dirty old river, must you keep rolling  
Flowin' into the night  
People so busy, making me dizzy  
Taxi light shines so bright  
But I don't need no friends  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset  
I am in paradise  
Every day I look at the world from my window  
But chilly, chilly is the evening time  
Waterloo sunset's fine  
Waterloo sunset's fine  
  
Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station  
Every Friday night  
But I am so lazy, I don't like to wander  
I stay at home at night  
But I don't feel afraid  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
