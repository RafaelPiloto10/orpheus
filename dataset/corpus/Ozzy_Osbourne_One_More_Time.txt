I just can't seem to get enough  
When I'm running good, you know,  
I don't slow down, even the times  
When I know I should go slow  
  
I know this won't ever be easy,  
I don't give up, so won't you get me  
  
Give me some more,  
I need it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I need it one more time  
  
Give me some more,  
I want it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I want it one more time  
  
You know I live for thunder,  
This is where I'm meant to be,  
And when I'm six feet under,  
Will you still be there for me?  
  
Right here, right now, let's have a party,  
We'll never stop, so won't you get me  
  
Give me some more,  
I need it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I need it one more time  
  
Give me some more,  
I want it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I want it one more time  
  
I never wanted to be more than who I am,  
I'm just a lucky son from an unlucky man,  
You'd get me more than anything I ever had  
  
Take away my faith,  
Take away my name,  
Give me one more, one more pain

Give me some more,  
I need it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I need it one more time  
  
Give me some more,  
I want it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I want it one more time  
  
Give me some more,  
I need it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I need it one more time  
  
Give me some more,  
I want it right now, get it now,  
Give me some more,  
I want it one more time
