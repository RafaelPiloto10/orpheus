I tried to feel your heartbeat, but I failed  
If I'd be more convincing you would stay  
But now it's time to stop the lies  
To go and walk away  
  
You tried to feel my heartbeat, but you failed  
If you'd be more convincing I would stay  
We left a while ago but now  
We can no longer fake  
  
We're moving empty boxes, what a waste  
We're moving empty thoughts, oh what a shame  
'Cause this is not a home for us, just sheer  
Waste of energy my dear  
  
We tried to feel a heartbeat, but we failed  
If we'd been more convincing we would stay  
This house is not a home for us  
Just sheer waste of energy  
My dear
