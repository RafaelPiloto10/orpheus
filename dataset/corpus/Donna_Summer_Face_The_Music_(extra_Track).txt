Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
You took my heart for a ride  
You tried to hurt cheat and lie  
But you'd better know  
That this walk down the road  
You're gonna face the music and dance oh  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
I gave you all I could give  
I tried to teach you how to live  
Baby but this time  
Please write down the line  
You're gonna face the music and dance oh  
You took good chance with my love  
You tread it down and beat it all  
But you'd better know  
This walk down the road  
You're gonna face the music and dance oh  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
Listen to me baby  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
Somewhere in the dark  
Corners of your heart  
You will know I'm gone  
Distant like a dream  
Just a memory  
Fading with the dawn  
Somewhere in the dark  
Corners of your heart  
You will feel I'm gone  
I'm gone  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance
