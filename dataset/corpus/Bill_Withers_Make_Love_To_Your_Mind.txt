I love the story in your love song  
Building them castles in your mind  
Come down here looking for a feeling  
Someday I know you're gonna find  
  
I wanna lay down there beside you  
But first we ought to take some time  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna feel good just like you do  
(Feel good) I haven't  
Loved in quite some time  
(Feel good) I had some  
Phases that I been through  
Where I've just loved and left behind  
  
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty  
I don't wanna be unkind  
But before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna make love to your mind  
I wanna make love to your mind  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
I wanna feel good just like you do  
I haven't loved in quite some time  
Lord, I had some funny phases  
That I been through, no, no  
Where I've just loved and left behind  
  
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty  
I don't really wanna be unkind  
But before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
(To your mind, to your mind)  
(To your mind, to your mind)  
(To your mind)  
  
I love the story in your love song  
Building them castles in your mind  
Come down here from somewhere  
Looking for a feeling  
Someday I know you're gonna find  
  
See, I wanna lay down there beside you  
But first we ought to take some time (time)  
Before I make love to your body  
I wanna make love to your mind  
  
To your mind  
(I wanna make love) to your mind  
To your mind  
(I wanna make love) to your mind  
(I wanna make love to your mind)...
