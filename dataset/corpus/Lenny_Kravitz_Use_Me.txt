My friends feel it's their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me  
Uh huh but my answer about all that use me stuff  
  
I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
You can keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
My brother sit me right down and he talked to me  
He told me that I ought to not let you just walk on me  
Well I'm sure that he meant well, yeah but when our talk was throught  
  
I said brother if you only knew you'd wish you were in my shoes  
You can keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
Sometimes it's true you really do abuse me  
Oh you get me in a crowd of high class people  
And you act real rude to me  
I said, oh baby, baby, baby, baby, when you love me I can't get enough  
  
I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
You can keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up
