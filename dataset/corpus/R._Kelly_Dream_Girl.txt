So amazing, unbelievable,  
Miraculous woman you are  
Incredible, unforgettable,  
You're the world's greatest by far  
Sensational, so lovable,  
My Cinderella you are  
So beautiful, ghetto fabulous,  
You're the reason I wish upon a star  
As I lay me down to sleep,  
I pray your heart I'll always keep  
And I hope you feel the same  
So baby come and hop aboard my life and  
Just let love take us away  
  
[Chorus]  
Dream Girl let's take a flight,  
Far away to a paradise  
Dream Girl let's take a ride,  
Destination rainbow skies  
Dream Girl let's kiss and hug,  
On a beach with white sand and all white doves  
Dream Girl let's cuddle up,  
Somewhere wherever and make sweet love  
  
Baby you are my Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream Girl  
  
My sunshine, my blue skies,  
Love is who you are to me  
My angel, my peace of mind,  
Woman you have come to set me free  
Lovemaking, breathtaking,  
Sweet Valentine's to me  
Heart racing, creating  
An incredible fire within me  
I believe in you and me,  
Together for all eternity  
And I hope you feel the same  
So baby come and hop aboard my life and  
Just let love take us away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby this love we make is too good to be true  
Heaven must really love me because heaven sent me you  
Keep bringing me joy baby,  
Giving me love baby  
I'll stay asleep as long as I can have you right here in my dreams  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
