I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I'm in love all over again  
I'm head over heels  
I can't even begin  
to tell you how it feels  
She lives on a rock  
surrounded by light  
She's young and she's wild  
and she's treating me right  
  
I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I shed some light  
I change my address  
I haven't felt so great  
since I first went west  
I've got brilliant intentions  
unthinkable plans  
I've got sparks and electric shocks  
just exploding from my hands  
  
I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I'm back in the saddle  
I'm out in the clear  
I got no regrets  
I've got nothing to fear  
I've battled my demons  
come out on top  
I'm gonna love you as hard as I can  
never gonna stop  
  
I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream
