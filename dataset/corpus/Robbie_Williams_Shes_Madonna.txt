Oh, Madonna, Madonna  
  
I don't miss you  
Just who you used to be  
And you don't ring true  
So please stop calling me  
  
Your I love yous  
Are ten a penny  
You're dropping clues  
Like you've got any  
You got to choose  
There's been so many  
  
I love you baby  
But face it she's Madonna  
No man on Earth  
Could say that he don't want her  
  
This look of love  
Says I'm leaving  
You're frozen now  
I've done the freezing  
I'm walking out  
Madonna's calling me  
  
She's got to be  
Obscene to be believed  
That's her routine  
Not what she means to me  
  
I found myself by circumstance  
Across a room where people dance  
And quite by chance she danced right next to me  
  
I love you baby  
But face it she's Madonna  
No man on earth would say that he don't want her  
It's me not you  
I've got to move on  
You're younger too  
But she's got her groove on  
I'm sorry love  
Madonna's calling me  
  
Madonna, Madonna  
  
I want to tell you a secret  
  
We're having drinks  
With Kate and Stella  
Gwyneth's here  
She's brought her fella  
But all I wanna do  
Is take Madonna home  
  
I love you baby  
But face it she's Madonna  
No man on earth  
Would say that he don't want her  
  
It's me not you  
I've got to move on  
You're younger too  
But she's got her groove on  
I'm sorry love  
Madonna's calling me
