You never take the easy way  
The wind is blowing straight into your face  
You never ever close your eyes  
For any trouble that may cross your way  
There's no risk that you're not taking  
Not a mountain that's too high  
Spread your wings, you're gonna make it  
To the best time of your life  
  
Don't stop at the top  
Touch the sky before you drop  
You never make a compromise  
Your will has got the power that won't break  
You never say never to a challenge  
That will come along the way  
There's no risk that you're not taking  
Not a mountain that's too high  
Spread your wings, you're gonna make it  
To the best time of your life  
  
Don't stop at the top  
Touch the sky before you drop  
Never stop! Don't stop at the top
