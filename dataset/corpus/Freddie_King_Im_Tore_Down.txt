Well, I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I feel like this  
When my baby can't be found  
  
Well, I went to the river  
To jump in  
My baby showed up and said  
'I will tell you when'  
  
Well, I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I feel like this  
When my baby can't be found  
  
I love you baby  
With all my heart an' soul  
A love like mine will never grow old  
I love you in the mornin'  
And in the evenin', too  
But ev'rytime you leave me  
I get mad with you  
  
Well, I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I feel like this  
When my baby can't be found  
  
I love you, baby with all my might  
A love like mine is out of sight  
I'll lie for you if you want me to  
I really don't believe your love is true  
  
Well, I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I feel like this  
When my baby can't be found  
  
A-well I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I'm tore down  
I'm almost level with the ground  
Well, I feel like this  
When my baby can't be found.
