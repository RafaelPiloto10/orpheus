Well, I've got a fever  
A non-believer  
I'm in a state of grace  
For I am the seizer  
I'm gonna seize the day  
Well, call of the banshee, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
As God as my witness  
The infidels are gonna pay  
  
Well, call the assassin  
The orgasm  
A spasm of love and hate  
For what will divide us?  
The righteous and the meek  
Well, call of the wild, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Death to the girl at the end of the serenade  
  
Vendetta, sweet vendetta  
This Beretta of the night  
This fire and the desire  
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite  
  
I am a killjoy from Detroit  
I drink from a well of rage  
I feed off the weakness with all my love  
Call up at the captain, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Death to the lover that you were dreaming of  
  
This is a stand-off  
A Molotov cocktail  
On the house  
You thought I was a write-off  
You better think again  
Call the peacemaker, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began  
  
Vendetta, sweet vendetta  
This Beretta of the night  
This fire and the desire  
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite  
  
Well now the caretaker's the undertaker  
Now I'm gonna go out and get the peacemaker  
This is the Neo St. Valentine's massacre  
Well call up the Gaza, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Death to the ones at the end of the serenade  
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade  
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade  
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
