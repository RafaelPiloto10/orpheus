My love said to me  
"A hero you'll be  
If you bring me the rose of love"  
So, today I must go where the wide rivers flow  
Down from the hills above  
From beginning to end  
Who will guide me, my friend  
For the difficult task that she chose?  
Will the sun and the rain  
From whose bosom I came  
Show me the way to The Rose?  
For my true love I yearn  
But I'll never, ever return  
Till I find where that red lady grows  
When I find her, I'll sing  
And the mission bells will ring  
The news that I've captured The Rose
