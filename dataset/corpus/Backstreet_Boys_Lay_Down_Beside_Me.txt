Something about the way you moved  
That caught my eye  
I really did have to try it  
I can't deny it  
The way your body swings  
As I watched you from behind  
That got me so excited  
How could I fly in  
Baby let me be the on to hold you  
To give you the things I know you need  
You know that we can wait another life time  
And we can never find a love just like this  
  
[Chorus]  
If you lay down lay down beside me  
You can get on inside me  
And I can get on inside you too  
If you lay down lay down beside me  
You can wake up beside me, forever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever, baby  
  
Let's take this chance to get to know each other better  
Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers  
I give you what you need  
Just come to me and get it  
Baby you won't regret it  
  
No, no, no baby  
Baby move a little closer, yeah  
I want to feel your body next to mine  
And before this night is over  
You will know what I need  
Talking love in your sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tonight, (tonight) we'll find  
Just what what we've been looking for  
Good, good lovin' and a whole lot more  
Hold on  
Be inside  
Hold me and don't you let go  
Until I tell you to  
  
[Chorus]
