You wear  
The cloth  
Of finest lands  
The touch of women the toil of hands  
  
Undress  
Me now  
Before I bend  
From the weight of everyman  
  
When I'm walking through this world  
I need to hold your hand  
Let me take you on this ride  
I hope you understand  
I'm not asking for a compromise  
  
Now you  
Defend  
Exhume  
Begin again  
It's the riddle of a skeleton  
  
We're all  
Diseased  
So count the coup  
I can't image stopping you  
  
When I'm walking through this world  
I need to hold your hand  
Let me take you on this ride  
I hope you understand  
I'm not asking for a compromise  
  
So the earth  
We scorch  
We breath  
Find some comfort on our knees  
  
You find  
Your worth  
In words that wind  
Pleasures I don't comprehend  
  
When I'm walking trough this world  
I need to hold your hand  
Let me take you on this ride  
I hope you understand  
I'm not asking for a compromise  
Asking for a compro  
Asking for a compromise
