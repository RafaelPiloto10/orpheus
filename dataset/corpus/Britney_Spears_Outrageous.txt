[Chorus]  
Outrageous, when I move my body.  
Outrageous, when I'm at a party.  
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans.  
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene.  
Outrageous, my sex drive.  
Outrageous, my shopping spree.  
Outrageous, we on a world tour  
Outrageous, let's be it girl!  
  
Outrageous  
  
Sexy as I want to be.  
Got these fellas chasing me.  
It's 'bout time I hit the streets.  
All my girls still feelin' me  
  
B-girl ain't lost the beat.  
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet.  
Gotta keep going, no stopping me  
And if you don't like it then  
  
La la la la la la la  
  
Media over here  
Come through like a world premiere.  
Trench coat and my underwear  
Let's go with this freak show, it's?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Outrageous  
  
Ding ding ding  
Ding ding ding ding ding  
  
I'm about to bring the heat  
Locking down the industry  
All dressed up and glamorous  
Red carpet and cameras  
  
Take trips around the globe  
Rims on my Jeep, so nobody knows  
So hot that you're coming out your clothes  
I'm about to give it to ya  
  
Media over here  
Come through like a world premiere.  
Trench coat and my underwear  
Let's go with this freak show, it's?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Outrageous  
  
I just want to be happy  
In a place where love is free  
Can you take me there somebody?  
Oh, and when you mention my name  
Make you sure you know the truth  
Until I'm about to keep it forever  
  
[Chorus: x2]
