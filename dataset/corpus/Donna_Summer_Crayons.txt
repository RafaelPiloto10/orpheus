Hey hey oh  
Donna, what's going on?  
  
1 2 3  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're like crayons melting in the sunshine  
Take a big eraser and wipe out the line  
Oh ,oh what's up tell me what's a-happening  
say you want love but why ain't you sacrificing?  
we're like crayons melting in the sunshine  
I'll color your world if you color mine  
Oh ,oh what's up tell me what's a-happening  
say you want love but why ain't you sacrificing?  
  
Come on over you sleepyhead  
it's time to color my dress in red  
It don't matter if it's day or night  
we play in color not in black in white  
  
Come on let's color the world in green  
Let's make a difference in the way we dream  
We're going to color a smiling face  
on the people of the human race  
  
1 2 3  
  
I'll take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you can be mine  
In and out, in and out, in and out of the lines  
Take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you could be mine  
In and out of the lines, in and out , in and out of the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Everybody dreaming )  
  
If we mix in some pink and blue  
We get a beating at a purple hue  
Mellow yellow when the day is done  
Becomes the orange of the setting sun  
  
1 2 3 come on  
  
I'll take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you can be mine  
In and out, in and out, in and out of the lines  
Take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you could be mine  
In and out of the lines, in and out , in and out of the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Red is the color of the blood in our veins oh  
Like the rainbow we are one the same (just one yeah)  
(Everybody dreaming )  
Yellow is the color of the sun we share  
The green grass is everywhere  
(Everybody dreaming )  
  
Chorus
