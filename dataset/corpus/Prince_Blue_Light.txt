Oh well, here we are again  
Lookin' for something to get us in the mood  
I tell each and every one of my friends  
That the love we make is really pretty rude  
But they don't believe me 'cause it's written all over my face  
Like Evian and the deep blue sea  
You and me got different taste  
You like it in the dark but I like a?  
  
Blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
Then cuddle up to me so tight  
Just you and me all night, alright  
Blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
Then everything will be alright  
Oh, blue light  
  
You say you wish I was shy  
I always take a simple thing and push it way to far  
But baby, that's the problem with you and I  
You say not in public but I say in the car, mm  
Say, we need to get wild again like it was when we first met  
Close your eyes and count to 10 and when you open 'em  
I'll be standing naked with nothing but a smile on  
  
Blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
Then cuddle up to me so tight  
Just you and me all night, alright  
Blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
Then everything will be alright  
Oh, blue light  
  
(Well) I'll be 117  
You'll be still sayin' - "Baby, not tonight"  
Well, it's easy to see us on the cover of a magazine, huh  
"Double heart attack, couple both died in a fight"  
Well baby, I don't want to cross that road 'cause I love you to much  
I'd do anything just to heat up your cold touch  
Anything I would do, but up until you tell me to  
  
Blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
Then cuddle up to me so tight  
Just you and me all night, alright  
Blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
Then everything will be alright  
Oh, blue light  
  
Hey, blue light  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
(Cuddle up to me so tight)  
Cuddle up next to me, baby  
You and me all night, alright  
Blue light (Light)  
Can you turn on a blue light?  
And everything will be alright  
Oh, blue light  
Oh, blue light  
Oh, blue light  
Blue light  
Blue light
