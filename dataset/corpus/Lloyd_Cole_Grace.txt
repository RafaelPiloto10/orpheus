Once you were an angel  
Jesse honey is it hard to take  
Does it feel so bad to be 28 you were 23  
And you could do anything now you open your mouth  
And spit the gutter out  
I was walking down by the river thames  
I decided that I should throw me in  
Because you broke my heart and you made me weep  
In the name of your sensitivity  
Still once you were an angel  
Did nobody tell you jesse honey oh you look so pale  
And old and so very I'll at ease these days  
So you tell yourself that you'll never win  
And you drown your sins in amphetamine  
Do you weary so of that bitter taste  
So you spit in my face just to keep you entertained  
Still I can only love you I have no option but to  
Is hard to take is it is it hard to swallow  
Is it is it hard to take from grace  
Once you were an angel  
Did nobody tell you jesse honey is it hard to take  
Does it feel so bad to be 28 you were 23  
And you could do anything  
Now you open your mouth and you spit the gutter out  
Out in the summer rain  
You will begin again  
Out in the summer rain  
We will begin again
