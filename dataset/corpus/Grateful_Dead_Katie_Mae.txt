Well you know Katie Mae is a good girl  
Folks say she don't run around at night  
I made a mistake and she don't run around at night  
Yes, you can bet your last dollar Katie Mae will treat you right.  
  
Well some folks say she must be a Cadillac  
But I say she got to be a t-model ford  
Yes she got the shape all right, but she can't carry no heavy load.  
  
And she walks this life  
Her daddy got oil wells in his backyard  
Every time she got to working that woman she never has to work too hard.  
  
I say bye-bye poor Katie Mae  
These are the last words I got to say  
Cause if I don't meet you tomorrow  
I'll get you early in the next day.
