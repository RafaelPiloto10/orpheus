To all the entertainers in the world I man show 'nough respect  
'Nough respect, cause every entertainer is select  
And right ya now me a go show you how to do the king step  
  
[Chorus]  
Me a go show you how to do the king step left right,  
Me a go show you how to do the king step left right,  
  
As soon as me operator puts the music on the deck  
Is pure exciting, educating, fascinating, pirate chanting  
Culture preaching, perfect timing lyrics you a go get  
The whistlers blow their whistle, big women say "Kiss me neck"  
Some bawl "Forward", some bawl "Rewind" and some shout out "eject"  
While the pirates press record pon fe dem pocket size cassettes  
The MCs that chat slack fret till dem armpit wet with sweat  
Because they know that slackness is a thing I man do not respect  
That's why me have to show dem how fe do the King Step Left Right.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well before me start to go down in a dais yak subject  
Me have to praise you Jah cause you never fail I yet  
Even when satan captured me and bring me close to death  
You offered me the truth and right and I had to accept  
But now me find you Jah me na go keep it secret  
That's why the conscious lyrics are my favorite subject  
Me chat dem in the blues party, pub, club and discotheque  
Me chat dem in the bookie shop while man a put on bet  
And also in the gambling house when man ready fe set  
And even to bad man who a walk wid dem ratchet  
Me chat dem a UB40 Studio in Digbeth  
And when dem want more culture dem a bawl out "Dep, Dep, Dep"  
But me tell them, hold on lads you ain't heard nothing yet  
"Cause now I'm gonna show ya how to do the King Step" Left Right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Left right its time to walk in the light of Jah not darkness  
Left right who Jab bless no man curse, who Jah curse no man bless  
Left right eternal life for the man that tries his very best  
Left right do bad and you'll go down in the pit that's bottomless  
Left right Pato Banton has now come to preach the right  
Left right left right me no partial if your black or if your white  
Left right well now me know how fe do the king step  
Me just can not keep it a secret  
So right ya now you a get  
The king step, the king step, the king step  
  
Step 1, we all should know that there's one god and only one  
Step 2, Is give him praises for this whole creation  
Step 3, Is love your brother man cause you and him is one  
Step 4, Is not to make the same mistake as Soloman  
Step 5, Is to repent and beg forgiveness for your wrongs  
Cause the wrath of Jah is clear to see in Revelation  
So make up mind if you want to go to Heaven or Hell  
Step 6, Oh yes there's more the King Step carries on  
It carries on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on  
Step 6, is once you know the truth to pass the message on  
And do the King Step daily as you trod upon Jah land  
So when the right time comes for Babylon's destruction  
You'll be among the few to march towards mount Zion  
Left-right, left-right, left-right, left-right
