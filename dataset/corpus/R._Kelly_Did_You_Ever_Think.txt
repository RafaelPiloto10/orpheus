[Chorus]  
Did you ever think that you would be this rich  
Did you ever think that you would have these hits  
Did you ever think that you would be the don  
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn  
Did you ever think that you would be this paid  
Were there times when your ass was real afraid  
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours  
Have a show with fifty million viewers  
  
I used to think about how I was gonna make it  
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper  
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way  
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I've been around the world and seen so many things  
Partied in every club nothing but VIP  
I never take for granted these luxuries I have  
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I used to play the game, at night the same old same  
Dreamin' 'bout city lights it was my only lie  
And now it's world wide shows  
As if I can fly on over  
Now I can't go nowhere without, before I do two more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to dream about this life  
Now I'm sitting on first class flights  
Now they all wanna know  
  
[Chorus]
