You want me to play the game you tried again and again  
To sell myself for fame fit in the format man  
To suit the image you want portrayed so the people are still enslaved  
You can't define what we do I won't be put in a box for you  
  
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out  
  
I of the universe won't be prisoners of your little world  
The mind is limitless where time does not exist  
We travel far beyond the realms of expectations  
And I refuse to be what you expect of me  
  
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out  
  
What would you lose to gain the price is high to pay  
Desire not to be like them to follow the dream of sin  
Blessed are the meek and humble my own spirit  
Cause music is a holy thing hey we giving thanks for the blessings  
  
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out  
Mama I get out papa I get out  
Said I'm gonna hit it down, said I'm gonna kick it down  
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out
