Where's the orchestra?  
Wasn't this supposed to be a musical?  
Here I am  
In the balcony,  
How the hell could I have missed the overture?  
  
I like the scenery  
Even though, I have absolutely no, idea at all,  
What is being said, despite the dialogue,  
There's the leading man  
  
The movie star who never faced an audience  
Where's the orchestra?  
After all, this is my big night on the town  
My introduction to the theatre crowd  
  
I assumed that the show would have a song  
So I was wrong  
At least I understand  
All the innuendo and the irony  
  
And I appreciate,  
The roles the actors played  
The point the author made  
And after the closing lines,  
  
And after the curtain calls,  
The curtain falls  
On empty chairs,  
Where's the orchestra?
