A young couple stood under stars in the sky  
They pledged their love with tears in their eyes  
For this was a true love goodbye  
They stood there trembling and couldn't speak  
She tip toed and kissed his cheek  
For this was a true love goodbye  
A true love goodbye, they tried not to cry  
With words so true, they both said, "I love you"  
Then they parted both broken hearted  
But they'll meet again some day some way  
Beyond this true love goodbye  
A true love goodbye, they tried not to cry  
With words so true, they both said, "I love you"  
Then they parted both broken hearted  
But they'll meet again some day some way  
Beyond this true love goodbye  
True love, true love goodbye, bye my love
