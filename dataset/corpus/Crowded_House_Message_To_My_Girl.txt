I don't wanna say I love you  
That would give away too much  
Hip to be detached and precious  
The only thing you feel is vicious  
  
I don't wanna say I want you  
Even though I want you so much  
It's wrapped up in conversation  
It's whispered in a hush  
  
Though I'm frightened by the word  
I think its time that it was heard  
  
No more empty self possession  
Visions swept under the mat  
It's no new years resolution  
It's more than that  
  
Now I wake up happy  
Warm in a lover's embrace  
No one else can touch us  
While we're in this place  
So I sing it to the world  
Simple message to my girl  
  
No more empty self possession  
Visions swept under the mat  
It's no new years resolution  
It's more than that  
  
Though I'm frightened by the word  
I think its time I made it heard  
So I sing it to the world  
Simple message to my girl  
  
No more empty self possession  
Visions swept under the mat  
It's no new years resolution  
It's more than that  
  
And there's nothing quite as real  
As the touch of your sweet hand  
I can't spend the rest of my life  
Buried in the sand
