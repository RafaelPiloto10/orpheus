I'm nothing fancy  
I'm nothing special that's true  
But I know what your thinkin'  
'cause I'm thinkin' that same thing too  
Now you'd like everything to go your way  
And I should probably say everything you'd like me to say  
But that's not me and baby that just wouldn't be you  
You better watch how long you wait  
'cause baby you might wait too long  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know if I could make you happy  
And I don't know if I could make you cry  
I don't know if the clock stops at midnight  
I can't see past forever but together we can fly  
Together we can fly  
  
Now let's pretend for a while that we've got no place to be  
You've been broken before but baby that wasn't me  
Now I'm trying to ask you to come  
  
To that same old place that you've been runnin' from  
We've been down that road  
You know there's nothing to see  
You better watch how long you wait  
'cause baby you might wait too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bay there' no use in waiting  
I can see that your hopes are fading  
They tell me that time is precious baby  
Why do you keep wastin' time?  
  
[Chorus]
