Baby this is getting dangerous  
Dangerous, dangerous  
Dangerous, dangerous  
You take me down  
Spin me around  
You got me running all the lights  
Don't make a sound  
Talk to me now  
Let me inside your mind  
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar  
But I just got that feeling, sugar  
And I can hear the sirens burning  
Red lights turning  
I can't turn back now  
So hold on tight  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But, baby, this is getting serious  
Detain the dangerous  
Dangerous  
Show me your soul  
I got to know  
Bet that you're beautiful inside  
Toes on the glass  
Car moving fast  
Come take the wheel and drive  
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar  
And I just got that feeling, sugar  
I can hear the sirens burning  
Red lights turning  
I can't turn back now  
So hold on tight  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But, baby, this is getting serious  
Detain the dangerous  
Detain the dangerous  
Oh yeah, don't be scared baby  
Running on the red lights  
It's a little crazy maybe  
And I don't know what to do  
Don't know what it is  
Can't explain it now  
It's dangerous  
It's dangerous, so dangerous  
I wanna do it again  
It's dangerous, so dangerous  
I wanna do it again  
It's dangerous, so dangerous  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But, baby, this is getting serious  
Detain the dangerous  
Detain the dangerous  
I don't know where the lights are taking us  
But something in the night is dangerous  
And nothing's holding back the two of us  
But, baby, this is getting serious  
Detain the dangerous
