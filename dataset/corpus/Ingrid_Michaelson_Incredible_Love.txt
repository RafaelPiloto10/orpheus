I never thought I'd fall so far down  
This incredibly long dark hole  
Something so sweet as the sound of your feet  
On the floor would give me more room to breath  
  
I'll say goodbye again tonight  
The third time's the charmer they say  
Your words are inked on my skin  
The marks of incredible love  
  
Incredible love, you fill me  
Incredible love, you spill me  
Incredible love, you kill me  
Incredible love  
  
Everything says it's time to go  
But the smell of your skin makes me stay  
You are not mine to ask things of  
But I ask you anyway, but I ask you anyway  
  
Incredible love, you fill me  
Incredible love, you spill me  
Incredible love, you kill me  
Incredible love, incredible love  
  
You take it away but then you give it right back  
Just take it away don't give it back  
  
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love  
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love  
  
Incredible love, you fill me  
Incredible love, you spill me  
Incredible love, you kill me  
Incredible love, incredible love, incredible love  
Incredible love
