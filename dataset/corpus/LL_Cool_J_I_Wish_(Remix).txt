[Ll Cool J](Puffy)  
Its gonna be a hot summer baby  
(This is the remix)  
Know what I'm saying sugar  
(Carl Thomas, yeah uncle L)  
(Let's go)  
  
When it's love at first sight  
It's all right to get caught up in the hype  
You got me staring at the ceiling late at night  
I got you calling up your girls for insight  
That's ai-ight cause I blazed it just right  
You got a man so I can't leave marks when I bite  
Can't go to your crib and conversate late at night  
But I know you think of me when he's holding you tight  
Wish I was there baby  
  
[Carl Thomas]  
It was love at first sight  
I know from the way she looked at me  
Her eyes said it all  
Long days and nights, we spent  
Until she dropped the bomb on me  
When she said that she  
Was unhappily married with children  
  
1 - And I wish I never met her at all  
Even though I love her so  
But she got love for me  
But she still belongs to someone else  
  
It hurts so bad, for sure  
Because she wants to be with me  
But she cannot be with me  
She chose to stay-hey at home  
So they could be a family  
For the children  
But what about me?  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Maybe in another life  
Things could be the way  
We both desired  
It's a catch-22  
(Catch-22)  
Even when you win, someone had to lose  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Ll Cool J] (Puffy)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I wanna snatch you from your man  
(That's right)  
If need be, throw some ice up on your hand  
(Come on)  
Anybody that's human will understand  
(Uh)  
No disrespect baby it's God's plan  
Your man's cool with me  
But I must take what's rightfully mine  
Even if it means I gotta cross the line  
Even if it means I got to take my time  
(Take your time)  
And send some chicks at him and disrupt his mind  
But whether he true or not  
You still hot  
(Still hot)  
At three in the morning you sit staring at the clock  
(Come on)  
Making up reasons to ride through my block  
(What?)  
I wish he'd disappear, I wish that you'd stop  
I wish that we could shop with our shorties in the drop  
(He-he)  
Cruise the clear waters in a wine colored yacht  
(I like that)  
The sun rays sparkle off your skin, so hot  
(Come on)  
It gets no better than this, we on top  
(Yeah)  
  
[Carl Thomas] (Puffy)  
Met her  
At all, at all  
Even though I love her so  
She's got love for me, oh  
(Carl Thomas, Emotions)  
But she still belongs to someone else  
(Bad Boy you know the name)  
(Sing the song)  
I wish, I wish I never met her at all, oh, oh  
(Yeah)  
I wouldn't hurt so much inside  
Oh she still belongs to someone else  
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain  
Met her at all  
If I never met her at all, at all, at all  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
She still belongs to someone else  
(Uh yeah, uh yeah)
