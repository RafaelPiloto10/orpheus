I know it's dumb to say,  
That you are on my mind.  
I know it's stupid to dream,  
That you might think of me as a man.  
I can loose my own tie knot,  
I can button up my own pants.  
I can buy my own cigarettes,  
I can pluck my own moustache.  
I read it's lame to wish,  
That you won't walk out on me.  
I'm not embarrassed to sing,  
Plainly the words love and your name.  
I can pay all my own bills,  
I can unroll my own tights.  
I can untuck all I have to untuck,  
I can weep through my own midnights.  
I can loose my own tie knot,  
I can button up my own pants.  
I can buy my own cigarettes,  
I can pluck my own moustache.  
I can pay all my own debts,  
I can rip off my own tights.  
I can humiliate myself to your face,  
I can weep through my own midnights.
