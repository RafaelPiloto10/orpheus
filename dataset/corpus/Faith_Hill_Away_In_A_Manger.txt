Away in a manger  
No crib for His bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Lay down His sweet head  
The stars  
In the bright sky  
Look down where lay  
The little Lord Jesus  
Asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
The baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love you Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle  
Til morning is night  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all  
The dear children  
In thy tender care  
And feen us for Heaven  
To live with thee there
