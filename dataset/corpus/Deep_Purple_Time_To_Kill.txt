Consider your position position your defense  
Why don't you let me ask you is it mere coincidence  
Feeding speculators on a downhill gravy train  
Like vultures ripping out the eyes to reach the dying brain  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
And there's a time for peace a time for war  
Wondering what we've been put here for  
A time for giving a time to take  
A time for love and a time for hate  
A time for beg and a time to steal  
So you gamble on that spinning wheel  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill  
  
Ten percent of nothing is exactly what you got  
You thing you've got the given right to take another shot  
I'll take away your money all you've got is colored beads  
Find a piece of land where you can sow your seeds  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
There's a time for passion a time for pain  
A time to learn that we're all the same  
A time to remember a time to forget  
Wondering how we're going to pay our debts  
A time for thunder a time for rain  
Waiting for the seasons to change  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill
