She wakes and takes her place in line  
And never bothers to ask why the mirror sheds no light at all  
The days turn into lesser days until there's only night  
The light it wouldn't help she's too far gone  
  
Her time is up it's five o'clock  
It never stops  
  
And she says please, and she says please  
And she says please, watch over me  
  
I watch her slowly make her way  
Down on a road she shouldn't take  
She always ends where she began  
  
The years go by, they're adding up  
She clicks her heels but she's still stuck  
She's giving in but won't give up she'll never stop  
  
And she says please, and she says please  
And she says please, watch over me  
And she says please, and she is,  
On her knees and she begs and she pleads  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
She counts the time 'til her heart breaks  
Just waiting for her next mistake  
  
And I said please, and she says please  
And she says please, watch over me  
  
On her knees and she begs and she pleads she says  
Please, and she says please and she says please watch over me  
  
She counts the time 'til her heart breaks  
Just waiting for her next mistake  
Don't give up I know you've stopped believing  
And you're down and you're begging you're pleading  
Don't give up cause you're not too far gone
