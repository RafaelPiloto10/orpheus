I used to hang my head down low  
Never knowing which way I was going  
My life was getting close to the edge  
And I knew that it was showing  
  
Because of you  
I can stand and hold my head up high  
Because of you  
I feel free and yet I don't know why  
  
Each morning is a spring time song  
With the sun up in the sky  
The sadness that is on your face  
Helped me to realise  
I owe each day I have to you  
And I'll pay you back some day  
You're reading me like a book  
But I really would like to say  
  
Because of you  
I can stand and hold my head up high  
Because of you  
I feel free and yet I don't know why  
  
Yes I do, it's you  
And I'll pay you back some day  
Because of you  
I have finally found my way
