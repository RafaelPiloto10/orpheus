Truth or lie, the silence is revealing  
An empty sky, a hidden mound of stone  
But the CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing  
Nowadays, when everything is known  
Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true  
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue  
Dazzling blue  
  
Miles apart, though the miles can't measure distance  
Worlds apart on a rainy afternoon  
But the road gets dirty and it offers no resistance  
So turn your amp up and play your lonesome tune  
Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true  
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue  
Dazzling blue  
  
Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen  
To make a marriage bed  
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through  
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue  
  
Sweet July, and we drove the Montauk Highway  
And walked along the cliffs above the sea  
And we wondered why, and imagined it was someday  
And that is how the future came to be  
  
Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen  
To make a marriage bed  
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through  
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue
