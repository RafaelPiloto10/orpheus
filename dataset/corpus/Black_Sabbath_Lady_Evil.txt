There's a place just south of Witches' Valley  
Where they say the wind won't blow  
And they only speak in whispers of her name  
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness  
It eats right from her hand  
With a crying shout she'll search you out  
And freeze you where you stand  
Lady Evil, evil  
She's a magical, mystical woman  
Lady Evil, evil in my mind  
She's queen of the night  
All right!  
In a place just south of Witches' Valley  
Where they say the rain won't fall  
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed, yeah  
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness  
She can't face the light  
With an awful shout, she'll find you out  
And have you for the night  
Lady Evil, evil  
She's a magical, mystical woman  
Lady Evil, evil on my mind  
She's queen of the night  
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley  
Don't dream or close your eyes  
And never trust your shadow in the dark  
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision  
Around  
The things you see are what to be, lost and never found  
Lady Evil, evil  
She's a magical, mystical woman  
Lady Evil, evil on my mind  
She's queen of the night  
She's the queen of sin  
Look out, she'll pull you in!  
Lady wonder!
