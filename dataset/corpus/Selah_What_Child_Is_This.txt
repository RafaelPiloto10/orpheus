What Child is this who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, Haste to bring Him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
Why lies He in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding  
Good Christian, fear for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, Haste to bring him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
So bring incense, gold, and myrrh  
Come peasant, come king to own Him  
The King of kings salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
Raise, raise, the song on high  
The virgin sings her lullaby  
Joy, Joy for Christ is born  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
This, this is Christ your King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, Haste to bring Him laud  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
Ooh, born in a manger, laid in some hay  
They just didn't know who you were  
Ooh, You were born in a stable, so far away  
O, we just didn't know who You were  
  
Yes, sweet little Jesus, boy  
Sweet little Jesus, boy, oh  
  
Didn't know who, who you were
