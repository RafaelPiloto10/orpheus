My mother told me  
'Fore she passed away  
Said son when I'm gone  
Don't forget to pray  
  
'Cause there'll be hard times  
Lord those hard times  
Who knows better than I?  
  
Well I soon found out  
Just what she meant  
When I had to pawn my clothes  
Just to pay the rent  
  
Talkin' 'bout hard times  
Lord those hard times  
Who knows better than I?  
  
I had a woman  
Who was always around  
But when I lost my money  
She put me down  
  
Talkin' 'bout hard times  
Hard times  
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?  
  
Lord,  
One of these days  
There'll be no more sorrow  
When I pass away  
  
And no more hard times  
No more hard times  
Yeah, yeah, who knows better than I?
