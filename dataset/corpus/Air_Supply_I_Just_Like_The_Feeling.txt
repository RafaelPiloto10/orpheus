I just like the feeling  
You give me when the time is right  
I just like the feeling  
When you tell me you'll be here tonight  
Let me believe that this moment is good for you too  
When you leave it's not really all through  
Does it get to you  
I just like the feeling  
Of pretending that some day you'll stay  
I just like the feeling  
That your love is not too far away  
Tell me again  
That you'll stay for as long as you can  
When I'm really not part of the plan  
  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
Closest to love  
  
I just like the feeling  
When you're next to me without a sound  
I just like the feeling  
When you tell me that you're all unwound  
  
One night I'm yours and tonight  
You can have nothing less  
Tomorrow I long for the rest  
Tell me a lie  
If it helps me get through one more day  
You know I'll be here anyway  
  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
Closest to love  
  
One night I'm yours and tonight  
You can have nothing less  
Tomorrow I long for the rest  
Tell me a lie  
If it helps me get through one more day  
You know I'll be here anyway
