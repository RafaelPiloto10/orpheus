(Dolly Parton)  
Oh, you're out there tonight with another  
And my pain is so dreadfully sharp.  
I picture you with her and shudder,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Do you think that my feelings don't matter,  
Or your cheatin' or hurtful remarks  
When you leave me all broken and shattered  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'  
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, you cut me to pieces so often  
Like a knife or a poisonous dart  
I would be better off in my coffin,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin'  
When you've made hurtin' me such an art,  
Tossed around like a used box of crayons,  
It's like a dagger through the heart  
Like a dagger through the heart, through the heart
