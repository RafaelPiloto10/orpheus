  
On a long lonesome journey I am going  
So my sweet little darling don't cry  
For in shackles and chains they will take me  
To a prison to live till I die  
(chorus)  
And each night threw the bars  
I will gaze at the stars  
My dreams dear of you so in vain  
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow  
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains  
Put your arms threw these bars once more darling  
Let me kiss your sweet lips I love best  
For in sorrow they were my conculution  
And in sadness my haven of rest  
(repeat chorus)
