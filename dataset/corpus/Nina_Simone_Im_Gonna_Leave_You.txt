I'm gonna leave you yes I'm gonna  
I'm gonna leave you 'cause I want to  
And I'll go where people love me  
And I'll stay there 'cause they love me  
  
No more headaches no more heartbreaks  
I'm gonna leave you where I met you  
I'm gonna leave you whit your money  
I want somebody to call me honey  
  
I don't want gold rings  
I want to hear sweet things  
I need affection and not protection  
When you're teasing you should be squeezing  
  
I'm gonna leave you where I met you  
Yes I put up with all your cussin'  
And I put up with all your fussin'  
And I waited getting frustrated  
  
I'm old fashioned I want my passion  
So I'm leaving through I'm greaving  
I'm gonna leave you where I met you

When you're teasing you should be squeezing  
I'm gonna leave you

Yes I'm gonna leave you 'cause I want to  
And I'll go where people love me  
And I'll stay there 'cause they love me
