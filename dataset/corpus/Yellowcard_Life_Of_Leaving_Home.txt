I can see all the footsteps left behind every second I gave.  
Every song was a snapshot of my life I needed something to say.  
  
It started out in the last slow motion scene watching everyone change.  
Made a map of the one way road from here, I had no reason to stay.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
Think of me when the stars come out tonight, take a look at the sky.  
I never said I could burn out that bright, but I needed to try.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.  
  
The day that I found my voice, I knew that I had no choice.  
The only way that I'd ever learn to love is if i found it on my own.  
On my own.  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me.  
More than a moment in time, it's a dream I'm following on my own.  
(On my own) On my own.  
On my own (on my own) On my own (on my own)  
More than a moment in time, it's a life of leaving home.
