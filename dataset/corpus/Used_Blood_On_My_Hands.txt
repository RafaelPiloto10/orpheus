You felt the coldness in my eyes  
And it's something I'm not revealing  
Though you got used to my disguise  
You can't shake this awful feeling  
  
It's the me that I let you know  
'Cause I'll never show I have my reasons  
I hate to say that I told you so  
But I told you so, yeah  
  
There's blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things can't be treated  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
Straight from your eyes it's burying me  
Beautifully so disfigured  
This other side that you can't see  
Just praying you won't remember  
  
Feel the pain that I never show  
And I hope you know, it's never healing  
I hate to say that I told you so  
But I told you so, yeah  
  
There's blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things can't be treated  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
Straight from your eyes it's burying me  
Beautifully so disfigured  
This other side that you can't see  
Just praying you won't remember  
  
There's blood, there's blood  
There's blood, blood, blood  
  
There's blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things can't be treated  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
There's blood on my hands  
(There's blood)  
Like the blood in you  
(There's blood)  
  
Some things can't be treated  
(There's blood)  
So don't make me, don't make me be myself around you  
  
There's blood
