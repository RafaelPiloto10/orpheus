In an April dream, once you came to me  
When you smiled I looked into your eyes and I knew  
I'd be loving you and  
Then you touched my hand  
And I learned April dreams can come true  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who can't see all the danger around us?  
If we're just April fools I don't care  
True love has found us now  
  
Little did we know where the road would lead  
Here we are a million miles away from the past  
Traveling so fast now  
There's no turning back if our sweet  
April dream doesn't last  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who can't see all the danger around us?  
If we're just April fools I don't care  
True love has found us now  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who can't see all the danger around us?  
If we're just April fools I don't care  
True love has found us now  
  
Are we just April fools  
Who can't see all the danger around us?  
If we're just April fools I don't care  
We'll find our way somehow  
No need to be afraid
