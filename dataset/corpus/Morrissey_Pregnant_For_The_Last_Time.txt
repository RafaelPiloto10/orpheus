Phlegm lapels for the last time  
Corn beef legs for the last time  
Oh, we're so glad  
That you've finally decided  
  
But then you see someone new  
And you want someone new  
So you have someone new  
I don't blame you  
We would all do the same as you  
If ever we had the nerve to  
  
Chips with cream for the last time  
The people's friend for the last time  
Oh, we're so glad  
That you've finally decided  
  
Tiny striped socks for the last time  
Pokes and prods for the last time  
And the doctor said  
"don't nod your head until june !"  
  
But then you see someone new  
And you want someone new  
So you have someone new  
I don't blame you  
We would all do the same as you  
If ever we had the chance to  
  
Sick at noon for the last time  
And who is going to clean up ?  
Would you be so kind ?  
Oh, everybody's staring  
At the strange clothes that you're wearing  
  
Bad advice for the last time  
And people being nice for the very first time  
Oh, we're so glad  
That you have finally decided !
