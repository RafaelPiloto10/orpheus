WARBUCKS  
  
I've made me a fortune  
(That fortune made ten)  
Been headlined  
And profiled  
Again and again  
But something was missing  
(I never quite knew)  
That something was someone  
But who?  
  
My speeches are greeted  
With thunderous acclaim  
At two universities  
Bearing my name  
Yes, something was missing  
Each timeI got through  
That something was someone  
But who?  
  
Who could that someone be?  
How could she make it known?  
Who would need me for me?  
Need me for me alone?  
The world was my oyster  
But where was the pearl?  
Who dreamed I could find it  
Yes something was missing  
But dreams can come true  
That something  
Is no one  
But you  
  
Who would need me for me?  
Need me for me alone  
The world was my oyster  
But where was the pearl?  
Who'd dream I would find it  
In one little girl?  
Yes, something was missing  
But dreams do come true  
That something is no one... but you.
