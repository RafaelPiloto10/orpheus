I've done some things that I hadn't oughta  
Like coming home late with the preacher's daughter  
I'd hit the back door seeing double  
My ol' man waiting with a fistful of trouble  
  
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you're a winner  
You talk about love, I ain't no beginner  
I'm a sucker for a juke joint jumpin'  
I never stop chasin' the scent of the woman  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
I come up smilin' song  
  
I've been on top and I've hit the bottom  
You talk about hard times Lord, I've got 'em  
Just keep on runnin' and go in full of throttle  
There ain't no answer in the bottom of a bottle  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
I come up smilin' song  
  
Come up smilin'  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
I come up smilin' song  
  
It's just the way that I've always been  
You knock me down, I'm coming back again  
I sing, I've been there and I've done that  
And I come up smilin' song  
  
Oh, keep on smilin'  
Oh, keep on smilin'
