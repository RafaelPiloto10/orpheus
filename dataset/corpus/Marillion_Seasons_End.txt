Getting close to seasons end  
I heard somebody say  
That it might never snow again  
In England  
  
Snow flakes in a new-born fist  
Sledging on a hill  
Are these things we'll never see  
In England  
  
We'll tell our children's children why  
We grew so tall and reached so high  
We left our footprints in the earth  
And punched a hole right through the sky  
  
We'll tell them how we changed the world  
And how we tamed the sea  
And seasons they will never know  
In England  
  
So watch the old world melt away  
A loss regrets could never mend  
You never miss it till it's gone  
So say goodbye, say goodbye  
  
We'll tell our children's children why  
We grew so tall and reached so high  
You never miss it till it's gone  
So say goodbye, say goodbye  
To seasons end
