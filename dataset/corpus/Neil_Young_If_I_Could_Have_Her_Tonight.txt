All of a sudden she was on my mind  
I wasn't ready for her kind  
And she was taking her time.  
  
What if she came to me  
Would she be kind?  
And if she stayed with me  
Do you think that she'd like to do anything  
I would, or would she leave me?  
  
Lately I've found myself losing my mind  
Knowing how badly I need her  
It's something hard to find.  
  
What if she came to me  
Would she be kind?  
And if she stayed with me  
Do you think that she'd like to do anything  
I would, or would she leave me?  
  
If I could have her tonight  
Does she want to go?  
Look at those eyes  
Does she want it?  
If I could have her tonight  
  
If I could have her tonight  
If I could have her tonight.
