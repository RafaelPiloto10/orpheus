I've been down this road walkin' the line  
That's painted by pride  
And I have made mistakes in my life  
That I just can't hide  
Oh I believe I am ready for what love has to bring  
Got myself together, now I'm ready to sing  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
I know there's so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
One by one, the chains around me unwind  
Every day now I feel that I can leave those years behind  
Oh I've been thinking of you for a long time  
There's a side of my life where I've been blind and so...  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
I know there's so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
Everything gonna be alright  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
Don't want to be alone in life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
Baby I been holding back now my whole life  
I've decided to move on now  
Gonna leave all my worries behind  
Oh I belive I am ready for what love has to give  
Got myself together now I'm ready to live  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
I know there's so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
Everything gonna be alright  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
Don't want to be alone in my life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
(Repeat Chorus)
