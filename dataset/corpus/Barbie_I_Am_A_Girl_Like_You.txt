Anneliese (speaking)-  
I'm savoring my first and last  
Taste of freedom before getting  
Married next week.  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
At least, you're not an  
Indentured servant.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Indentured servant?  
  
Erika-  
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot  
Madame Carp will make me pay,  
And I have to fetch the eggs myself  
And the barn's a mile away.  
It's cold and wet  
But still I get an omelette on my plate,  
But in my head I'm back in bed  
Snuggled up and sleeping late.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Really?  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Really. But it's all right.  
I mean, I'm used to it.  
And you?  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
Well...  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Well?  
Anneliese-  
If I want some eggs I ring the bell  
And the maid comes running in,  
And she serves them on a silver tray  
And she brings a cookie tin.  
And while I eat, she rubs my feet  
And strolling minstrels play,  
But I'd rather be in my library  
Reading science books all day.  
  
Erika-  
I'm just like you  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
(you are?)  
Erika-  
You're just like me  
There's somewhere else we'd rather be  
Somewhere that's ours  
Somewhere that dreams come true  
Yes I am a girl like you.  
You'd never think that it was so  
But now I've met you and I know,  
It's plain as day  
Sure as the sky is blue  
I am a girl like you.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
So, you're a singer?  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
No, I work at Madame Carp's penitentiary.  
Uh, I mean, Dress Emporium.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
I love Madame Carp's dresses!  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
I made the one you're wearing.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
You made this? The design looks so complicated!  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
Oh, it isn't really.  
(sings)  
First I choose a fabric from the rack  
And I pin the pattern down,  
And I stitch it in the front and back  
And it turns into a gown!  
Anneliese-  
I wear my gown  
Without my crown  
And dance around my room  
Both-  
And imagine life without the strife  
Of an unfamiliar groom.  
  
Anneliese (speaking)-  
But I'd never let my mother know.  
I wouldn't want to disappoint her.  
  
Erika (speaking)-  
I completely understand.  
  
Anneliese-  
I'm just like you  
Erika-  
(I think that's true)  
Anneliese-  
You're just like me  
Erika-  
(Yes I can see)  
Both-  
We take responsibility  
Anneliese-  
We carry through  
Erika-  
(We carry through)  
Both-  
Do what we need to go.  
Yes I am a girl like you.  
Anneliese-  
I'm just like you  
Erika-  
(I'm just like you)  
Anneliese-  
You're just like me  
Erika-  
(You're just like me)  
Both-  
It's something anyone can see  
Anneliese-  
A heart that beats  
Erika-  
(a heart that beats)  
Both-  
A voice that speaks the truth  
Yes I am a girl like you.
