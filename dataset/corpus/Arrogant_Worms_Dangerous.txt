Darling for you  
I think of what I'd so  
To keep you safe and sound  
I would climb the highest mountain  
I would swim the widest sea  
I would wrestle a gorilla to the ground  
I would fend off a dozen charging rhinos  
I would catch a storm of killer bees  
I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword  
If I didn't know what this could do to me  
  
'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)  
I'd really like to do it  
But I might get hurt  
It's dangerous (too dangerous)  
I don't feel like bleeding  
On my brand new shirt  
You might say I'm cowardly  
Or say I'll full of fright  
You might call me yellow  
And baby you'd be right!  
  
So I'd skip across volcanoes full of lava  
I'd even grab a tiger by the tail  
I would make fun of  
A boxing champion's mother  
But my courage and my bowels both would fail  
I would fight off a bunch  
Of angry Kosacks  
I would stop a thousand  
Bullets with my hand  
I would laugh  
As my leg was amputated..  
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!  
  
'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)  
I use big words  
But I never do the deed  
It's dangerous (too dangerous)  
I faint like a baby  
If I see somebody bleed  
I haven't got a backbone  
I'm as timid as a mouse  
I would find a cure for this  
But I can't leave the house!  
  
Cause it's dangerous  
Too dangerous  
Too dangerous  
  
For me!  
For me!  
For me.
