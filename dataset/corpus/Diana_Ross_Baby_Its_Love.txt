I should run away boy  
But I'm satisfied  
It's your way of loving  
That's filling my desires  
  
Baby when you're gone  
I wonder why you turn me on  
Ooh, you must be the only man for me  
'Cause you're the only one I see  
  
It's love, ooh baby it's love  
Baby it's love makes me weep for you  
  
I love your affection  
Take me in the right direction  
For the rest of my life  
  
I'm a slave for your love  
Just like mama said  
I should be without you  
But losing you I'm dead  
  
Your love is so tough  
I swear I just can't get enough  
Speaking to you with all sincerity  
You don't know what you do to me  
  
It's love, ooh baby it's love  
Baby it's love makes me weep for you  
  
I love your affection  
Take me in the right direction  
For the rest of my life  
  
Thanks a lot for your affection  
Always wanting your protection  
For the rest of my life  
  
It's love, ooh baby it's love  
Baby it's love makes me weep for you  
  
Thanks a lot for your affection  
Always wanting your protection  
For the rest of my life  
Baby, for the rest of my life  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
For the rest of my life  
Baby, always wanting your protection
