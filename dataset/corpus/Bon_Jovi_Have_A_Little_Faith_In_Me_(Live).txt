When the road gets dark  
And you can no longer see  
Let my love throw a spark  
Have a little faith in me  
  
And when the tears you cry  
Are all you can believe  
Give these loving arms a try baby  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
When your secret heart  
Cannot speak so easily  
From a whisper start  
To have a little faith in me  
  
And when your back's against the wall  
Just turn around and you will see  
I will catch your fall  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Solo  
  
When the road gets dark  
And you can no longer see  
Let my love throw a spark  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
I've been loving you for such a long time  
Expecting nothing in return  
Just for you to have a little faith in me  
You know time, time is our friend  
I will hold you up, I will hold you up  
Your love gives me strength enough  
  
Have a little faith in me
