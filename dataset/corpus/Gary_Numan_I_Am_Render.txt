I'm up here  
You're down there  
Call me the baitman  
I'm screaming for air  
Colour me black  
If you wish, but  
I don't believe  
I don't believe  
My God  
  
I don't crash  
Te sky moves  
I'll shape you dreams  
That a lifetime can't lose  
I won't talk  
I won't sing  
They call me render  
The shaper of things  
Oh God  
  
I'm not down  
I'm not ashamed  
Call it the job  
If you need something to blame  
Young reckless sleepers  
Still screaming for air  
I don't care  
I don't care  
Dear God
