[Chorus]  
I'll never swim Kern River again,  
It was there that I met him,  
There that I lost my best friend.  
Now I live in the mountains  
I drifted up here with the wind.  
And I may drown in still water,  
But I'll never swim Kern River again.  
  
He grew up in an oil town  
But that gusher never came in.  
And the river was a boundary  
Where my darling and I used to swim.  
One night in the moonlight,  
The swiftness swept his life away.  
Now I live on Lake Shasta,  
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay.  
  
There's the South San Joaquin  
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found.  
And theres a place called Mt. Whitney  
From where the mighty Kern River comes down.  
Now it's not deep nor wide,  
But it's a mean piece of water my friend.  
And I may cross on the highway,  
But I'll never swim Kern River again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
No, I'll never swim Kern River again.
