One mind divided into three, for every problem a personality  
Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select  
With sorrow comes reassurance, with confusion there's ignorance  
  
Deny who they are, a fantasy gone gone too far  
  
Protecting the weak points of the mind  
Defensive personalities  
Violent one minute calm the next  
Defensive Personalities  
  
Passed down from generations, years of pain and complication  
Darkness was a punishment, memories time cannot mend  
Brutalized from the day of birth, to reality they can't return  
  
Existing in a world of three lives inside of one  
  
Protecting the weak points of the mind  
Defensive personalities  
Violent one minute calm the next  
Defensive Personalities
