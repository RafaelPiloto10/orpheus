I can see you comin' mama yes you're movin' on down the line  
I can see you comin' mama yes you're movin' on down the line  
You done have left a thousand men and they're all back there cryin'  
She's a high falootin' woman and she just can't do no wrong  
She's a high falootin' woman and she just can't do no wrong  
She gonna' cry some day and I know it can't be too long  
She got hips like she oughta and Lord she can make 'em move  
She got hips like she oughta and Lord she can make 'em move  
And she'll do anything to make you get in her groove  
Lord have mercy on you woman and your wicked soul  
Lord have mercy on you woman and your wicked soul  
'Cause that high falootin' woman gonna' live 'till she's a hundred years
