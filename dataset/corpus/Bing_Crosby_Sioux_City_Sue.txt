Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue,  
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue  
I'd swap my horse and dog for you, oh  
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue  
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue.  
  
I drove a herd of cattle out  
From old Nebraska way  
That's how I come to be in the state of I-o-way.  
I met a gal and asked her how  
She said "Indeed I do"  
I asked her what her name was and she said  
"Sioux City Sue"  
  
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue,  
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue  
I'd swap my horse and dog for you, oh  
Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue  
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue.
