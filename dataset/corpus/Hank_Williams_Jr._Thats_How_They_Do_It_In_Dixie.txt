Cut-off jeans an' cowboy boots,  
Long blonde hair an' dark brown roots.  
Lord, pinch me:  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
  
Electric slidin' on a sawdust floor,  
Long-neck chaser for a,  
Shot of hard core whiskey:  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
  
Blue red "GO" stickers on the window says "Sugar n' spice.  
Baby, crank the bass up, ride it till you see, girl.  
Those pink paradise.  
Oh, ain't that nice.  
  
Down to the river to go for a dip.  
Rollin' them Levis off of her hip.  
Goin' Big Kenny skinny:  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
Splish-splash.  
  
Instrumental Break.  
  
Watermelon lip-gloss, kiss beneath the swamp moss,  
On a moonlit night.  
Bubble gum perfume, well placed tattoo,  
Above her hiney, high.  
(Oh my.)  
  
Belly button danglin', a twenty minute tan.  
You know, I'll go to Jerry Springer if you hit on my man.  
That girl will throw a hissy.  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
  
Cut-off jeans an' cowboy boots,  
Long blonde hair an' dark brown roots.  
Lord, pinch me:  
That's how they do it in Dixie:  
Yeah, yeah now.  
  
Y'all, that's how we do it in Dixie.  
  
Whoo I love them girls man.  
In Dixie.  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
That's right, class, that's how we do it in Dixie.  
  
Y'all, that's how we do it in Dixie.  
  
Bocephus, it's a pleasure.  
Let's get into the honky-tonk.  
Aw, had some good ridin' friends on this one.
