Every little whisper every little sound  
Brings me comfort whenever you're around  
A heart full of wonder and sweet reverie  
Gives me a reason a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
Forever's just begun  
We'll never turn and run  
Slowly we've become  
One, one  
  
Slowly we've become one  
I love the way we're different  
And the way we're the same  
Making love to each other  
Is like shelter from the rain  
  
Isn't it amazing  
What I see in your eyes  
I'll be your partner  
And never leave your side  
  
[Chorus]
