If we're so much the same like I always hear  
Why such different fortunes and fates?  
Some of us live in a cloud of fear  
Some live behind iron gates  
  
Why such different fortunes and fates?  
Some are blessed and some are cursed  
Some live behind iron gates  
While others see only the worst  
  
[Chorus:]  
Some are blessed and some are cursed  
The golden one or scarred from birth  
While others only see the worst  
Such a lot of pain on the earth  
  
The golden one or scarred from birth  
Somethings can never be changed  
Such a lot of pain on this earth  
It's somehow so badly arranged  
  
Somethings can never be changed  
Some reasons will never come clear  
It's somehow so badly arranged  
If we're so much the same like I always hear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some are blessed and some are cursed  
The golden one or scarred from birth  
While others only see the worst  
Such a lot of pain on the earth  
Such a lot of pain on the earth  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Such a lot of pain  
Such a lot of pain  
Such a lot of pain on the earth
