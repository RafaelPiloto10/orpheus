You know that you can find me  
On the way to Jerusalem  
But I took a magic carpet ride  
To a popular movie show  
And that's where I found her  
Was on the way to Jerusalem  
She was hangin' on silver screen  
A techni-color Michelangelo  
  
Well I was rollin'  
On the way to Jerusalem  
I was headed for the Promised Land  
And nothing make me go against the tide  
But I took a little turn, yeah  
Was on the way to Jerusalem  
What's another day more or less  
You pay your money  
And you take your ride  
  
One more day, gonna stay one more day  
Then I got to go  
On my way,  
Tell them I'm on my way  
But I need to know  
Does Jerusalem close?  
Does Jerusalem close?  
When does it close?  
  
Oh, yeah  
(You know that you could find me)  
Oh, yeah  
(On the way to Jerusalem)  
  
Oh, yeah  
(You know that you can find me)  
Oh yeah  
(On the way to Jerusalem)  
  
Oh, yeah  
(You know that you can find me)  
Oh, yeah  
(On the way to Jerusalem)  
  
Oh, yeah  
(You know that you can find me)  
Oh, yeah  
(On the way to Jerusalem)  
  
Oh, yeah  
(You know that you can find me)  
Oh, yeah  
(On the way to Jerusalem)  
  
Oh, yeah  
You know that you can find me  
Oh, yeah
