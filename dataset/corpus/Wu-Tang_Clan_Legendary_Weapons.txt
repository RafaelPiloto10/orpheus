I flip goods like a stock trader (get money!)  
Theodore rush the floor, we attack like Al'Qaeda  
Suicide missionary, black activist  
Nice with the tongue, I'm a verbal type masochist  
Tall body, my skin got Teflon fibers  
Dodge bullets, rock chains the size of barbed wire  
Roll big blunts, a whole ounce of reefer  
Rocked that "Black and Yellow" before Wiz Khalifa  
It's a killer bee color scheme, I blow mega cream  
Bingos face before I scream, know what I mean?  
Like Billie Jean, lightin' up the floor when I walk  
This is Staten Island, New York, eighty-seven cheeba hawk  
No pork, no swine on the rider  
If your chick loose or tighter, I'ma still get inside her  
Rebel porn star, thick like Dick Swellington  
Beat the pussy up, leave it soft like gelatin  
  
("What the hell is going on here?")  
("Man m-man m-man man I'm not playin', I kick the rough shit")  
("Say what?") ("I'm not I'm not I'm not playin'")  
("Direct from the Shaolin slum, here I come")  
("Right now, I'm teaching school")  
("There it is, you're fuckin' with pros and there it goes")  
("Yo") ("You don't wanna get too close to that man's razor")  
("You about to get cut up")  
  
You know the M.O., could never be in limbo  
No live have I die 'fore I cough up info  
Boss shit intro, horse dick nympho  
Smooth on the chicks like a ride on dick tempo  
Imprint flow make your bottom bitch unrobe  
Soft pushin' in-sole, stroll on tracks  
In the back of the bar when they told on black  
Plaques on plaques, got racks on racks  
So no need to ask why he act all that  
King Cognac, got a thing for them gats  
An eighties offspring, I'm a fiend for the facts  
Swing on the map, overseas with the G's  
In South Cackalak tryin to squeeze me some cheese  
Breezed on the D's when they tailed on the pipe  
Around the same time I exhaled on the mic  
The name AZ rings bells on site  
  
("What the hell is going on here?")  
("Man m-man m-man man I'm not playin', I kick the rough shit")  
("I offer you, reality!")  
("Direct from the Shaolin slum, here I come")  
("Right now, I'm teaching school")  
("There it is, you're fuckin' with pros and there it goes")  
("Yo") ("You don't wanna get too close to that man's razor")  
("You about to get cut up")  
  
I take money like a pool shark, put the eighth in my right pocket  
Hella cool dude and I won't hesitate to pop it  
Still a rude dude, try to replicate my doctrine  
Roll with mad killers, my niggas regulate the projects  
I'm hard body, I keep a young hottie  
You keep it Bon Jovi, you wear a thong probably  
Blaow! Nigga you fuckin' with a sick puppy  
B'ville up in this bitch it's 'bout to get ugly  
  
I could tell you I'm hood, but y'all should already know  
My affiliation of Wu contribute to the globe  
I'm worl'wide with it for sho', you better check  
Or get laced up from your face up and left off  
We don't just do it, we do it to death (y'all)  
Better respect some shit or we'll ruin your rep (c'mon!)  
The realness, that split this, kill or be killed shit  
It's still kill or be killed should of never concealed it  
  
("What the hell is going on here?")  
("Man m-man m-man man I'm not playin', I kick the rough shit")  
("Say what?") ("I'm not I'm not I'm not playin'")  
("Direct from the Shaolin slum, here I come")  
("Right now, I'm teaching school")  
("There it is, you're fuckin' with pros and there it goes")  
("Yo") ("You don't wanna get too close to that man's razor")
