Life can change in the blink of an eye  
You don't know when and you don't know why  
"Forever Young" is a big fat lie  
For the one who lives and the one who dies  
  
I watched my son - shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a full-grown man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and he's buryin' a friend  
Oh, goodbye two boys, hello one man  
  
This son of mine is gonna leave in the fall  
Some might ask how he stands so tall  
His life was changed with a telephone call  
Not even he understands it all  
  
I watched my son - shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a broken man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and he's buryin' a friend  
Oh, goodbye two boys, hello one man  
  
I watched my son - shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a full-grown man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and he's buryin' a friend  
Oh, goodbye two boys,  
Oh, goodbye two boys,  
Oh, goodbye my boys
