Midnight touch the black hills westward on the run  
Crimson clouds to the eastward painted by the setting sun  
Oh Jesse drove the pickup I slipped to the radio  
With some good time behind us and some good times ago  
Well we pulled into the station for some water and some gasoline  
I jumped when I heard sweet Jesse from the pong when she let out of scream  
Oh come here quick I said hon grab your boots and comb your hair  
Do believe the fellow here's got an old pet dancin' bear  
Dance dance Dakota dance dance until the break of day  
Me and sweet Jesse ain't never seen a bear like that dance that well  
It's a one step two step three step four  
A bottle of soda and he'll dance some more  
Dance dance Dakota dance dance around the country store  
  
There was set up camp in the pick up and we stayed a better day or two  
Me and my baby are ramblin' around we couldn't think of nothing better to do  
Jesse blow the mouth harp Dakota done the pack and wing  
I broke all the strings off my Fender guitar and we began to sing  
Dance dance Dakota dance...  
Dance dance Dakota dance dance around the country store
