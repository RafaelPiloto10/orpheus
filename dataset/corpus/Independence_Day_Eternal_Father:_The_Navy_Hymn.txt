Eternal Father, strong to save,  
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,  
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep,  
It's own appointed limits keep.  
  
Oh hear us when we cry to Thee,  
For those in peril on the sea! Amen.  
  
Eternal Father, lend Thy grace To  
Those with wings who fly thro' space,  
Thro wind and storm, thro' sun and rain,  
Oh bring them safely home again.  
  
Oh Father, hear an humble prayer,  
For those in peril in the air! Amen.  
  
Oh Trinity of love and pow'are,  
Our brethren shield in danger's hour,  
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,  
Protect them where so e'er they go.  
  
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee  
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea! Amen.
