It's no use knocking on my door  
I won't be answering any more  
So don't come round here like you did before  
I'm moving out, no doubt about it  
  
Take the video  
Take the stereo  
Take the dog and the cat and the Bonio  
Take the TV and the rug and the radio  
I packed my bags  
Come on, let's go  
  
Take the bicycle that's in the hall  
Take the pictures and the ducks off the wall  
This is it, don't let the teardrops fall  
I'm moving out today  
  
Take the video  
Take the stereo  
Take the dog and the cat and the Bonio  
Take the TV and the rug and the radio  
I packed my bags  
Come on, let's go
