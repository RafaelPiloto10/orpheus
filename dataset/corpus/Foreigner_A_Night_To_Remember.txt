I can't sleep tonight  
I won't sleep tomorrow  
I'm goin' deep and tight  
I don't need no excuse  
I feel mean tonight  
One-eyed jacks and aces  
Read 'em and weep tonight  
I'm gonna let all hell break loose  
  
I want drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who could shake me  
Yeah, be my love machine  
  
I need a love machine  
to keep my motor running  
Upon the big wide screen  
I want to see it all  
Yeah, we'll be lean and mean  
We'll be synchronized together  
Me and my love machine  
We're gonna do it all  
  
I want drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who can rock me  
Yeah, my little love machine  
  
We're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
We're going hard and strong  
Again and again  
Yeah, we're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah we're gonna take tonight  
Right to the end  
  
I need drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who can rock me  
I need a love machine  
  
We gotta make tonight  
A night to remember  
We're goin' hard and strong  
Again and again  
  
Yeah, we're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah we're goin' for a night  
A night without end  
  
We gotta make tonight  
A night to remember  
We're goin' hard and strong  
Again and again  
  
We're gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah we're gonna take tonight  
Right to the end
