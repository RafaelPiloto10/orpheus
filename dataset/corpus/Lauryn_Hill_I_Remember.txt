I remember  
When you look into my eyes  
You saw right through me  
And I could not hide  
I was exposed  
Just like a town  
All of my heart  
You hold it in your hands  
I'm yours to command  
I'm yours to demand  
I, I feel so vulnerable  
With you in my life  
With you in my life  
I remember  
When I looked into your eyes  
I saw a reflection of myself  
And I could not lie  
Out of control  
Too weak to deny  
All of myself  
Is naked before you  
But what can I do  
There is nothing I can do  
I feel so beautiful  
With you in my life  
With you in my life  
I remember  
I remember  
I remember  
I, ohh, ohh, ohh  
With you in my life  
With you in my life
