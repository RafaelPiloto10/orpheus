Well they told me not to come around you anymore  
Said I should find something to do  
And it filled me with an anger that I can't ignore  
But I'm sure it didn't come from you  
  
Everyone says I'm touched inside  
That you don't even know I'm alive  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak, can you hear me?  
I've got your picture pasted on the wall  
Little Miss Heartbreak, need you near me  
Without you, I'm nothing at all  
  
Is there something I can change in me to suit your taste?  
Something clever I can say?  
Left my number at your room again, just in case  
You want a quiet place to stay  
  
I'm not just another face in the crowd  
I'm here to tell you clear and loud  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak, can you hear me?  
I've got your picture pasted on the wall  
Little Miss Heartbreak, need you near me  
Without you, I'm nothing at all  
  
I can't stop these chills you give me  
Every time you come through the door  
I won't just stand by and watch you  
Like a schoolboy anymore... Yeah...  
  
Ooh, I wait by the mailbox, stare at the phone  
How can you leave me here alone?  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak, can you hear me?  
I've got your picture pasted on my wall  
Miss Heartbreak, need you near me  
Without you, I'm nothing... Yeah...  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak, I know you see me  
How can you go on treating me this way?  
Little Miss Heartbreak, believe me  
I'm gonna make you mine someday  
  
Yeah, Little Miss Heartbreak  
I'm gonna make you mine someday  
  
Yeah, Little Miss Heartbreak...  
  
Miss Heartbreak...
