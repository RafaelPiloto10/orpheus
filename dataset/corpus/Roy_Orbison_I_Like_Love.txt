Well everyday and every way  
I know that love is a here to stay  
'Cause I like it, mmmm I like it  
I'm in a stew over what to do  
But I like makin love to you  
Yeah I like love and I like lovin you.  
  
They say that love will make you blind  
That may be true yeah but I don't mind  
'Cause I like it ooooh I like it  
I'm kinda mixed up it's awful tough  
But I like love and that's enough  
Yeah I like love and I like lovin you

Lovin you is sure alright  
'Cause I like it, ooooh I like it  
I'm in a stew over what to do  
But I like makin love to you

Just want to love you both night and day  
'Cause I like it oooh I like it

But I like love, and that's enough  
Yeah I like love and I like lovin you  
  
Now ever since you looked at me  
I've been barkin up your tree  
'Cause I like it, oooh I like it
