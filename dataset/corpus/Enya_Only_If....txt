When there's a shadow near, reach for the sun  
When there is loving here, look for the one  
And for the promises, there is the sky  
And for the heavens are those who can fly  
  
Chorus:  
If you really want to, you can hear me say  
Only if you want to will you find a way  
If you really want to you can seize the day  
Only if you want to will you fly away  
  
Interlude:  
na na na...  
  
When there's a journey to follow the star  
When there's an ocean to sail to far  
And for the broken hearts there is the sky  
And for tomorrow are those who can Fly  
  
Chorus....  
Bridge:  
Je voudrais voler, comme un oiseau d'ailleurs  
(bis) d'ailleurs  
  
Chorus...
