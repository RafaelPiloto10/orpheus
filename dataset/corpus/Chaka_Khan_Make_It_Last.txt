Come on and stay with me for a little while  
Hey can't we spend some time together  
You look so good to me and I like your style  
Come on let's make it last forever  
I'm not an ordinary woman  
I just want to love you with all my might  
You better believe that I'm a good one  
And I wanna guarantee I'll treat you right  
Come on and stay with me for a little while  
Come on and spend some time together  
Whatever it takes I'm gonna make you smile  
Hey can't we make it last forever  
I know that love's a gamble  
Puttin' all my lovin' on the line  
There ain't a man that I can't handle  
Give me your love, and I'll give you mine
