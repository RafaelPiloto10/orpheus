The grass it seems greener since I saw it last  
New beauty keeps springing from out of my past  
These old things seem so good to me  
And you most of all  
And you most of all  
  
The day that I left here this place seemed so wrong  
Saw many just like it all summer long  
I thought of you, not someone new  
It's here I belong  
I was sure you'd be gone  
  
It doesn't matter where I went  
I don't regret the time I spent  
The things I learnt just brought me back to you  
  
Here I stand in your doorway and what will you do  
The best I can hope for is that you'll want me too  
I took the chance of losing you  
And it's you that I found, and me
