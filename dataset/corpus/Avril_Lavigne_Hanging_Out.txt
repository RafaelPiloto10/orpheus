Everytime you go away  
It actually kinda makes my day  
Everytime you leave you slam the door  
You pick your words so carefully  
You hate to think your hurting me  
You leave me laughing on the floor cuz  
  
Chorus:  
I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I'm not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks he's all that  
  
I thought we were just hanging out  
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth  
You thought the way you'd taste would get me high  
You went to all your friends to brag  
Guys are always such a drag  
Don't you know the reason that I kissed ya was to say goodbye cause  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Hanging, hanging out, I am simply hanging, hanging out  
I am simply hanging, so why'd you kissed me on the mouth  
Don't you know that I  
  
I don't give a damn about you, I won't give it up, not for you  
I don't give a damn about you, I won't give it up, not for you  
I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy, a guy who thinks he's all that  
  
(chorus slowly fades)
