Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune, something to make us all feel happy.  
Do anything to take (keep) us out of this gloom  
Sing a song, play guitar, make us happy.  
  
You are the one who makes us feel glad  
Please don't be sad to take up the straight life you had  
We wouldn't have known you all these years.  
  
Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune, something to treat us happy.  
Do anything to take (keep) us out of this gloom  
Sing a song, play guitar, make us happy.
