You've got a party heart, a gay time party heart  
You're only happy when the party's going on  
And it makes me sad because I know that party's have to end  
And when this party's over, you'll be gone  
  
I love your party heart your playful party heart  
But though you make me laugh you also make me cry  
'Cause I know you only think of me as just a party friend  
And when the party's done you'll say goodbye  
  
A playtime girl like you plays lots of thrills in life it seems  
But oh, what I'd ever give to be the playboy of your dreams  
I'd tame your party heart, your fickle party heart  
And someday that's just what some party boy will do  
  
But I love you so, I guess that I'll cry just as much as you  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two  
When someone breaks your party heart in two...
