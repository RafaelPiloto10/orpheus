Why do you cry for me?  
Why do you fake that you don't see me?  
When you change everybody's path  
But you know that...  
One day you are going to see me with different eyes  
  
Chorus:  
  
I don't know if I will survive without you in my arms  
Then now...  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the dark and from the death  
  
If I die, the love that I feel for you will ressucitateme from  
The gray of the evil and dark  
And the sun will shine for me again, yeah  
The love is indestructible against the evil  
I dream that I have you with me  
So tell me why do you cry for me?  
Come with me, you won't regret it  
  
Chorus:  
  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much I love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the death  
  
Chorus:  
  
I don't know if I will survive without you in my arms  
Then now...  
Give me a chance  
Let me show you how much I love you  
Oh, I need you to survive in the darkness  
Save me from the dark and from the death  
  
(Repeat chorus 2x)
