They say the heart must feel it all.  
Know every rise and everyfall.  
To earn the right to stand in sunlight.  
Someday the sun will always shine.  
Deep down inside this heart of mine.  
And it will be my time.  
  
Rivers keep flowing.  
Cold winds keep blowing inside me.  
I walk alone.  
Hard rain keep fallin'  
Lost souls keep callin' so lonely.  
I hope I find.  
Love in time  
Love in time.  
  
You know a man can't always choose.  
Love has its rhythm and its blues.  
I hope it's there for me.  
  
Rivers keep flowing.  
Cold winds keep blowing inside me.  
I walk alone.  
Hard rains keep callin' so lonely.  
I hope I find .  
Love in time.  
Love in time.  
  
I hope I find it.  
Shinin' somewhere  
Somewhere out there.  
There will be love in time.  
In time.  
  
Rivers keep flowing (again this part)...
