La la la  
La la la  
  
My eyes that cannot see  
Other guys that are cuter  
And my ears that cannot hear  
My friends say I should walk away  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you  
  
My knees that all go weak that all go kiddiup  
When you don't call me and my head  
It thousand spend so don't tell me  
Without your sweet happen  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you  
  
My mind is buggin' out when I think you're in  
Seem it wrong like I expect  
And my toes watch them curl  
So don't call me, babe, 'cause I'm your little girl  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you  
  
La la la  
La la la  
  
My mind is buggin out when I think you're in  
Seem it wrong like I expect  
And my toes watch them curl  
So don't call me, babe, 'cause I'm your little girl  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you  
  
La la la  
La la la
