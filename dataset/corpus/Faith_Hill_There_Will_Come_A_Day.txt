It's not easy trying to understand  
How the world can be so cold, stealing the souls of man  
Cloudy skies rain down on all your dreams  
You wrestle with the fear and doubt  
Sometimes it's hard but you gotta believe  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a better place, where our Father waits  
And every tear He'll wipe away  
The darkness will be gone,the weak shall be strong  
Hold on to your faith  
  
There will come a day, there will come a day  
Wars are raging, lives are scattered  
Innocence is lost, and hopes are shattered  
The old are forgotten, the children are forsaken  
In this world we're living in  
Is there anything sacred?  
  
There will come a day, there will come a day  
The song will ring out, down those golden streets  
The voices of earth with the angels will sing  
Every knee will bow, sin will have no trace  
  
In the glory of His amazing grace  
Every knee will bow, sin will have no trace  
In the glory of His amazing grace  
There will come a day, there will come a day  
  
Oooh there will come a day  
I know there's coming a day, coming a day
