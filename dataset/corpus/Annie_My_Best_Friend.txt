My best friend, where are you?  
Tell me where are you  
Can't seem to find you anywhere  
Where will I meet you?  
  
Thought I saw you last night smiling at me  
Thought I heard your voice calling for me  
Did I imagine it, was it a dream?  
What do you look like, are you just like me?  
  
My best friend, where are you?  
Tell me where are you  
Can't seem to find you anywhere  
Where will I meet you?  
  
Thought I saw you last night smiling at me  
Thought I heard your voice calling for me  
Day after day looking for something new  
Closer and closer the months between you  
  
My best friend, where are you?  
Tell me where are you  
Can't seem to find you anywhere  
Where will I meet you?  
  
Oh where ever will I meet you now?  
You didn't know  
You've been alone  
You've been away  
  
There's always something out there
