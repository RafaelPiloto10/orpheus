A G-string is looking for a pilot  
White flesh is coming down the stairs again  
Your look just makes me a believer  
Stray cats are landing in a rain storm  
Crashed down lost in wango tango land  
Spaced out your body gives me fever  
You sex it  
Relax it  
Reload it  
You want it freshly squeezed  
Closed down the road of all restrictions  
Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again  
Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers  
Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight  
Exit is the door that I can't find  
Black out it can't get it any deeper  
You sex it  
Relax it  
Reload it  
And never hold it  
You slash it  
Refresh it  
Reload it  
You want it fresh  
Got no diamonds rings  
But a song to sing  
Just to make you fly  
Beggar or a king
