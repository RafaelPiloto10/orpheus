Close my eyes  
My mind looks for you everywhere  
You and I intertwined  
In everything we share  
  
You watch me  
Undercover, dirty lover  
1-900-anything  
Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3, 4  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there  
  
Staring out the blinds  
Like I'm in a picture frame  
Dancing out of time  
While you're whispering my name  
  
You've got me in the shutter  
You've got my number  
See the writing on the wall  
Makes me feel like 1984  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there  
  
It's just that sometimes  
I think I notice  
A certain change going by  
  
And if I...  
Before I know it, I turn a blind eye  
And I can't see clear anymore  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there
