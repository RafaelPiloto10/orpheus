I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
Take your little knife, stab me  
Go, strike my heart  
Take your little knife, stab me  
Go, strike my heart  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
Such things can't exist  
Such things can't exist  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
You will tell them of me  
And how one day I shall come for them  
You will tell them of me  
And how one day I shall come for them  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
Quietly, I will come over your bed  
I will lean over and gently bite your neck  
Ringmaster, ringmaster  
Ringmaster, ringmaster  
Ringmaster, ringmaster  
Ringmaster  
Ringmaster  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose, I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
You will tell them of me  
And how one day I shall come for them
