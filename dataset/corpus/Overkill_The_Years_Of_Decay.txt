Out on this road takes its toll  
And you pay for everything you do  
Under lights, made me blind  
This place is the same as last night  
Out of control takes its toll  
But you learn to live with your dreams  
Speaking your mind to those you find  
Listening to what you have to say  
I wouldn't change the way  
I wouldn't stop the decay  
  
Promised the world, as your world  
Changed before your eyes  
And the days became the weeks  
And the weeks the years  
And no one remembers that very first day  
Or how it slipped away  
Forever I wait, pulling in, pulling out  
As the motors whine  
To remind me I'm home  
And I'm here to stay  
As we decay  
Another day  
Decay away  
  
I'm goin' home, I don't know where  
I'm goin' home, not far from here  
  
Out on this road, paint this toll  
Make me whole, set the stage  
Fill it with anger, fill it with rage  
No I don't know what's today  
I know it falls in the years of decay  
Self, sacrifice, every night  
And together we paid a price in blood  
That spilled out through the years  
And another day passes away  
Look to the black, drawn farther back  
Look to each day, see the decay  
Times I've had, good and bad  
Win or lose, this is what I choose
