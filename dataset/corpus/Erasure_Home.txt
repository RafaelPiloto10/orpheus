I ain't never going home  
Cause I'm having a good time  
I ain't never going home  
Cause my time is come  
  
I'll wait for the winter to lie at my door  
White stretches out before me  
Leads me to the hall  
  
White circles play within my mind  
Ices over and freezes life  
Time will come, time will come, time will fall  
Bringing the world to its feet  
Bringing the world to its feet  
  
I ain't never turning back  
Cause I've come this far  
And I'm lost within my tracks  
I will follow the north star  
  
I'll wait 'til the springtime is breathing at my door  
The wilderness before me  
Heeds the lion's roar  
  
White circles play within my mind  
Ices over and freezes life  
Time will come, time will come, time will fall  
Bringing the world to its feet  
Bringing the world her hands and her knees  
  
I'll wait 'til the winter is lying at my door  
Time stretches out before me  
A stone's throw from the door  
  
White circles play within my mind  
Ices over and freezes life  
Time will come, time will come, time will fall  
Bringing the world to its feet  
Bringing the world to her hands and her feet  
  
Bringing the world to its feet  
I ain't never going home
