Well, we're the ravers, we just want to come out and play  
If you try to keep us down, you better get out of our way  
If you don't know by now, I'm tellin' you we're here to stay  
We're a super-charged machine like a rock-mobile  
Our pistons are poppin' right under your wheels  
We're the ravers, oh yeah  
The ravers (ahh, yeah yeah yeah)  
The ravers, look out  
They say we're brats with no manners or pride  
Our reputation's spreadin' far and wide  
A bottle of gin is all we need tonight  
A hell-raisin' night  
Start to shake, oh yeah  
We're a super-charged machine like a rock-mobile  
Our pistons are poppin' right under your wheels  
We're the ravers, oh yeah  
The ravers (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)  
The ravers, watch out  
We're givin' you the rest, gonna give it to you 'n' you  
Look out baby, or we'll get you too  
We go anyway, way we choose  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere, we wanted too  
Here we go  
We're the ravers  
The ravers  
The ravers (oh yeah)  
Well we're a super-charged machine like a rock-mobile  
Our pistons are poppin' right under your wheels  
We're the ravers, oh yeah  
The ravers, yeah yeah yeah, yeah-e-yeah  
The ravers come on down  
We're here to stay!
