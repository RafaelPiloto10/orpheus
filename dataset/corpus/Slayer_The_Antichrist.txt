Screams and nightmares  
Of a life I want  
Can't see living this lie no  
A world I haunt  
You've lost all control of my  
Heart and soul  
Satan holds my future  
Watch it unfold  
  
I am the Antichrist  
It's what I was meant to be  
Your God left me behind  
And set my soul to be free  
  
Watching disciples  
Of the satanic rule  
Pentagram of blood  
Holds the jackal's truth  
Searching for the answer  
Christ hasn't come  
Awaiting the final moment  
The birth of Satan's son  
  
Screams,  
From a life I live  
Torment,  
Is what I give  
Torture,  
Is what I love  
The down fall,  
Of the heavens above  
  
I am the Antichrist  
All love is lost  
Insanity is what I am  
Eternally my soul will rot
