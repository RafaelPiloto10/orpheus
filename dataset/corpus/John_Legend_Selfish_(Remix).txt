[Chorus:]  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby  
  
Gotta admit to this little addiction  
To the ladies and they just can't fix him  
Conversation and the drinks start mixin'  
And I'm a champ like the Detroit Pistons  
  
I tried to contain myself  
But I can't restrain myself  
I can only blame myself  
Maybe I need to get some help  
  
So what can I do?  
It's so hard to chew  
This one's for you  
Yeah all of you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby  
  
The startin' five how do I pick them?  
I came up with this rating system  
I think about how it feels when I kiss them  
And when I'm gone do I truly miss them?  
Well baby, you made the team  
Now go cook my favorite things  
Some greens and some chicken wings  
Tastes so good that you make me wanna sing  
  
So what can I do?  
It's so hard to chew  
This one's for you  
Yeah all of you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby  
  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby
