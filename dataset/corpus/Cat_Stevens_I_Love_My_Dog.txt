I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
All he asks from me is the food to give him strength  
All he ever needs is love and that he knows he'll get  
  
So, I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
All the pay I need comes shining through his eyes  
I don't need no cold water to make me realize that  
  
I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana...  
  
I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade, my dog will always come through.  
  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana...  
  
I love my dog, baby, I love my dog. Na, na, na...  
I love my dog, baby, I love my dog. Na, na, na...
