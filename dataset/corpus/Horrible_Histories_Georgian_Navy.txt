Sailors:  
Were the Georgian navy  
We've never been beat  
Thanks to Admiral Nelson  
Commander of the fleet  
  
Nelson:  
The only things I've lost is this eye and this arm  
  
Sailor:  
Yes, playing with these balls  
Can really do you harm (ow)  
He's the gaffe  
He's the boss  
Knows every naval trick  
Surprising thing about him is  
Sailing makes him sick  
  
All:

Nelson:  
When it comes to my attack the gunners are my team  
  
Gunners:  
We got the strongest arsenal the world has ever seen  
Thanks our team practice we are magic with a ball  
  
Nelson:  
It means the French and Spanish ships  
Don't stand a chance at All  
  
Sailors:  
We can get nasty injuries  
Sometimes it's best to die  
If you're hit by the enemy  
You're lucky to survive (Magic sponge? Magic saw!)  
  
Nelson:  
You've got to wait to fight  
Only do it when it's right  
Got to break their line  
They'll be swimming in the brine  
Pick your time to shoot  
Then they're ships we're going to loot  
Going to be a hoot  
For scurvy have some fruit  
  
Sailor:  
Half-time orange, anyone?  
  
All:  
Georgian navy
