I guess I'll go to California  
Seems like I'm always on the run  
Nobody ever needs a loser  
We just exist under the sun  
But someday, somehow, someone may need me  
When my drifting days are done  
  
Well, I'm aimlessly drifting  
Looks like I live from day to day  
Hard as I try to make a showing  
Something is always in my way  
Even the one I truly love now  
Deals in the games that people play  
  
Every time I love I always lose  
Seems like I'll never ever win  
Each I hear them lonesome blues  
I'm all alone at home again  
Seems like I'm just existing  
Aimlessly drifting to no end  
  
All that I ask of this old world  
Is just to have a happy home  
All that I ask of one little girl  
Is just to be my very own  
It seems just like I'm just existing  
Aimlessly drifting along  
  
Yes, I'll go to California  
Seems like I'm always on the run  
Nobody ever needs a loser  
I just exist under the sun  
But someday, somehow, someone may need me  
But my drifting days be done
