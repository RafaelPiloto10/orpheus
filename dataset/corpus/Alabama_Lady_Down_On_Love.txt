It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen  
A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams  
The ties that once bound her now are broke away  
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play  
  
She never thought that love could ever end so soon  
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon  
When he asked her to marry and she glady said O.K  
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To a man who would love her and never let her down  
  
Well, I know a lady that's down on her love  
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch  
But work took me a way from home late at nights  
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights  
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust  
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To man who would love her and never let her down  
Now she's a lady down on love
