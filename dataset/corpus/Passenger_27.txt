27 years, 27 years old  
Only thing I know, the only thing that gets old  
I gotta sell out if I want to get sold  
Don't want the devil to be taking my soul  
I write songs that come from my heart  
I don't give a fuck if they get into the chart, oh no  
Only way I can be, is to say what I see  
And have my shadow hanging over me  
  
I don't know where I'm running but I know how to run  
'Cause, running's the thing I've always done  
I don't know what I'm doing but I know what I've done  
I'm a hungry heart, I'm a loaded gun  
  
27 years, 27 years now, only thing I know, I know that I don't know how  
To please everybody all of the time  
'Cause everybody always fucking changes their mind  
A little bit of faith and a little bit of chain  
Don't want to stop, won't be persuaded  
To write words I can't believe in, to see my face on a video screen  
  
I don't know where I'm running but I know how to run  
'Cause, running's the thing I've always done  
I don't know what I'm doing but I know what I've done  
I'm a hungry heart, I'm a loaded gun  
  
Oh oh, oh, ooooh, ooh, oh, oh oh, oooooh, oh oh, oooh  
  
27 years, 27 years done  
Written 600 songs, only 12 get sung  
87, 000 cigarettes have passed through these lungs and  
Every single day I wish I'd never smoked 1  
A week brushing my teeth and a week getting my haircut  
8 years sleeping, I'm still tired when I wake up  
A whole year eating and I still lost weight fuck  
5 proper girlfriends and 5 messy breakups  
27 birthdays, 27 new years  
30, 000 quid, just so I could have a few beers  
Ever dying old hopes, ever growing new fears  
Don't know how I'm going, but I know how I'm going here  
  
Don't know where I'm running but I know how to run  
'Cause, running's the thing I've always done  
Said I don't know what I'm doing but I know what I've done  
I'm a hungry heart, I'm a loaded gun
