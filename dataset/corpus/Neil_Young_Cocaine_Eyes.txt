Ain't a day goes by, I don't burn a little bit of my soul  
Ain't a day goes by, I don't burn a little bit of my soul  
Scored some friends along the way  
Did what I did, said what I had to say  
And I'd do it all again if I had to today  
When all is said and done  
I'm the one.  
It's a long hard road when your friends start to leave you behind  
It's a long hard road when you try to find peace of mind  
Some might go for poison  
And some go for too much stuff  
Some just go to sleep at night  
And forget to wake up.  
Cocaine eyes  
Can't hide your face  
It's no surprise  
You lose the race  
Again.  
Ain't a day goes by, I don't burn a little bit of my soul  
Ain't a day goes by, I don't burn a little bit of my soul  
Scored some friends along the way  
Did what I did, said what I had to say  
And I'd do it all again if I had to today  
'Cause when all is said and done  
I'm the one.  
I'm the one, yeah.  
Cocaine eyes  
It won't hide your face  
It's no surprise  
You lost the race  
Once again  
My old friend.
