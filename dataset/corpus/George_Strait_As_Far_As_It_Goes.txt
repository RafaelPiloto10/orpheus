Lately I've found myself fallin'  
Deeper in love with you  
I'm not the kind of guy  
Who gets swept away  
So here's what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna give you this heart of mine  
But that's where I draw the line  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only gonna give you everything  
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road  
I'm gonna love you one day past forever  
But that's as far as it goes  
  
I know it may not sound like much  
But baby, make no mistake  
I'm gonna treat you with more tenderness  
Than any one woman can take  
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true  
But after that, baby, I'm through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've got your limits, I've got mine  
I'm only gonna go the distance  
Time after time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But that's as far as it goes
