It's winter-fall  
Read skies are gleaming, oh  
Sea-gulls are flyin' over  
Swans are floatin' by  
Smoking chimney-tops  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming...?  
  
The nights draw in  
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah  
Children are fantasizing  
Grown-ups are standin' by  
What a super feeling  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming...?  
Woh-woh-woh-woh  
  
(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful  
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful  
(Dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air  
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view  
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene  
With the dreams of the world  
In the palm of your hand  
  
(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat  
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that  
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by  
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face  
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!  
And the dream of the child  
Is the hope of the, hope of the man  
  
It's all so beautiful  
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah  
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh  
Little girls scream an' cry  
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'  
It's unbelievable  
Sends me reeling  
Am I dreaming  
Am I dreaming...?  
  
Oooh - it's bliss
