Where were you when I was fallin' down  
Buzzin' round your heart  
Why'd you wait till I was moving on  
To come out of the dark  
  
To say I'm what you need  
And you could spend your life with me  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I can't help you now  
(sorry baby, I can't help you)  
No, I can't help you now  
(keep away, I've fallen in love)  
Maybe there was a time  
But sometimes time runs out  
And I can't help you know  
  
Forty days since I stopped countin' the days  
And countin' the ways that I loved you  
Good long while since I found  
Good enough reasons to stop believin' that you  
Are what I really want  
And now that you you do baby, I don't  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now you sayin' the one you need  
And you could spend your life with me  
But I can't help you know,no  
  
I can't help you know  
  
Baby there was a time  
And I wish I could somehow  
But I can't help you  
Can't help you know
