When I'm feeling down  
And feeling sad  
You come around  
And make me glad  
I got you  
Oh, my little chicken  
  
I love your feet  
I love your breasts  
I love the way you eat gravel  
To help you digest  
Oh, my little chicken  
  
People say you're using me  
In your heart you're a killer  
But I know the worst  
I should fear is  
A slight case of salmonella  
So lie right back  
Don't you cry  
If an egg can fit in there  
Why can't I.....mmmmmmm  
Oh my little  
  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawk  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawk  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawking Bawk,  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawking Bawk  
  
You're my love  
My little chicken likes  
To wear garter belts
