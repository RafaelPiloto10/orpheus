Flying through the sky  
His true love waits.  
Lonely time's gone by.  
There's a problem at the border  
He learns they won't let him through.  
She was standing in the rain.  
She waits in vain for you.  
She was standing in the rain.  
She knows her love will pull her through.  
Immigration law must be obeyed.  
Close the case, return another day.  
On the phone he tries to tell her  
He must go without a single word.  
She was standing in the rain.  
She waits in vain for you.  
She was standing in the rain.  
She knows her love will pull her through.  
Taking to the cloudy skies again,  
The city lights shimmer on the plane.  
In his eyes he sees the sadness,  
For his love will always be the same.  
She was standing in the rain.  
She waits in vain for you.  
She was standing in the rain.  
She knows her love will pull her through.
