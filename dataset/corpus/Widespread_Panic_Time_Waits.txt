Someday, there'll be nothing more to say  
When life is seen as the dance of the seven veils  
Well, each teaser reveals the beauty that was always already there  
My body and soul and my car are not for sale  
  
Some days are made of silent anticipation  
Some days are just quarter-pumping, cheap peepshows  
Oh, make-believe is all we have some of these days  
Tie your money to your dog if you fear you might lose your way  
  
The sun slips off each night to enjoy on the other side of town  
Where barstools, and dreamers, and glasses all get refilled  
Clocks and bar tabs are just numbers and memories fighting gravity against the
wall  
Steamboat fishlight dancin' on the windowsill  
  
Oh, the jukebox man never hits us with the latest  
No, he just brushes the the dust from the grooves of the songs we love  
Wow a drunk couple sayin' "baby no,no you are no you are no you,you are the
greatest"  
Haloes and hornies, they're squared off toe to toe  
  
Some day there'll be nothing more to say  
As life is seen as the dance of the seven veils  
Each teaser reveal the beauty that was always already there  
My body and soul and my car are not for sale  
My body and soul and my car are not for sale  
My body and soul and my car are not for sale
