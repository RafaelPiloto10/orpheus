I see a red door  
And I want to paint it black  
No colors anymore  
I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by  
Dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head  
Until my darkness goes  
I see a line of cars  
And they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love  
Both never to come back  
I people turn their heads  
And quickly look away  
Like a newborn baby  
It just happens everyday  
I look inside myself  
See my heart is black  
I see my red door  
And I wanna paint it black  
Maybe then I'll fade away  
Not have to face the facts  
It's not easy facing up  
When your whole world is black  
No more will my green sea  
Will turn a deeper blue  
I could not foresee  
This thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough  
Into the setting sun  
My love will laugh with me  
Before the morning comes  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as night  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as coal  
...
