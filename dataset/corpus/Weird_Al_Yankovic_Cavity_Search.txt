Listenin' to the Muzak  
Hearin' people scream  
Sittin' in the waiting room  
Readin' crappy magazines  
  
With a toothache  
This is it, pal  
Root canal  
My molars are impacted  
  
I'm gettin' gum disease  
I'm gonna need some fillings  
Got twelve cavities  
Can you help me  
  
Have mercy  
Doctor, please  
  
My teeth are a fright  
Got a huge overbite  
Numb me, drill me  
Floss me, bill me  
  
You jab at my nerve endings  
It's driving me insane  
Just give me nitrous oxide  
Shoot me up with novocaine  
  
Help me out here  
'Cause I'm in severe  
Pain  
Please stop for a bit  
  
Now let me rinse and spit  
Numb me, drill me  
Floss me, bill me  
  
You validate my parking  
I think that I'm okay  
But you my one more appointment for  
A week from Saturday  
  
'Cause you came upon  
A little problem on  
My x-ray  
Oy vey!  
  
It's getting absurd  
Well, I hope I'm insured, now  
Numb me, drill me  
Floss me, bill me
