Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.  
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.  
Why do the people always look at me?  
Nobody can see that we are you,  
We are you.  
She's him, too.  
She's him, too.  
Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.  
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.  
Umm, hummm.  
Umm, hummm.  
  
Solid brass statuary guards the door  
Used to come as one, now it comes as four.  
Somebody here just sent for more  
Red and yellow cartoons saying we need two  
We need two.  
More than you.  
More than you.  
Solid brass statuary guards the door  
Used to come as one, now it comes as four.  
Umm, hummm.  
Umm, hummm.  
  
Somebody stole they mind.  
Somebody stole they mind.  
They way they can't find  
What is kind.  
What is kind.  
  
Somebody stole they mind.  
Somebody stole they mind.  
They way they can't find  
What is kind.  
What is kind.  
  
Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.  
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.  
Why do the people walk away from me?  
Nobody can see that we are you,  
We are you.  
She's him, too.  
She's him, too.  
Fine man, crazy man, he can't see.  
Sound of the sunset, sound of the sea.  
Umm, hummm.  
Umm, hummm.
