Verse 1:  
Somebody asked me how I knew  
Oh you were the one for me baby  
And I was the one for you  
I never had to ask myself that question why?  
  
Chorus:  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I can't deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside  
  
Verse 2:  
Oh everyday I thank the lord above  
For the sweet essence of your love  
Oh I know this love was meant to be,  
You are the biggest part of me  
Deeper than the deepest ocean  
Oh I take the pride in knowing  
That I got you by my side  
Ever waiting, ever standing by  
  
Chorus:  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I can't deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside  
  
Verse 3:  
Not an hour out of the million days  
Could you ever take your sweet love away  
Not a one day out of the million years  
Could I ever live without you here  
Inside everyday I thank the lord above  
For the sweetness of your love  
Kindness of your love  
Patience of you love  
One and only lover  
Never be another  
  
Chorus:  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I can't deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside
