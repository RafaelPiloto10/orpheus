River splashes against the rocks,  
And I scale the slope,  
I hope the tracks won't,  
Lead me down to dark black pits,  
Or places where we fall to bits,  
If she were there I'd hold her down,  
I'd push her under while she drowns  
And couldn't breathe and claw for air-  
She doesn't care for my despair,  
  
Or is it me?  
The one that's wrong?  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
In my Mersey paradise  
  
As I stare an oil wheel comes sailing by,  
And I feel like,  
Growing fins and falling in,  
With the bricks the bikes, the rusty tin  
I swim around without a care,  
I'm eating sand when I need air,  
You can bet your life  
I'll meet a pike who'll wolf me down for tea tonight  
  
I want to be, I want to be,  
Where the drownings are,  
(drownings are),  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
In my Mersey paradise  
  
I want to be, I want to be,  
Where the drownings are,  
(drownings are),  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
Oh yeah  
I want to be, I want to be,  
Where the drownings are,  
(drownings are),  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
In my Mersey paradise.
