It's a beautiful world we live in  
A sweet romantic place  
Beautiful people everywhere  
The way they show they care makes me want to say  
It's a beautiful world  
Oh what a beautiful world  
For you  
  
It's a wonderful time to be here  
It's nice to be alive  
Wonderful people everywhere  
The way they comb their hair makes me want to say  
It's a wonderful place  
Oh what a wonderful place  
For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, not me
