To boldly clap in a room full of nothing  
You never know, it could be one of those  
Poignant evenings.  
Museum's locked and it's long since past  
Closing,  
You cannot know, you cannot not know  
What you're knowing  
What can you do, they're all gone  
And we'll go too.  
The curtain climbs over me every morning.  
I don't know why I'm so immunized  
Against reforming.  
To coldly slap at a face full of nothing,  
You never know it could've been one of those  
Looks of longing.  
What can you do, they're all gone  
And we'll go too.
