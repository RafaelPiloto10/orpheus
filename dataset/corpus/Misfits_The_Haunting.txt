The darkness bleeds violent sights  
It purges from within  
Death, it holds you in its arms  
And kisses you goodnight  
  
Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes  
Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite  
Oh, it purges from within  
  
It's over, it's over  
This haunting, it's over  
They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed  
Inside a dream  
  
It's over, it's over  
This haunting, it's over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
They stop haunting me  
  
The darkness bleeds violent sights  
It purges from within  
Death, it holds you in its arms  
And kisses you goodnight  
  
Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes  
Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite  
Oh, it purges from within  
  
It's over, it's over  
This haunting, it's over  
They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed  
Inside a dream  
  
It's over, it's over  
This haunting, it's over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
They stop haunting me
