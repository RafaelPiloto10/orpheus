[includes a quote from Daddy, Daddy, Daddy which includes a quote from Tell Me
You Love Me]  
  
And if his dick is a monster  
If his dick is a monster  
If his dick is a monster  
They will give him their hearts  
  
Howard:  
Hold it! Please hold it!  
My God, Madge. .. You voluptuous New York City slit. ..  
Why didn't you tell me before?  
It was so hard to tell with your little blousey-poo on, but. ..  
Now that I see you. .. I would have helped. ..  
I didn't know you were so obviously. .. Pregnant. ..  
  
I've got the thing you need  
I am endowed beyond your wildest  
Clearasil-spattered fantasies  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah. ..  
  
Girls from all over the world  
Flock to write my name on the toilet walls  
Of the Whisky A-Go-Go  
For I am Bwana Dik  
I am Bwana Dik  
Me Bwana Dik  
Yo! Me Bwana Dik  
Say!  
  
My dick is a monster  
Give me your heart  
  
Chorus:  
Bwana Dik is a legend  
Enormous thou art  
  
Howard:  
My dick is a Harley  
You kick it to start  
  
Chorus:  
Bwana Dik speaks  
The heavens will part  
  
Howard:  
My dick is a dagger  
I'll force it to fit  
My dick is a reamer, baby  
To scream up your slit  
  
Chorus:  
Steam it!  
Ream it!  
Cream it!
