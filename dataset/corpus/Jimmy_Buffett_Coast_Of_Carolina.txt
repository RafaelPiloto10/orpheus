Little roadside restaurant we artfully complain  
Groovy tells the waitress that his chicken died in vain  
Most every day goes by according to design  
I live this dream but still it seems I have you on my mind  
  
From the bottom of my heart  
Off the coast of Carolina  
After one or two false starts  
I believe we found our stride  
And the walls that won't come down  
We can decorate or climb or find some way to get around  
Cause I'm still on your side  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I can't see the future but I know it's coming fast  
It's not that hard to wind up knee deep in the past  
It's come a lot of Mondays  
Since the phone booth that first night  
Through years and miles and tears and smiles  
I want to get it right  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
From the bottom of my heart  
Off the coast of Carolina  
After one or two false starts  
I believe we found our stride  
And the walls that won't come down  
We can decorate or climb or find some way to get around  
Cause I'm still on your side  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
These days I'm up about the time I used to go to bed  
Living large was once the deal, now I watch the stars instead  
They are timeless and predictable unlike most things that I do  
But I tell the wind and my old friend I?m headed home to you  
  
From the bottom of my heart  
Off the coast of Carolina  
After one or two false starts  
I believe we found our stride  
And the walls that won't come down  
Hell we can decorate or climb or find some way to get around  
Cause I'm still on your side  
From the bottom of my heart  
From the bottom of my heart
