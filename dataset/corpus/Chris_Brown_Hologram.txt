(Feat. Dr. Dre)  
  
I-I-I- gotta make make my way  
Way through all these people.  
I didn't put all this money  
Just so so I I can see ya'  
I'm about to act a fool,  
I used to dawg on you.  
I'm about to bon bon  
Chicky bon bon bon me.  
Run it back  
  
I got technology,  
X-Ray vision anything  
I can see through.  
I get static every time you speak,  
Frequency got to be equal.  
I'm tired of playing,  
Can't even hear the shit you saying.  
It's like (make the noises? Lol)  
  
Hologram, I'm pushing up close  
But it's hard to get to ya.  
Hologram, there's a glitch  
In the system tell me  
What I gotta do now.  
Oh damn.  
Illusion, confusion,  
I'm losing ground (Oh oh oh)  
Hologram.  
(Hey hey hey. Hologram.  
Hey hey hey hey)  
(Hey hey hey. Hologram.  
Hey hey hey hey)  
(Oh oh oh oh oh. Hologram)  
  
You want me to flip the switch  
So I I can be your victim.  
I ain't gotta slip up  
Like going it outside in the rain  
With no umbrella.  
What the hell you take me for.  
I'ma take a different route.  
I'm about to bon bon  
Chicky bon bon bon me.  
Run it back  
  
Bang bang choo-choo train,  
Baby put that thing on me.  
You'd rather see my main frame,  
Not the cage.  
You about to see another side of me.  
And she'd be like T minus 7,  
Before my system shut us down.  
Matter of fact I think  
I'm about to shut down right now.  
  
Hologram, I'm pushing up close  
But it's hard to get to ya.  
Hologram,  
There's a glitch in the system  
Tell me what I gotta do now.  
Oh damn.  
Illusion, confusion,  
I'm losing ground (Oh oh oh)  
Hologram.  
(Hey hey hey. Hologram.  
Hey hey hey hey)  
(Hey hey hey. Hologram.  
Hey hey hey hey)  
(Oh oh oh oh oh. Hologram)  
  
I'm tired of playing with you,  
Right now I think your times up.  
Giving mixed signals  
That I don't have control of.  
I'm losing my mind,  
Perfect model before my time.  
Download to my instant data,  
Give me a socket I can plug in.  
  
Hologram, I'm pushing up close  
But it's hard to get to ya.  
Hologram,  
There's a glitch in the system  
Tell me what I gotta do now.  
Oh damn.  
Illusion, confusion,  
I'm losing ground (Oh oh oh oh)  
Hologram.  
(Hey hey hey. Hologram.  
Hey hey hey hey)  
(Hey hey hey. Hologram.  
Hey hey hey hey)  
(Oh oh oh oh oh. Hologram)
