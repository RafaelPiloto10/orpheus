In the light of the day  
You can hear the old ones say  
Was the sound last night the wind?  
Can you feel the change begin?  
  
By the fall of the snow  
A single soul will go  
The footsteps on the white  
There's an unholy light  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Something evil's passing by  
What's to come - when the siren calls you go  
To run with the wolf  
  
When the world makes a turn  
The eyes of one will learn  
That a sound just like the wind  
Only makes the change begin  
  
By the end of the rain  
The feelings passed again  
From things that snap and bite  
An unholy light  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Something evil's passing by  
What's to come - when the siren calls you go  
To run with the wolf  
  
There's a break in the ground  
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down  
  
When the siren calls you go, yeah  
To run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Something evil is passing by  
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah  
To run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
  
Like a beast in a field  
He knows his fate is sealed  
He runs with the wolf, oh oooh  
  
Run with the wolf  
  
See the break, you know it's the same(?)  
Now he goes  
To run, run, run  
Run, run, run, run  
  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf  
Run, run, run  
Now we go run, run, run, run  
Run with the wolf  
All right  
Run with the wolf  
Run with the wolf
