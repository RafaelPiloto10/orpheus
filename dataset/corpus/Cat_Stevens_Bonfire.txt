I can't budge baby I can't move without your love to guide me  
I don't know honey that's the truth what laid you down beside me,  
Heat me with your love oh, your lips were meant for mine  
Nobody else can bake me like a, no no no, like a  
Bonfire, your love is like a bonfire burning deep within me  
Now some folks said it's no good to smoke in bed  
Um, but I just turn off my ears and I jump into the fire again  
  
I feel so weak, yea, I can't sleep without you there to hold me  
Promise me you won't ever leave or I would die so coldly,  
Kiss me with your eyes, please don't let it rain  
Don't kick no dust on my  
Bonfire, your love is like a bonfire burning deep within me  
Now it just grows, no matter where the wind blows  
Yeah but since you touched me I can't hide it  
I've been so delighted with you  
  
Yeah, heat me with your love, ah ah  
You opened up my heart, I just can't live without you,  
Oh, I just couldn't live another day, your my  
Bonfire, your love is like a bonfire burning deep within me  
Now some folks said it's no good to smoke in bed uh, huh  
But I just take off my clothes and I jump into the fire again
