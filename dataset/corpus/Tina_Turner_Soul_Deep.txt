Darlin' I don't know much.  
I know I love you so much.  
My life depends on your touch.  
And my love is a river runnin' soul deep.  
Way down inside me it's a-soul deep.  
It's to big to hide and it can't be denighed.  
My love is a river runnin' soul de..ee..ee..ep.  
I work myself to death for ya  
Just to show I adore ya.  
Nothing I wouldn't do for ya.  
Cause my love is a river runnin' soul deep.  
Way down inside me it's a-soul deep.  
It's to big to hide and it can't be denighed.  
My love is a river runnin' soul de..ee..ee..ep.  
All I ever ever hope to be  
Depends on your love for me.  
Baby believe me, if you should leave me  
I'd be nothing but an empty shell.  
I know darn well, I can tell now.  
I don't know much.  
But I know I love you so much.  
My life depends on your touch.  
And my love is a river runnin' soul deep.  
Way down inside me it's a-soul deep.  
It's to big to hide and it can't be denighed.  
My love is a river runnin' soul de..ee..ee..ep.  
My love is a river runnin' soul deep.  
Way down inside me it's a-soul deep.  
My love is a river runnin' soul deep.  
Way down inside me it's a-soul deep...
