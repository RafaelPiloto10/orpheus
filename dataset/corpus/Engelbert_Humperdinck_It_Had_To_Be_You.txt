It had to be you  
It had to be you  
I wandered around and finally found  
The somebody who  
Could make me be true  
Could make me be blue  
Or even be glad Just to be sad  
Thinking of you  
Some others I've seen.  
Might never be mean  
Might never be cross  
Or try to be boss  
But they wouldn't do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill  
With all your faults I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you  
It had to be you  
Some others I've seen.  
Might never be mean  
Might never be cross  
Or try to be boss  
But they wouldn't do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill  
With all your faults I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you  
It had to be you
