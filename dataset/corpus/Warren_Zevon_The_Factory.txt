I was born in sixty-three  
Got a little job in the factory  
I don't know much about Kennedy  
I was too busy working in the factory  
  
We got a kid that's two, we got another one due  
We get by the best we can do  
The factory's got a good medical plan  
And, cousin, I'm a union man  
Saying, Yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, work !  
  
I was born in Mechanicsburg  
My daddy worked for Pontiac 'til he got hurt  
Now he's on disability  
And I got his old job in the factory  
Saying, Yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, yes sir, no sir, work !  
  
Early in the morning I feel a chill  
The factory whistle blows loud and shrill  
I'd kill my wife or she'd kill me  
But we gotta go to work in the factory  
Six days a week at the factory  
Up early in the morning at the factory  
  
I've been working in the factory  
Johnny, I've been working in the factory  
Kickin' asbestos in the factory  
Punchin' out Chryslers in the factory  
Breathin' that plastic in the factory  
Makin' polyvinyl chloride in the factory
