Llooking for something  
....  
Trying to be something good, trying to be something  
Looking through the world with those big black eyes  
Where did you run to, baby?  
Where did you hide?  
All around I see great big falling stars  
People outside the windows in great big jars  
??? Close my eyes  
Those are my eyes you walk with  
That I can't see  
Being a king I guess it's all fine and well  
You're the star I guess it's just as well  
Even when I have something to do with this world  
??? Baby  
Haven't found a place for you  
....  
When you die you ain't gonna have any place to go  
Your brand new sports car not one day run you down  
Did you ever face the facts?
