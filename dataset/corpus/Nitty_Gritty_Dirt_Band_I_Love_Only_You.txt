I like to drink my beer  
Spend time with the boys  
After work, to down a few  
Is something I enjoy  
And sometimes I stay out too late,  
Yes I know it's true  
But I love only you.  
  
And I like to take life easy  
Work out in the yard  
Sleep late on the weekends  
After an all-night game of cards  
And drivin' my old Chevy  
On a Sunday afternoon  
But I love only you  
I like my old guitar  
  
And I'd like to be a star and shine on you  
I'd like to write a song  
The whole world could sing along about  
  
I love only you  
I like my old memories  
The girls I used to know  
Some of them still have a place  
My mind likes to go  
  
Of all the ones I've cared for  
Lord knows that's been a few  
But I love only you  
Ah, Honey, I love only you.
