Well who are you what do you know  
And I guess it only goes to show  
Don't think you're ready for the fall  
Do you think you really wanta play  
Cause we do this every fucking day  
And we're gonna lay down the law  
You're outdrawn  
...Let's go outside, we'll crucify  
...But you're not there  
You don't wanna cross the line boy  
It will you your genocide  
Your genocide  
Do you think you really wanna throw  
Cause you know UL is five and zero  
Toe to toe and that shit is for real  
You better pray to God up in the sky  
Tuck your tail between your legs and hide  
Get ready 'cause here comes the drill  
And we got skill  
You're standing there  
Like we're gonna be all scared  
Come now  
And I don't really wanna brag  
But my whole city's got my back  
And we're all ready to attack
