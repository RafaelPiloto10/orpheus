I'm lying beside you just thinking about us  
Too tired to go to sleep and too much in love  
I know I'm crazy but I can't close my eyes  
I'm scared you won't be there in the morning when I rise  
Will you be there?  
Who do you dream about are you alone in your sleep?  
To who will you reach out?  
Oh, let it be me  
Oh baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug  
Don't want to be without you when I wake up  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up, oh I need you to be there in the morning  
Will you be there?  
  
Well, you're so close to me but I feel so alone  
The more I touch you the more I want  
Don't know what to do about me loving you but I pray to god that you feel it
too  
You're my obsession, my addiction, my drug, so let the candle grow into a
great fire of love  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up?  
I need you to be there in the morning!  
I wanna love you forever,  
Don't want a love that's now or never  
Can't you see you got me down on the floor.  
I want more more!  
  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up?  
Will you be there in the morning?  
Will you be there?
