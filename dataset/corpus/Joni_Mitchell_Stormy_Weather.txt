Don't know why  
There's no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps rainin' all of the time  
  
Life is bare  
Gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just can't get my poor self together  
I'm weary all the time  
All the time  
  
So weary all of the time  
When you went away  
The blues stepped up and met me  
If he's gone to stay  
That old rocking chair's going to get me  
Every night I pray  
That the lord above will let me  
Walk in the sunlight once more  
  
I can't go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps rainin' all of the time  
  
Keeps rainin' all of the time
