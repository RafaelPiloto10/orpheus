There is unrest in the forest  
There is trouble with the trees  
For the Maples want more sunlight  
And the Oaks ignore their pleas  
  
The trouble with the maples  
(And they're quite convinced they're right)  
They say the oaks are just too lofty  
And they grab up all the light  
But the oaks can't help their feelings  
If they like the way they're made  
And they wonder why the maples  
Can't be happy in their shade?  
  
There is trouble in the forest  
And the creatures all have fled  
As the maples scream 'Oppression!'  
And the oaks, just shake their heads  
  
So the maples formed a union  
And demanded equal rights  
'The oaks are just too greedy  
We will make them give us light'  
Now there's no more oak oppression  
For they passed a noble law  
And the trees are all kept equal  
By hatchet,  
Axe,  
And saw
