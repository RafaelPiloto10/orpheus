It's getting colder in this ditch where I lie  
I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why  
I heard they told her it was tell and live or die  
I didn't know her, but I know why she lied  
I didn't know her, but I know why she died  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
  
I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head  
Well, I feel ashamed of the things that I've said  
Put on these chains and you can live a free life  
Well, I'd rather bleed just to know why I die  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
All I know is that fear has got to go  
This time around  
  
I've started feeling like I don't want to fight  
Give in to the given and put out the light  
Cannons a-blazin' shower these moonlit skies  
Then I remember and I know why he died  
Do you know why I die?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down
