Adam's at the window staring at the apple trees on fire  
Waiting for the windfall that brings the smile of kings and their desire  
Door blows in behind him, a floral pattern, summer dress so gay  
Burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay  
To steal her cherry lips away  
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down  
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown  
In kissing sips we drown  
  
And Adam will have his way  
Adam will have his way  
  
Adam's on the island, living in the land of love  
Shadows lurk around him, drunk on the royal jelly of pure love  
Full and ripe, the fruit hang, for when the prince arrives he will want more  
And more and more he will drink from the canvas cup  
The son of a swan will then loose his plumera  
And he will wear a new age suit and haunt the joints in town  
And play a silver magic flute and call his lovers down  
And call his lovers down  
  
And Adam will have his way  
Adam will have his way  
Will have his way  
  
Adam's at the easel painting in the wrinkles and the gray  
Waiting for November, easy with the darkness of the day  
Smiles a tear of gladness, and Adam's at the window once again  
He's burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay  
To steal her cherry lips away  
For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down  
The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown  
In kissing sips we drown  
  
And Adam will have his way  
  
Adam's at the window
