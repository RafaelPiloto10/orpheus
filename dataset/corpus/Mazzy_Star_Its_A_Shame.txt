Hold a candle to my face  
I just want to see the lights  
You and me, we went our separate ways  
And ....  
We went driving in your car  
And you took me by the hand  
Now I don't know just where you are  
I wanna ? ? my chance  
I miss your smile  
I kiss your face  
I tell you good-bye  
And it's a shame  
Don't you wake me 'cause I'm not dreaming  
I don't want to ? ? ? mistake? ?  
I ain't to be nothing? ?  
....  
I miss your smile  
I kiss your face  
I'll tell you good-bye  
But it's a shame  
We went driving in your car  
And you took me by the hand  
Now I don't know just where you are  
I wanna know ? ? my chance  
I miss your smile  
I kiss your face  
I'll wish you alive  
But it's a shame  
It's a shame
