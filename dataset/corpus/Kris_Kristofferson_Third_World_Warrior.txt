Chorus:  
You can't defeat him - he's fighting for freedom  
That's all he wanted - that's all he needs  
You'll never beat him with weapons and money  
There ain't no chain as strong as the will to be free  
Maybe his colors are driving you crazy  
Call him a commie - maybe it's true  
Lure him away from his home with your money  
Give him the work that you don't want to do  
Chorus:  
You can't defeat him - he's fighting for freedom  
That's all he wanted - that's all he needs  
You'll never beat him with weapons and money  
There ain't no chain as strong as the will to be free  
See how we honor the struggle for freedom  
They needed vision - we gave'em war  
See who is patiently watching in silence  
The crucification of el salvador  
Chorus:  
You can't defeat him - he's fighting for freedom  
That's all he wanted - that's all he needs  
You'll never beat him with weapons and money  
There ain't no chain as strong as the will to be free
