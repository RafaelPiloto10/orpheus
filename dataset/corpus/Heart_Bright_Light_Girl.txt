I knew a woman  
Never knew no one like her  
She said, "The world's made up of angels  
Beautiful and fair"  
She would give you anything  
Just give it all away  
Just for one true moment  
Believing love would stay  
You're a bright light girl  
Shine into this world  
Now you know your love is coming true  
You're a bright light girl  
In a disbelieving world  
Now someone believes as much as you  
And now you know he really loves you too  
She opened up for trouble  
And saw him come on strong  
But when he could not meet her eyes  
She thought she'd done it wrong  
Each time love abused her  
She would take the shame  
Each time love would lose her  
She would take the blame  
No, you're a bright light girl  
Shine into this world  
Now you know your love is coming true  
Bright light girl  
In a disbelieving world  
Now someone believes as much as you  
And now you know he really loved you too  
You never lost your magic vision  
Always in your sight  
Special intuition  
Telling you, it's gonna be alright  
Oh, yeah, you're a bright light girl  
Shine into this world  
Now you know your love is coming true  
You're a bright light girl  
In a disbelieving world  
Now someone believes as much as you  
And now somebody really loves you too  
Come on, shine on  
Shine on girl
