The singer finished singing and she's walking out  
The singer sheds a tear  
Fear of falling out  
  
And It's hard to say how I feel today  
For years gone by  
And I cried  
  
It's hard to say that I was wrong  
It's hard to say that I miss you  
Since you've been gone it's not the same  
  
My worries weigh the world  
How I used to be and everything  
(I'm so cold)  
Seems a plague in me  
  
And its hard to say how I feel today  
For years gone by  
And I cried  
  
It's hard to say that I was wrong  
It's hard to say I miss you  
Since you've been gone its not the same  
Its hard to say I held my tongue  
It's hard to say if only  
Since you've been gone it's not the same  
  
Worse than a lie you told a thousand times before  
Worse than a fear it's the knife  
And its hard to say how I feel today for years gone by and I cried  
Its hard to say that I was wrong  
It's hard to say I miss you  
Since you've been gone it's not the same  
It's hard to say I held my tongue  
It's hard to say if only  
Since you've been gone its not the same.
