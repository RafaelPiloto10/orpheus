It's early in the morning  
About a quarter till three  
I'm sittin' here talkin' with my baby  
Over cigarettes and coffee, now  
And to tell you that  
Darling I've been so satisfied  
Honey since I met you  
Baby since I met you, ooh  
  
All the places that I've been around  
And all the good looking girls I've met  
They just don't seem to fit in  
Knowing this particularly sad, yeah  
  
But it seemed so natural, darling  
That you and I are here  
Just talking over cigarettes and drinking coffee, ooh now  
  
And whole my heart cries out  
Love at last I've found you, ooh now  
And honey won't you let me  
Just be my whole life around you  
And while I complete, I complete my whole life would be, yeah  
If you would take things under consideration  
And walk down this hour with me  
And I would love it, yeah  
  
People I say it's so early in the morning  
Oh, it's a quarter till three  
We're sittin' here talkin'  
Over cigarettes and drinking coffee, now, lord  
And I'll like to show you, well  
I've known nothing but good old joy  
Since I met you, darling  
Honey since I've met you, baby yeah  
  
I would love to have another drink of coffee, now  
And please, darling, help me smoke this one more cigarette, now  
I don't want no cream and sugar  
Cause I've got you, now darling  
But just let me enjoy  
Help me to enjoy  
This good time that we'll have, baby  
It's so early, so early in the morning  
So early, so early in the morning  
And I've got you  
And you've got me  
And we'll have each other  
And we don't, we don't want nothing but joy, y'all  
Nothing but joy
