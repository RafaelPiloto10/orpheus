How can I ever forget you  
You don't know just what I've been through  
The holiday we spent together  
Lives with me now and forever.  
  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do.  
  
I can't find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
I used to think about you night and day  
I used to feel what language cannot say  
Oh I can't find you  
No I can't find my piece of mind without you.  
  
Maybe you'd write me a letter  
And tell me why I never met you  
Our rendezvous just ended in sorrow  
Without you there's no tomorrow.  
  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do.  
  
I can't find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
I used to think about you night and day  
I didn't care what other people would say  
  
Oh I can't find you  
No I can't find my piece of mind without you.  
I can't find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
  
I used to think about you night and day  
I used to feel what language cannot say  
Oh I can't find you  
No I can't find my piece of mind without you.  
  
Ibiza, Majorca, and Benidorm too  
I've searched all these places but never found you.
