Last time I talked to you  
You were lonely and out of place  
You were looking down on me  
Lost out in space  
We laid underneath the stars  
Strung out and feeling brave  
I watched the red orange glow  
I watched you float away  
  
Down here in the atmosphere  
Garbage and city lights  
You've gone to save your tired soul  
You've gone to save our lives  
I turned on the radio  
To find you on satellite  
I'm waiting for this sky to fall  
I'm waiting for a sign  
And all we are  
Is all so far  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
Hope you remember me  
When you're homesick and need a change  
I miss your purple hair  
I miss the way you taste  
I know you'll come back someday  
On a bed of nails I'll wait  
I'm praying that you don't burn out  
Or fade away  
And all we are  
Is all so far  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see  
I know you're out there  
Oh  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
You're falling back to me  
I know , I know  
You're falling out of reach  
I know
