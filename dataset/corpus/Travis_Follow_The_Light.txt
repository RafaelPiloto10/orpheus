Nobody really knows  
Where they're supposed to go  
Hiding behind a wall  
Afraid that they'll lose it all  
  
But it's alright  
Just follow the light  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
You'll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
But nobody wants to know  
'cos nobody even cares  
Everyone's on the make  
Yeah and everyone's out for themselves  
  
Me I'm on the longest road  
Where everything's overload  
But I've got my heart and soul  
So don't throw me overboard  
  
'cos it's alright  
Just follow the light  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
You'll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
'cos it's alright  
Just follow the light  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
You'll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
'cos it's alright, alright now  
And you're alright  
Yeah we're alright now
