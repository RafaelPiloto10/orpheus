Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way?  
I was dumb enough not to settle down when you wanted to  
Now I'm sittin' here going crazy trying to crawl back to you  
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way?  
  
But I was smart enough to come to my senses  
Be who you need me to be  
And if you say that I'm too late  
I'll curl up and die in misery  
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way  
  
I remember our first kiss on the 4th of July  
I'll never miss another one of those  
I'll be by your side  
  
If my foolish heart was wrong,  
This truly was never meant to be  
Well I only hope that he'll count his lucky stars  
And love you as much as me  
  
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way  
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way  
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way
