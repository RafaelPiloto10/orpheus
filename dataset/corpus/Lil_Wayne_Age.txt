Hey young world.

With her big bro, young weezy right beside 'er.  
And you now I got 'er.  
Like I got 'er.  
Gunz it's yo turn, and you are the driver.  
And whateva' ya lost.  
All you do is follow.  
The roadsigns lead you to a gold mind.  
  
How do I know?  
It cause I just moved.  
Gotta new crib on Goldmind Avenue.  
So that's why I got this rich boy attitude.  
You probly see me in the Caddy, with some D's  
On that bitch.  
Riding down Goldmind Avenue.  
In the lane like l'm goin' get a Allie Oupe.  
Oops, that was a coupe.  
Pass yo' ass like lightning's flash.  
Cut the light down now and turn me to a darkchild.  
My thoughts fall, my eyelids are scattered.  
And we are Young Money, but age doesn't matter.
