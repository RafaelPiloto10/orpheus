What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
Way hay and up she rises  
Way hay and up she rises  
Way hay and up she rises  
Earl-eye in the morning  
  
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,  
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,  
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter,  
Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter,  
Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put him the back of the paddy wagon,  
Put him the back of the paddy wagon,  
Put him the back of the paddy wagon,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Throw him in the lock-up 'til he's sober,  
Throw him in the lock-up 'til he's sober,  
Throw him in the lock-up 'til he's sober,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
What do you do with a drunken sailor,  
Earl-eye in the morning!  
  
[Chorus]
