You say you want a revolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the world  
You tell me that it's evolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the world  
But when you talk about destruction  
Don't you know that you can count me out  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
All right, all right  
  
You say you got a real solution  
Well, you know  
We'd all love to see the plan  
You ask me for a contribution  
Well, you know  
We're doing what we can  
But if you want money  
For people with minds that hate  
  
All I can tell is brother you have to wait  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
All right, all right  
Ah  
  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...  
  
You say you'll change the constitution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change your head  
You tell me it's the institution  
Well, you know  
You better free you mind instead  
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao  
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
All right, all right  
All right, all right, all right  
All right, all right, all right
