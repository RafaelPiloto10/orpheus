Sometimes  
A heart has a mind of it's own  
Sometimes  
I can tell myself  
That I'm better off being alone  
Sometimes  
But this time  
I can't hide from the thought of it  
It's around every corner I turn  
Right there in lights  
In black and white  
Staring at me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all because of you  
That I feel this way  
All because of you  
That my heart wants to break  
If every other love can be forgotten  
It's all because of you  
All because of you  
  
Tonight  
I can't feel any magic inside  
Tonight  
'Cause I can't reach out for the stars  
Lookin' up at the moon on my own  
No signs of life, no nothing's right  
Since you've been gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All because of you  
I can't sleep at night  
Oh no I can't sleep at night  
And there ain't no rest  
Living second best  
Without your love  
  
You don't know what it's like  
To feel this way  
All because of you  
That my heart wants to break  
If every other love can be forgotten  
It's all because of you
