I've been watching you now  
I've been caught in these hours  
Days are turning to nights  
Out of where there's no  
  
No rules for strangers  
When I see you again  
Will you still feel the same way  
Understand  
  
In your eyes  
I can't get nothing right  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
Oh yeah  
When I see you walk by  
  
Turn my head want to break down  
I've been living alone  
I've been living a lie  
I get so scared of my fears  
  
There's a space in my life  
For just one time  
Or baby forever  
Understand  
  
It's in your eyes  
I can't get nothing right  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
I've been watching you now  
And I've been living in a daydream  
  
It's that I miss you so  
Can't think of words  
I break down  
I've been lonely  
  
When I see you again  
Will you still feel the same way  
Understand  
In your eyes  
  
I can't do nothing right  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
All night  
Make it happen  
  
Make me feel alright  
All day  
Make it happen  
Make me feel alright  
  
All day  
Make it happen  
Alright  
Make it happen  
  
Yeah  
Make it happen  
Yeah
