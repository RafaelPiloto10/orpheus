From a Jack to a King.  
From loneliness to a wedding ring.  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,  
An' walked away with your heart.  
  
From a Jack to a King.  
With no regrets, I stacked the cards last night.  
And Lady Luck played her hand just right:  
You made me King of your heart.  
  
For just a little while, I thought that I might lose again.  
Then just in time, I saw the twinkle in your eye.  
  
From a Jack to a King.  
From loneliness to a wedding ring.  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,  
You made me King of your heart.  
  
For just a little while, I thought that I might lose again.  
Then just in time, I saw the twinkle in your eye.  
  
From a Jack to a King.  
From loneliness to a wedding ring.  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,  
You made me King of your heart.
