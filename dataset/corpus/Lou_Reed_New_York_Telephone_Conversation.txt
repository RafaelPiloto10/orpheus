I was sleeping, gently napping, when I heard the phone  
Who is on the other end talking, am I even home  
Did you see what she did to him, did you hear what they said  
Just a New York conversation, rattling in my head  
  
Oh, my, and what shall we wear  
Oh, my, and whop really cares  
  
Just a New York conversation, gossip all of the time  
Did you hear who did what to whom, happens all the time  
Who has touched and who has dabbled here in the city of shows  
Openings, closings, bad repartee, everybody knows  
  
Oh, how sad, why do we call  
Oh, I'm glad to hear from you all  
  
I am calling, yes I'm calling just to speak to you  
For I know this night will kill me, if I can't be with you  
If I can't be with you
