It looks like it's about to begin  
I'm lying down in a pool of sin now  
So why does it feel so good within?  
Letting go, giving in!  
  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Go away and never come back!  
  
I'm gonna cry to dive right in  
I'm gonna fight until I win now  
I'm running down in a pool of sin  
Letting go, giving in!  
  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Go away and never come back!  
  
Never come back  
Never come back!  
Go away and never come back!  
Go away!  
Go away!  
  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Tell me what you want?  
Tell me what you want?  
Fuck you go away!  
Go away and never come back!  
  
Never come back!  
Never come back!
