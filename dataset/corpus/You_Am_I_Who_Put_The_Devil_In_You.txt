I got too much on my mind  
Yeah, so play that thing in a different style  
Caught on a hook and a line  
Yeah, thicken, use and drive me outta my mind  
So I'm down, so punch me in the decals  
And see which of my teeth tells  
The honor of thieves, hard to prove  
But who put the devil in you?  
I got too much on my mind  
I cross my chest to keep myself in line  
Willing the water from wine  
I've wasted years looking for somewhere to hide  
Lookin' down, just kick me where the sun shines  
And now we're on for hot times  
And bashin' out to hammer the blues  
Yeah, who put the devil in you?  
I'm finding out where my head's at  
Like loose change in a laundromat  
It chews me through  
From Dallas Crane to Motley Crue, oh  
Yeah, but I know just why I'm masquerading  
And why my tracks is fading  
And bash out to hammer the blue  
Who put the devil in you?  
I hit on the speed in my shoe  
Now who put the devil in you?  
'Cause you know we're going out there again  
I'm just throwing my trust to the wind  
We're gonna beat this damn thing to the end  
And then kiss it off, hey
