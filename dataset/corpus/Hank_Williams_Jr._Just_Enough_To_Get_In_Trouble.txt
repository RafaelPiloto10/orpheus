I've been down my share of  
Country roads, boulevards, and interstates  
I kinda know my way around  
A little bout a lot of things  
I know what the cards say  
Sometimes the hard way  
It looks so easy  
  
My curiosity always gets me in a ditch  
What really happens if  
You turn that knob  
Or flip that switch  
Something I shouldn't do  
Why you already knew  
Thats all been taught to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I know just enough to get in trouble  
And thats just enough to understand  
That the more I know  
The more I'm sure  
Someday it's gonna do me in  
Yeah when my time comes  
And I'm dead and gone  
Let em put it on my tombstone  
He knew just enough to get in trouble  
But not enough to leave it alone  
  
They got a book somewhere  
On everything a woman wants  
Bout how and when and where  
And why they will  
And why they won't  
Thats complicated stuff  
And when it comes to love  
I'm still learning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Waylon always told me  
Son everybody makes mistakes  
And how come it's always me  
Standing there when something breaks  
  
Yeah I know just enough to get in trouble  
And thats just enough to understand  
That the more I know  
The more I'm sure  
Someday it's gonna do me in  
Yeah when my time comes  
And I'm dead and gone  
Let em write it on my tombstone  
Here lies just enough to get in trouble  
But not enough to leave it alone  
He knew just enough to get in trouble  
But not quite enough to leave it alone
