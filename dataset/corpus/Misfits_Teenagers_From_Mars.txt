Well, we land in barren fields  
On the Arizona plains  
The insemination of little girls  
In the middle of wet dreams  
  
We are the angel mutants  
The streets for us seduction  
Our cause injust and ancient  
In this "be " film born invasion  
  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
  
Well, we've seen your 3-D movies  
In violent abduction  
We blast your mindless structure  
Inferior connection  
  
We take your weak resistance  
Throw it in your face  
We need no introduction  
For mass anhiliation  
  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
  
Well, we need no introduction  
No visas or carte blanche  
Inhuman reproduction  
We're here for what we want  
  
We want, we need it, we'll take it  
We want, we need it, we'll take it  
We want, we need it, we'll take it  
We want, we need it, we'll take it, baby  
  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
Teenagers from Mars  
And we don't care  
  
And we don't care  
And we don't care, we don't care  
We don't care, and we don't care  
And we don't care
