We'll be leaving this town in the mornin'  
Tomorrow we'll be able to see  
I've had me enough of this city  
And she's had enough out of me  
Say if I climbed to the mountain  
Would you still follow me there  
Steal me away in an echo  
The mountain will always be there  
Well I'm turning my sights on the country  
I sold everything that I own  
Heading away from the bright lights  
Looking for where the wind blows  
Say if I climbed to the mountain  
Would you still follow me there  
Steal me away in an echo  
The mountain will always be there  
We'll be leaving this town in the mornin'  
Tomorrow we'll be able to see  
I've had me enough of this city  
And she's had enough out of me  
Say if I climbed to the mountain  
Would you still follow me there  
Steal me away in an echo  
The mountain will always be there
