Last night you breathed the deepest sigh  
Turned away with those cold cool eyes  
You said won't you give me space to breathe  
And my tears gave it confidence to leave  
Now you say I'm just to much for you  
There are things you'll never know  
If you lie and cheat so easily  
You'd better go  
Go go go yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity  
Yesterday you were my brightest star  
But even when you're near  
I don't know where you are  
I was wrong to show my weaker side  
Now it's much too late to cry cry cry  
I was blind to put my trust in you  
If you leave me I'll fall apart  
Did you plan to make a fool out of me  
From the start  
Yeah yeah yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity  
Now you say I'm too much for you  
There are things you'll never know  
If you lie and cheat so easily  
You'd better go  
Go go go yeah  
All I know is how I feel  
And my heart was always yours to steal  
But you take and never give to me  
Your kisses are charity  
Your kisses are charity
