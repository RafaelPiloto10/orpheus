Love is life and life is livin'  
It's very special  
All my love  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
(Baby, don't go)  
(Baby, don't go) Yeah  
(Baby, don't go, uh)  
(Baby, don't go) Yeah  
(Baby, don't go)  
(Baby, don't go) Yeah, yeah  
(Why you act like that)  
  
It's such a shame, but I'm leavin'  
Can't take the way you mistreated me  
And it's crazy, but oh, baby  
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me  
  
Uh, uh, uh  
I don't believe you wanna leave like this  
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss  
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce  
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby,  
let's talk about this, man  
  
Well, I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son  
I gotta leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm good holdin' my spot  
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block  
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock  
So without me you'll be fine, right  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
The path you chose to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)  
Promises you made about comin' through  
So much time you wasted  
That's why I had to replace you  
  
Uh, uh, uh  
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settlin' down  
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town  
I thought my tender touch could lock you down  
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds  
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down  
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here  
  
Stop playin, you gamin'  
I gotta leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm good holdin' my spot (Stop actin' like that)  
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block  
(Now you know you need to stop)  
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock  
So without me you'll be fine, right (Here we go)  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
You had to your choice to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
People make mistakes to make up, to break  
To wake up cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me  
You love me, I'm like your homey  
Instead of beef you come hold me  
I promise I'm not a phony  
Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here  
  
Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind  
I gotta let you go now  
And nothin' will ever be the same, so just be on your way  
Go 'head and do your thing now  
And there's no more to explain to me, you no  
I know your game and I'm feelin' what you do  
  
So I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son  
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
You had to your choice to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
All my pride is all I have

I promise you  
You know what I'm sayin'
