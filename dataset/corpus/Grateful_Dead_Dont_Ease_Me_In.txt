Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in  
I've been all night long commin' home, don't ease me in  
When I turned around sweet mama, she was way across town  
So I'm walkin' down the street with a dollar in my hand  
I've been lookin' for a woman sweet mama, ain't got no man  
The girl I love, she's sweet and true  
You the dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue  
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea  
She brings me 'bout every damm thing but the jailhouse keys
