Love had ended  
Can't be mended  
All along the line  
I've been true to you  
Even though for some time  
I knew we were through  
I was feeling  
That love had ended  
Can't be mended  
But I can't bear to see you cry  
The feeling's gone  
It's been missing too long  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
It's such a shame  
That it's ended this way  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
There'll be no goodbyes  
There are no words to say  
When you realise  
That I'm far away  
You'll be hurting  
Like I've been hurting  
The truth was burning  
But I just can't say goodbye  
The feeling's gone  
It's been missing too long  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
It's such a shame  
That it's ended this way  
But I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
Ooh but I just don't have the heart  
I just don't have the heart to tell you  
If I stopped to think about  
The good times that we shared  
I could fool myself believing  
That somehow love, love was still there  
Ooh (love, love, love, love, love had ended)  
(love, love, love, love, love had ended)  
I was feeling  
That love had ended  
Can't be mended  
But I can't bear to see you cry  
(repeat chorus)
