(Feelin' kinda Sunday, feelin' kinda Sunday, feelin' kinda Sunday)  
Hey Mr. Sunlight, don't outshine your bright,  
I'm talking out of my head, I'm so high on life.  
  
Don't you know that it's gonna be a "thousand-and-one" day.  
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday, (feeling kinda Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday.  
Pardon my glow-on, out on the high all night,  
I see myself in a world right where I belong,  
  
There's nothing can hold me down , it's a "get-up-and-run" day.  
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday),  
Feeling kinda Sunday, (Sunday).  
The bells I hear in me say I should be getting up late,  
  
Been traveling all morning long, but I'm still here in my room.  
Not to give in to (in to) this feeling I'm on to, (I'm on to)  
I'm looking at love from a window, to lighten the view,  
It's just the beginning of happy go Sunday,  
  
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday (feeling kinda Sunday),  
Feeling kinda Sunday (feeling kinda Sunday),  
Feeling kinda Sunday (feeling kinda Sunday).  
(La, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la la la,)  
  
It's just the beginning of happy "go-off" one day,  
And I'm feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday)  
Feeling kinda Sunday.(Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday)  
Feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday), feeling kinda Sunday (Sunday)...
