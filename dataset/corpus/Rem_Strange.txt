There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
Micheal's nervous and the lights are bright  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something going on that wasn't here before  
Keep your eyes glued to the floor  
There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
Micheal's nervous and the lights are bright  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something going on that wasn't here before  
Keep your eyes glued to the floor  
There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something going on that wasn't here before  
Keep your eyes glued to the floor  
No one's going to say goodnight  
There's something going on that's not quite right
