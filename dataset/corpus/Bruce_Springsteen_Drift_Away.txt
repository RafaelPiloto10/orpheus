Day after day, I'm more confused  
Yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to loose  
And I'm feelin' the strain  
Ain't it a shame.  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
  
Sometimes I think I'm wastin' my time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
And I'm countin' on you  
To carry me through.  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
  
And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when I'm feelin' blue  
The guitar's comin' through  
To soothe me.  
  
Thanks for the joy (for 20 years) you brought me  
I (sure) believe in your song  
Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You help me along  
Makin' me strong.  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
  
OH HO AH HO..  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
HEY, HEY,HEY, YA  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Na, Na, now won't ya  
Won't ya take, OH HA ..take me.
