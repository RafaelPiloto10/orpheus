Had my share of disco nights  
Did some talking, rainbow lights  
Easy smile shines like gold  
Burning hot and turning cold  
Live that kind of life before  
Lost the note to learn the score  
Something tells me that  
There must be something more  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I'm holdin' out for love  
Made up my mind  
I'm holdin' out for love  
Mister this time  
I'm holdin' on, holdin' back  
Holdin' out for love  
  
Had my fill of party scenes  
One night stands and neon dreams  
Good times friends and fancy clothes  
Flashing highs and crashing lows  
So if that's what's on your mind  
Well I'll just take a pass this time  
I believe I rather leave it all behind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need to find someone  
Who'll still be holding me  
When the dance is done  
  
[Chorus: x 3]
