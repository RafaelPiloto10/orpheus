Hangin' in the underground  
Before a train back out of town  
Away from you  
All the lights that disappear  
In the tunnels way down here  
It's quite a view  
  
Sometimes I wish I were deaf  
Then I wouldn't hear the words you say  
Under your breath  
Under your breath  
  
Locked away in your room  
On the phone with someone who  
She thinks out loud  
Thought she found the right to leave  
Think of the things you used to need  
And I'd run out  
  
Sometimes I wish I were deaf  
But I hear the words you say  
Under your breath  
Under your breath  
  
Anything that you put on me  
All the things your head needs, you believe  
Read my mind 'Cause I can't say anything  
The sick heart potion  
Two parts pain  
One part true again  
  
Sometimes I wish I were deaf  
But I hear the words you say  
Under your breath  
Under your breath
