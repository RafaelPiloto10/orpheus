Caught up in wheels of fortune while you've been asleep  
Come on, give it up, you got what's comin' to you  
No use for you to struggle, now you're in too deep  
It's gonna be a long, long time before it's through  
  
Changin' wheels of fortune  
Drivin' us on and on  
Winnin', sometimes losin'  
As soon as it's here it's gone  
  
I'm so tired of losin'  
But I still play the game  
And I know there's no reason  
Still I go on searchin' just the same  
  
Well, I've kicked around your city  
Seen your vanity  
Mister Society, can you hear me  
You get your satisfaction and you cover all the action  
But your loaded dice won't help you in the end  
  
Changin' wheels of fortune  
Drivin' us on and on  
Winnin', sometimes losin'  
As soon as it's here it's gone  
  
I'm so tired of losin'  
But I still play the game  
And I know there's no reason  
Still I go on searchin' just the same
