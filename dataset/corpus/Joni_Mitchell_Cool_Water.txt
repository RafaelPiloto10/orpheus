All day I face the barren waste  
Without a taste of water  
Cool water  
Old Dan and I  
Our throats slate dry  
Our spirits cry out for water  
Cool clear water  
Keep on movin' Dan  
Some devils had a plan  
Buried poison in the sand  
Don't drink it man  
It's in the water  
Cool clear water  
In my mind I see  
A big green tree  
And a river flowin' free  
Waitin' up ahead  
For you and me  
Cool clear water  
  
The nights are cool and I'm a fool  
Each star is a pool of water  
Cool water  
But come the dawn  
We carry on  
We won't last long without water  
Cool clear water  
Keep on movin' Dan  
We're still in no-man's land  
Dry bones and sand  
People never planned here for water  
Cool clear water  
In my mind I see  
A big green tree  
And a river flowin' free  
Waiting up ahead for you and me  
Cool clear water  
  
The shadows sway  
They seem to say  
Tonight we pray for water  
Cool water  
And way up there  
If you care  
Please show us where  
There's good water  
Cool clear water
