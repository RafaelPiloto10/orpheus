Just because it's raining here  
It doesn't mean the sun isn't shining  
Somewhere else for someone  
You have loved  
But who's not near you anymore.  
When your love is on the run  
Don't fall apart at what's begun  
It's just the healing process  
Of your heart.  
  
When your dream has lost its cause  
Don't waste your time in closing doors,  
You'll be the last to know  
When love has gone.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.  
  
Couldn't find the words to say I love you.  
Couldn't fight the hurt of holding on.  
Couldn't hope.  
Couldn't dream.  
Couldn't see tomorrow.  
Without your love  
I can't go on.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.  
  
When your love is on the run  
Don't fall apart at what's begun.  
It's just the healing process  
Of your heart.  
  
When your dream has lost it's cause  
Don't waste your time in closing doors,  
You'll be the last to know  
When love has gone.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.
