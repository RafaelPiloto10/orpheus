Madman drummers bummers, Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat  
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat  
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-
round  
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin, the calliope crashed to the
ground  
The calliope crashed to the ground  
  
But she was...

Some silicone sister with a manager mister told me I go what it takes  
She said "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong, play the song with the
funky break"  
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe

ride  
Asked me if I needed a ride  
  
But she was...  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
  
She got down but she never got tired  
She's gonna make it through the night

But mama, that's where the fun is  
But mama, that's where the fun is  
Mama always told me not to look into the eye's of the sun  
But mama, that's where the fun is  
  
Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east  
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone, that's where they
expect it least"  
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner, watching the young
girls dance  
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone, reminding him
of romance  
The calliope crashed to the ground  
  
But she was...
