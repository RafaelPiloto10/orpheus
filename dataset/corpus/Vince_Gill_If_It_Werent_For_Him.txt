If she'd only knew what I was thinking  
If she'd only knew what was in my head  
Why can't she see my heart is breaking  
She'd be mine if it weren't for him.  
  
So many times I dreamed I had her  
I call her name when I lay down  
Still I can't learn to live without  
Her jealous heart is all I found.  
  
See your face would be my destiny  
Now I won't take what you can give to me  
This lonely place is all I hope to find  
If it weren't for him then you'd be mine.  
  
If he'd only knew what I was thinking  
If he'd only knew what was in my head  
Why can't he see my heart is breaking  
He'd be mine if it weren't for him.  
  
You'd be mine if it weren't for him
