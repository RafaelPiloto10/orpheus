I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke  
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke  
I was an iron man I had a master plan  
But I was alone  
  
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind  
I remember how your body started trembling  
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in  
I'm still alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
And all the wonders made for the earth  
And all the hearts in all creation  
Somehow I always end up alone  
  
Always end up alone, always end up alone  
So I'll play, I'll wait  
'Cause you know that love takes time  
  
Living love between the line  
We came (sha la) so close (so far)  
Just the beat of a lonely heart  
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone  
  
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone  
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home  
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere  
But I'm still alone  
  
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate  
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate  
Am I the subject of the pain  
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone  
  
And is there glory there to behold  
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told  
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la  
And I pray it's not too late  
We came sha la so far so far  
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine  
And I don't want to be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gone but not out of sight  
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home  
I don't want to be alone face the heat of the the night  
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone  
You search for the light  
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean  
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain  
And there's no one home
