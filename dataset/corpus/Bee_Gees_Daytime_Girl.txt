There she goes my daytime girl.  
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle.  
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground.  
  
Heaven knows my daytime girl.  
Never been kissed she don't know what she's missing.  
All the kisses there are to be found.  
All the wisdom of people she used.  
She took advantage of this.  
Taking time to remember the past.  
Remembering all she has missed.  
  
What a dream this place has been.  
Said when she left "I believed when I saw him.  
All the seeing believing come true".  
All the wisdom of people she used.  
She took advantage of this.  
Taking time to remember the past.  
Remembering all she has missed.  
  
There she goes my daytime girl.  
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle.  
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground.  
Me how to get over you.
