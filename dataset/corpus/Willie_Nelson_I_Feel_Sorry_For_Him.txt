There goes the man who gave his heart to someone,  
I feel sorry for him.  
For that someone just gave her to me.  
Now, he's the loser an' it hurts so much to lose.  
An' I feel sorry for him,  
'Cause the loser, I know, could have been me.  
  
Oh, how he loved her:  
I'm sure he must have loved her almost as much as me.  
But fate has frowned on him,  
Then turned around and smiled on me.  
  
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone,  
I feel sorry for him.  
'Cause that someone just gave her to me.  
  
If things were different:  
If he had won her heart instead of me,  
I wonder if he'd find the time,  
To offer sympathy.  
  
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone,  
I feel sorry for him.  
For that someone just gave her to me.
