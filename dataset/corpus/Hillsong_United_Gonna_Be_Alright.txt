I've found my meaning in You  
Your cause is the reason why I live  
Your grace is teaching me how to give  
  
I give my whole life to You  
Your love is the reason why I song  
Jesus You are my everything  
  
Every night, everyday  
I don't need to worry, no I celebrate  
All the things You've done in me  
  
And its gonna be alright, cause  
You are in my life  
Yes its gonna be alright  
  
Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be alright  
And its gonna be alright,  
'Cause Jesus, you're my light  
And You have shown me the way  
All of my troubles, all of my life  
I give to You, my king
