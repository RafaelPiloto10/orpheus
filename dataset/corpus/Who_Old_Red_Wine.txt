Old red wine, well past its prime,  
May have to finish it, after crossing the line.  
Dusty old wine, two thousand a time,  
An inch of black mud always left behind.  
They say you turned in while the sun still shined,  
That gorgeous girl with you was highly primed.  
She said she'd take you way down or way up,  
She might break your heart, she might crack you up.  
Old red wine, not worth a dime,  
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time.  
Expensive old wine, forty years lying,  
Mice chewed the labels, don't know what we're buying.  
Back home in California, they got wine for the meek,  
There's a Bowl and a Fillmore, the Cow and the Greek.  
You sniffed at the cork, chose low on the list,  
As you dashed to the lights and gazed through the mist.  
Old red wine, well past its prime,  
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time.  
Just let it breathe,  
Oh, let it breathe,  
Breathe life, breathe life.  
Let it breathe,  
Oh, let it breathe,  
Let it breathe.
