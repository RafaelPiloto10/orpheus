I watched you cry  
Bathed in sunlight  
By the bathroom door  
You said you wished you did not love me anymore  
  
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car  
The things we said and did have left permanent scars  
Obsessed depressed at the same time  
I can't even walk in a straight line  
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries  
This is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes  
You're not even there  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Oh yeah  
  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
You've hit your low  
You've lost control and you want me back  
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have  
Oh just confess that you're still mine  
I roll around in a bed full of tears and  
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine  
No sunshine  
No sunshine  
  
She cries this is more than goodbye  
When I look into your eyes you're not even there  
  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
No I can't believe that it's over now baby  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
So much to say  
It's not the way she does her hair  
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes  
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away  
The love she tried so hard to save  
  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
It's just a feeling  
It's just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
Just a feeling  
Just a feeling that I have  
  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
I can't believe that it's over  
(Just a feeling)  
(Just a feeling that I have)  
I can't believe that it's over yeah
