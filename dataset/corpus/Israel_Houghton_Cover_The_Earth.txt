Let me be an instrument  
To exalt and to extend  
Jesus' name globally  
As the waters cover the sea  
Open the heavens O Lord  
Pour out Your Spirit  
  
Cover the earth with Your glory  
Cover the earth with Your glory  
Cover the earth with the sound of heaven  
Cover the earth with Your glory  
Cover the earth with Your glory  
Cover the earth with the sound of heaven  
Cover the earth  
  
Let me speak what You say  
Let the sound prepare the way  
Kingdom come globally  
As the waters cover the sea  
Open the heavens O Lord  
Pour out Your Spirit  
  
Cover the earth with Your glory  
Cover the earth with Your glory  
Cover the earth with the sound of heaven  
All of the earth is Yours  
All of the nations adore You  
Cover the earth with the sound of heaven  
Cover the earth  
  
Open up the heavenlies  
Let a new sound be released  
As the waters cover the sea  
Cover the earth
