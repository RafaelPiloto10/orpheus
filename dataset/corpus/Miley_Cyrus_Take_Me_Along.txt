The city of angels is lonely tonight  
Keep myself alight by candlelight  
So she can love you like I do  
Look me in the eyes and say it's true  
I ask myself is this love at all  
When I need you most, you let me fall  
I'm always here at the side of your stage  
Let you live your life  
Pretend I'm okay (don't you know)  
I'll be okay  
I'll hold you close we'll stay forever  
  
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me  
I, I don't understand, how without you I can breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why you can't take me with you  
  
You can pretend I don't exist,  
But you will see my face every time you kiss  
I hope you heard any walls fall down,  
When you hear the sound that I'm okay (don't you know)  
I'll be okay  
You can't hold me down, I will stay forever  
  
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me  
I, I don't understand how without you I can breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why you can't take me with you  
  
I watched you leave  
I'm awake tonight  
And I'm letting go for the last time  
And through the tears I say goodbye  
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out.  
  
I, I don't understand, why you're leaving me  
I, I don't understand how without you I can't breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why you can't take me with you  
Don't leave me here  
Please don't leave me here  
I, I don't understand,  
How without you I can breathe  
Please don't, don't leave me here  
Take my hand and breathe in deep  
I don't understand why how can't take me with you
