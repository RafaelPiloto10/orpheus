I was the baby brother,  
I was the quiet other,  
And I remember mother so well.  
I was the little stranger,  
I never was in danger,  
I could 'a had a manger, pray tell.  
Oh, how she could control me,  
When I was bad she'd scold me,  
Sometimes she wouldn't hold me,  
And I'd cry.  
But momma she never told me a lie -  
Momma she never told me a lie.  
I used to stay out evenings,  
Stay out too late some evenings,  
And momma would be there seething,  
Back home.  
Momma, she sat and waited,  
Sat in the hall and waited,  
Now I know why she hated  
That phone.  
And when I'd come in she'd grab me,  
Right by the arm she'd grab me,  
Lord, when she was finished with me,  
I'd cry ... Oh, I'd cry.  
But momma she never told me a lie.  
Momma she never told me a lie.  
Momma she could control me,  
And when I was bad she'd scold me,  
Sometimes she wouldn't hold me,  
And I'd cry.  
Momma she never told me a lie.  
Momma she never promised me the sky.  
Momma she never told me a lie.
