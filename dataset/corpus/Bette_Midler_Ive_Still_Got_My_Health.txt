I'm always a flop at a top-notch affair,  
But I've still got my health, so what do I care?  
My best ring, alas, is a glass solitaire,  
But I still got my health, so what do I care?  
  
By fashion and foppery, I'm never discussed.  
Attending the opry, my box would be a bust.  
I never shall have that Park Avenue aire,  
But I'm in such health, why should I care?  
  
The hip that I shake doesn't make people stare,  
But I got such health, what do I care?  
The sight of my props never stops a thoroughfare,  
But I still got my health, so what do I care?  
  
Your face is your fortune, so some wise men spoke.  
My face is my fortune, that's why I'm totally broke.  
My ship ain't come in, but I grin while I bear,  
'cause I got my vitamins:  
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H  
I still have my.  
Got no diamonds, got no wealth.  
I got no men, but I got my health.
