I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have some snow and mistletoe  
And presents by the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
Oh, I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
I'll be comin' home  
I'll be comin' home  
Comin' home  
  
My darling, Christmas eve will find me  
Right where the love light gleams  
And I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
I'm comin' home, oh yes  
I'll be comin' home  
I'll be comin' home  
I'll be comin' home
