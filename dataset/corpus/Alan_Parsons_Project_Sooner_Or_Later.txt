Oh what a price we pay  
For the things we say  
And the closer I get to you  
The further you move away  
  
All the lies we tell  
In the games we play  
And the longer I think it over  
The harder it is to stay  
  
Sooner or later I'll be free  
To leave the past behind  
Sooner or later you're gonna be  
The last thing on my mind  
Little by little I'm finding out  
The truth behind your eyes  
Maybe if I don't show  
I thought you might like to know  
You're gonna be the last thing on my mind  
  
You didn't want to know  
I could have told you so  
But the moment I think it's over  
The further there is to go  
  
Just a little word  
Such an easy way  
But the longer I think about it  
The harder it is to say  
  
Sooner or later I'll be free  
To leave the past behind  
Sooner or later you're gonna be  
The last thing on my mind  
Little by little I'm finding out  
The truth behind your eyes  
Maybe if I don't show  
I thought you might like to know  
You're gonna be the last thing on my mind
