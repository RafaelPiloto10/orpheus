Wherever you're going, I wanna go  
Wherever you're heading, can you let me know  
I don't mind catching up, I'm on my way  
Just can't take the thought of you miles away  
  
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life  
I hope that you find it on the first try  
And even though it kills me that you have to go  
I know it will be sadder if you never hit the road  
  
So farewell  
Somebody's gonna miss you  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here  
That somebody is me  
  
I will write to tell you what's going on  
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song  
If you don't mind catching up  
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away  
But I know  
  
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life  
I hope that you find it on the first try  
And even though it kills me that you have to go  
I know it'll be sadder if you never hit the road  
  
So farewell  
Somebody's gonna miss you  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna miss you  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here  
That somebody is me  
  
And I'm gon' try to hold it all in  
Try to hold back my tears  
So it don't make you stay here, yeah  
I'ma try to be a big girl now  
'Cause I don't wanna be  
The reason you don't leave  
  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna miss you  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna miss you  
Farewell  
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here  
That somebody is me
