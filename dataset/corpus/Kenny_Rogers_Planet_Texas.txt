Planet Texas  
  
They rode like they was Rangers as they came out of the skies  
They had High-Tech horses with beacons in their eyes  
My gun was cocked and ready when I looked into their face  
I seen they just weren't just common buck-a-roos born of the human race  
No, sir, these Cowboys came from space  
Their shootin' irons shot laser light and their spurs was anodized  
Bandanas caked with stardust and their jeans was pressurized  
Well he handed me a halter, said, "Tighten up the girth."  
But before I hit the saddle we were miles above the Earth.  
And I mean MILES above the Earth  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
I seen London, Paris, Budapest, Kashmir and Tokyo  
And there ain't no sight like a desert night looking down on Mexico  
To the Moons of Mars and Jupiter, 'round Saturn's rings we rode  
Past the frozen plains of Pluto where even the sunshine's cold  
Man, I do mean COLD  
Then our interstellar stallions sailed through the starless void  
There was nothing to miss in that emptiness, not even a stray asteroid  
So we picked up the trail of a comet tail, man, you can't even DREAM that far  
And the galloping beat like the rhythm of an old catgut guitar  
Just the strummin' of a distant star  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Well, it could have lasted minutes or a hundred thousand years  
When they got me down, I was safe and sound and it hadn't even popped my ears  
And they reared back on their broncos and they shot a bolt of light  
I knew they were the good guys, yes, sir. you got it right  
'Cause their cowboy hats was White  
So I asked 'em as they pulled their reins towards the settin' sun  
I said, "Before you go, I'd like to know, just where you boys come from?"  
Well they opened up a star chart and said, "right here where this 'X' is  
It's the biggest place in Outer Space, the planet known as Texas"  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Yippie-aye-ay-e  
Yippie-aye-ay-e
