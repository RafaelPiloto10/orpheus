Oh yeah  
  
In France, skinny man  
Died of a big disease with a little name  
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle  
Soon she did the same  
  
At home there are seventeen year old boys  
And their idea of fun  
Is being in a gang called The Disciples  
High on crack, totin' a machine gun  
  
Time  
  
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church  
And killed everyone inside  
You turn on the telly and every other story  
Tellin' you somebody died  
  
Sister killed her baby 'cause she could afford to feed it  
They were sending rockets to the moon  
September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time  
Now he's doing horse, it's June  
  
Time, time, yeah  
  
It's silly no, when a rocket ship explodes  
Everybody still want to fly  
Some say a man ain't happy  
Unless a man truly dies, oh why?  
  
Time, time, time  
  
Baby make a speech, star wars fly  
Neighbors just shine it on  
But if the night falls and a bomb falls  
Then everybody sees dawn  
  
Time, time  
  
It's silly now, when a rocket ship explodes  
Everybody still wants to fly  
Some say a man ain't happy, truly, yeah  
Until he dies, oh why?  
  
Time, time, time, time  
  
Sign o' the times mess with your mind  
Hurry before it's too late  
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby  
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy  
  
Time, time  
Everybody, yeah  
Sign o' the times  
[Incomprehensible]  
Time, sign o' the times  
  
Don't you know we can change the world?  
Don't you know every boy and every girl  
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?  
Sign o' the times  
  
Don't you know we can change the world?  
Don't you know every boy and every girl  
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?  
Sign o' the times  
  
Don't you know we can change the world?  
Don't you know every boy and every girl  
Deserves to live life, deserves a peace of mind?  
Sign o' the times
