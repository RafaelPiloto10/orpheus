Hooray for the last of the madness  
Hooray for no more misery  
Cause I'm in the middle of darkness  
Ya see no hope's a dangerous thing  
  
Come on and kill me  
I know that's what you want  
Kill me, I know that's what you want  
Kill me, I know that's all you want  
Kill me, I know that's all you, all that you want  
  
One way takes away all the sadness  
One way take away all of me  
You pushed me to a suicide darkness  
Gimme some death mama, my name's misery  
  
Come on and kill me  
I know that's what you want  
Kill me, I want to die in your arms forever  
Kill me, I know that's what you want  
Kill me, so my tortured eyes  
Never see you again  
  
There's hate on face, the last that I'll ever see  
As I stare into the eyes of my misery  
And I'll leave you with the memory of me  
My sweetest revenge lies here in your misery  
  
Hooray for the horror of darkness  
Horray for the horror is me  
I'm inside on the dark ride of madness  
Gimme some death daddy, my name's misery  
  
Come on and kill me  
I know that's what you want  
Kill me, I want to die in your arms forever  
Kill me, I know that's what you want  
Kill me, so my tortured eyes  
Never see you again  
So I never see you again  
So I never see you again
