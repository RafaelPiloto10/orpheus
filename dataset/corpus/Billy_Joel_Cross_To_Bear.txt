Well I know you got your troubles  
But I've got problems of my own  
It's all relative you see, what happiness should be  
And we got to work it out alone.  
I know about your situation  
And I know all about your pain  
But you know it's true though it's no comfort to you  
Into each life must fall some rain  
  
We all have our cross to bear.  
We all walk in darkness sometimes.  
Though I know it don't seem fair,  
We all have our cross to bear.  
  
You know I hate to see you cry  
I hate to see you cry now  
Because I had my share of tears  
And though it may sound cool  
You know I'd be a fool to let it slide a few more years.  
Listen, I just got to have my freedom  
And if that's giving you the blues  
That's the price you pay, Lord, there ain't no other way  
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues  
'Cause don't you know...  
  
We all have our cross to bear  
We all knuckle under sometimes  
Oh, everybody gets his share  
We all have our cross to bear  
  
Oh, I just got to have my freedom  
And if that's giving you the blues  
Well, that's the price you pay, Lord,  
There ain't no other way  
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues  
'Cause don't you know...  
  
We all have our cross to bear  
We all walk in darkness sometimes  
Oh, everybody gets his share, mmm,  
''cause we all have our cross to bear
