We are children of paradise  
When the Lord created us  
All his work was through  
  
Then the children of paradise  
Did the only thing they really shouldn't do  
  
Children of paradise  
We started out there  
Full of innocence in our eyes  
And without a care  
  
We are children of paradise  
We knew of no crime  
Until one of the meanest lies  
Has changed our time  
  
It was long ago  
In the early morning glow  
When it all began with Adam and Eve  
They were young and free  
And for all eternity  
They were meant to feel  
No trouble no grief  
  
Children of paradise  
  
We're the children of paradise  
In search of the light  
  
That was put in paradise  
And started the night  
  
It was long ago  
  
We are children of paradise  
  
We are the children of paradise  
Who didn't obey  
When we followed the wrong advise  
We wandered astray  
We are the children of paradise  
In search of the light  
  
It was long ago
