While in that gay tropic isle  
I first saw that maiden smile  
Though I had failed in the past  
I said "this is true love at last"  
But then she whispered to me  
That our love never could be  
  
[Chorus]  
Destiny, oh when will I see the day?  
Hopelessly, I've wandered so long this way  
"This could never be" she said pleadingly  
"Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free"  
"This could never be" she said pleadingly  
"Don't ever love me"  
  
My love was motion and grace  
The moonlight soft on her face  
I held her close in my arms  
My heart was quick to her charms  
But then I saw in her glance  
It was just an evening's romance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"This could never be" she said pleadingly  
"Don't ever love me"
