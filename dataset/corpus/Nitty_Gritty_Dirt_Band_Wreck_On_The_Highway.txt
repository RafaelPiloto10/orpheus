Who did you say it was brother?  
Who was it who fell by the way?  
When whiskey and blood run together  
Did you hear anyone pray?  
  
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother  
I didn't hear nobody pray  
I heard the crash on the highway  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
When I heard the crash on the highway  
I knew what it was from the start  
I went to the scene of destruction  
And a picture was stamped on my heart  
  
There was whiskey and blood all together  
Mixed with glass where they lay  
Death played her hand in destruction  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother  
I didn't hear nobody pray  
I heard the crash on the highway  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
I wish I could change this sad story  
That I am now telling you  
But there is no way I can change it  
For somebody's life is now through  
  
Their soul has been called by the Master  
They died in a crash on the way  
And I heard the groans of the dying  
But I didn't hear nobody pray  
  
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother  
I didn't hear nobody pray  
I heard the crash on the highway  
But I didn't hear nobody pray
