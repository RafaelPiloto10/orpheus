Lately I'm feeling glad I'm alive  
'Cause when I'm with you,  
You make me feel so good inside  
Lately it's only you, on my mind  
And I have to smile, when I think of you,  
Knowing that you are mine  
You are mine, you are mine  
  
Ooh baby, back in love again  
Ooh baby, next to you again  
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love  
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya  
Ooh baby, back in love again  
Ooh baby, next to you again  
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love  
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya  
  
The better I know you, the better I feel  
It feels so right, it can't be wrong,  
I know this love is real  
Baby I'll show you what I feel inside  
It's lasted so long, love's growing strong,  
Love's growing stronger now  
Stronger now, stronger now  
  
Ooh baby, back in love again  
Ooh baby, next to you again  
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love  
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya  
Ooh baby, back in love again  
Ooh baby, next to you again  
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love  
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya  
  
Ooh baby, back in love again  
Ooh baby, next to you again  
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love  
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya  
Ooh baby, back in love again  
Ooh baby, next to you again  
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love  
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya
