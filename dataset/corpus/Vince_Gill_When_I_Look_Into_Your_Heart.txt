[Chorus]  
When I look into your heart  
I see us holding each other  
I can finally see forever  
When I look into your heart  
  
I've seen the moon dance on the waters  
Watched the morning sun slip through the trees  
Bu tthe sight of you is the vision  
That takes me to my knees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've never known such comfort  
I've never felt such release  
I've never felt so connected  
I've never known such peace  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can finally see forever  
When I look into your heart
