Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through  
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do  
How many hearts must break,how many will it take  
To satisfy you,just to satisfy you  
  
Another love,another fool  
To play your game  
Another love,another fool  
They're all the same  
  
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through  
Don't be surprised if that someone is you  
You're gonna find when it's too late,a heart that just won't break  
To satisfy you,just to satisfy you  
  
How many tears were cried,how many dreams have died  
To satisfy you,just to satisfy you
