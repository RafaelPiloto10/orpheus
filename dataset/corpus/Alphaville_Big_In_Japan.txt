Winter's cityside  
Crystal bits of snowflakes  
All around my head and in the wind  
I had no illusions  
That I'd ever find a glimpse  
Of summer's heatwaves in your eyes  
You did what you did to me  
Now it's history, I see  
Here's my comeback on the road again  
Things will happen while they can  
I will wait here for my man tonight  
It's easy when you're big in Japan  
  
Aah when you're big in Japan-tonight  
Big in Japan-be-tight  
Big in Japan ooh the eastern sea's so blue  
Big in Japan-alright  
Pay! - Then I'll sleep by your side  
Things are easy when you're big in Japan  
Oh when you're big in Japan  
  
Neon on my naked skin, passing silhouettes  
Of strange illuminated mannequins  
Shall I stay here at the zoo  
Or should I go and change my point of view  
For other ugly scenes  
You did what you did to me  
Now it's history I see  
Here's my comeback on the road again  
Things will happen while they can  
I will wait here for my man tonight  
It's easy when you're big in Japan  
  
Aah when you're big in Japan-tonight  
Big in Japan-be-tight  
Big in Japan ooh the eastern sea's so blue  
Big in Japan-alright, pay!  
Then I'll sleep by your side  
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
