Hey there baby with the long hair, I know you played it cool  
You play the game of broken hearts, with the heart of a fool  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool  
I never was a scholar, was never good at school  
I learned to love the hard way, with the heart of a fool  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with a heart of a fool  
  
You know you should have warned me, I didn't know the rules  
Now I'm just a lonesome traveller, with a heart of a fool  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool  
Too many times I loved you, too soon you said goodbye  
Too late I learned my lesson, now, too many times I cried  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool
