Do you remember, the first time you fell in love  
The way it felt, the way it feels  
Being able to say, from the bottom of your heart  
I love you for real  
Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat  
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still  
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em  
Oh what a thrill!  
You was always searching, and finally your dream came true  
They came strolling along  
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart  
I swear, I'll never do you wrong  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Nothing in the world could separate the two  
And even though you've only known that person for a short time  
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart  
  
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK  
You're too young to be so serious  
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you  
And walk away aggravated and furious  
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter  
The relationship's yours  
You feel you're maturing, and hey,  
You can fight your own battles and wars  
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them  
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm  
Life is sweet, kissing caressing and hugging  
And keeping each other warm  
But now comes the serious part, 'cause love  
Believe me, it ain't a easy task  
We'd have one argument too many  
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?  
  
Am I still your heart or is something, pulling us apart  
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what  
You run out the door, I tell you come back  
I love you, you shout out, so what?  
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me  
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?  
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain  
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right  
And held you tight, every night  
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?  
Cause if it is, aw, baby, please, don't do this to me  
I'm trying to reach you, trying to talk to you  
It's killing me, 'cause you're my heart  
That's right I admit it  
  
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go  
I struggle and fight for you against all odds  
Get down on my knees, and pray to God  
That our love is in the cards  
Cause I know you're right for me  
And I know I'm right for you  
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands  
People say forget about it, move on  
But see they don't understand  
You're nothing to them, but you're so much to me  
So much in fact that I'd give my life  
To stare into your eyes and caress your face  
As the priest, announces us man and wife  
We'd live happily, ever after  
White picket fence and the whole nine yards  
And anything that anybody said  
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart  
  
So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind  
I'm begging you baby please come back home  
I'll be tossing and turning, as I lay in my bed  
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones  
This can't be true, I'm losing you  
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright  
All I wanna do in this whole wide world, is hold you tight  
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried  
Now it's up to you baby, please understand  
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything  
Just let me take ya by the hand  
And lead ya, baby I got ya  
Protect you like a mother, protects a child  
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while  
You're my heart
