Refrain:  
Biscuits in the oven, gonna watch 'em rise  
Biscuits in the oven, gonna watch 'em rise  
Biscuits in the oven, gonna watch 'em rise  
Right before my very eyes.  
  
When they get ready, gonna jump and shout...  
  
Roll my eyes and bug them out-hey, hey  
  
Gonna clap my hands and stomp my feet...  
Right before the very next beat-  
  
Refrain  
  
Gonna look both ways when I cross the street...  
Gonna take my time when the light turns green
