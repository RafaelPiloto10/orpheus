We're sleeping together  
But still it's not enough  
And maybe you'll come on my back  
To fuck, who can tell?  
I guess there is no one to blame  
We have only one left (only one left)  
Will things ever be the same again?  
  
[Hook]  
It's the final condom  
The final condom  
Ohh!  
  
[Verse 2]  
We're heading for Uranus (Uranus)  
And still we stand tall  
Cause maybe they've seen us  
And welcome us, all yeah  
With so many strokes to go  
And blowjobs to be done (to be done)  
I'm sure that we'll all miss it so  
  
[Hook]  
It's the final condom  
The final condom  
The final condom  
(Final condom). Ohhh oh oh ohhh  
The final condom.  
Ohhh  
It's the final condom  
The final condom  
  
The final condom  
(Final condom)  
Ohhh. It's the final condom  
We enjoy it togetherrr.  
(The final condom)  
We'll all miss it so  
It's the final condom (Final condom)  
Ohhh. It's. the. final. condom
