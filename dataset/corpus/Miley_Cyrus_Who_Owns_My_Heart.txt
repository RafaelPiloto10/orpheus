Creation shows me what to do  
I'm dancing on the floor with you And when you touch my hand  
I go crazy, yeah  
The music tells me what to feel  
I like you now  
But is it real by the time we say goodnight  
I'll know if this is right  
And I feel you (you) coming through my veins.  
Am I into you (you) or is it the music to blame?  
  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'  
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece  
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark  
Who owns my heart  
  
The room is full  
But all I see is the way  
Your eyes just blaze through me  
Like fire in the dark  
We're like living art  
And it hits me  
Like a tidal wave  
Are you feeling me  
Or is the music to blame  
  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'  
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece  
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark  
Who owns my heart  
  
So come on, baby  
Keep provoking me  
Keep on roping me  
Like a rodeo  
Baby, pull me close  
Come on  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go  
  
And it hits me  
Like a tidal wave  
Are you feeling me  
Or is the music to blame  
  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'  
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks  
Who owns my heart  
Is it love or is it art  
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece  
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark  
Who owns my heart
