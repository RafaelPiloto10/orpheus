Tryin' to say I'm sorry, didn't mean to break your heart  
And find you waitin' up by the light of day  
There's a lot I want to tell you, but I don't know where to start  
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away  
Ooh, baby I tried to make it, I just got lost along the way  
But every time I look at you,  
No matter what I'm goin' through, it's easy to see  
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you,  
Seem to come easily  
Cause you're everything to me  
I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart  
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending  
I thought it wouldn't matter, if it all just came apart  
But now I realize I was just pretending  
Ooh, baby, I know I hurt you, but you can still believe in me  
But every time I look at you, no matter what I'm goin' through,  
It's easy to see  
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you,  
Seem to come easily  
Cause you're everything to me  
It's gonna take a little time to show you,  
Just what you mean to me, oh yeah  
It seems the more I get to know you, the more I need to make you see  
You're everything I need, yeah  
Oho, I need ya, I need ya, I need ya...  
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I know I hurt you,  
But you can still believe in me  
But every time I look at you, no matter what I'm goin' through,  
It's easy to see  
And every time I hold you, the things I never told you,  
Seem to come easily  
Cause you're everything to me  
You're everything to me, you're everything to me
