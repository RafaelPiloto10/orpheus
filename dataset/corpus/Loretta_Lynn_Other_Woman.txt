I'd like to introduce myself  
I'm the other woman the other woman in your husband's life  
The whole town's buzzin' bout us and our stolen moments  
They're callin' you the true and faithful wife  
But you gave him the right to seek that other woman  
And you know who was first to cheat on who  
I just accepted love from him you never wanted  
The other woman didn't steal from you  
[ steel ]  
Now everybody's blaming me I'm the other woman  
But who are they to judge who's wrong or right  
Their whispers might be different if they knew what I know  
The husband still beats you home ever night  
But you gave him the right...
