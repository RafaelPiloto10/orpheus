Take me back to an easy life,  
Robin Hood and Marian,  
A lone ranger on a silver horse.  
Make believe in a box of sand,  
Bang, bang, we all fall down.  
Just about dinner time  
I'm eatin' bullets. Come on Fury - take me for a ride.  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Sun down with a chorus girl,  
Ragtime and whiskey pour.  
Midnight in a rented room  
With a key inside the bedroom door.  
Bang, bang, we all fall down.  
Just about out of my mind.  
Come on Lily. Come on honey - take me for a ride.  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Last chance for an easy life  
Double down and let it ride.  
Lone ranger with a silver bullet  
For the one arm man inside.  
Bang, bang, we all fall down.  
Just about run out of time.  
Come on seven. Come on eleven - take me for a ride.  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse
