Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
She is sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down on lover's lane she strayed  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone  
Madam  
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail  
Madam  
They strung her upon the old willow across the way  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
