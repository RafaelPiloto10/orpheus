Why was I born? Why am I livin'?  
What do I get? What am I givin'?  
Why do I want a thing I daren't hope for?  
What can I hope for? I wish I knew  
  
Why do I try to draw you near me?  
Why do I cry? You never hear me  
I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?  
Why was I born to love you?  
  
Why was I born? Why am I livin'?  
What do I get? What am I givin'?  
Why do I want a thing I daren't hope for?  
What can I hope for? I wish I knew
