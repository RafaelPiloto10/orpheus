See my chariot run to your ships  
I'll drive you back in the sea  
You came here for gold  
The wall will not hold  
This day was promised to me  
The Gods are my shield  
My fate has been sealed  
Lightning and javelins fly  
Soon many will fall  
We are storming the wall  
Stones fall snow from the sky  
We will pay with our glory  
In the fire of battle  
Zeus today is mine  
Killing all in my way  
Like sheep and like cattle  
Smashing skulls of all who defy  
I spare not the hammer  
I spare not the sword  
This day will ring with my name  
None have to chase me  
Let he who will face me  
Kill me or die by the sword  
  
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye  
This was your time, but the armor you  
Wore was mine, I will not rest until  
Hector's blood is spilled  
His bones will all be broken  
Dragged across the field  
This dear friend is how we'll say  
Goodbye, until we meet in the sky  
  
Here inside the walls of Troy, the Gods weigh my  
Fate from this day do I abstain, to a memory of  
Hate to pay for all the blood that spilled  
The many thousands I did kill, no walls can  
Contain in the Gods almighty will  
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide  
The Gods leave no choices so we all must die  
Oh Achilles let my arrows fly  
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky  
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand it was  
Foretold I will die by my hand  
Into Hades my soul descends  
  
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold  
For all shall come to know me  
As they fall unto their knees  
Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny  
When the cards of life were dealt  
My hand a ruthless fate  
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate  
A bloodbath I was born to bring, my birth I'm an assassin  
To cut the cord of life and death  
Ties to Earth unfasten  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall the Hades waits  
Kill  
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield  
His body's mangled wounds  
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom  
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction  
I fall upon your bringing death, the Gods give no protection  
Coward in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold  
For all shall come to know me, as they fall unto their  
Knees Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits  
Die die die die  
  
The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled  
In the hear of the battle, Hector was killed  
See him Patroclus, down in the dust  
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust  
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed  
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled  
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire  
With oxen , sheep and two of your hounds  
Your funeral Pyre high off the ground  
Hector's body dragged three times around  
I will carry the torch to your funeral Pyre  
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire  
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body  
Until your body is burned  
A prophecy spoken a promise fulfilled  
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed
