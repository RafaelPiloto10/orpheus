Sunrise  
And the new day's breakin' through  
The morning  
Of another day without you  
And as the hours roll by  
No-one's there to see me cry  
Except the sunrise  
The sunrise and you  
  
Tired eyes drift across the shore  
Looking for love and nothing more  
But as the sea rolls by  
No-one's there to see me cry  
Except the sunrise  
The sunrise and you  
  
Sunrise  
Bless my eyes  
Catch my soul  
Make me whole again  
  
Sunrise, new day  
Hear my song  
I'm tired of fightin'  
And foolin' around  
But from now on  
Till who knows when  
My sword will be my friend  
And I'll love you, love you  
For all of my time
