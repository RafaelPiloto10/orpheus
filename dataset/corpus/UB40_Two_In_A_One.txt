Jackpot is when you win plenty at money  
Jail is a place I don't want to go  
January the first month of the year  
Jealose is when five women fancy  
But john is the proper name fe a english man  
Jockey is a profisnel horse rider  
Me sah June is the sixth mounth of the year  
  
(chorus)  
  
An jam is when you caint move in a party  
Mi say england is a place that covered in snow  
Man we drink the ribeana wi don't no like drink beer  
But jelly fish jahman mi say them swim in a the sea  
Unless you born an bread as a jamican  
The pirate them a gather round the jolly roger  
Wi wackad as single but wi deadly as a pair  
  
(chorus)  
  
No fe treatment go a hospital
