Scar tissue that I wish you saw  
Sarcastic Mister know it all  
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause'  
With the bird I'll share  
With the bird I'll share  
This lonely view  
With the bird I'll share  
This lonely view  
  
Push me up against the wall  
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra  
Fallin' all over myself  
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view  
  
Blood loss in a bathroom stall  
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl  
Wave goodbye to ma and pa 'cause  
With the bird I'll share  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view  
  
Soft spoken with a broken jaw  
Step outside but not to brawl  
Autumn's sweet we call it fall  
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view  
  
Scar tissue that I wish you saw  
Sarcastic Mister know it all  
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause'  
With the bird I'll share  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view
