Living in a world that dies within,  
you are they who try and touch the wind.  
You could be the blessed one  
that makes me love you.  
  
And doing what you've never done before,  
taking every wave that hits the shore,  
you could be a silver star that shines  
on my blue island.  
It's gonna be a blue island.  
See you on a blue island.  
Take you to a blue island.  
  
Blue island.  
  
You can see the rain.  
You can feel the pain  
that no part of me is going through.  
  
Everybody say  
we can find a way.  
Do you know the place you're going to?  
  
You're going to a blue island.  
  
This is what the lonely heart must know.  
This is what it takes to make it grow.  
You could be a child alone.  
But you may save the world.  
  
Maybe it's the words that mean goodbye.  
There but for the grace of God go I.  
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island.  
  
Gonna be a blue island.  
See you on a blue island.  
Take you to a blue island.  
  
Blue island.  
Blue island.  
Blue island.
