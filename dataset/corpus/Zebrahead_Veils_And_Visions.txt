I crash so hard  
Fall so low  
Just when things look right  
That's when you know that I'm alone  
I take the chance  
To lose it all  
Take a look around me  
And you'll see where I have stalled  
This is the last time that I'm sayin'  
And here's the end  
Of the night  
Of the line  
Won't somebody save me?  
Here's the time  
Time for more  
Time for everything and anything  
It's alright  
It's alright  
And we go on and on and on and on again  
The rooms on fire  
You lock the door  
Your new way of thinking will not get  
Me off the floor  
Take this time  
To take a fall  
I've given you my best  
And now you won't see that at all  
This is the last time that I'm sayin'  
And here's the end  
Of the night  
Of the line  
Won't somebody save me?  
Here's the time  
Time for more  
Time for everything and anything  
It's alright  
It's alright  
And we go on and on and on and on again  
Back beat  
Everybody is changing  
I'm so stuck and you are amazing  
This is my low  
You are the reason  
Live to be numb  
My fall is the season  
Inhale the bullshit  
Makes my skin itch but it gets me lit  
Don't ya wish that the pieces fit  
Like when we were kids  
You can't bide lost time  
Can't bide lost time  
You can't bide lost time  
Can't bide yours and mine  
You can't bide lost time  
Can't bide lost time  
You can't bide lost time  
Can't bide yours and mine  
Mine  
Here's the end  
Of the night  
Of the line  
Won't somebody save me?  
Here's the time  
Time for more  
Time for everything and anything  
It's alright  
It's alright  
And we go on and on and on and on  
On and on and on and on again
