I'd like to see you  
I'll take your hand  
And when I pull out  
You'll understand  
See me when you're lookin' for love  
A naked lie from the heavens above  
  
I've been around  
Since I don't know when  
I've got some lovers  
That you could rent  
I seek you when I'm diggin' for gold  
I feel alive since my soul was sold  
  
I'm scared thinkin' about the 4th of July  
Can't seem to fight it, it can't be denied  
I've got more than that on my brain  
I've got so much, it'll drive you insane  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
'Cause when I get to the top  
And I don't want to stop  
'Cause I like it, like it  
I love it, love it  
I like it a lot, wooo  
  
You want a real look  
At paradise  
Simple pleasures  
Just won't suffice  
See me when you're lookin' for love  
A naked lie from the heavens above  
  
I'm in color, and you're black and white  
Let's start the rumors from heaven tonight  
I've got a penthouse in Manhattan Place  
Come up and see me if you want a taste, yeah  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
'Cause when I get to the top  
And I don't want to stop  
'Cause I like it, like it  
I love it, love it  
I like it a lot, wooo  
  
Sitting pretty  
Sitting pretty  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
'Cause when I get to the top  
And I don't want to stop  
'Cause I like it, like it  
I love it, love it  
I like it a lot, wooo  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
Yeah when I get to the top  
And I don't wanna stop  
'Cause I like it, I love it, I like it  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury
