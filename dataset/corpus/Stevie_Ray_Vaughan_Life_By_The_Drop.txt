Hello there my old friend  
Not so long ago it was till the end  
We played outside in the pourin' rain  
On our way up the road we started over again  
  
You're livin' out dreams of you on top  
My mind is achin' oh lord it won't stop  
that's how it happened livin' life by the drop  
  
Up and down the road in our worn out shoes  
Talkin' 'bout good things and singin' the blues  
You went your way and I stayed behind  
We both knew it was just a matter or time  
  
You're livin' out dreams of you on top  
My mind is achin' oh lord it won't stop  
that's how it happened life by the drop  
  
No waste of time we're allowed today  
Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way  
Times been between us,a means to a end  
God its good to be here walkin' together my friend  
  
Livin' our dreams  
My mind stoped achin'  
that's how it happened livin' life by the drop
