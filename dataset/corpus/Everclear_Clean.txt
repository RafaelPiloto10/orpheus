I want you to stay the way you are, skinny legs and all  
I know the time is coming when the boys will begin to call  
I wish that I could hurt for you when you are learning how to fall  
You are the reason that I am alive today  
You are the reason that I have changed my life in a wonderful way  
I can see the passion that is growing inside of you  
I can see the sadness that throws a shadow down on everything you do  
I wish I was the man you thought I was  
Back when life was new for you  
You don't know what it's like to feel a love like this  
You don't know what it's like to feel this kind of helplessness  
You don't know what it's like to be weak  
I hope you never know  
I don't want you to be like me  
I want you to be clean  
Clean  
You are going to find a reason to hate me someday  
You are going to find a reason to push me away  
You are going to find reasons to blame me for your pain  
I hope you never lose the magic that is big inside of you  
I hope you never do the ridiculous things that I used to do  
I hope you never know my disease  
Never being good enough  
I don't want you to be like me  
I want you to be clean  
I want you to be clean
