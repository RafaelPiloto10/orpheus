Follow in my wake, you've not that much at stake  
For I have plowed the seas, and smoothed the troubled waters  
Come along let's have some fun, the hard work has been done  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
  
Just for starters, barometer is my soup  
I'm descended from a deck hand on a sloop  
I travel on the song lines that only dreamers see  
Not known for predictability  
  
Come and follow in our wake, you've not that much at stake  
For we have plowed the seas, and smoothed the troubled waters  
Come along let's have some fun, seems our work is done  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
  
Sail the main course, sail it in a simple sturdy craft  
Keep her well stocked with short stories and long laughs  
Go fast enough to get there, but slow enough to see  
Moderation seems to be the key  
  
Constantly searching  
Oh my eyes have seen some horizons  
And I've crossed the oceans  
For more than just thrills  
No I'm not the first  
Won't be the last  
You lust for the future  
But treasure the past  
  
Follow in my wake, you've not that much at stake  
For I have plowed the seas, and smoothed the troubled waters  
Come along let's have some fun, the hard work has been done  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters  
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just for starters
