You've gotta get up every morning  
Put a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people are gonna treat you better  
You're gonna find,  
Yes you will  
That you're beautiful as you feel  
Waiting at the station  
With the work day wind a-blowing  
I've got nothing to do  
But watch the passers by  
Mirrored in their faces  
I see frustration growing  
And they don't see a-showing  
Why do I?  
You've gotta get up every morning  
Put a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people are gonna treat you better  
You're gonna find,  
Yes you will  
That you're beautiful as you feel  
I have often asked myself  
The reason for the sadness  
In the world  
But tears are just a lullaby  
If there's any answer  
May be love kind  
And the madness may be not  
Oh, but we can only try  
You've gotta get up every morning  
Put a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people are gonna treat you better  
You're gonna find,  
Oh, yes, you will  
That you're beautiful...  
Yes, you're beautiful...  
Yeah, beautiful as you feel!
