Exercise the demon that is living up inside you  
After all you think you've been through, just what have you been through  
Try to get beside yourself this tearing at your insides  
If you end up on the wrong side, always standing so strong  
  
Sharpen up your teeth your dreams are more than worth defending  
In a, fight that's never ending  
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong  
  
The further you go  
The less you know  
You're born to quit, you've blown it (you've blown it)  
You need to let go, of letting go  
You're full of shit, you're born to quit  
  
Something supernatural it seems it could possess you  
No melevalance about you yeah that might not be true (might not be true)  
How they kept you demonized the fucked up situation,  
How you've killed off all the angels taking notice of you  
  
Sharpen up your teeth your dreams are more than worth defending  
In a, fight that's never ending  
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong  
  
The further you go  
The less you know  
You're born to quit, you've blown it (you've blown it)  
You need to let go, of letting go  
You're full of shit, you're born to quit  
  
You've blown it  
You're born to quit  
  
Sharpe up your teeth your dreams are more than worth defending  
In a, fight that's never ending  
GO on, go ahead and prove me wrong  
  
The further you go  
The less you know  
You're born to quit, you've blown it (you've blown it)  
You need to let go, of letting go  
You're full of shit, you're born to quit  
  
You've blown it!  
You're born to quit!  
You've blown it!  
(you've blown it, you've blown it!)
