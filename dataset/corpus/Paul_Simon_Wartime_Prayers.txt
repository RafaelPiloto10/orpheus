Prayers offered in times of peace are silent conversations,  
Appeals for love or love's release  
In private invocations  
But all that is changed now,  
Gone like a memory from the day before the fires.  
People hungry for the voice of God  
Hear lunatics and liars  
Wartime prayers, wartime prayers  
In every language spoken,  
For every family scattered and broken.  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy,  
If you're just a halfway decent man.  
I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan.  
I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,  
Even a little drop will do.  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before I'm through.  
  
Times are hard, it's a hard time  
But everybody knows all about hard times.  
The thing is, what are you gonna do?  
Well, you cry and try to muscle through  
Try to rearrange your stuff  
But when the wounds are deep enough,  
It's all that we can bear,  
We wrap ourselves in prayer.  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy,  
If you're just a halfway decent man.  
I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan.  
I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,  
Even a little drop willdo.  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before I'm through.  
A mother murmurs in twilight sleep  
And draws her babies closer.  
With hush-a-byes for sleepy eyes,  
And kisses on the shoulder.  
To drive away despair  
She says a wartime prayer
