She looked so much like a lady, but she was so much like a child.  
A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled.  
She always held it deep inside, but somehow I always knew  
She's go away when the grass turned green  
And the sky turned baby blue.  
  
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.  
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.  
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,  
And I still don't know why,  
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.  
  
She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.  
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.  
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do,  
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue.  
  
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.  
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.  
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,  
And I still don't know why,  
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.  
  
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.  
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.  
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,  
And I still don't know why,  
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.
