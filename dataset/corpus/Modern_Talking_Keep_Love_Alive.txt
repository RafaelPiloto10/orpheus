Bitter sweet, you wasted years  
Lonely dream about souvenirs  
Baby, touch an hand and make a friend, tonight  
Bitter sweet love has no pride  
Try again time is on your side  
Oh, strange are the ways of love  
Come on and take my heart  
It's breaking just apart  
  
Keep love alive  
Too hard to hold it  
Keep love alive  
Too hard to stop it  
  
Keep the fire burning in your heart  
Forever and ever  
Keep the fire burning from the start  
Ever together  
  
Bitter sweet so high so low  
Lonely dreamer  
Life is a show  
Oh, touch an hand  
Make a friend, tonight  
Bitter sweet more than words can say  
Evil women want to play  
Oh, strange are the ways of love  
Come on and take my heart  
It's breaking just apart
