And on a Tuesday, I'm gonna hug ya  
And on a Wednesday, Thursday,

Care for you, baby, till the cows come home  
Do for you, baby, for the love that I seek  
Slave for you, baby, every day of the week  
  
(And on a Monday) scrub your dirty floor  
(On a Tuesday) I do a whole lot more  
(On a Wednesday) I wash your dirty clothes  
To have a little lovin' 'fore the weekend goes  
  
And I'll be (I'll be), your seven-day fool  
And I'll be (I'll be), your seven-day fool  
And I'll be (I'll be), your seven-day fool  
Only because I really love you
