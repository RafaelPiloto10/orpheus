Let's begin  
It started with a plan  
To get out of here  
  
Said "hey comin' "  
Cuz the weather don't wait for no one  
And sure not us  
  
Seems so precious  
Or maybe we're just tired  
And bored with our lives  
Because it  
Seems so sinful at the same time  
  
5 miles out of town  
She turns to me and says  
"Is it too late to turn around?"  
Cuz I think I forgot my things  
And I think we forgot our heads  
And it can't get too far without that  
  
Seems so precious  
Or maybe we're just tired  
And bored with our lives  
Because it  
Seems so sinful at the same time  
  
Seems so precious  
Or maybe we're just tired  
And bored with our lives  
Because it  
Seems so sinful at the same time  
  
Seems so precious  
Or maybe we're just tired  
And bored with our lives  
Because it  
Seems so sinful at the same time  
  
She turned around  
I seen that face as I watched her say  
Goodbye.....  
Goodbye........
