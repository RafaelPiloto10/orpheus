Young hunks  
Cyberpunks  
And sweet things  
Trying hard to change your luck  
Baby thugs  
Bad spuds  
And mean things  
Living for today or maybe even yesterday  
Look around  
Shaky ground  
Do the right thing  
In this world you're just a guest  
Do it now  
Time's run out for the pig thing  
Living for today stealing from tomorrow  
Law and order puppets remote-controlled by greed  
And TV preacher robots won't give you what you need  
Use your head  
Sidestep the traps  
Snake through the chaos with a smooth noodle map  
Besides the king's been dead  
They blew off his head in '63  
Big bucks  
Energy sucks  
And dumb things  
Make it hard to live and breathe  
Add it up  
No matter what  
There's one thing  
Living for today there's maybe no tomorrow  
Subhuman bloodless leaders fed on lies and fear  
And TV anchor news teams trim all we see and hear  
Use your head  
Sidestep the traps  
Snake through the chaos with a smooth noodle map  
Besides God isn't dead  
He's in your head  
Right where he ought to be
