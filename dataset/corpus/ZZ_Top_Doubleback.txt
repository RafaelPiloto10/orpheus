I got shot through a space not long ago,  
I thought I knew the place so well.  
It wasn't the same, now it goes to show,  
Sometime you never can tell.  
  
I'm lookin' high and low, don't know where to go,  
I got to double back, my friend.  
The only way to find, what I left behind  
I got to double back again, double back again.  
  
You know I'm movin on in this fine machine,  
Rollin' on through the night.  
Seein' things like I've never seen  
And it's taking me outta sight.  
  
Lookin' high and low, don't know where to go,  
I got to double back, my friend.  
The only way to find, what I left behind  
I got to double back again, double back again.  
  
It's got me up and down,  
I been lost and found,  
Down in a deep dark hole.  
Looks like my luck has changed,  
I been rearranged  
And I'm coming out on a roll.  
  
Lookin' high and low, don't know where to go,  
I got to double back, my friend.  
The only way to find, what I left behind  
I got to double back again, double back again.
