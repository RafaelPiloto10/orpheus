Dawg you gotta feel me on this one  
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit  
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga  
Geezy, Juve and Turk, be and Slim dawg pay attention dawg  
[Verse 1]  
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this  
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch  
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip  
I slip a clip in every rip , cas hatas likely to trip  
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip  
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit  
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when I'm pissed  
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit  
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly  
And i noI might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me  
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court  
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start  
Its like i'm livin happy now  
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now  
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts  
and puff a cooler bust me up  
And say a prayer for everyday  
just so I get through the stuff but I be like  
(Chorus) - 2x  
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man  
being responsible for everybody and yo own man  
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man  
I'm gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN  
[Verse 2]  
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up  
And usually I'm fed up thinkin everythang's a set up  
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts  
And i get hit up with all kinda stress  
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough  
But I mantain to climb through it all  
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball  
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow  
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall  
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a solution  
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion  
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it  
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me  
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit  
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest  
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do  
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through  
(Chorus) - 2x  
[Verse 3]  
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic  
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it  
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became  
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say its a game  
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change  
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change  
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants  
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man  
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it  
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit  
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeced at last  
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path  
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me  
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me  
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone  
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown  
so I'll be good on my own but I be like  
(Chorus) fading.......Believe Dat
