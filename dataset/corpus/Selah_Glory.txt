One day eyes that are blind will see You clearly  
One day all who deny will finally believe  
One day hearts made of stone will break in pieces  
One day chains once unbroken will fall down at Your feet  
So we wait for that one day, come quickly  
  
We wanna see Your glory  
Every knee falls down before Thee  
Every tongue offers You praise with every hand raised  
Singing glory to You and unto You only  
We'll sing glory to Your name  
  
One day voices that lie will all be silenced  
One day all that's divided will be whole again  
One day death will retreat and wave it's white flag  
One day love will defeat the strongest enemy  
So we wait for that one day, come quickly  
  
We wanna see Your glory  
Every knee falls down before Thee  
Every tongue offers You praise with every hand raised  
Singing glory to You and unto You only  
We'll sing glory to Your name  
  
We know not today or the hour  
Or the moments in between  
But we know the end of the story  
When we'll see  
  
Your glory  
Every knee falls down before Thee  
Every tongue offers You praise with every hand raised  
Singing glory to You and unto You only  
We'll sing glory to Your name, oh one day
