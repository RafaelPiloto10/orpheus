Seems like lately we're losin' touch  
Work to hard and worry too much  
I think it's time for me and you  
To get back to what we used to do  
  
We'd steal away on a Saturday night  
Meet in the field when the time was right  
Just us two and a starry sky  
Felt like paradise  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin' down that road tonight  
I said it's too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin' maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
Like it did back then, it'll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
  
Remember all the songs that we used to know  
Dancin' in the dark to the radio  
Lost in the rythmn, kickin' up some heat  
The memories are still so sweet  
  
Time's gone by but it's plain to see  
I still love you and you still love me  
Let's shake these troubles put 'em all aside  
see'mon we're gonna take that ride  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin' down that road tonight  
I said it's too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin' maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
  
Like it did back then, it'll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
Down that road
