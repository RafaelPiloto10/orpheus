What now, my love  
Now that you've left me  
How can I live  
Through another day  
Watching my dreams  
Turn into ashes  
And my hopes  
Into bits of clay  
Once I could see  
Once I could feel  
Now I am numb  
I've become unreal  
I walk the night  
Oh without a goal  
Stripped of my heart  
And my soul  
What now, my love  
Now that it's over  
I feel the world  
Closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And there's the sky  
Where the sea should be  
What now, my love  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool  
To go on and on  
No one would care  
No one would cry  
If I should live  
If I should die  
What now, my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last  
My last goodbye
