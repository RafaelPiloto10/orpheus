My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable  
Yet you're my favorite work of art  
  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
But don't change a hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, little Valentine stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day  
  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
But don't you change one hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay, little Valentine stay  
Each day is Valentine's Day
