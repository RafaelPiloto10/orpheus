When the earth was young  
And the air was sweet  
And the mountains kissed the sky  
In the great beyond, with its many paths  
Man and nature lived side by side  
  
In this wilderness of danger and beauty  
Lived three brothers, bonded by love  
Their hearts full of joy  
They ask now for guidance  
Reaching out to the skies up above  
  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls  
With all you know  
Show us that in your eyes  
We are all the same  
Brothers to each other  
In this world we remain truly  
Brothers all the same  
  
Give us wisdom to pass to each other  
Give us strength so we understand  
That the things we do  
The choices we make  
Give direction to all life's plans  
  
To look in wonder  
At all we've been given  
In a world that's not always as it seems  
Every corner we turn  
Only leads to another  
A journey ends, but another begins  
  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls  
With all you know  
Show us that in your eyes  
We are all the same  
Brothers to each other  
In this world we remain truly  
Brothers all the same  
  
Brothers all the same
