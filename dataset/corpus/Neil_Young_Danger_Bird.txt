Danger bird, he flies alone  
And he rides the wind  
Back to his home  
Although his wings  
Have turned to stone  
  
And we used  
To be so calm  
Now I think  
About you  
All day long  
'Cause you've been  
With another man  
Here you are  
And here I am.  
  
That's the moment  
That he cracked  
Long ago in the  
Museum with his  
Friends.  
  
The jailbird takes the raps  
And he finds himself  
Spread-eagled on the tracks  
But the training that he learned  
Will get him nowhere fast.  
  
And I know we  
Should be free  
But freedom's just  
A prison to me  
'Cause I lied  
To keep it kind  
When I left you  
Far behind.  
  
With the rain  
Pounding on his  
Back he recalls  
The moment that  
He cracked long  
Ago in the museum  
With his friends.  
And like those  
Memories the rain  
Keeps pounding  
Down, down, down.  
  
And though these wings  
Have turned to stone  
I can fly fly fly away.  
Watch me fly above the city  
Like a shadow on the sky.  
Fly, fly, fly.
