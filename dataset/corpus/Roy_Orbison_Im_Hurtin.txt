Dumb-dee-dumb-dee-dumb-ooh-yeah-yeah,  
Dumb-dee-dumb-dee-dumb-ooh-yeah-yeah,  
Oh, I'm hurtin'.  
  
Felt this way,yesterday,  
Today, I keep hurtin', yeah, hurtin'.  
  
Time goes by, right on by,  
And I, I'm still hurtin', yeah, hurtin'.  
  
You walked away, and the pain began.  
I knew I'd never, love again.  
  
Oh, my heart, tore apart  
And I'm sure hurtin' yeah hurtin'.  
  
You walked away, and the pain began.  
I knew I'd never, love again.  
  
Seems to me my destiny  
Is to be just hurtin'  
Yeah, hurtin'.
