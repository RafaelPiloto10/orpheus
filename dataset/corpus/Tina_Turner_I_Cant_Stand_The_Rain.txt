I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
  
Hey window pain  
Tell me, do you remember  
How sweet it used to be  
  
When we were together  
Everything was so grand  
Now that we've parted  
There's just one sound  
That I just can't stand  
  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
  
Hey hey rain  
Get out of my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories
