If you don't hear me, how can I tell you  
If you don't listen, why should I speak  
If you're indifferent, how can I reach you  
Just 'cos you're angry don't assume I'm weak  
  
Howling Wolf, and old Link Wray  
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day  
Bobby Darin, Brownie McGhee  
Elvis, Buddy and Eddie C.  
  
Music makes me, makes me strong  
Strong vibrations, make me long  
Long for a place where I belong  
You will find me in this song.  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music, or will there be war  
Will we be rich, or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music, or will there be war  
Will we be rich, or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
A thousand angels, a million children  
Fire and fear in a suicide eye  
Golden stairway to a Zeppelin heaven  
Rolling thunder under New York sky  
  
Frank 'n' Ella, Ray 'What'd I Say'  
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray  
Amadeus and Ludvig Van  
Henry, Johann and the doo dah band.  
  
We are here in celebration  
This music's gonna make us strong  
We climb up high, to the golden station  
Curtis Mayfield ain't waiting long  
  
(Get on board...)  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music, or will there be war  
Will we be rich, or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
Will there be music, or will there be war  
Will we be rich, or will we be poor  
Who will walk through the mirror door  
  
Howling Wolf, and old Link Wray  
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day  
Bobby Darin, Brownie McGhee  
Elvis, Buddy and Eddie C.  
  
Frank 'n' Ella, Ray 'What'd I Say'  
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray  
Amadeus and Ludvig Van  
Henry, Johann and the doo dah band.  
  
Keep on climbing
