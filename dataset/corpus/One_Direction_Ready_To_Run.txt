[Verse:]  
There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny  
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, running out of time  
Without you I'll never make it out alive  
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright  
There's a devil in your smile it's chasing me  
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed  
There's a moment when you finally realize  
There's no way you can change the rolling tide  
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run  
  
[Verse 2:]  
There's a future in my life I can't foresee  
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me  
There will always be the kind that criticize  
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run  
  
[Bridge:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
I'd give everything that I've got for your love  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run
