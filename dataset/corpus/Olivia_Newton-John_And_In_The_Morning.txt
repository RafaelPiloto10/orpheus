In the early morning when I'm lying by your side  
Doubts go through my mind, thoughts I try to hide  
Lying there I wonder if your love for me is real  
Or just another fantasy  
  
Then I try to think about the way things used to be  
Misty memories, hazy like a dream  
All we did together, all the things we planned to do  
There was only me and you  
  
And in the morning I touch you  
And I find you're still there  
I want to tell you that I love you  
Please never leave me  
In the morning light I turn to look at you  
And hope that you still care  
  
When I look back on our life, the pieces fall in place  
Words that went unsaid, pictures of your face  
All those things we shared, yet stay together day by day  
'Cause our love was never far away  
  
And in the morning I touch you  
And I find you're still there  
I want to tell you that I love you  
Please never leave me  
In the morning light I turn to look at you  
And hope that you still care
