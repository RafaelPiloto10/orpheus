Would you care for me if I was deaf and blind  
Would you hear my voice if I was always quiet  
Would you hold my hand if I was going to fall  
Would you cry for me would you know my name at all  
  
Would you be there if I was on the ground  
Would you be my friend if no one was around  
Would you hold me close if I was in the cold  
Would you pray for me would you know my name at all  
  
Would you care would you be there  
For the soul behind the face  
Would you love me for what I am  
  
Would you care would you be there  
For the soul behind the face  
Would you love me for what I am  
  
Would you care would you be there  
For the soul behind the face  
Would you love me for what I am  
  
Would you care would you be there  
For the soul behind the face  
Would you love me for what I am  
  
Would you love me for what I am  
Would you love me for what I am  
Would you love me for what I am
