You know what?  
Everybody goes through some changes in life  
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse  
But umm, some people need to make that change  
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?  
  
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole  
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold  
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls  
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?  
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole  
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold  
No pride, I ain't that old  
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??  
It probably don't seem like a struggle  
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle  
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you  
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you  
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you  
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you  
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you  
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?  
  
[Chorus:]  
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you  
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you  
If you got love for me, I still got love for you  
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you  
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you  
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you  
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you  
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth  
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth  
I'm speakin' the known truth  
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof  
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?  
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?  
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right  
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites  
I ain't blind from the limelite,  
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right  
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful  
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full  
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed  
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed  
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler  
One million customers, and I still bust at ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?  
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks  
Known a few ?? and met a few locs  
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes  
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine  
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then  
Some have even became rivals instead of friends  
Only two become liable for settlements  
I grew up watchin the  
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz  
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in  
They know the family bring knives and barettas in  
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd  
How could my head be in the clouds?  
It's strange, what the fame'll do  
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the same nigga man  
Same nigga, that ridin' with you  
Niggas that's fuckin' with you  
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas  
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like  
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy  
Don't let this game change you nigga...
