(Baby don't you know?)  
Tonight you'll take away my sorrow  
(Baby don't you know?)  
That it will all come back tomorrow  
When we have to part  
(Why, oh why)  
Do I go on loving you?  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
How much I want my arms about you?  
(Baby don't you know?)  
This emptiness I feel without you  
Close to my heart  
(Close to my heart)  
  
Don't ever, ever say goodbye  
(Say goodbye)  
Unless you wanna see, wanna see me cry  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
That we were meant to be together  
(Baby don't you know?)  
The thought of leaving you forever  
Tears me apart  
(Tears me apart)  
  
I'll never say goodbye to you  
(Say goodbye to you)  
Unless you really want, really want me to  
(Baby don't you know?)  
I wanna spend my life loving you  
  
(Close to my heart)  
Don't ever, ever say goodbye  
(Don't say goodbye)  
Unless you wanna see, wanna see me cry  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
That we were meant to be together  
(Baby don't you know?)  
The thought of leaving you forever  
Tears me apart  
(Tears me apart)  
  
I'll never say goodbye to you  
(Say goodbye to you)  
Unless you really want, really want me to  
(Baby don't you know?)  
I wanna spend my life loving you  
  
(Baby don't you know?)  
Wanna spend my life loving you  
(Baby don't you know?)  
(Baby don't you know?)  
I wanna spend my life  
(Baby don't you know?)  
(Baby don't you know?)
