You look like you could be the mother of a girl  
A girl I hated more than any other girl in the world  
The way I let her treat me was totally a disgrace  
I wanted to permanently wipe that smile off her face  
  
No I'm not joking  
Yes I was choking  
You look like you could be the mother of a girl  
A girl I loved more than any other girl in the world  
  
The way that I treated her was totally a crime  
I wanted to permanently wipe the joy out of my mind  
No I'm not joking  
Yes I was choking  
  
You look like you could be the mother of a boy  
Who bored me more than any other man in the land  
The way that he dogged me like I was totally a jerk  
I wanted to permanently pound his prick into the dirt  
  
No I'm not joking  
Yes I was choking
