This ain't the way  
I spend my mornings, baby  
Come stai?  
You've been with him,  
And you've come back, lady  
Hei, what's he like?  
I just sit and watch the ocean  
With myself even I do my own cookin'  
You ca laugh, you're forgiven, but  
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'  
  
Senza una donna  
No more pain and no sorrow  
Without a woman  
I'll make it through tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss  
Without a woman  
Better like this  
  
There is no way  
That you can buy me, baby  
Don't make fun  
You got a dig, a little deeper, lady  
In your heart  
Yeah, if you have one  
Here's my heart, feel the power  
Look at me, I'm a flower  
You can laugh, you're forgiven, but  
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'  
  
Senza una donna  
No more pain and no sorrow  
Without a woman  
I'll make it through tomorrow  
Senza una donna  
Givin me torture and bliss  
Without a woman  
Better like this  
  
Oooh, I stay here and watch the ocean  
Don't know why, I keep on talkin'  
You may laugh, you're forgiven, but  
I'm no longer frightened, maybe, ti be livin'  
  
Senza una donna  
Without a woman  
Senza una donna  
Without a woman  
Vieni qui! Come on in  
Senza una donna  
I don't know what might follow  
Senza una donna  
Oh, maybe from tomorrow!  
Senza una donna  
Givin' me torture and bliss
