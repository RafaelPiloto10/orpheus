There must be a million (there must be a million)  
Teardrops falling down (they're falling down)  
Yes, there must be a million (yes, there's one million)  
I'll forget somehow (I'll forget somehow)  
How long I am crying, still I'm yours to commend  
Take this love that I give you, here's my heart in my hand  
  
Alone, alone I am crying (Oh, how I cry)  
I am yours to commend (I'm yours to commend)  
Take this love that I give you (my, my love I give you)  
Here's my heart in my hand
