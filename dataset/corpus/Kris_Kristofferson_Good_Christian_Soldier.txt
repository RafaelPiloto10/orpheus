Not so long ago in Oklahoma the son of an Okie preacher knelt to pray  
He said Lord I want to be a Christian soldier just like you  
And fight to build a new and better day  
Now many years and miles from Oklahoma  
  
That same young Okie boy still kneels to pray  
But he don't pray to be no Christian soldier anymore  
He just prays to make it through another day  
'Cause it's hard to be a Christian soldier when you tote a gun  
  
And it hurts to have to watch a grown man cry  
But we're playin' cards writin' home havin' lots of fun  
Telling jokes and learning how to die  
Now the things I've come to know seem so confusin'  
  
It's gettin' hard to tell what's wrong from right  
I can't separate the winners from the losers anymore  
And I'm thinking of just giving up the fight  
'Cause it's hard to be a Christian soldier when you tote a gun  
  
And it hurts to have to watch a grown man cry  
But we're playin' cards writin' home ain't we hadn't fun  
Turning on and learning how to die
