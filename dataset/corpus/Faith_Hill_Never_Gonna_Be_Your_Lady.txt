I tried to say it politely  
I tried to give you a clue  
All your gold don't excite me  
That old trick just won't do  
  
Still you keep spending money  
But there's blood on the pearls  
Don't call me babe, don't call me honey  
And think you rule my whole world  
  
'Cause I'm never gonna be your lady  
I'm not the fool you think I am  
I'm never gonna be your lady  
And you will never be my man  
That's right  
  
Well, listen  
I bet your wife don't know nothin'  
About your sordid affairs  
You've got greed mixed up with lovin'  
And love mixed up with flair  
  
But I'm never gonna be your lady  
I'm not the fool you think I am  
I'm never gonna be your lady  
  
All your funky business  
See you in jail  
You might buy the other, but baby, I'm not for sale  
I'm not for sale...that's right  
  
'Cause I'm never gonna be your lady  
I'm not the fool you think I am  
Yeah, I'm never gonna be your lady  
And you will never be man  
  
No, I'm never gonna be your lady  
I'm not the fool you think I am  
Oh, I'm never gonna be your lady  
And you will never be my man  
Never gonna be my man  
  
Now listen to me  
That's right, I told you  
Never gonna be my man  
Let me tell ya somethin boy  
You can keep tryin all you want to try  
But it's never gonna work  
You don't have a thing that I need  
And you sure ain't got a thing I want  
  
Oh, no  
Never be your lady
