I wake up one morning and it's passed you by  
You don't know when and you don't know why  
I feel like an old memory hangin' round  
And man, we've got to face it, it's a young man's town  
I knew this day was comin' all along  
Some why bitch an' moan and say they done you wrong  
Just teach 'em what you know and pass it on down  
'Cause man, you gotta face it, it's a young man's town  
It's a young man's town  
Full of young man's dreams  
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings  
And sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch 'em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town  
You always seem to be the last to know  
Man, that's just the way that the story goes  
There's nothin' you can do when the fields have turned brown  
An' man, you gotta face it, it's a young man's town  
It's a young man's town  
Full of young man's dreams  
And all God's children gotta learn to spread their wings  
And sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch 'em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town  
Sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch 'em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it, it's a young man's town  
It's a young man's town
