I would die or kill  
Battle, beg and steal  
Baby, just to feel your eyes on me  
  
Give my secrets up  
Be slave to just your love  
One more moment of your eyes on me  
  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
But you're burning me from the inside out  
And now I live  
Oh I live to hear you say  
It's you who lives to take my breath away  
  
The thing I wouldn't do for one more taste of you  
I'm addicted to your eyes on me  
  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
But you're burning me from the inside out  
And I only live  
Oh I live to hear you say  
It's you who lives to take my breath away  
  
The thing I wouldn't do for one more taste of you  
I'm addicted to your eyes on me
