Along about eighteen twenty-five  
I left Tennessee very much alive  
And I never would have gotten through the Arkansas mud  
If I hadn't been a-ridin that Tennessee stud  
  
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa  
And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw  
I sent her a letter by my Uncle Fud  
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud  
  
Chorus:  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
We drifted on down into no man's land  
We crossed that river called the Rio Grande  
I raced my hoss with the Spaniard's foal  
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold  
  
Me and the gambler we couldn't agree  
We got in a fight over Tennessee  
We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud  
And I got away on the Tennessee stud  
  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
A-He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
Well I got just as lonesome as a man can be  
A-Dreaming of my girl in Tennessee  
The Tennessee stud's green eyes turned blue  
Cause he was a-dreamin' of his sweetheart, too  
  
We loped right back across Arkansas  
I whoop her brother and I whoop her pa  
When I found that girl with the golden hair  
And she was A-ridin' that Tennessee mare (whoa, boy)  
  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
He had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud  
  
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side  
We crossed them mountains and the valleys wide  
We came into Big Muddy then we forded a flood  
On the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee stud  
  
There's a pretty little baby on the cabin floor  
A little hoss colt playin' 'round the door  
I love the girl with golden hair  
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare (They'se good hosses)  
  
The Tennessee stud was long and lean  
The color of the sun and his eyes were green  
And he had the nerve and he had the blood  
And there never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud
