Funny how I've stopped loving you  
I can pass you on the street and my heart don't skip a beat  
Not much, so much my eyes wanna cry  
  
Funny, how I've stopped loving you  
I can listen to your name and it doesn't start a flame  
Not much, so much my heart wants to die  
  
Now that you're standing here, darling, I don't shed a tear  
This is just the rain in my eyes  
And if I have proved to you everything I say is true  
Please help me believe my own lies  
  
Funny, how I've stopped loving you  
And it's funny I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss  
Your touch, no I don't love you, not much  
  
Funny, how I've stopped loving you  
And it's funny I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss  
Your touch, no I don't love you, not much  
  
No, I don't love you, not much
