He's a blind man, crouching by the pavement  
only seeing with his third eye  
and clutching at the astral shadow  
of every passer-by  
  
He's a wise man, trumping all the answers  
she's a wild girl, trying to keep his feet on the floor  
in whispered physical litanies  
"Stay away from the door."  
  
"Oh, but we're all in this together," he says  
"three-legged race across the floor  
if only you'd loosen the handkerchief  
then I'd forget the door."  
  
"Ooh, that feels so much better," he says  
"now you forget everything that I've said before  
and sit there all by yourself  
while I walk through the door."  
  
They're a blind man, crouching by the pavement,  
only seeing with his third eye  
and clutching at the astral shadow  
of the door of a room  
called 'I'
