Here we are alone in this old smokin' room again  
If your highness is your pleasure it's alright  
Cause there's an extra added goodness  
In my heart for you tonight  
If there's any such a thing as god  
He must be here tonight  
  
Ain't sayin' I'm right  
Ain't sayin' I'm wrong  
Ain't sayin' there's any such a thing as short or long  
It seems you been here many times before  
It's too beautiful but true  
And I'm glad I got the chance tonight  
To share my now with you  
  
I used to be locked in a closet and I couldn't find the key  
Used to be you'd look my way but not see me  
But it's happiness to know that from yourself you cannot hide  
And that here's where I am and it's you that's by my side  
  
Ain't sayin' I'm right  
Ain't sayin' I'm wrong  
Ain't sayin' there's any such a thing as short or long  
It seems you been here many times before  
It's too beautiful but true  
And I'm glad I got the chance tonight  
To share my now, share my now  
Oh baby baby ? oh yeah  
  
So glad I gotcha spend some time  
Spend some time glad I gotcha baby (repeat)  
  
So glad I gotcha share my life  
Share my life glad I gotcha baby (repeat)
