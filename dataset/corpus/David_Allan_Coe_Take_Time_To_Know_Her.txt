Take time to know her  
Take time to know her  
  
I found a woman, one I knew I truly love  
She was everything, I'd ever been dreaming of  
And she was bad, I didn't know it  
Her pretty smile never did show it  
All I knew is what I could see  
And I knew I wanted her for me  
  
I took her home to mama  
Mama wanted to see my future bride  
She looked at us both  
Then she called me to her side  
  
She said, "Take time to know her  
It's not an overnight thing  
Take time to know her  
Son don't rush into this thing"  
  
But I didn't listen to my mama  
I went straight down to the church  
I just couldn't wait to have that little girl of mine  
I couldn't even wait till I got home from work  
The preacher was there, so was my future bride  
He looked at us both and then he called me to his side  
  
He said, "Son take time to know her  
It's not an overnight thing  
Take time to know her  
Please don't rush into this thing"  
  
But it looked like every thing  
It looked like everything was gonna be all right  
Then I came home from work a little early one night  
When I walked in the house, I saw her there  
She was kissin' on another man and I knew right then  
I knew right then what my mama meant  
When she took me by the hand  
  
She said, "Son take time to know her  
Boy it's not an overnight thing  
Take time to know her  
There's no reason for you to rush into this thing"  
  
Take time to know her  
It's not, love is not an easy thing  
Take time to know her  
Boy please don't rush into this thing  
Take time to know her
