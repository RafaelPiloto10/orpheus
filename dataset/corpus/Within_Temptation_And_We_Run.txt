It burns into your heart, the darkness that you fear  
You were never free, and you never realized  
And love, is a word you've never heard  
Your heart is cold cause it burns, the desire to leave the mind  
  
Take your breath til nothing's left  
Stars of life upon your chest  
And I know you wherever you go  
  
And we run and we don't look back  
And we run til we've had enough  
And we run, tell me how to run  
And we run, til we break down  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run til we've had enough  
  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head. We gotta get gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late, we gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
  
And we run, for this killing love  
And we run, tell me how it's enough  
And we run, far ahead we go  
  
I'ma break these chains, ran through the rain  
Never looked back, never quit, worked through the pain  
This blood in my veins run cold when I hate  
Give enough to keep sane but I never lose hope  
This is my time now, no time for tears to celebrate  
Put it in the air right now  
Never back down, you'll never wear my crown  
cause it weighs too much and I crush every motherfucking thing I touch  
This is what I've never loved so much  
Get involved what's the worst stand up  
Here my mic before I ever get far  
Man in lights, you lost all my trust  
Now it's time to face all of us  
Get in line just to spar with us  
And it feels so far from us, just take my hand and run  
  
And we run, for this killing love  
And we run, tell me how it's enough  
And we run, til we never don  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run, til it's enough  
  
Yeah, we out of here  
  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
We gotta get gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late, we gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
  
And we run, for this killing love  
And we run, tell me how it's enough  
And we run, til we never don  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run, til it's enough  
  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
We gotta get gone  
Yeah, we outta here  
Don't blink, you'll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late, we gone  
Yeah, we outta here
