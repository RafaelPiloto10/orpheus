Love hurts love scars love wounds and mars  
Any heart not tough nor strong enough  
To take a lot of pain take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.  
Love Hurts uh, uh Love Hurts.  
  
I'm young I know but even so  
I know a thing or two I've learned from you  
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot  
Love Hurts Uh, Uh Love hurts.  
  
Some fools rave of happiness  
Blissfullness togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves I guess,  
But they're not fooling me  
I know it isn't true, no it isn't true  
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue  
Love hurts Uh, uh love hurts.
