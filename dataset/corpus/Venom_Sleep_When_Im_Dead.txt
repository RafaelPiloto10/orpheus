There's no one to save us, it's kill or be killed  
Living in a jungle you'll hunt with all your skills  
Waiting for a victim, your hunger must be fed  
Better see it coming or you will end up dead  
Taste the anger - I'm seeing red  
Feel the danger - Sleep when I'm dead  
There's no time for mercy, there's no need for sympathy  
Line of fire and chaos in a world of constant greed  
Don't let your guard down, they'll be on you in a flash  
Keep it locked and loaded, you're heading for a crash  
There's no second chances  
You're going full speed  
Headlong into danger  
Your habit needs a feed  
Can't put the brakes on your finished when you stop  
There's no tomorrow and yesterday is lost
