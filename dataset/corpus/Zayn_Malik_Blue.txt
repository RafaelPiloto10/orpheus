[Verse 1]  
In the clouds where the angels sing  
In her eyes, where I wanna be and her smile is all I see  
She knows I need her loving  
She knows I need her touching  
She plays with my heart and emotion  
I give her my love and devotion  
She gives thoughts and a notion  
I need her body, it needs me too  
  
[Chorus]  
I need somebody to  
Love me blue  
  
[Bridge]  
I've been doing it wrong for too long  
I said I've been at it wrong for too long  
I've been doing it wrong for too long  
  
[Verse 2]  
In the clouds where the angels sing  
It's her smile, yeah it's all I see, in her eyes, where I wanna be  
She knows I need her loving  
She knows I need her touching  
She plays with my heart and emotion  
I give her my love and devotion  
She gave me her thought and a notion  
I need her body, she needs me too  
  
[Chorus]  
I need somebody to love  
Love me blue  
Love me blue  
Love me blue  
Love me blue
