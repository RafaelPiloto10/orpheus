(On my word)  
There will never be anyone but you child  
(On my word)  
No one else will ever do but you  
(On my word)  
I will never stay from your side  
And someday youre gonna be my bride  
(On my word)  
They say Im the cheatin guy  
They say looking girl youll find someone new  
So someone new keeps in my heart  
But dont believe them cause I know  
That deep inside they love you too, honey  
(Repeat the 1st verse)  
  
Umm, they say that I am no good  
They say that I never would stand by you  
So someday when youre givin me  
But dont believe them cause I know  
That deep inside they love you too, honey  
(Repeat the 1st verse again)
