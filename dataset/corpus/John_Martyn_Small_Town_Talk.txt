It's only small town talk  
You know how people are  
They can't stand to see you  
Being who you are.  
  
It's only small town talk  
Don't pay it no mind  
Don't believe a word they say  
They do it to you every time.  
  
You can't believe everything you hear  
Only half of what you might see  
But if you have to believe in anyone  
I'd believe, darling, believe in me.  
  
It's only small town talk  
A well-known fact  
You don't even know  
How one other might react  
To what you're thinking  
What are they thinking.  
  
It's only small town talk  
They're telling all the lies  
And make some people crazy  
They don't realize we're still thinking.  
  
We're only people, trying to live together  
We're trying to make this little life work  
Who are we to judge one another  
It may lead to tears or maybe something even worse.  
  
It's only small town talk  
You know how people are  
They can't stand to see you  
Being just exactly who you are.  
  
It's small town talk  
Pittle, pattle, it's small town talk  
Tittle, tattle, it's small town talk.
