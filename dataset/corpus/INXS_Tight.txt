Hold tight  
Nothing missing  
Look around  
Pupils listen  
Can you listen?  
  
Or is it that  
You've learnt too much  
What's your limit  
You know you've heard  
Teeth are clenched  
  
A pack of lies, yeah  
Chords in the neck are tense  
So hold tight  
Sometimes it seems to make no sense  
And don't you cry  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Hold tight  
Yeah, I can see ya  
You got it all under your skin  
Turn around where you stand  
Everybody takes aim at adversity  
  
You know you've heard  
Teeth are clenched  
A pack of lies, yeah  
Chords in the neck are tense  
  
So hold tight  
Sometimes it seems to make no sense  
And don't you cry  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Hold tight  
I got ya message  
I got it all  
And there's no limit  
The travel between our dreams  
Has not come to an end  
So let's keep up  
Our unholy alliance  
  
You know you've heard  
Teeth are clenched  
A pack of lies, yeah  
Chords in the neck are tense  
So hold tight  
Sometimes it seems to make no sense  
And don't you cry  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
