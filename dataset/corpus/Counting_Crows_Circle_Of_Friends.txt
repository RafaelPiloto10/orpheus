Well how the times have changed  
Looking back, it seems so clear now  
Everything you wanted in your life  
Everything is certain  
Try and understand  
Put a checklist on your wall  
I am not what you think I should be  
[Chorus:]  
But you're making amends  
To your circle of friends  
And you're trying to fit me to their mold  
Yeah you're making amends  
To your circle of friends  
And you're trying to fit me to their mold  
When you're trying to make decisions  
When you try to water this thing down  
Look up once in a while  
You'll see it's not so clear  
The things you believe in  
Are the things that's worth keeping  
Make a promise, stand right by your word  
But you're making amends  
To your circle of friends  
And you're trying to fit me to their mold  
Yeah you're making amends  
To your circle of friends  
And you're trying to fit me to their mold  
(guitar solo)  
But you're making amends  
To your circle of friends  
And you're trying to fit me to their mold  
Yeah you're making amends  
To your circle of friends  
And you're trying to fit me to their mold  
Your circle of friends  
Your circle of friends  
Your circle of friends
