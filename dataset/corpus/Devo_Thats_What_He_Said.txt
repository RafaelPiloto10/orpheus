Question for all you  
Who should know  
Much better  
But don't.  
  
With your brains and your instincts around you  
Why do you  
Still blow it?  
  
Big fish eat the little fish  
No fish left to eat  
Big man beats the little man  
'til the little man starts to beat  
And the little man starts to beat  
  
I have been hurt  
I will hurt others  
That's what he said  
  
I have been hurt  
I will hurt others  
That's what he said  
  
Question for all you  
Who don't know  
Much better  
But should  
  
Maybe the time's come  
To use what you got  
For some good  
  
I have been hurt  
I will hurt others  
That's what he said  
That's what he said  
  
I have been hurt  
Love is for others  
That's what he said  
That's what he said
