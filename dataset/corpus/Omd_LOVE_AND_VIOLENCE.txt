She walks real slow  
Talks like an animal  
What am I  
Supposed to do  
I've tried to explain  
My heart's not a radio  
But I can't seem  
To get to you  
Face to face  
Tears on a heart of stone  
When she talks  
I walk away  
It seems to me  
It's just a waste of time  
These are words  
I know she's heard before  
She's the girl  
Guess I'll always know  
And I've tried  
I've tried  
She always seems to know  
The morning after  
But not before  
I haven't slept  
Worrying  
I know I promised  
To come see you  
But now I have these  
Things to do  
All in all  
It seems to me  
You don't understand subtlety  
Shall I make it obvious  
Do you really want me to make up?  
She doesn't talk  
For days and days  
And when she does  
She always says  
That I act real slow  
Behave like an animal  
What am I supposed to do?  
And I've tried  
I've tried  
But she always seems to know  
We don't make sense  
Love and Violence  
We don't make sense  
Love and Violence
