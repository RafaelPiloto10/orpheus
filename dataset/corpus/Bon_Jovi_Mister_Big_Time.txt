I've been watching my tv  
It's got a hundred different stations  
They all look the same to me  
Now I'm ready for a new sensation  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too  
  
In the big reclining chair  
With a cold six pack of beer  
You've got a front row seat  
Lean back and put up you're feet  
Man, the future is looking bright from here  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
I can taste it, I'll be prime time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Ain't going to waste it when I'm big time  
I'll be ready for it, bing, bang, boom  
I can taste it, I'll be prime time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too
