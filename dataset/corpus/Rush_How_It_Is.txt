Here's a little trap  
That sometimes catches everyone  
When today's as far as we can see  
Faith in bright tomorrows  
Giving way to resignation  
That's how it is - how it's going to be  
  
It's such a cloudy day  
Seems we'll never see the sun  
Or feel the day has possibilities  
Frozen in the moment -  
The lack of imagination  
Between how it is and how it ought to be  
  
Here's a little trap  
That sometimes trips up everyone  
When we tire of our own company  
Sometimes we're the last to see beyond the day's frustrations  
That's how it is - how it's going to be  
  
It's such a cloudy day  
Seems we'll never see the sun  
I feel the day is all uncertainty  
Burning in the moment - trapped by the desperation  
Between how it is and how it ought to be  
  
Foot upon the stair  
Shoulder to the wheel  
You can't tell yourself not to care  
You can't tell yourself how to feel  
  
That's how it is  
Another cloudy day
