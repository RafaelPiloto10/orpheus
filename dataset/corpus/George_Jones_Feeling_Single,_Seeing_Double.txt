Well, I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin' single but seein' double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night  
  
I came home from work this mornin'  
My little womans was a-feelin' low  
She told me what was on her mind  
And she told me where I could go  
  
Well, I didn't go where she told to to  
'Cause the water was cold in the lake  
There's something fishy 'bout this whole deal  
I'm gonna see where I made a mistake  
  
Well, I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin' single but seein' double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night  
  
Well, when I opened the door this mornin'  
Like me the sun was high  
I started walkin' the long way home  
Just to think of an alibi  
  
Well, I couldn't think of a doggon thing  
That I hadn't already said  
Guess I better play it by ear  
For I'm already dead  
  
Well, I really had a fall last night  
I held all the pretty girl tight  
I was feelin' single but seein' double  
And wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
The day I face a big fight  
But I really had a fall last night
