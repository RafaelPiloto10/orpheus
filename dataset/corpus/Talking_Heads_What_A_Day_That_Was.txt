Well, I'm dressed up so nice  
An' I'm doin' my best  
An' I'm startin' over...  
I'm startin' over in another place  
  
Lemme tell you a story  
Big chief with a golden crown  
He's got rings on his fingers  
And then he walks up, up to the throne  
  
He's makin' shapes with his hands  
An' don't choo dare sit back  
Now don't choo dare sit down  
And don't choo dare speak up!  
  
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand  
Ooh who could've asked for more?  
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do  
Ooh what a day that was.  
  
There are fifty thousand beggars  
Roaming in the streets  
They have lost all their possessions  
They have nothing left to eat  
  
Down come a bolt of lightning  
Start an electrical storm  
Starts a chain reaction  
Go pull a fire alarm  
  
I'm dreaming of a city  
It was my own invention  
I put the wheels in motion  
A time for big decisions  
  
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand  
Ooh and then we let it fall  
And on the second day, there was nothing else at all  
Ooh what a day that was.  
  
Oh a day that was  
Ooh that's the way it goes  
There's a million ways- to get things done  
There's a million ways- to make things work out.  
  
Well I'm going right through  
And the light came down  
Well they're roundin' 'em up  
From all over town  
  
They're movin' forward and backwards  
They're movin' backwards and front  
And they're enjoying themselves  
Moving in ev'ry direction  
  
And if you feel like you're in a whirlpool  
You feel like going home  
You feel like talking to someone  
Who know the difference between right and wrong  
  
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand  
Ooh and then we let it fall  
And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all  
Ooh what a day that was.  
(We're go(in') boom boom boom That's the way we live  
And in a great big room and That's the way we live.) x3
