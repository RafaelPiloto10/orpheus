It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's raining outside  
You've nowhere to hide  
  
She's asking you why you think it's funny  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
She's leaving your house  
  
She had to get out  
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
You lie on the floor  
  
She's slamming your door  
She's gone and she's wearing your red sweater  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
  
Aw no  
It's coming down  
It's coming down  
It's coming down
