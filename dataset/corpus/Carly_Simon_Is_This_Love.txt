(Bob Marley)  
I want to love you  
And treat you right  
I want to love you  
Every day and every night  
We'll be together with a roof  
Right over our head  
We'll share the shelter of my single bed  
We'll share the same room,  
God will provide the bread  
  
Chorus:  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling  
I'm willing and able  
So I throw my cards on the table  
  
I want to love you  
And treat you right  
I want to love you  
Everyday and every night  
We'll be together with a roof  
Right over our heads  
We'll share the shelter of my single bed  
We'll share the same room  
God will provide the bread  
  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling  
Is this love, is this love, is this love, is this love  
That I'm feeling I want to know, want to know, want to know now  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to love you  
I want to treat you right  
I want to love you  
Everyday and every night  
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads  
We'll share the shelter, yeah, of my single bed  
We'll share the same room  
God will provide the bread
