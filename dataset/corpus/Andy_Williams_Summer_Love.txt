Summer Love  
Who will be your summer love  
Like I was last summer  
Sharing every moment of  
Things we did last summer  
Who will be satisfied  
Just to be by your side  
Who will kiss you, hold you tight  
Two silver silhouettes  
In the summer moonlight  
Will you walk along the beach  
Like we did last summer  
Counting stars way out of reach  
Like we did last summer  
Will you tell your heart, beware  
This is just a summer affair  
Or will you fall in love for keeps  
Like I did last summer
