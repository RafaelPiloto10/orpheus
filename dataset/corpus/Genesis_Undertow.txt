The curtains are drawn  
Now the fire warms the room.  
Meanwhile outside  
Wind from the north-east chills the air,  
It will soon be snowing out there.  
  
And some there are  
Cold, they prepare for a sleepless night.  
Maybe this will be their last fight.  
  
But we're safe in each other's embrace,  
All fears go out as I look on your face  
  
Better think awhile  
Or I may never think again.  
If this were the last day of your life, my friend,  
Tell me, what do you think you would do then?  
  
Stand up to the blow that fate has struck upon you,  
Make the most of all you still have coming to you, [or]  
Lay down on the ground and let the tears run from you,  
Crying to the grass and trees and heaven finally on your knees  
  
Let me live again, let life come find me wanting.  
Spring must strike again against the shield of winter.  
Let me feel once more the arms of love surround me,  
Telling me the danger's past, I need not fear the icy blast again.  
  
Laughter, music and perfume linger here  
And there, and there,  
Wine flows from flask to glass and mouth,  
As it soothes, confusing our doubts.  
  
And soon we feel,  
Why do a single thing to-day,  
There's tomorrow sure as I'm here.  
  
So the days they turn into years  
And still no tomorrow appears.  
  
Better think awhile  
Or I may never think again.  
If this were the last day of your life, my friend,  
Tell me, what do you think you would do then?  
  
Stand up to the blow that fate has struck upon you,  
Make the most of all you still have coming to you, [or]  
Lay down on the ground and let the tears run from you,  
Crying to the grass and trees and heaven finally on your knees  
  
Let me live again, let life come find me wanting.  
Spring must strike again against the shield of winter.  
Let me feel once more the arms of love surround me,  
Telling me the danger's past, I need not fear the icy blast again.
