You know you're making me nervous  
I don't know if the world deserves us  
You're doing things I wouldn't mention  
You have a hunger for attention  
You know you're making me frantic  
Is this supposed to be romantic?  
You're like the woman out of Species  
I think I'm gonna go to pieces  
  
You never do right  
For doing wrong  
You'd better get back where you belong  
You never do right  
You're doing wrong  
Then running to me  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Saty for life or leave me sadly  
Do you have to?  
  
you're really making me anxious  
You know that everybody blanks us  
You're like a cocktail set Atilla  
A kind of holycon geurilla  
You know I'm heading for a crackup  
You're getting everybody's back up  
I'm getting ready for a freak out  
What makes you think you're right to speak out?  
  
You never back down you'd rather fight  
You're ready for combat day or night  
You never back down  
You start the fight  
The run behind me  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Stay for life or leave me sadly  
Please don't always love me madly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Be my friend reject me gladly  
Do you have to?  
  
I feel I'm getting rather tense  
At the turn of these events  
I want to run away and hide  
But you keep dragging me inside  
I'm tethered to a trainee hellcat  
I'm feeling jealous of the doormat  
I'm nearly fainting with the tension  
One day we'll end up in detention  
  
You never do right  
You're doing wrong  
You'd better get back where you belong  
You never do right  
You're always wrong  
Then running to me  
  
Love me well or love be badly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Stay for life or leave me sadly  
Please don't always love me madly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Be my friend reject me gladly  
Only don't you love me madly  
  
Love, me madly
