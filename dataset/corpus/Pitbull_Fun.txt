[Intro]  
Chris, you set it off  
  
[Chris Brown]  
Oh, feeling crazy  
The moon is up, the night is hazy  
Let's get lost in the shadows  
Somewhere we can go  
And no one else can find  
  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
  
Oh my mind, looking like good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you wanna love tonight  
Oh my mind, hook you with a brand new high  
Don't be shy, I just wanna in tonight  
F.U.N, fun  
  
[Pitbull]  
Baby you know I'm a hard worker  
But I'm far from the boss  
Got them big numbers  
Performing for Microsoft  
Got a girl, she lost her top,  
3,2,1 baby we taking off,  
Wanna have fun tonight,  
We never stop,  
Chris Brown,  
You got it,  
Show 'em what you got  
  
[Hook]  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
  
Oh my mind, looking like good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you wanna love tonight  
Oh my mind, hook you with a brand new high  
Don't be shy, I just wanna in tonight  
F.U.N, fun  
  
[Pitbull]  
Come on babe,  
I know you want this,  
If I was Santa Claus,  
You'd be on the naughty list,  
'Cause you so sexy,  
Wanna get it on,  
3,2,1, we taking off,  
Wanna have fun tonight?  
Chris Brown,  
Show 'me what you got  
  
[Hook]  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
  
Oh my mind, looking like good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you wanna love tonight  
Oh my mind, hook you with a brand new high  
Don't be shy, I just wanna in tonight  
F.U.N, fun

[Hook]  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
Lose 'em everybody baby come undone  
  
Oh my mind, looking like good time  
Don't disguise  
The way you wanna love tonight  
Oh my mind, hook you with a brand new high  
Don't be shy, I just wanna in tonight  
F.U.N, fun
