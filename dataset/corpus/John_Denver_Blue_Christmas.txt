I'll have a blue Christmas without you,  
I'll be so blue thinking about you.  
Decorations of red  
On a green Christmas tree  
Just won't mean a thing if  
You're not here with me  
  
And when those blue heartaches start hurting,  
I'll have some blue memories for certain,  
You'll be doing all right  
With your Christmas of white,  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Yes I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.
