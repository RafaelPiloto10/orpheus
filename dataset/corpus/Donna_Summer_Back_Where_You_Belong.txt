Ooh I've been down there a million times  
If I've been down before  
Never thought I'd hurt so bad  
To see you play the fool  
Never mountain high enough  
I said and I watched you climb  
Till the day I saw you walk out of your life and mine  
  
So I'm gonna leave you just because I want you  
Back where you belong  
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me  
Back where you belong  
Be home right by my side is where you want to be  
Back where you belong  
  
Standing in the shadows  
Watch your never-ending flight  
Just how high as high to be before you see the light  
Will this be the change you need to show you who you are  
I love you but I'll leave you just to prove you've gone too far  
  
Soon I'm gonna leave you just because I want you  
Back where you belong  
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me  
Back where you belong  
Be home right by my side is where you want to be  
Back where you belong  
  
Can't you see you're losing me using me  
Back where you belong  
Heaven knows I love you will this make you see  
Back where you belong  
  
So I'm gonna leave you just because I want you  
Back where you belong  
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me  
Back where you belong  
Be home right by my side is where you want to be  
Back where you belong  
  
Don't you understand my feelings and  
Set me free  
Don't you realize it...
