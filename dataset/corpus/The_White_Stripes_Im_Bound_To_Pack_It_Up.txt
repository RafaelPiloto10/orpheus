I've thought about it for a while  
And I've thought about the many miles  
But I think it's time that I've gone away  
The feelings that you have for me  
Have gone away it's plain to see  
And it looks to me that your pulling away  
  
I'm gonna pick it up  
I'm gonna pick it up today  
I'm bound pack it up  
I'm bound pack it up and go away  
  
I've found it hard to say to you  
That this is what I have to do  
But there is no way that I'm gonna stay  
There are so many things you need to know  
And I want to tell you before I go  
But it's hard to think of just what to say  
  
I'm gonna pick it up  
I'm gonna pick it up today  
I'm bound pack it up  
I'm bound pack it up and go away  
  
I'm sorry to leave you all alone  
You're sitting silent by the phone  
But we'd always known there would come a day  
The bus is warm and softly lit  
And a hundred people ride in it  
I guess I'm just another runaway  
  
I'm gonna pick it up  
I'm gonna pick it up today  
I'm bound pack it up  
I'm bound pack it up and go away
