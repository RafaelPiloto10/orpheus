Help me out, I need it  
I don't feel like loving you no more  
I don't feel like loving you no more  
  
Help me out, I need it  
I don't feel like touching her no more  
Help me out, I need it  
I said I don't feel like touching her no more  
Well how did it happen  
I spent two long years in a strange strange land  
Well how did it happen  
I'd do anything just to be your man  
  
You're not going anywhere without me  
These trials don't prepare the air of love  
You're not telling anyone about me  
And you shake and you bleed while I sing my song  
  
I don't feel like, I don't feel like  
I don't feel like loving you  
I don't feel like, I don't feel like  
I don't feel like loving you  
  
All the different places  
Ringing out like a shotgun in my head  
All the pretty faces  
Ringing out well I just can't go to bed  
Well how did it happen  
  
I spent two long years in a strange strange land  
Well how did it happen  
I'd do anything just to be your man  
I'd do anything just to be your man  
  
You're not going anywhere without me  
These trials don't prepare the air of love  
You're not telling anyone about me  
And you shake and you bleed while I sing my song  
  
I don't feel like touching you  
I don't feel like touching you  
I don't feel like touching you  
I don't feel like touching you  
You can't tell anyone about me  
  
You're not going anywhere without me  
Help me out I need it  
You can't tell anyone about me  
Help me out I need it  
  
I don't feel like, I don't feel like  
I don't feel like loving you  
I don't feel like, I don't feel like  
I don't feel like loving you
