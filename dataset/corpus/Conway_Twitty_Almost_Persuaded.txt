Last night all alone in a barroom  
Met the girl with a drink in her hand  
She had ruby red lips and coal black hair  
And eyes that would tempt any man.  
  
Then she came and sat down at my table  
And as she placed her soft hands in mine  
I found myself wanting to kiss her  
For temptation was flowing like wine.  
  
And I was almost persuaded  
To strip myself of my pride  
Almost persuaded  
To put my conscience aside.  
  
Then we danced and she whispered I need you  
Take me away from here and be my man  
Then I looked in her eyes and I saw it  
The reflection of my wedding band.  
  
And I was almost persuaded  
To let soft lips lead me on  
Almost persuaded  
But your sweet love made me stop and go home...
