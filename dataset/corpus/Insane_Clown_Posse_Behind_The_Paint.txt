(Today we'll be talking about the reporting artists The Insane Clown Posse)  
(They look too spooky) Dickface (It kinda reminds me of gang related)  
(Before the anti-Christ who is coming)  
  
Remember me bitch 8th grade  
Ball park skinny ass well-fare aid  
Ulster and Bruce brothers we was the shit  
Dungeons Dragons, and Bruce Lee flicks  
Quit school nobody missed us,  
Nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us  
Now look at these beautiful model type high class women  
Takin' my dick in em  
You don't remember my kind in class  
The whipped out freak starin' at your ass  
Never had the courage to even say hi  
Only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by  
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind  
Now your flashing your titties at me waitin' in line  
And that's fine while you're working your charm  
Look beneath the paint bitch its the scrubs who won  
  
You used to say "Ahhh Hah!"  
Look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again  
An outcast I knew I had to do something  
Figure out a way to make something out of nothin'  
Open up shop got what you need  
Speakers clothes CD's or bags of weed  
But that shit got me nowhere except jail  
Me and all my homies to broke to make the bail  
So now we're right back at the place we started  
Chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs  
Assed out but we was like "fuck y'all"  
We got each other and the drop of the homie call  
Look at us now bitch holdin' platinum  
All up on my dick but I'm the same as back then  
Forget the money and fame because  
Beneath the paint life's just as it always was  
  
Look at me!  
Analyze! What you see?  
Look at me!  
Analyze! What you see?  
  
Another girl I don't dare to confide in  
Playing that role it hurts inside  
Here I am thinking she wants me  
She only wants that killer on her CD  
Just when I couldn't feel any worse  
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first  
The day I finally get to leave this land  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man
