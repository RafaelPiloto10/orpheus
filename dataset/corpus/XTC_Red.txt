You better watch your tape boys  
It's the tint that angers the beast  
Got their sails in the sunset  
They've already got the east  
  
Red red red  
Don't you let them make you  
Don't let them make you see...red  
  
You better watch your lead boys  
It's already in your veins  
Did you ever see the colour  
Iron turns when it rains  
  
It's not a gross infatuation  
It's not a fear, it's not a crush  
It's not any special nation  
But even now they make me blush
