I woke up this mornin',  
Peaked out my door:  
It was rainin', cold an' grey.  
It's my one day off: I was gonna play golf.  
There goes the plans that I made.  
Oh, but you won't hear me complain.  
  
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine,  
An' the sky's always blue.  
Couldn't ask for better weather,  
To do what I do:  
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
  
So let's go grab a blanket,  
An' a hot cup of coffee,  
And sit out on the front porch and swing.  
That look in your eyes is what's on my mind:  
We don't have to say anything.  
Let's just listen to that old tin roof sing.  
  
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine,  
An' the sky's always blue.  
Couldn't ask for better weather,  
To do what I do:  
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
For lovin' you.
