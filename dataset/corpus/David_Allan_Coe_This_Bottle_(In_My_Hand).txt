Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
I know Friday night he'll do it all again  
Oh, he'll drink till he falls down then he'll order "One more round"  
And then go home with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to is the bottle in my hand  
I know I'll never have to share it with any other man  
I'm so glad you introduced us and I'll do the best I can  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told George that changing diapers could sure become a drag  
And to clean the house and cook for him was not her kind of bag  
She said he needed someone who would love and understand  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can count on now is this bottle in my handv  
I know I'll never have to share it, oh with any other man  
And I'm so glad you introduced us, oh I'll do the best I can  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
Yes we'll be faithfull to this bottle in our hand
