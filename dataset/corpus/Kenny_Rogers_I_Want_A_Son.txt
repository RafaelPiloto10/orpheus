I want a son.  
  
I want a son  
Someone I can blame for turning grey  
To share my name, to share my days  
To share the things I've earned  
The lessons that I've learned along the way  
He'd have a friend and we'd have fun  
I love to laugh and I would love to have a son.  
  
I want a girl  
Twirling round the room in pink and blue  
To count on me, to see her through  
Who'd worry when I'm late  
And tell me that I'm great when it's not true  
She'd have a friend and we'd have fun  
I'd love a daughter just as I would love a son.  
  
I wanna care  
I wanna wonder where they are  
I wanna see that they go farther than me  
And carry on, the things I love, when I'm gone.  
  
Forgetting me  
I'd be good for them, I really would  
They'd have someone who understood  
Who'd always be around  
And never let them down, I never could.  
  
He'd have a friend and we'd have fun  
She'd have a friend, we'd all be one  
I'd love to have a girl  
Or I would love to have a son.
