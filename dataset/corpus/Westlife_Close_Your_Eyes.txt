If you want to know  
  
Tomorrow morning I have to leave  
But wherever I may be  
Best believe I'm thinking of you  
I can't believe how much I love you  
All we have is here tonight  
We don't want to waste this time  
Give me something to remember  
Baby put your lips on mine  
  
And I'll love you forever  
Any time that we find ourselves apart,  
  
Just close your eyes  
And you'll be here with me  
Just look to your heart  
And that's where I'll be  
If you just close your eyes  
Till you're drifting away  
You'll never be too far from me  
If you close your eyes  
  
I know I'm gonna see you again  
But promise me that you won't forget  
Cause as long as you remember  
A part of us will be together  
So even when you're fast asleep  
Look for me inside your dreams  
Keep believing in what we're sharing  
And even when I'm not there to tell you  
  
I'll, I'll love, love you forever  
Any time that I can't be where you are,  
  
You just close your eyes  
And you'll be here with me  
Just look to your heart  
And that's where I'll be  
Just close your eyes  
Till you're drifting away  
You'll never be too far from me  
If you close your eyes  
  
Is there anywhere that far?  
Any time you're feeling low  
Is there anywhere that love cannot reach?  
Oh no  
It could be anywhere on earth  
It could be anywhere I'll be  
Oh baby if you want to see  
  
Just close your eyes and you'll be here with me  
Look to your heart and that's where you'll be  
Just close your eyes till you're drifting away  
You'll never be too far from me
