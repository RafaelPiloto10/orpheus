You hide, won't fight  
Avoid the daylight  
Give in, won't win  
No try to make it right  
  
Why don't you stop crying  
Stop your painful dying  
Why don't you give your life a sense  
  
One game, one aim  
But you're always sleeping  
One light so bright  
In darkness you're creeping  
  
Why don't you use your head  
Step out of your warm bed  
And stop being on anxious rat  
  
Run, for your destination  
Fly, to the sun  
Don't give a damn what the people may say  
It's like a chain on your leg  
When you always look back  
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't run for cover  
Don't cry alone  
Make a step on your stairway  
One step closer to what you live for  
Don't run for cover  
Don't throw away  
The only chance that you got  
To be the fire in a hot life you choose  
  
No pride, no right?  
In your heart is more strength  
You know, I know  
Your destiny's in your hand  
  
Now you have this time  
To survive don't be blind  
In this world where so many can't see  
  
Bridge:  
Try, to catch the key  
Make, that you can see  
The light of your life your way to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run, for your destination  
Fly, to the sun  
Don't give a damn what the people may say  
It's like a chain on your leg  
When you always look back  
If you don't risk anything one day you'll pay  
  
[Chorus]
