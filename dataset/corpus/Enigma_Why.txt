I was childish and unfair  
To you, my only friend  
I regret, but now it's too late  
I can't show you any more  
The things I've learned from you  
'Cause life just took you away  
I'm asking why  
I'm asking why  
Nobody gives an answer  
I'm just asking why  
But someday we'll meet again  
And I'll ask you  
I'll ask you why  
Why it has to be like this  
I'm asking you why  
Please give me an answer  
Many years and stupid fights  
Till we accept to see  
How it was and it'll always be  
Why it has to be like this  
Why we don't realize  
Why we're too blind to see the one  
Who's always on our side  
I'm asking why  
I'm asking why  
Nobody gives an answer  
I'm just asking why  
Just tell me why Why it has to be like this  
That the good ones disappear  
I'm asking you why  
I'm asking why  
I'm asking why  
Nobody gives an answer  
I'm just asking why  
I'm asking why
