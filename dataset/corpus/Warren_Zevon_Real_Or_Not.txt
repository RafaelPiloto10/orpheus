They say the devil's in the details  
I know what they mean  
I'm walking in the wasteland  
With the Ghost in the Machine  
There's a simulated sunset  
Starlight in my eyes  
The skies are filled with miracles  
And half of them are lies  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way  
When you wake up from a nightmare  
And it's worse when you're awake  
And there's no one you can turn to  
And there's nothing you can take  
Are you real or not?  
It's a fine line  
Are you ready or not  
For the light of day ?  
Are you real or not?  
These are strange times  
And I don't want to live this way
