Man, I'm talking about that six four rag top  
Green, with the back racked  
Everything mat black, caught it in a six pack  
You know what the fuck it is and what I came to do  
Now put your hands up in the air, like I'm about to shoot  
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear  
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothing to fear  
We have nothing to lose, pressure applying the rules  
Wasp on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes  
That's what my coast love, good money, great drugs  
Every bad bitch you can think of  
Swagged out, locked out, flamed on, purve out  
Shit face from shots, your words come swirled up  
Better put the word out, mind I find the mediocre  
I'm a bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers  
You can fuck around, who else get the fly  
You know I asked your little mind is your prime world dying over  
  
[Chorus]  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
Not a verdict to see, just the moment of truth  
Fighting the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot  
I be my own attorney, watching you try to burn me down  
Testimony testifier from the underground  
Order in the court, that's what you came to see  
The state of hip hop versus mister X to the Z  
  
I create in a dark, darkest place in my heart  
I finish off with your started terror, I tear you apart  
I am not for the cage, I'm the climb to the change  
Dread the eye and the needle, that means accurate aim  
That means I can arrange haters and hideous things  
I'm the sickness you feel, sickness from popping a vein  
Paranormal presence to people who can never explain  
Why deal with the devil when dealing with you is the same  
I got a proposition for all you bitches listening  
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion  
Give you what you've been missing  
A man in my condition shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision  
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system  
I got a fetish for fucking over my opposition  
It's time to set the standing, the mother ship is landing  
We didn't come here in peace, we're here to take the player  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I came up with the wolf, they came out with them tools  
Elevate you out the earth gravitational pool  
This is not for the week, this time works for the streets  
Mister X to the Z, motherfuck, what you think?  
Motherfuck, what you blog, this for my loss and my dogs  
Standing tall, still calling shots from behind the wall  
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my crew  
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do  
Make movements my elemental, I did make some improvements  
You can check my potential, tool to never pursue it  
If I listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit  
Dreams splattered and broken never breaking my spirit  
Listen close, you can hear it, the footsteps of the future  
Ain't no time like the present, live the past and excuses  
Fucked on anything, fuck it, I keep it exclusive  
You just saw as if acoustic, this that real nigga music
