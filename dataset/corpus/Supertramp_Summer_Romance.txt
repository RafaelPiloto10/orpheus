In the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her and he asked her to dance  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
  
My heart was beating with a rage like thunder  
And when I saw him, I began to wonder  
I could see the old love light in his eyes  
See the love light in his eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
How's your new love, babe?  
  
Well, in the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her, he said, 'Please, give me another chance'  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
Yes, it did, it did, it did  
  
It took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?  
Took a while to say, how's your new love, babe?
