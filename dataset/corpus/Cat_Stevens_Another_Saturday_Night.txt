[Chorus: ]  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
I got in town a month ago  
I've seen a lot of girls since then  
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em  
But as yet I haven't met 'em  
That's how I'm in the state I'm in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Another fella told me  
He had a sister who looked just fine  
Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat named Frankenstein  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's hard on a fella  
When he don't know his way around  
If I don't find me a honey  
To help me spend my money  
I'm gonna have to blow this town  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful ooo  
I'm in an awful way  
He's in an awful way  
  
I'm in an awful ooo  
I'm in an awful way  
He's in an awful way  
I'm in an awful way
