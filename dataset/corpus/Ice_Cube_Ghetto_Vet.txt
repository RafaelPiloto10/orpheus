Life  
Niggas used to come and get me  
When it was time to disagree with an enemy  
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy  
Packed the gat in the small of my back  
Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack  
Talkin' shit 'cause I'm down for my set I'm a vet  
Smokin' on a wet cigarette  
(who these niggas think they are)  
(wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar)  
I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs  
'cause these westside niggas is harder thugs  
Enslave us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis  
Shootin' at your neighbors  
(cause sometimes I feel like a nut don't give a fuck when I open ya up)  
Hot rocks fly from the back seat and  
Busta ass niggas run like a track meet  
An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' dinner little (what)  
Killer king is the hospital  
Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum  
And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit  
  
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that  
I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)  
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there  
  
(For life) I'm still there  
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass  
Up early in the morning takin' out the trash  
Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser  
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser  
One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)  
Tryin' be ghetto stars they said:  
Are you from the west side is it so?  
I said hell yea and who want to to know (me)  
In slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud  
Puddle full of blood left for dead  
The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs  
I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center  
As I enter I see you  
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital  
I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to  
Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again  
I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide  
At night I jerk and jerk  
But my dick don't work it don't even hurt (damn)  
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube  
I be pissin' through a tube fool I'm a vet  
  
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that  
I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)  
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there  
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair  
  
Fuck a V-A they need G-A  
Gang hospital for a crippal now I'm drinkin' rippal  
Same corner same hood I'm still there  
With bandannas tied to my wheel chair  
To all the hood rat hoes I'm fine  
They mad 'cause my tongue get tired  
Now everybody want to put they dope on me  
Sayin' I won't get searched by the LAPD  
I'm sitting on a doorway duece five  
Dependin' on neck to keep my ass alive  
I don't got folks but my arms about a one six  
My fuckin' legs lookin' like tooth picks  
Some times I can't deal got to beg the be G's to roll me up the hill  
Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine  
Just to maintain nothin' to gain nutin' to lose  
And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom  
Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold  
Nigga its the only friend to a stranger AKA handicap gang banger  
There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet  
Fool I'm a Vet  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Fool I'm a vet you can bet that  
I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)  
Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there  
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair  
  
Life  
Yea  
Life  
Yea  
Life  
Life  
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets  
For every nigga that done took one for the hood
