I'm leaving it all up, up to you  
You decide what you're gonna do  
Now do you want my love  
Or are we through?  
That's why I'm leaving it up to you  
You decide what you're gonna do  
Now do you want my love  
Or are we through?  
Here's my heart in my hand  
And I, I don't understand  
What did I, what have I done wrong?  
You know I worship the ground you walk on  
That's why I'm leaving it up to you  
You decide what you're gonna do  
Now do you want my love  
Or are we through?
