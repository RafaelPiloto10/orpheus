You stood in the belltower,  
But now you're gone.  
So who knows all the sights  
Of Notre Dame?  
  
They've got the stars for the gallant hearts.  
I'm the replacement for your part.  
But all I want to do is forget  
You, friend.  
  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave me alone.  
The first time in my life,  
I leave the lights on  
To ease my soul.  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave it alone.  
I don't know,  
Is this the right thing to do?  
  
Rehearsing in your things,  
I feel guilty.  
And retracing all the scenes,  
Of your big hit,  
Oh, God, you needed the leading role.  
It wasn't me who made you go, though.  
Now all I want to do is forget  
You, friend.  
  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave me alone.  
The first time in my life,  
I leave the lights on  
To ease my soul.  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave it alone.  
I don't know,  
Is this the right thing to do?  
  
Who calls me from the other side  
Of the street?  
And who taps me on the shoulder?  
I turn around, but you're gone.
