I'm thinking of you while here all alone  
I'm wishing and longing for you and for home  
I'd give this whole world if I could only say  
I'm climbin' that old hill headin' that way  
For I'm lonesome and blue for some place to roam  
And I wish it could be down that old road to home  
With a troubled mind and a heart full of pain  
I've searched this whole world for fortune and fame  
But I'm longing to be with you once again  
So we could go strolling down old mem'ry lane  
  
There's a little white house on the top of the hill  
Not very far from an old sawmill  
And I'd give this world if I could only say  
I'm climbin' that old hill heading that way  
For I'm lonesome and blue for some place to roam  
And I wish it could be down that old road to home
