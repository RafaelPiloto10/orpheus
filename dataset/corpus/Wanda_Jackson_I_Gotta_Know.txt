Well I thought that you were a wantin' romance  
But all you ever do is dance dance dance  
So I boppity bop the whole night long to the knocked out music of a jukebox
song  
One thing I gotta know I gotta know I gotta know  
If our love's the real thing where's my weddin' ring  
Yes we rocked and rolled till the broad daylight  
You're a little too pooped to kiss your baby goodnight  
I know you've had it when the rockin' is through  
So I let you go home what else could I do  
One thing I gotta know  
  
Well I thought that you were a wantin' romance  
When you're on that floor you're cool man cool  
But when it comes to lovin' you need to go to school  
You know I'm longin' for a weddin' day but all you ever do is play boy play  
One thing I gotta know
