You go to my head  
And you linger  
Like a haunting refrain  
And I find you  
Spinning 'round  
In my brain  
Like the bubbles  
In a glass of champagne  
  
You go to my head  
Like a sip  
Of sparkling Burgundy brew  
And I find  
The very mention of you  
Like the kicker  
In a julep or two  
  
The thrill of the thought  
That you might  
Give a thought to my plea  
Casts a spell over me  
Still I say to myself  
"Get a hold of yourself"  
"Can't you see  
That it never can be?"  
  
You go to my head  
With a smile  
That makes  
My temperature rise  
Like a summer  
With a thousand July's  
You intoxicate my soul  
With your eyes  
  
Though I'm certain  
That this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost  
If a chance  
In this crazy romance  
You go to my head  
You go to my head
