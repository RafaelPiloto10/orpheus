Little Jesse Younger was a well respected lad  
Doing all he could to please his mommy and his dad  
But he never planned to be the man  
They said that he'd become  
And somehow or another Jesse's little baby brother  
Is his father's and his mother's only son  
Every day the neighbors say that it's a dirty shame  
The way he spat upon his family and scandalized their name  
And his parents never really ever said he'd been disowned  
But somehow or another now his little baby brother  
Is his father's and his mother's only son  
Oh, Jesse Younger you're a devil not a man  
Can you dare to treat your parents so unkind?  
You have selfishly refused to live your life the way they planned  
And you've started going your own way and speaking your own mind.  
Jesse Younger's parents wonder where it all went wrong  
Now that Jesse's name has turned to ashes on their tongues  
But he chose to starve asnd try to carve a future of his own  
And he got his druthers because now his younger brother  
Is his father's and his mother's only son.  
Oh, Jesse Younger, you're a devil not a man  
Can you dare to treat your parents so unkind?  
You have selfishly refuysed to live your life the way they planned  
And you've started going your own way and speaking your own mind.
