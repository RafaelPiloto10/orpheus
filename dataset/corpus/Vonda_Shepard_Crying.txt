I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while  
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight  
As you stopped to say "Hello"  
Aww you wished me well, you couldn't tell  
That I'd been cry-i-i-i-ng over you, cry-i-i-i-ng over you  
Then you said "so long". left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying, crying, crying cry-i-ing  
It's hard to understand but the touch of your hand  
Can start me crying  
I thought that I was over you but it's tru-ue, so true  
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do-o-o-o  
For you don't love me and I'll always be  
Cry-i-i-i-ng over you, cry-i-i-i-ng over you  
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on  
I'll be crying, crying, crying, cry-i-i-ing  
Yeah crying, crying, o-o-o-o-ver you
