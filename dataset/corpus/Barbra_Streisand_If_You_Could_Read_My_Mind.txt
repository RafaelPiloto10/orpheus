If you could read my mind, love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well  
  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
You know that ghost is me  
And I will never be set free  
As long as I am  
A ghost that you can see  
  
If I could read your mind, love  
What a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paperback novel  
That kind the drugstores sell  
  
When you reach the part  
Where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me  
The heroes often fail  
And you won't red that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take  
I'd walk away like a movie star  
Who gets spurned in a three-way script  
Ends up number two  
The movie queen to play the scene  
And bringing all the good things out in me  
But now for love, lets be real  
I never thought I could feel this way  
And I got to say  
That I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back  
  
If you could read my mind, love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well  
  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
Stories always end  
And if you read between the lines  
You know that I'm just trying to understand  
The feelings that you lack  
I've never thought I could feel this way  
And I've got to say  
That I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back
