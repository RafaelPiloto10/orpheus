Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
O'er the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bob-tails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to laugh and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago  
I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright  
Was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank  
Misfortune seemed his lot  
We got into a drifted bank  
And we all got upset  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A day or two ago  
The story I must tell  
I went out on the snow  
And on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by  
In a one-horse open sleigh  
He laughed as there I sprawling lie  
But quickly drove away  
  
Now the ground is white  
Go it while you're young  
Take the girls tonight  
And sing this sleighing song  
Just get a bob-tailed bay  
Two-forty as his speed  
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack!  
You'll take the lead
