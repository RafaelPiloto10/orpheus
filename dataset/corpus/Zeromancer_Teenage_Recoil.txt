Guys are drooling over you  
Sampling your soul  
You could be the chosen one, but what if  
Everything they say is wrong  
And you die some  
  
Everlasting teenage recoil  
Fall in love with anything, come undone  
With hearts unbroken  
And wish upon a lucky star  
  
Sometimes you feel so skinny  
It's like you don't even exist  
Lolita never been kissed  
You gotta feel what can be felt  
  
Touch what can be touched  
Do what can be done  
But don't die young  
Against all odds again  
You got zip to lose
