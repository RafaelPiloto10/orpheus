She sings to me now and then  
Gentle refrains of summer mornings  
The first rays of sunlight  
And dew-dropped roses  
  
Winds rolling through falling leaves  
Whistling in the sycamores  
These are her songs of love  
  
She needs to be reassured  
of all of the hope you hold for her  
And when the lady loves you  
Don't ever let it go  
Take your world into your arms  
And let your feelings show  
  
And she, never will leave  
Always these memories will stay with me  
And I'll think of her now and then  
  
She, she needs to be reassured  
of all of the hope you hold for her  
And brother, when the lady loves you  
Don't ever let it go  
Take your world into your arms  
And let your feelings show  
  
And she, never will leave  
Always these memories will stay with me  
And I'll think of her now and then
