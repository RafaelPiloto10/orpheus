There's a riot in the kitchen and the bed's on fire  
There's a locket in my pocket that I can't find  
Oh I'm at the window whistling in the wind  
I'm at my own front door and I can't get in  
  
I'm dialing up 911  
I'm on the brink of trouble again,  
If you could change the time, a little,  
Then everything would be  
Fine, fine, fine  
  
Tell me do you have a home-made remedy,  
The only time we talk is in our sleep  
Oh he likes mornings, I like the moon  
It's a typical case of too little, too soon  
  
I'm dialing up 911  
I'm on the brink of trouble again,  
If you could change the time, a little,  
Then everything would be  
Fine, fine, fine  
  
...My back is in the corner,  
My boat is taking on water,  
You can't wrap fire up in paper  
And you can't rap your way out of here  
  
Oh I like mornings, he likes the moon  
It's a typical case of too late, too soon  
  
I'm dialing up 911...
