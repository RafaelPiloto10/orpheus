Time and time again  
Naughty girls get me in trouble  
When I fly too high  
Something's bound to burst the bubble  
  
You say this is love  
Wonder if you're feeling lonely  
Tell me if you please  
Is this for this evening only  
  
Or will it be for long, long time  
Or just a passing fancy  
Will it be for a long, long time  
I feel as though it can be  
  
I'll just what and see  
What tomorrow has to bring me  
A love that is oh-so-true  
Or another girl who's free and easy  
  
So, I'll just wait and see  
What tomorrow has to bring me  
A love that is oh-so-true  
Or another girl who's free and easy  
  
Time and time again  
And again
