I will wait for the bridegroom  
I've awakened early to say  
I will wait for my bridegroom  
I will wait for him today  
I will give to him my impatience  
I will give him all of my fear  
I will make my heart very quiet  
I will wait for him here  
In bright color, in joyous line  
In morning light and lamp fire  
I?ll make fine my home here  
And trust in my home to come  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
With loving care and with pleasure  
In the lamp light I will sing  
I will trust in my bridegroom  
I will give him everything  
In bright color and in joyous line  
In morning light and lamp fire  
I?ll make fine my home here  
And trust in my home to come  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
In bright color and in joyous line  
In morning light and lamp fire  
I?ll make fine my home here  
And trust in my home to come  
I will give to him my impatience  
I will give him all of my fear  
I will make my heart very quiet  
I will wait for him here  
I will wait for the bridegroom  
I've awakened early to say  
I will wait for my bridegroom  
I will wait for him today
