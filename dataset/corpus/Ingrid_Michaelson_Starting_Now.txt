I want to crawl back inside my mother's womb  
I want to shut out all the lights in this room  
I want to start fresh, like a baby in a sink  
Scrub away all these thoughts that I think of you  
  
So life moves slowly when you're waiting for it to boil,  
Feel like I watch from six feet under the soil  
Still, want to hold you and kiss behind your ears,  
But I recount the countless tears that I lost for you  
  
But before you finally go there's one thing you should know, that I promise...  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world  
  
I want to crawl back inside my bed of sin  
I want to burn the sheets that smell like your skin  
Instead I'll wash them just like kitchen rags with stains  
Spinning away every piece that remains of you  
  
But before you finally go there's one thing you should know, that I promise...  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world  
  
It's my world, it's not ours anymore  
It's my world, it's not ours anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Starting now, I'll never know your name  
Starting now, I'll never feel the same  
Starting now, I wish you never came into my world
