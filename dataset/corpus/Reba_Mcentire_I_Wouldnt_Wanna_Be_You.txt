You don't have a clue  
You're so far gone  
He's got you dancin' to  
A siren's song  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't want to be you right now  
I wouldn't want to be  
I wouldn't want to be you right now  
I wouldn't want to be, I wouldn't want to be  
  
You're not the first he's drawn  
To his flame  
He means to do you wrong  
He has no shame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's easy to understand  
How you could fall so hard  
You're not the only one  
He's taken in and torn apart  
  
Won't say I told you so  
But I'm afraid it's true  
You're about to go  
What I went through  
  
[Chorus]
