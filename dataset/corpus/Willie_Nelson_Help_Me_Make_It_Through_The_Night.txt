Take the ribbons from your hair shake 'em loose and let 'em fall  
Let 'em fall against your chin like the shadows on the wall  
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light  
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night  
  
Well I don't care who's right or wrong and I won't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow cause tonight I need a friend  
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night  
  
Well I don't care who's right or wrong...  
I can't stand to be alone help me make it through the night
