I carry a Madness,  
Everywhere I go,  
Over the border.  
And back to the snow.  
  
So if you see me  
And I look right through  
You should not take it  
As a reflection on you  
  
Come on, turn up the sun  
Turn it up for everyone.  
  
Love one another  
Love one another  
  
The boys in the bubble  
Want to be free  
They got so blind  
That they cannot see  
  
Well I'm not your keeper,  
I don't have your key.  
I got a piano,  
But I can't find the see  
  
Come one, turn up the sun  
Turn it up for everyone  
  
Love one another  
Love one another  
  
Come on, turn up the sun,  
Turn it up, for everyone  
  
Love one another,  
Love one another.
