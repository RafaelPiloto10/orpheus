I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Well, it was on one moonlight night  
Stars shining bright  
Wish blown high  
Love said good-bye  
Blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Well, I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Just keep on shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
Well, it was on one moonlight night  
Stars shining bright  
Wish blown high  
Love said good-bye  
Blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shining  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
