Me and my big ideas  
Won't wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That I'm not that kind  
  
Go get a volunteer  
We'll pay him well my dear  
He will see inside your mind  
Because he is that kind  
  
It's a southern kind of heat  
The shadows crack and start to creep  
Conversation drag its feet  
I wish we'd both been more discret  
Like light that it caught between night and day  
You're stuck between me and my  
  
Me and my big ideas  
Won't wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That I'm not that kind  
  
Well they love you when you're weak  
Bet they hate you to see this winning streak  
It's that thing we call control  
There's a deep frustration  
Black thoughts  
That are stuck between someone's ears  
Like me and my big idea  
  
So many strings to your bow  
Why not let one go  
  
In a way this dream is over  
Blown away our four leaf clover  
  
There's no reason why  
There's just me and my  
  
Me and my big ideas  
Won't wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That I'm not that kind
