I-I had a chance for glory  
Ooh-ooh wouldn't tell you no lies  
Same end on another story  
I-I could have prophesised  
I'd lose the prize  
  
I-I'm gonna raid the future  
Ooh-ooh and I wanna know why  
Everything is so temporary  
Ooh those I'll let you know eyes  
I should have realized  
  
I'm no hero  
I won't get the glory  
I'm the one who's left behind  
I'm no hero  
No place in your story  
I'm the man who's left behind  
I must have been blind  
Must have been  
  
I-I needed understanding  
Ooh-ooh you didn't symphathise  
Left me here-left without a warning  
Ooh you left me paralysed  
I-I should have realized  
  
I'm no hero  
I won't get the glory  
I'm the one who's left behind  
I'm no hero  
No place in your story  
I'm the man who's left behind  
I must have been blind  
Must have been... Oh so blind ahh blind  
-solo-  
I'm no hero  
I won't get the glory  
I'm the one who's left behind  
I'm no hero  
No place in your story  
I'm the man who's left behind  
I must have been blind  
Must have been
