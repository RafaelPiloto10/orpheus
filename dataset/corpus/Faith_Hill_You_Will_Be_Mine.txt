Heads I win, tails you lose  
I always play by my own rules  
And I don't believe in wasting time  
So long before we end this night  
  
I will have held you  
I will have kissed you  
I will have claimed you  
You will be mine  
I will have loved you  
Wrong or right  
I will have your heart  
You will be mine  
  
An unwritten law says a girl should wait  
Should let the man set his own pace  
But a woman in love, she's above the law  
So long before this night is gone  
  
I will have held you  
I will have kissed you  
I will have claimed you  
You will be mine  
I will have loved you  
Wrong or right  
I will have your heart  
You will be mine  
  
You top my list of things to do  
And I will get close to you  
Before this night is through  
  
I will have held you  
I will have kissed you  
I will have claimed you  
You will be mine  
I will have loved you  
Wrong or right  
I will have your heart  
You will be mine
