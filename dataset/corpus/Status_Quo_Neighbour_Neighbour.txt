You're so unrespecting  
You're interfering with my life  
  
Day and night, all the time, leave me alone  
  
Neighbour neighbour don't you worry what goes on in my home  
You're always looking for something to gossip about  
You run around from door to door  
Rollin' your mouth about things you don't know  
Neighbour neighbour don't you worry what goes on in my home  
Just leave me alone  
  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry how I treat my wife  
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night, well it ain't right  
You've got your troubles, my troubles too  
Something bad's gonna happen to you  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry what goes on in my home  
Just leave me alone  
  
Day and night, all the time, yeah  
  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry who knocks on my front door  
Walking and talking and pacing all over the floor  
Peeping, sleeping, through the hall  
Keeping your big ears glued to my wall  
Neighbour neighbour don't worry what goes on in my home  
You know it's true  
  
You're interfering with my life, leave me alone neighbour  
Leave me alone, you go your way and I'll go mine  
  
You're so unrespecting
