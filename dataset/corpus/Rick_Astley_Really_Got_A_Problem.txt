Here we are  
Riding high  
We've some so far  
We can touch the sky  
  
So why can't we live together  
Can't we be friends  
Why must we fight our brothers  
Til the bitter end  
  
[Chorus]  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix yeah  
There ain't no reason for staying  
We just can't do it  
  
Talk to me  
Scream and shout  
Trust in me  
We can work it out  
  
We all know the world keeps turning  
One day at a time  
Easier lessons for leaving  
We just couldn't find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So why can't we live together  
Can't we be friends  
Why must we fight our brothers  
Til the bitter end  
  
Oh yeah  
Won't you trust in me  
I know we can make it yeah  
  
I close my eyes and look inside  
For a picture of how it should be  
And I wonder if you could see what I see  
  
Would you ever choose to live the way you do  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix b'dum yeah  
There ain't no reason for staying  
We just can't do it  
  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix b'dum yeah  
I know we got the pieces  
But they just don't fit  
  
We really got a problem  
We don't know how to fix  
I know we got the pieces  
We just can't do it
