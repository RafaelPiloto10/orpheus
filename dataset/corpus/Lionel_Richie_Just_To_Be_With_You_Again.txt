So I still walk on through the night and through the rain  
I would give it all  
Just to be with you again  
  
It's a lonely road  
For my heart is still in chains  
But I live my life just to be with you again  
  
We have walked together where angels go  
And we found a place inside us that only we could know  
  
So I still walk on through the night and through the rain  
I would give it all  
Just to be with you again  
  
That's the way life goes  
I go whispering the wind  
But I take that for  
Just to be with you again  
Can I find a reason  
Can I find a way  
Cause the words I need to tell you  
Are the words I didn't say  
  
So I still walk on through the night and through the rain  
I would give it all  
Just to be with you again  
  
I see you standing in the doorway  
With that looks in your eyes  
And the feeling that I feel will never die  
  
So I still walk on through the night and through the rain  
I would give it all  
Just to be with you again  
  
Well that's the way life goes  
I go whispering the wind  
I would give it all  
Just to be with you again  
It's a lonely road  
For my heart is still in chains  
But I live my life just to be with you again
