If you see him, tell him I wish him well. how am I doing? well sometimes  
Its hard to tell. I still miss him more than ever. but please don't say a
word.  
If you see him. if you see him.  
  
If you see her, tell her Im doing fine. and if you want to, say that I think  
Of her from time to time. ask her if she ever wonders where we both went
wrong.  
If you see her. if you see her. I still want her.  
  
And I still need him so.  
  
I don't know why we let each other go.  
  
If you see her, tell her the lights still on for her.  
  
Nothings changed deep down the fire still burns for him. and even if  
It takes forever, say I'll still be here. if you see him.  
  
If you see her.  
  
If you see him.  
  
If you see her.
