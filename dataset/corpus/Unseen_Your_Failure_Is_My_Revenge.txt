Go  
  
You say stand up for your rights  
  
But you fall for all their lies  
  
You Claim to know the truth  
  
While wearing a cheap disguise  
  
Who are you to judge us, don't tell  
  
Us how to live our lives  
  
The real world's outside your door,  
  
It's gonna open your eyes  
  
Go..  
  
Real life is coming gonna wipe  
  
The smile from your face  
  
You'll be left chocking, gagging  
  
On reality's bitter taste  
  
Won't talk down to others when  
  
You're living on your knees  
  
Slowly the hate sets in it  
  
Consumes you like a disease  
  
.  
  
Oh your failure (failure) is my revenge.  
  
Life's gonna catch up with you in the end  
  
.  
  
this world you've built is fragile,  
  
It's all gonna come crashing down  
  
And when your world collapses,  
  
I only pray that I'm around  
  
To see the look on your face,  
  
The hurt, hollow, and blank stare  
  
Of a person who just realized  
  
That no one ever cared
