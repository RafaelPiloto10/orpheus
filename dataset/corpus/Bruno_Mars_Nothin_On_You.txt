Beautiful girls all over the world  
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted  
They got nothin' on you baby  
Nothin' on you baby  
  
They might say hi and I might say hey  
But you shouldn't worry about what they say  
'Cause they got nothin' on you baby  
Nothin' on you baby  
  
No' no' no' nothin' on you babe  
No' no' nothin' on you  
I know you feel where I'm coming from  
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done  
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun  
On the carousel so around I spun (spun)  
With no directions just tryna get some (some)  
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)  
An' so I lost more than I had ever won  
And honestly I ended up with none  
  
There's so much nonsense  
It's on my conscience  
I'm thinking baby I should get it out  
And I don't wanna sound redundant  
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know  
(That you wanna know)  
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)  
'Cause we don't wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)  
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go)

Hands down there will never be another one  
I been around and I never seen another one  
Because your style I ain't really got nothin' on  
And you wow when you got nothin' on?  
Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes  
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic  
You're my Wonder Women call me Mr. Fantastic  
Stop, now think about it  
  
I've been to London, I've been to Paris  
Even way out there in Tokyo  
Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans  
But you always steal the show (steal the show)  
And just like that girl you got a fro (got a fro)  
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)  
If you never knew well now you know (know, know, know)

Everywhere I go I'm always hearing your name (name, name)  
And no matter where I'm at girl you make me wanna sing (sing)  
Whether a bus or a plane (plane) or a car or a train (train)  
No other girls in my brain and you the one to blame (blame)
