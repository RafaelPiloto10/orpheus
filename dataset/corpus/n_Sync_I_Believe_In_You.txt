I never believed in dreaming  
It never got me very far  
I never believed that love could find me  
Like an arrow through the heart  
I never believed in miracles  
Or building castles in the air  
Not until that day I found you  
I turned around and you were there  
  
From the day you came you gave me  
A whole new point of view  
I've been touched by an angel  
It's impossible but true  
  
(CHORUS)  
I believe in you  
I swear that forever from today  
No one will ever take your place  
I believe in you  
And I believe our love will last always  
  
I never believed in fairytales  
Though sometimes I wish I could  
I never believed that golden slippers  
Could ever find the perfect foot  
I never believed in magic  
Or that wishes could come true  
But your very first kiss  
Changed all this something only you could do  
  
You made me a believer  
You made me trust again  
You showed me there's a pot of gold  
At every rainbow's end  
  
(CHORUS)  
I believe in you  
I swear that forever from today  
No one will ever take your place  
I believe in you  
And I believe our love will last always  
  
Only love could set you free  
And if you serve to fate  
Then you're my destiny  
Now I know  
Now I see  
Anything can happen  
If you just believe  
  
(CHORUS)  
I believe in you  
I swear that forever from today  
No one will ever take your place  
I believe in you  
And I believe our love will last always
