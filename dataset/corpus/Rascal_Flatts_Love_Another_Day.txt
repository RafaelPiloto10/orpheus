It' s 3 A. M. And you' re still wide awake  
Wonderin' how much more your broken heart can take  
All he left you with is shattered dreams  
I know it' s hard to see right now it' s not as bad as it seems  
  
You' ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it' s way  
Hold on, it won' t be long  
I know the pain you' re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It' s ok, don' t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
I know you said you lost your faith in love  
But it' s not written in the stars above  
I wouldn' t tell you anything but the truth  
Cause I' ve been where you are and I' m living proof  
  
You' ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it' s way  
Hold on, it won' t be long  
I know the pain you' re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It' s ok, don' t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
What' s here right now didn' t come to stay  
The sun' s gonna rise again and the clouds will roll away  
Believe me when I say  
  
You' ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it' s way  
Hold on, hold on  
I know the pain you' re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It' s ok, don' t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
Don' t you worry baby cause we all live to love another day
