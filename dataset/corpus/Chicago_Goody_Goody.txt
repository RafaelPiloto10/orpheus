Good thing, got yourself a good thing, It's a good thing. Ooooh.  
It's a good thing, got yourself a good thing, I'm gonna let you go  
So you met someone who set you back on your heels. (Goody Goody)  
So you met someone and now you know how it feels. (Goody Goody)  
So you gave him your heart too, just as I gave mine to you  
And he broke it in little pieces. Now, how do you do?  
So you lie awake, just singin' the blues all night (Goody Goody)  
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite (Goody Goody)  
Hurray and Hallelujah! You had it comin' to ya  
  
Goody goody for him. Goody Goody for you.  
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal, you  
Good thing, got yourself a good thing. Ooooh.  
It's a good thing, got yourself a good thing, I'm gonna let you go  
So you met somebody who set you back on your heels. (Goody Goody)  
So you met somebody and now you know how it feels. (Goody Goody)  
So you gave him your heart too, just as I gave mine to you  
And he stuck it in his collection, section 92.  
So you lie awake, just singin' the blues all night (Goody Goody)  
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite (Goody Goody)  
Hurray and Hallelujah! You had it comin' to ya  
Goody goody for him. Goody Goody for me.  
And I hope you're satisfied, you rascal, you  
Good thing, got yourself a good thing, It's a good thing. Ooooh.  
It's a good thing, got yourself a good thing, I'm gonna let you go  
(till end
