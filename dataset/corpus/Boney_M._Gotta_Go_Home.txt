Headin' for the islands  
We're ready man and packed to go  
When we hit those islands  
There's gonna be a big hello  
Diggin' all the sunshine  
It's easy not to say goodbye  
Bye Bye Bye  
  
Headin' for the islands  
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home  
  
Walkin' down the beaches  
Tomorrow mornin' we'll be there  
Golden sandy beaches  
Say, I can smell the breezy air  
One more celebration  
And then we're ready for goodbye  
Bye, Bye,Bye  
  
Walkin' down the beaches  
Heyeah, We're really flyin' high  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home  
  
Going back home  
Going back home  
Going back home  
Going back home  
  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home, home, home  
Gotta go home
