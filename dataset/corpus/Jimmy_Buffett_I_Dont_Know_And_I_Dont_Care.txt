Why does the sunset in the west?  
And why does my heart keep beating in my chest?  
What ever happened to the Duke of Earl?  
I got a PBS mind in a MTV world.  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
I forgot these lessons taught to me.  
Some say life isn't fair,  
Hey, I don't know, I don't care.  
  
Ambivalent, well, yes and no.  
Hey where did all the hippies go?  
Our conversation sounds like actors' lines.  
Is it time for your medication or mine?  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
I forgot these lessons taught to me.  
Some say life isn't fair,  
Hey I don't know, I don't care.  
  
Therapy is extremely expensive.  
Poppin' bubblie wrap is radically cheap.  
You choose which one helps with your problem.  
I'm gonna get some sleep.  
I'm gonna get some sleep.  
  
Sandy beaches in distant reaches  
And oh those lovely Georgia peaches.  
It's never too much and never too late  
To pack your bags and get out of state.  
Is it ignorance or apathy  
The worried will all disagree.  
Some say life isn't fair,  
Hell, I don't know and I don't care.  
  
If you're looking for a quote from me  
I'll be under the mango tree.  
Just can't say how I'll get there  
Hey, I don't know and I don't care.  
I don't know and I don't' care.  
I don't know and I don't care.  
At his beach house on the moon
