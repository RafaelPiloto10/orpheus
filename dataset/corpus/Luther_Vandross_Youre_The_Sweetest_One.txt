The world's sweetest lady  
Live around my way  
And I think that I'm in love  
Hey there sweet one  
You don't know what you've done  
I was once so lonely  
Now I only think of love, of love sweet love  
And you're the sweetest one  
  
[Chorus I:]  
(The sweetest one) I've ever known  
(Sugar and honey) You're the one  
(You are the one) The sweetest love  
(The sweetest one and only)  
  
Said I'm in love forever  
With the sweetest lady  
And I know she love me too  
  
Hey there sweetness  
Girl, believe me you're the best  
You are quite amazing  
I'll forever stay in love, in love sweet love  
'Cause you're the sweetest one  
  
[Chorus II:]  
(The sweetest one) I have known  
(I've ever known) Everyone  
(Everyone) Says it's love  
(Says we belong together) Yeah  
(The sweetest one) The sweetest love  
(Sugar and honey) You're the one  
(You are the one) And I'm in love  
(The sweetest one and only) Yeah  
  
Hey there sweetie pie  
People never ask me why  
'Cause it's so easy to see  
Why I'm so sweetly in love, in love sweet love
