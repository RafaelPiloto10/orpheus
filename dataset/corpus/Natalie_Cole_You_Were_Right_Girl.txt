It's hard to say how long it's been, but once upon a time  
You were my best friend, I'm sorry I hurt you but I loved him, loved him  
You said I'd get hurt in the end, you tried to warn me with good advice  
Instead of listening, I paid the price, yes I did, you told me back then  
You said he'll love you, leave you, you said his heart was cold as ice  
And you were right girl, yes, he played me for a fool, (you were right girl)  
Hmm, it all came true, (you were right girl), I know  
I should have known it all along, (you were right girl)  
Yes, you were right and I was wrong, I thought you blamed him for your
mistakes  
That all your put downs were just sour grapes, you told me back then  
That they'll be lyin, cryin' and it won't be his heart that breaks  
And ooh, (you were right girl) you were right girl  
He played me for a fool, (you were right girl) oh  
It all came true, you were (you were right girl) right girl  
Yes, I should have known it all along (you were right girl)  
You were right girl, you were right and I was wrong  
Oh, what made me think that I was different from you  
That I could make him do what he wouldn't do for you  
Now you told me back then I'd never change him, change him  
But he'd change me before he's through, and ooh (you were right girl)  
You were right girl, he played me for a fool, he really did  
(you were right girl) well, it all came true, (you were right girl)  
You were so right, I should have known it all along (you were right girl)  
Oh, yes, you were right and I was wrong, oh, (you were right girl)  
He really played me for a fool, (you were right girl)  
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it all came true (you were right girl)  
Yeah, (you were right girl) you were right girl  
I should have known it all along, (you were righ girl)  
You were right girlfriend, you were right and I was wrong, woo, woo, woo  
(you were right girl) you were right my girl, (you were right girl)  
You were right my girl, he played me for a great big fool
