You always stir my imagination  
Sometimes it borders on fantasy  
And sometimes I find visions flash  
Through my mind close to reality  
  
Night a soft guitar a hidden lane  
A moon and here and there a star  
For a man and his dream  
Night a crickets' cry a whispered word  
A kiss and now and then a sigh  
  
For a man and his dream  
And their eyes when they meet  
Seem to say it's sublime  
And their hearts proudly beat  
  
To a tune that is older than time  
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love  
So all the world will say  
There's a man and his dream  
  
And their eyes when they meet  
Seem to say it's sublime  
And their hearts proudly beat  
  
To a tune that is older than time  
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love  
So all the world will say  
There's a man and his dream
