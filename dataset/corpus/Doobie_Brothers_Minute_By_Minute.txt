Hey, don't you worry, I've been lied to  
I've been here many times before  
Girl, don't you worry, I know where I stand  
I don't need this love, I don't need your hand  
I know I could turn, blink, and you'd be gone  
Then I must be prepared any time to carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
But minute by minute by minute by minute  
I keep holding on  
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute  
I keep holding on  
  
You would stay just to watch me, darlin'  
Wilt away on lies from you  
Can't stop the habit of livin' on the run  
I take it all for granted like you're the only one  
  
Livin' on my own  
Somehow that sounds nice  
You think I'm you fool  
Well, you may just be right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Call my name and I'll be gone  
You'll reach out and I won't be there  
Just my luck you'll realize  
You should spend your life with someone  
You could spend your life with someone  
  
[Chorus]
