The other woman finds time to manicure her nails  
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails  
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair  
  
The other woman enchantes her clothes with french perfume  
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room  
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere  
  
And when her baby comes to call  
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen  
'Cause when she's by his side  
It's such a change from old routine  
  
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep  
The other woman will never have his love to keep  
And as the years go by the other woman  
Will spend her life alone
