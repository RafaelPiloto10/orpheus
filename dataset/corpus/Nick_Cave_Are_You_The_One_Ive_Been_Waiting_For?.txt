I've felt you coming girl, as you drew near  
I knew you'd find me, cause I longed you here  
Are you my destiny? Is this how you'll appear?  
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?  
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor  
Are you the one I've been waiting for?  
  
As you've been moving, surely toward me  
My soul has comforted and assured me  
That in time my heart it will reward me  
And that all will be revealed  
So I've sat and I've watched an ice-age thaw  
Are you the one I've been waiting for?  
  
Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built  
Out of longing great wonders have been willed  
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill  
And lay your head upon my shoulder  
Outside my window the world has gone to war  
Are you the one I've been waiting for?  
  
O we will know... Won't we?  
The stars will explode in the sky  
But they don't... Do they?  
Stars have their moment and then they die  
  
There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him  
He said, "He who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in"  
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting  
And how every little thing anticipates you  
All down my veins my heart-strings call  
Are you the one I've been waiting for?
