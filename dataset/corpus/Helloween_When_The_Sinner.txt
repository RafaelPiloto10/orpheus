Now it's time, to shake it all up to be free  
Now it's time, to make us some room to let us be  
Oh, it feels so bad  
Yes it feels so bad  
When everything good looks so bad  
When everything right goes so wrong  
  
I am up, to break it all down what's in my way  
I won't stop, until I am where I'm going to stay  
No one holds me back  
No, no one holds me back  
Don't want to be what I'm not  
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck  
  
I here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere  
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around  
We keep on looking 'til we know what for  
  
If you don't know it, I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?  
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know  
But anyway we've got to make a stop  
  
Over my head, look over my head you won't see no halo  
It's driving me mad, I must hold it back inside  
  
When the sinner searches sin, it's all of us  
When we finally search inside, it's under us  
We keep on looking anyway  
If we don't find it who must pay?  
All I've ever done I've done to you!  
  
In my mind, the battle goes on 'til I give up  
Will we find, the key of life we once have dropped?  
Do you really care?  
Tell me you really care!  
You may find Mr. Blame  
But the guilt of life burns everywhere  
  
Give me light to see my inside, give me light to see my sin  
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad  
You must be joking when you point at me!  
  
Hey! Don't you blame me! Don't you touch me!  
Won't you ever leave me be?  
I want to live! Don't want to think! Why should I give what I can drink?  
Man! Life is short so I take what I need!  
  
Over your head...  
When the sinner...  
  
Pain!  
I feel inside it's such a  
Shame!  
No one fights fair, but who' to  
Blame!  
Might be the game of life but it ain't' over  
Now!  
I walk my way firm any  
How!  
My conscience speaks and there are  
Doubts!  
But nothing's sure in lifeand it ain't over  
Now!  
  
I look here...  
Over my head...  
When the sinner...
