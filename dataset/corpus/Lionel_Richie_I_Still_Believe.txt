I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
I still believe there's a reason, there's a meaning to why we're here  
There is a place where we can go to where we don't have to live in fear  
They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean.  
And I'm just dreaming my life away  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer, don't turn away  
'cause I believe in love, that's the only way  
  
I believe in every moment, every heartbeat that we're here  
And we're a part of each other and forever it seems so clear  
I don't believe that I'm just walking in the darkness  
Or that I'm lost without a prayer  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
Oh now love is the answer and oh it's right here  
And I know we've got to remember it's only together for now and forever  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer  
Don't turn away, 'cause I believe in love  
'cause I believe in love, 'cause I believe in love and that's the only way.
