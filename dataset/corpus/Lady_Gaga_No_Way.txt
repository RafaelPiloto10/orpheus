I saw a shadow,  
And I knew that it wasn't mine  
  
You and her, I know that you were intertwined  
Even though her clothes were on and everything  
Your eyes were somewhere else and you were both  
To blame  
  
Don't say a word, I'm sure that it won't  
Be enough  
To erase what I know  
Just happens now what dreams are made of  
  
This is my house and I won't allow the disrespect  
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you  
  
Cause baby now that your caught what am I supposed to say?  
When you're so wrong in what you did  
But I still feel this way  
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw that day  
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying  
  
The answer is no way  
No way ay-ay-ay  
No way ay-ay-ay  
No way ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay  
  
And then I saw something I know did not belong to me  
But then I thought there was no way you would do that to me  
And then last week when you went outside to use your phone  
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold  
  
And I just woke up but I wish that it was a nightmare  
'Cause when I have those it isn't real like this one is  
This is my heart and I won't allow the disrespect  
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you  
  
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say  
When you're so wrong in what you did  
But I still feel this way  
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today  
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying  
  
The answer is no way  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay  
  
Get your things and go  
You can take the dinner leftover from last night  
I made you your favorite goodbye  
  
'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say  
When you're so wrong in what you did  
But I still feel this way  
I can't believe it or forget it, what I saw today  
And if you're wonderin' if I'm staying  
  
The answer is no way  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay  
No way-ay-ay-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee-ay  
  
Ehh-heeeeeeyyyyyy-ohhhhhhhh-noo way  
No way
