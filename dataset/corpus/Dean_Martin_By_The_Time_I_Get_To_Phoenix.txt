By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be risin'  
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door  
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'  
'Cause I've left that gal so many times before  
By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working  
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing  
Off the wall, that's all  
By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping  
She'll turn softly, call my name out low  
And she'll cry just to think, I'd really leave her  
Though time and time, I've tried to tell her so  
She just didn't know, I would really go
