Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone  
'Cause right now it says that "We can't come to the phone"  
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
  
(It's ridiculous)  
It's been months and for some reason I just  
(Can't get over us)  
And I'm stronger than this  
  
(Enough is enough)  
No more walking round with my head down  
I'm so over being blue, crying over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory  
And now every song reminds me of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm  
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
(Leave me alone)  
Leave me alone  
(Stupid love songs)  
Don't make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
Let it go  
Turning off the radio  
  
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)  
Why can't I turn off the radio?
