Sometimes I imagine myself as a drifter  
A seeker of fortune, connoisseur of great wines  
Dashin' through meadows of yellow and green  
Tryin' to catch the impossible dream  
A-leavin' the straight life behind  
  
Sometimes my thoughts found me way down in Mexico  
A-drinkin' tequila goin' out of my mind  
Havin' a ball on a couple 'a bob  
A-treatin' the ladies to corn on the cob  
A-leavin' the straight life behind  
  
And suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear  
She comes to me softly with crackers and beer  
A-winkin' and blinkin' and blowin' my ear  
A-runnin' away with my mind  
  
It's great to be in love, I'm not really thinkin' of  
A-leavin' the straight life behind  
I'm just playin' a game in my-why mind  
  
Once in a while in my mind I go a-bummin'  
A-goin' nowhere, with no worry of time  
Runnin' along chasin' after a train  
Hummin' a song in the sun and the rain  
A-leavin' the straight life behind  
  
I can just see me on a tropical island  
A-ridin' the surf and drinkin' coconut wine  
Havin' me fun with the girls in the sand  
Chasin' the sun through an innocent land  
A-leavin' the straight life behind  
  
Suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear  
She comes to me softly with crackers and beer  
A-winkin' and blinkin' and blowin' my ear  
A-runnin' away with my mind  
  
It's great to be in love, I'm not really thinkin' of  
A-leavin' the straight life behind  
I'm just playin' a game in my-why mind
