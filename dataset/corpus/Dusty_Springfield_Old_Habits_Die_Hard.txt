It's my decision  
You look my way  
With innocent expression  
Just as if to say  
It would be easy  
The mood is right  
Forget for just one moment  
Who we are tonight  
I start  
To weaken the music's strong  
My conscience speaks, I know it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Temptation makes a fool out of us all  
  
I made my mind up  
It had to end  
So why this indecision?  
When you're close again  
Oh, the thought's appealing  
I can't deny  
With those old memories stealing  
Back across my mind  
I thought by now that the flame had gone  
I realize that I'm still holding on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll just keep holding on  
It's easier said than done  
  
(Old habits die hard)  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard
