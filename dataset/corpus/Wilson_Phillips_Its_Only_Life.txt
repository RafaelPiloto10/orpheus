Hey, do you know what's going on  
Do you?  
Come on, play it!  
Are you awake  
Have you anything to say  
Are you aware of what surrounds you  
And all the times you tried to please everyone  
Can you admit it doesn't matter?  
Ooh there's never a dull moment in my life  
And I don't mind the ride  
Don't live a lifeless life  
When you could be living it right  
Don't be one to be led  
It's a heavy world in my small world  
Get up get out of bed  
Ooh there's never a dull moment in my life  
And I don't mind the ride  
  
Don't you know it's only life  
It's only life  
Taking you on a constant flight  
Don't you know that it's only life  
There is no wrong there could be no right  
Whatever you're doing  
However you're doing it  
You'll be living your life  
Yes it's only life  
So there is no wrong, no right  
Ooh it's a constant flight  
  
Movin' on  
Are you awake  
(I don't think I heard the answer)  
Is there no one on the other line  
No  
It's a heavy world in my small world  
But I'm feeling just fine  
Ooh there's never a still moment in my life  
And I don't mind the ride  
  
Life  
Don't you know  
It's only life  
It's only life  
I'm crying  
I'm crying  
Don't you know it's only life  
Taking you on a constant flight  
Don't you know that it's only life  
There is no wrong there could be no right  
Whatever you're doin'  
However you're doing it  
You'll be living your life  
Don't you know it's only life  
  
And everyone pushes to get by  
We go here  
We're going there  
Somebody tell me why  
Don't you know that it's only life  
There is no wrong  
There could be no right  
Whatever you're doing  
However you're doing  
You'll be living your life  
Don't you know it's only life  
Don't you know it's only life
