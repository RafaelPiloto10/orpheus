listen to the news, changes are coming soon  
atlantic engineers and cities in the moon  
you better look across the ocean, tell me what you see  
the southern cross explodes into the colours of the sea  
mighty maomoondog skips across the waves  
kick the door and hit the shore and be somebody else  
supersonic landscapes are melting in your hair  
bubblegum comediens planting skylarks in the air  
here we go with the new sensation  
we're on every station  
such a kind of a legend to turn you on  
dig that rhythm, genie and listen to the voice of the dolphins  
listen to your radio  
all across the planet, politicians tremble  
continental sister's rocking with the liquid gambler  
now the time is here, now it's coming true  
the enigmatic extasy is overwhelming you  
acrobats and comets are streaking by  
40.000 sirens are wailing at the sky  
innersexual circuits are cruising without fear  
all inviting you for partytiming here  
that's the start of the new sensation..  
...dig that band  
listen to me, listen to the voice of the dolphin  
you better return to the sea  
listen to his majesty  
you better return to the sea  
you better return to me..
