Some say the heart is just like a wheel  
When you bend it you can't mend it  
But my love for you is like a sinking ship  
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean  
  
When harm is done no love can be won  
I know it happens frequently  
What I can't understand oh please God hold my hand  
Why it had to happen to me  
  
And it's only love and it's only love  
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out  
  
Some say the heart is just like a wheel  
When you bend it you can't mend it  
But my love for you is like a sinking ship  
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
