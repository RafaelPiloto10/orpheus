It's only been a hour since you left me  
But it feels like a million days  
If I had a magic wand I could turn back time  
I'd never let you go away  
  
I didn't have the heart to say I'm sorry  
Now I haven't got a heart at all  
I could tolerate the pain if I could talk to my best friend  
But you won't even call  
  
I'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase  
And packing everything I own  
I didn't back then but I do know now  
Wherever you are is home  
I'll crawl on my belly and beg you  
But you're so far away  
You've only been gone for an hour  
But it seems like a million days  
  
It's only been a hour since you left me  
I wish I had somebody to blame  
But you're the perfect picture of what love should look like  
And I want to be you're frame  
It's only been a hour but it feels like a million days  
  
A million days  
One hundred thousand million days  
Come home, come home baby  
I can't take this no more  
Well, come home baby oh yeah  
Baby, I know I shouldn't put my faith in heroes  
But I can't see you any other way  
It's only been a hour since you left me girl  
Feels like a million, feels like a million days  
  
Come home baby
