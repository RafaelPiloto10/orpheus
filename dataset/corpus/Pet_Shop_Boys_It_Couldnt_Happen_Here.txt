Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed  
In six inch heels, quoting magazines  
Go all the way, you knew you could  
So far, so good  
  
Someone asked: Who do you think you are?  
Who pays your bills? How come you came this far?  
Shrugged him off, and locked the door  
So good, this far  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here here  
  
I don't expect to talk in terms of sense  
Our dignity and injured innocence  
It contradicts your battle-scars  
Still healed, so far  
  
Now it almost seems incredible  
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong, but I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
We've found ourselves back where we started from  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here  
  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here
