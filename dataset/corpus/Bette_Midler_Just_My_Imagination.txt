Each day through my window  
I watch him as he passes by.  
I say to myself, "What an incredible guy."  
To have a love like that  
Must surely be a dream come true.  
Out of all the women in the world,  
He belongs to only you.  
  
But it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
It was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
  
Soon we'll be married  
And raise a family.  
A cozy little home out in the country  
With two kids or three.  
  
I tell you, I can visualize it all.  
This couldn't be a dream  
How real it all seems.  
  
Ohh, but it was just my imagination, once again  
Runnin' away with me.  
Tell you it was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
  
Every night on my knees I pray:  
Dear Lord, hear my plea.  
Don't ever let another take his love from me  
Or I will surely, surely die.  
  
His love is heavenly.  
When his arms enfold me  
I hear a tender rhapsody.  
But in reality  
He doesn't even know me.  
  
Once again  
Runnin' away with me.  
Ohh, just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
  
It was just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me.  
It was just my imagination  
Running away with me.  
  
Just my imagination  
Runnin' away with me
