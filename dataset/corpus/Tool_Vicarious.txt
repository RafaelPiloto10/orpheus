Eye on the TV  
Cause tragedy thrills me  
Whatever flavor it happens to be  
Like  
Killed by the husband"  
"Drowned by the ocean"  
Shot by his own son  
She used a poison  
In his tea  
And kissed him goodbye  
That's my kind of story  
It's no fun until someone dies  
  
Don't look at me like  
I am a monster  
Frown out your one face  
But with the other  
Stare like a junkie  
Into the TV  
Stare like a zombie  
  
While the mother holds her child  
Watches him die  
Hands to the sky crying,  
"Why, oh why?"  
  
Cause I need to watch things die, from a distance  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
You all need it too, don't lie  
  
Why can't we just admit it?  
Why can't we just admit it?  
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing  
Neither the brave nor bold  
Were writers of the stories told  
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing  
  
I need to watch things die... from a good safe distance  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
You all feel the same, so  
  
Why can't we just admit it?  
  
Blood like rain come down  
Drum on grave and ground  
  
Part vampire  
Part warrior  
Carnivore and voyeur  
Still have the transmitter  
Synched to the death rattle  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie (x4)  
  
Credulous at best  
Your desire to believe in  
Angels in the hearts of men  
Pull your head of your hippie haze, and give a listen  
Shouldn't have to say it all again  
  
The universe is hostile, so impersonal  
Devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been  
  
We all feed on tragedy  
It's like blood to a vampire  
  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
Much better you than I
