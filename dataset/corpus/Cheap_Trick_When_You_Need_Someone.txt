How does it feel to be on your own  
While the night slips away  
You toss and turn like a ship in a storm  
Have you lost your way?  
  
I can see by the look in your eyes  
You've been hurt before  
Hold me close like the very first time  
'Cause that's what love is for  
  
There's no reason to cry  
?Cause I'll be there beside you  
When you need someone  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
Sometimes the world can be so cold  
And you just don't know why  
You're reaching out but there's no one to hold  
And times rushin' by  
  
There's no reason to cry  
?Cause I'll be there beside you  
When you need someone  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
When you need someone  
It's a long long day  
When you need someone  
It's a cryin shame  
When you need someone  
You can call out my name  
  
There's no reason to cry  
?Cause I'll be there beside you  
When you need someone  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need somone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
When you need someone  
  
When you need someone  
Oh do ya need someone  
  
I'd never leave you  
I swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need someone  
I'd stay forever  
I swear that you would never be the lonely one  
Do you need someone?  
Do you need someone?  
  
I'll stay forever  
Swear that you will be the only one  
Through the sorrow and pain  
Just call out my name  
When you need someone  
Please stay forever  
Swear that you'll never be the lonley one  
Don't you need someone?
