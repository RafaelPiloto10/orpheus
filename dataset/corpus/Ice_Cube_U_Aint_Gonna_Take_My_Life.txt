Mr. Dirty Harry, you look really scary  
With your .357, officer Kevin  
Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine  
Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine  
Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood  
Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers  
Shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers  
Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff  
A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast  
And get away nigga fast  
You ain't gonna have me face down no more  
You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more  
To the boys in blue, I got kids too  
Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no  
On my way to the store  
You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over  
But where oh where is the ticket?  
You got your hand on your gun cause you're wicked  
You don't like the face of the original man  
But you gotta treat me like an individual man  
Talk right and I'll talk right back  
Show some goddamn respect to the black  
Cause I gotta get back to my wife  
But I'm sorry, you ain't gonna take my life  
  
Just because you got a badge  
Did you think Ice Cube was gonna wave the white flag?  
Cracker please, you can yell freeze  
I'd rather die standing up than die on my knees  
You think you can do anything you want to do  
To my crew when you come through, man fuck you  
Shooting up South Central  
Catch your ass slipping at a rent show  
Could have popped you off, one dead cop  
But I know you got a wife and a dog named Spot  
I show a little mercy cause I'm civilized  
Looking through a nigga's eyes at a much bigger prize  
But when I saw Rodney it got me so hot  
Made me wanna go out and pop me a cop  
Cause every time you see me sagging  
Here comes the Grand Dragon, in the motherfucking patty wagon  
Try to play me like a trick  
Sometimes you act like a dick, Mr. Nightstick  
Back then, I used to throw my Mack-10  
But nowadays you got the black skin  
Back then you don't like the voice of a nigga named Ice  
But you ain't gonna take my life  
  
You man let's get an understanding  
I know that your job is demanding  
But I only got me one life to live  
You only got about six shots to give  
And I got a big AK with a 50-round clip  
So why should we trip?  
You ain't gonna punk me, so what you trying for?  
Ain't no job worth dying for, is it?  
Might pay a visit to Petey Wheatstraw  
When you stop me on the shore, officer of the law  
And if I did something wrong, you can lock me up  
Never never never gonna sock me up  
So next time you have the urge, all of the sudden  
To fuck with a nigga for nothing  
Think about me, a brother that's 23  
I got a son and a J-O-B  
So before you pull your gun, you'd better think twice  
Pig, cause you ain't gonna take my life
