I can't believe  
That you're gone and we're alone  
I can't believe  
That we'll never see your face  
  
I can't believe  
That you're at the gates of Heaven  
I can't believe  
That we'll never know you  
  
If only, if only  
Miracles happened every day  
If only, if only  
I could believe in something  
  
Helpless we cried over you  
Empty and lost over you  
  
How in the world  
Can they say that you're at peace?  
How in the world  
Can they say that time will heal us?  
  
How in the world  
Can we hope to be forgiven?  
How in the world  
Can we know how we feel?  
  
If only, if only  
We could all live forever  
If only, if only  
No memories to remember  
  
Words were not spoken for you  
No grave marks our love for you  
Broken our hearts call for you  
No-one can blame us but you  
  
How in the world can we ever smile again  
How in the world can we live without you
