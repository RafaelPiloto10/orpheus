Well I'm a uptown cat, yeah even a crazy pet  
Well I'm a ladies man, yes a smooth talkin' dad  
  
I gotta go to bed 'cause I'm tired and sleepy  
I can't love you baby 'cause I'm tired and sleepy  
Tired and sleepy, ooh baby so tired  
  
I left the house last night, yeah with style and grace  
I met a wild-wild woman, yeah I tried to keep the pace  
  
I got a fifty dollar headache, yeah hundred dollar shoes  
A big long pink Cadillac and a bad-bad case of blues  
  
Yeah I'm a-waiting for you daddy  
Yeah that's what my baby said  
But honey I got a passion for my kingsize be
