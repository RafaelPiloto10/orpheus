No one seems to care as much  
No time to smile, laugh or cry as much  
Have we lost the touch that means so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
  
No one wants to be alone  
To walk or talk and sleep and weep alone  
Have we lost the touch that does so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
  
Touch me now and let me know  
Hold me tight so i can go  
Through this misery unafraid  
And really knowin' what lift is all about  
  
No one wants to live alone  
Who wants to smile, laugh or cry alone  
Have we lost the touch that means so much  
Have we lost the human touch  
Yes, yes, yes
