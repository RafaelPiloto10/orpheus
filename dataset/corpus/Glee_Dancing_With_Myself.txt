On the floors of Tokyo  
Down in London town's a go-go  
With the record selection  
And the mirror's reflection  
I'm a-dancing with myself  
  
Oh, when there's no one else in sight  
In the crowded, lonely night  
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
If I looked all over the world  
And there's every type of girl  
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by  
And leave me dancing with myself  
  
So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
If I had a chance, I'd ask one to dance  
And I'd be dancing with myself  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance  
And I'll be dancing with myself  
I'll be dancing with myself  
So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
And I'm dancing with myself
