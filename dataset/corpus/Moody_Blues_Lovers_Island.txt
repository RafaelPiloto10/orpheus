On Lover's Island  
Where the trees stand so tall  
And the dust turn to gold  
And love never grows old  
  
On Lover's Island  
Where the birds sing of love  
Seems a gift from up above  
I met her one day  
(Met her one day)  
  
As we stood alone on the mountain  
Under the moon and stars above  
Oh, darling, don't ever go  
She was Venus, the goddess of love  
  
On Lover's Island  
Where the trees stand so tall  
And the dust turn to gold  
And love never, never  
Never, never grows old
