Till U come back 2 me  
There'll be nothing left 2 say, no  
  
Broken  
My heart is broken, yeah  
Broken, oh baby  
My heart's just broken in 2  
Until U bring your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Broken, Lord  
My heart is broken, Lord  
Broken, yeah  
My heart's just broken in 2  
If U think that I'll beg 4 your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Lonely  
I'm so lonely  
Lonely  
I don't know what do 2  
Until U bring your sweet pussy, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Cryin'  
I'm just a-cryin'  
I'm just a-cryin', baby, all night  
I don't know what 2 do  
Until U bring your sweet honey, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Oh oh, baby  
Until U, baby  
Until U, baby, Lord  
Until U, baby  
Until U bring your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone in misery  
  
Cymbals!  
  
Until U bring your sweet love, bring it on home 2 me  
I'll be your broken-hearted man alone, baby  
Broken-hearted man alone, baby  
Broken-hearted man alone in misery
