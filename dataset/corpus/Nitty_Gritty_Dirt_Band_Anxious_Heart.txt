Don't mind me  
I'm half crazy about you  
I don't mean to doubt you  
But ooh I got an anxious heart  
  
You been gone so damn long  
That it seems  
I've fallen for a bad dream  
I guess I got an anxious heart  
  
Ooohh, put me away  
Tell me I don't deserve you  
But you ain't got the nerve too  
Oh wooh wooh  
  
I don't mind the times  
You lied, it's alright  
Just come home to me tonight  
Take away my anxious heart  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
Ooohhh, put me away  
Tell me I don't deserve you, ah  
You ain't got the nerve too  
Oh wooh wooh  
  
I don't mind the times  
You lied, it's alright  
Just come home to me tonight  
And take away my anxious heart (take away)  
Take away my anxious heart (take away)  
Please take away my anxious heart (take away)  
Ba-by take away my anxious heart (take away)  
Ooohh  
Take away my anxious heart  
Take away  
Take away
