I've got a lover way over there on the mountain side  
And I know that's where I should be  
Don't you know  
I've got a lover way over there across the river wide  
I can hear her calling to me  
Oh, she's calling my name  
So sweet so plain I can hear her saying  
(Come to me, baby)  
I'm on my way  
(Come to me baby)  
I'm gonna stay  
(Come to me baby)  
  
They tell me that the river's too deep  
And it's much too wide  
Boy, you can't get over to the other side  
But they don't know I got to get there  
And hold her in my arms just one more time  
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine  
'Cause I hear her saying,  
(Come to me baby)  
I'm on my way  
(Come to me baby)  
I'm gonna stay  
I'm gonna get to you  
No matter what I have to do
