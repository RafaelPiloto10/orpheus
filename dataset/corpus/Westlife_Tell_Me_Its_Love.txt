After all the lights come down  
And the circus has left town  
Will you be the one I can count on  
Will you be around  
  
When the stage is dark and empty  
And the last song has been sung  
Will the love you feel still be as strong  
To help me carry on  
  
Let me know the words inside you, say I do  
  
Tell me it's love it's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one  
  
When it's easier to walk away  
Are you strong enough to turn the page  
Do you know how to begin again  
Would you let me in  
  
I'd get through anything I had to if I've got you  
  
Tell me it's love it's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one  
  
'Cause you know I want nothing else  
Then to have you to myself  
Your love is all I ever knew  
If you feel it let me know the words inside you  
Say I do  
  
Tell me it's love that's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one that's all I want to hear you say  
That we're in love, that you're always gonna feel this way  
No matter what, no matter when  
You know I'd do it all again  
Tell me it's love  
Say I'm the one
