It's the most frightening thing in the world  
It's the scariest sight I've ever seen  
The most chilling visual  
The most terrifying scene  
It's awful, it's crappy, it's monstrous, it's bad  
It's really really huge  
It's a fat man in a Speedo  
I'm walking on a beach in a tropical isle  
Hoping to enjoy the sand and surf  
When I see a mound of baby-oiled flesh  
Rolling and a broiling in the foam  
The only thing that's holding this  
Explosion of Caucasian is  
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread  
I try to sink it in the sand  
And entomb it in a castle but  
It always manages to break free  
The fat man in a Speedo  
I'm having nightmares  
I'm scared to open my eyes  
I try to free myself  
By going to the buffet  
But there he is  
He even eats in his Speedo  
I take up a collection at the bar the next day  
And everybody gives to the cause  
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale  
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk  
We have a celebration  
In one of his indentations  
And throw a bowl of jello in the air  
We think we've escaped and our scenery is clear  
But in comes a plane from Germany  
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos!
