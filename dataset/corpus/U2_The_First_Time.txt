I have a lover  
A lover like no other  
She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul  
And she teach me how to sing  
  
Shows me colors when there's none to see  
Gives me hope when I can't believe  
That for the first time  
I feel love  
  
I have a brother  
When I'm a brother in need  
I spend my whole time running  
He spends his running after me  
  
When I feel myself going down  
I just call and he comes around  
But for the first time  
I feel love  
  
My father is a rich man  
He wears a rich man's cloak  
Gave me the keys to his kingdom coming  
Gave me a cup of gold  
  
He said I have many mansions  
And there are many rooms to see  
But I left by the back door  
And I threw away the key  
And I threw away the key  
Yeah, I threw away the key  
Yeah, I threw away the key  
  
For the first time  
For the first time  
For the first time  
  
I feel love
