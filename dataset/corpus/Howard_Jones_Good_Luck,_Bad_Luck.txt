The film script lies ahead  
Change the future, change the past  
Choose the players, choose the role  
Cast of thousands, cast of few  
Imagination decides the plot  
Play the good guy, play the bad  
Here's the victim, here's the saint  
Here's the canvas, here's the paint  
Good luck bad luck who knows  
Good luck bad luck who knows  
The world is peopled by many winds  
Whirling faster than the wind  
Solving a dilemma of life and death  
Trying to make some sense of it all  
No good blaming the outside world  
Pleasure and pain are in the mind  
Whether we like it or whether we don't  
We found as much as we wanted to find  
Good luck, bad luck who knows  
Good luck, bad luck  
Good luck, bad luck who knows  
Good luck, bad luck  
Good luck, bad luck who knows  
Good luck, bad luck  
We can make it horror we can make it blue  
We can make it slow time, make it move  
The director sits behind those eyes  
Play it straight or in disguise  
Imagination decides the plot  
Play the good guy play the bad  
Here's the victim, here's the saint  
Here's the canvas and here's the paint  
Good luck, good  
Good luck bad luck who knows  
Good luck bad luck who knows?
