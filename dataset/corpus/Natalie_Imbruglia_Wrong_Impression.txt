Calling out, calling out  
Have you ever wondered  
Why I'm always alone when you're in my dreams  
Calling out, calling out  
Have you ever wondered  
What we could have been if you'd only let me in  
  
I want you, but I want you to understand  
I need you I love you  
  
Didn't want to leave you with the wrong impression  
Didn't want to leave you with my last confession,  
Yeah, of love  
Wasn't tryin' to pull you in the wrong direction  
All I want to do is try to make a connection yeah  
  
Fallng out, fallin' out  
Have you ever wondered, if this was ever more  
Than a crazy idea  
Falling out, falling out  
Have you ever wondered  
  
I want you, but I want you to understand  
I need I love you  
  
Didn't want to leave you with the wrong impression  
Didn't want to leave you with my last confession,  
Yeah, of love  
Wasn't tryin' to pull you in the wrong direction  
All I want to do is try to make a connection yeah
