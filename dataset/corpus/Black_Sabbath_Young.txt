(Die young)  
Go to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all,  
Your back's to the wall  
  
Then chase the sun, n it tears away and breaks you as you run, you run, you
run  
  
Behind the smile, there's danger n a promise to be told, you never get old  
Life's fantasy, to be locked away n still you think you're free, you're free,
we're free  
  
So live for today tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young die young  
Can't you see the writting in the air  
Die young gonna die young  
Someone stopped the faith  
  
Go to the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Then chase the sun, n it tears away n it breaks you as you run you run you run  
  
Live for today tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young  
Young  
Die young  
Young die you die young  
Young  
Die young die young die young die young
