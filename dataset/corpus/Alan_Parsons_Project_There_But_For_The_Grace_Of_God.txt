An anthem to the human condition  
  
Lead vocal: john miles  
  
What kind of madness rule the world today  
What earthly reason holding sway  
There is no heaven at all  
For some may weep  
And some may sleep  
While some may rise  
And some may fall  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go I  
  
And so we live in lives of fantasy  
And dream of dreams that hold the key  
And we follow like sheep  
We thread the path  
That leads to thee  
We seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go i
