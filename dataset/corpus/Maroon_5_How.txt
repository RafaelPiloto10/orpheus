I have been searching for your touch  
Unlike any touch I've ever known  
  
And I never thought about you much  
Till I'm broken down and all alone  
  
No I don't understand the meaning of love  
I do not mind if I die trying, oh  
  
Took you for granted  
When you lifted me up  
  
I'm asking for your help  
I am going through hell  
Afraid nothing can save me  
But the sound of your voice  
  
You cut out all the noise  
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly, now  
I'd kill if I could take you back  
But how?  
But how?  
  
I can feel it in my guts  
What's going on with him now  
  
Don't patronize me with lies  
I'ma man, be a woman now  
  
I have been bound by the shackles of love  
And I don't mind if I die tied up  
  
Took you for granted  
When you lifted me up  
  
I'm asking for your help  
I am going through hell  
Afraid nothing can save me  
But the sound of your voice  
  
You cut out all the noise  
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now  
I'd kill if I could take you back  
But how?  
But how?  
But how?  
But how?  
  
Why must we be so ugly  
And please do not speak ill of me  
Why does the one you love  
Become the one who makes you want to cry  
  
And why?  
Why?  
Why?  
  
No I don't understand the meaning of love  
I do not mind if I die trying  
I do not mind if I die trying  
I do not mind if I die trying
