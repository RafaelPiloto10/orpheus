Is, this love  
Feeling restless inside  
Wanting you  
To always be my side  
I don't even want you out of my side  
You are in my thoughts all day and night  
I can't get you out of my mind  
I think I'm in love  
  
I think I'm in love  
Think I'm in love with you  
Every single day  
Every single night  
Every single moment of my life  
I want to spend them all with you  
I think I'm in love  
I think I'm in love  
I think I'm in love with you  
Tell me that you care  
Tell me please  
Tell me that you also feel  
The way that I do  
  
Can't describe  
Words are just not enough  
Can't explain  
It all happened so fast  
What exactly am I feeling right now  
If this is love I got to know somehow  
Just how long this madness will last  
'Cause I think I'm in love  
  
I think I'm in love  
Think I'm in love with you  
Every single day  
Every single night  
Every single moment of my life  
I want to spend them all with you  
I think I'm in love  
I think I'm in love  
I think I'm in love with you  
Tell me that you care  
Tell me please  
Tell me that you also feel  
The way that I do  
  
I think I'm in love  
Think I'm in love with you  
Every single day  
Every single night  
Every single moment of my life  
I want to spend them all with you  
I think I'm in love  
I think I'm in love  
I think I'm in love with you  
Tell me that you care  
Tell me please  
Tell me that you also feel  
The way that I do  
  
Oh ah
