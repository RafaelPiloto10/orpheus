I was born a travelin' man, that's all Ill ever be  
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free  
My father was a trucker for the years of 23  
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me  
  
I'm a travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man  
That's what I am  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
No woman puts a hold on me  
You'll see me once or maybe twice  
That's all you'll see of me  
All you pretty women lord, I hope you understand  
Don't be a fool lord no, and put your heart in a travelin' man  
  
I'm a travelin' man  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Guess Ill always be  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
But at least I'm free  
  
Travelin' man  
Oh, that's what I am  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am, lord I move so fast  
I have had so many women, none of them have last  
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound  
Always free, sometimes lonely. always movin around  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
Oh, that's what I am
