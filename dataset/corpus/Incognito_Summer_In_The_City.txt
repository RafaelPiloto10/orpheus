Hot town, summer in the city, back of my neck getting dirty and gritty  
Been down, isn't it a pity, doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around, people looking half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head  
  
But at night it's a different world, so nice just to be a girl  
Come on and dance all night despite the heat it will be alright  
And baby, don't you know it's a pity  
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer  
In the city, in the summer, in the city  
  
Cool town, evening in the city, dressing so fine and looking so pretty  
Cool cat, looking for a kitty, gonna look in every corner of the city  
Till I'm wheezing just like a bus stop  
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop  
  
But at night it's a different world, so nice just to be a girl  
Come on and dance all night despite the heat it will be alright  
And baby, don't you know it's a pity  
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer  
In the city, in the summer, in the city
