( seger )  
I still remember, it was autumn and the moon was shining  
Our '60 cadillac was rolling through nebraska whining  
Doing a hundred-twenty, man the fields was bending over  
Hauling up for the mountains knowing we was traveling further  
All our fires were blazing and the spinning wheels were turning, turning  
Had my girl beside me, brother, brother, she was burning, burning  
I walked up back to speak to this southern funky school teacher  
She had a lot of something heavy but we couldn't reach her  
We told her that we needed something that would get us going  
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showing  
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up  
The cop came busting in and then we lit out in a pickup truck  
Go! get out of denver, better go, go  
Get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver, better go, go  
Get out of denver  
'cause you look just like a commie and you might just be a member  
Better get out of denver, better get out of denver  
Well, red lights were flashing and the sirens they were screaming  
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreaming  
Made it to lovely pass in under less than half an hour  
Lord, it started drizzling and it turned into a thundershower  
Well, red lights were flashing and the sirens they were screaming  
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreaming  
Made it to lovely pass in under less than half an hour  
Lord, it started drizzling and it turned into a thundershower  
The rain was driving but the caddy kept on burning rubber  
We kept on driving 'til we ran into some fog cover  
We couldn't see a thing but somehow we just kept on going  
We kept on driving all night long and then into the morning  
Morning fog had lifted when we looked to see where we was at  
We're staring at a colorado state policeman trooper cat  
Go! get out of denver, better go, go  
Get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver  
'cause you look just like a commie and you might just be a member  
Better get out of denver, better get out of denver  
Better go! get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver, better go  
Get out of denver  
'cause you look just like a commie and you might just be a member  
Better get out of denver, better get out of denver  
Better go!  
Get out of denver, better get out of denver  
Better get out of denver, better....go!  
Get out of denver , better go, get out of denver  
Better get out, get out, get out  
Get out of denver  
Better go, get out of denver better go get out of denver  
Better, better  
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out
