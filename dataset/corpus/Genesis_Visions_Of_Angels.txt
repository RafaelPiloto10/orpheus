Standing in a forest gazing at the sun  
Looking at the trees but there's not even one  
See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by  
Run to feel its comfort but the water's dry.  
  
I see her face and run to take her hand  
Why she's never there I just don't understand  
The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.  
  
As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love  
For the fragile beauty of our lives must fade  
Though I once remember echoes of my youth  
Now I sense no past, no love that ends in love  
  
Take this dream the stars have filled with light  
As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees  
In vengeance to a god no-one can reach  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.  
  
Ice is moving and the world's begun to freeze  
See the sunlight stopped and deadned by the breeze  
Minds are empty bodies more insensitive  
Some believe that when they die they really live  
  
I believe there never is an end  
God gave up the world its people long ago  
Why she's never there I still don't understand  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky.  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye.
