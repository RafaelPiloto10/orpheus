[Hook:]  
I'm a dog, she a dog too  
If he a shooter, I'm a shooter too  
I'm a trap nigga, who are you?  
Is you mad, cause I'm flexing all on you?  
Who the hell? [x3]  
Got me fucked up  
Who the hell? [x3]  
Got me fucked up  
  
[Verse 1: Quavo]  
Bitch  
Who the hell are you?  
I'm a dog she a dog too  
We know that she fucking the team  
Man the whole crew  
I'm a fucking fool if I put cuffs on you  
Who the hell?  
Bet he got trap spots  
No bandos, and I can't tell...  
Who the hell say I ain't whipping a bale?  
My niggas be kicking the doors  
And running from 12  
Fish scales  
Pockets deep like water wells

[Verse 2: Offset]  
I got bombs no Osama  
President rollie, Obama  
Forty pornos  
You can see my diamonds  
From cross the corner  
Death before dishonor  
Middle finger, fuck the your honor  
Concrete jungle  
If you fumble  
Eat you up like piranhas  
Who the hell?  
Said I won't pull out that chopper  
And aim it at your turtle shell  
I know that you snitching  
You a informant for 12  
My niggas they trained to kill  
We got bananas  
You know they gone peel
