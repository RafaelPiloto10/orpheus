When she calls my name  
Nobody says it quite the same  
Gives me a feeling I never knew  
Makes me so happy loving her  
Love and love alone  
I'd wait a life just to have it here  
Love is all I know and that can't be wrong  
It's sometimes hard to see  
Love isn't bought well it's got to be  
There for a reason you want to share  
To show somebody you care  
Love and love alone  
Conquers the world that can be so cold  
Love is how we show just what we feel  
It's enough for me can't say I need anything else  
Love is here to be had by us all  
Don't cheat yourself  
I can say it now  
Someday we'll all be there somehow  
Everyone singing, love leads the way  
'Til then I'm counting every day  
Love and love alone  
I'd wait a life just to have it here  
Love is all I know and that can't be wrong
