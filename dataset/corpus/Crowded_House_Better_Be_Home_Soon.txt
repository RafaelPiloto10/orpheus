Somewhere deep inside, something's got a hold on you  
And it's pushing me aside, see it stretch on forever  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
  
Stripping back the coats of lies and deception  
Back to nothingness like a week in the desert  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
  
So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong  
'Cause when you get back home maybe I'll be gone, oh  
  
It would cause me pain if we were to end it  
But I could start again, you can depend on it  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
Oh, that's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon
