[Verse 1]  
Little light shining  
Little light will guide them to me  
My face is all lit up  
My face is all lit up  
  
[Chorus 1]  
If they find me racing white horses  
They'll not take me for a buoy  
Let me be weak, let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ooh, I'll wake up to any sound of engines  
Every gull a seeking craft  
I can't keep my eyes open  
Wish I had my radio  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I'd tune into some friendly voices  
Talking 'bout stupid things  
I can't be left to my imagination  
Let me be weak, let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
[Outro]  
Ooh, their breath is warm  
And they smell like sleep  
And they say they take me home  
Like poppies, heavy with seed  
They take me deeper and deeper
