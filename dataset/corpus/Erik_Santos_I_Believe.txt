I believe we'll be together  
And we can be one again  
I believe in the end it's still you and I  
'Coz you've been the best lover and friend  
Deep in my heart I know that  
You never meant to walk away  
And I know you wanted to stay  
  
Chorus:  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe  
  
I believe one day you'll wake-up  
And you will be missing me  
And I know that you will come back  
Oh, come back to the one you really love  
And when that day comes  
I'll take you in my arms again  
And never ever let you go  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Deep in my heart I know that  
You never meant to walk away  
And I know you wanted to stay  
  
Repeat chorus (2x)  
  
And I believe
