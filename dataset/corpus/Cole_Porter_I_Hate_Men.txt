I hate men  
I can't abide 'em even now and then  
  
Than ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather  
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother  
Of course, I'm awfully glad that mother deemed to marry father  
But I hate men  
  
Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy  
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy  
He may have hair upon his chest but, sister, so has Lassie  
Oh, I hate men  
  
I hate men  
They should be kept like piggies in a pen  
  
Don't wed a trav'ling salesman though a tempting Tom he may be  
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby  
While he's away in Mandalay it is thee who have the baby  
Oh, I hate men  
  
If thou shouldst wed a businessman, be wary, oh, be wary  
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business necessary  
His business is the business with his pretty secretary  
Oh, I hate men  
  
I hate men  
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen  
  
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism  
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism  
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism  
Oh, I hate men  
  
From all I've read alone in bed, from A to Z, about them  
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout them  
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without them?  
Still, I hate men
