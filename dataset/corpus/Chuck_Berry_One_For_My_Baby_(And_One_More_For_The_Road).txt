It's quarter to three and there's no one in the place except you and me  
So set 'em up Joe, I got a little story you ought to know  
We're drinkin' my friend on to the end of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
I got the routine, gonna drop another quarter in this machine  
Feelin' so bad, I got to have the music dreamy and sad  
I could tell you a lot but you have got to be true to your code  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
Joe you'd never know it but I'm a kind of poet  
And I got a lot of things to say  
But when I'm gloomy just listen to me until it's all talked away  
  
Well, that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close  
Thanks, thanks for the cheer, hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear  
The torch that I found must be drowned or soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
One more for the road
