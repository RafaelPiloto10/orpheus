Let the sky fall  
Let the sea sink  
Let the earth shake  
Let the sun blink  
Let the universe  
Go spinning free  
If my darling  
Ever leaves me  
  
Let the air freeze  
Let the moon cry  
Let the stars go out  
Let the world die  
Let the eyes go blind  
Let the grass turn blue  
If I ever  
Think of leaving you  
  
Let our love be  
With our minds free  
Let our hearts beat  
Let our eyes see  
Let the universe  
Share our love  
Let me be  
What you're thinking of
