I've seen the lightning leave me  
My baby just can't take  
Her eyes off me  
  
Chorus:  
Don't blame it on sunshine  
Don't blame it on moonlight  
Don't blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Don't blame it on sunshine  
Don't blame it on moonlight  
Don't blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
I just can't  
I just can't  
I just can't control my feet  
  
I just can't  
I just can't  
I just can't control my feet  
  
I just can't  
I just can't  
I just can't control my feet  
  
I just can't  
I just can't  
I just can't control my feet  
  
Chorus:  
Don't blame it on sunshine  
Don't blame it on moonlight  
Don't blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Don't blame it on sunshine  
Don't blame it on moonlight  
Don't blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
The magic music grooves me  
The dirty rhythm moves me  
The devil's gotten to me  
Through his dance  
  
I'm full of funky fever  
And fire burns inside me  
Boogies got me in a  
Super trance  
  
Chorus:  
Don't blame it on sunshine  
Don't blame it on moonlight  
Don't blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Don't blame it on sunshine  
Don't blame it on moonlight  
Don't blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Sunshine  
Moonlight  
Goodtimes  
Boogie  
  
Sunshine  
Moonlight  
Goodtimes  
Boogie  
  
Don't you blame it - sunshine  
You just got to - moonlight  
You just want to - goodtimes  
Yeah - boogie  
Blame it on yourself - sunshine  
Ain't nobody's fault - moonlight  
But yours and that boogie - goodtimes  
Dancin' all night long - boogie  
  
Yours and that boogie - sunshine  
Ain't nobody's fault - moonlight  
But yours and that boogie - goodtimes  
Dancin' all night long - boogie
