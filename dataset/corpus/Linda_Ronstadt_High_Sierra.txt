I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
The way I feel, can't explain  
So much passion turned to pain  
The sun still shines most of the time  
Did you know the sun shines when it rains  
  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
I've been cussed and I've been praised  
And I've been nothing these days  
But I'll come back, time will see  
If I'm wrong about you, right about me  
  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
Wrong about you, right about me  
Wrong about you, right about me
