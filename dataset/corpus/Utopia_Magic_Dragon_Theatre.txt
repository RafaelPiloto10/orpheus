Look at all the advertising  
Some kind of show, come if you're going  
Patronize the magic dragon  
Walk through the door, kiss off your boredom  
  
Tuning up the orchestra, bringing down the ceiling lights  
All at once the curtain goes up  
Now it begins, strike up the band  
Bring on the dancing girls and the freak parade  
  
Look to your right where a gentleman sat  
There sits a monkey in a tall silk hat  
The lady on the left is now a pumpkin pie  
That's when you notice that your chair is flying  
  
High in the sky out over the sea  
But don't wonder why, where else could you be but  
  
Where anything can happen,  
Down at the magic dragon theater  
More than you can imagine,  
Down at the magic dragon theater  
  
(come to the magic dragon)  
Do you fancy melodrama?  
Tragedy's mask, yours for the asking  
Madness a la magic dragon  
  
Who could that be at this time of night?  
I'm sure we weren't followed dr. klang  
Wait, pull down your knickers, he's going to hit us  
Here goes your cue, don't blow your line  
Dam, danger! I'm gonna go out there and get, get, get ...  
  
All of a sudden there's a flash of light  
Stars begin appearing in a moonlit night  
Your vision of reality has gone awry  
That's when you notice that your mind is flying  
High in the sky out over the sea  
But don't wonder why, where else could you be but
