i like the way you wanted me  
every night for so long baby  
and i like the way you needed me  
every time things got rocky  
(ah ah ah ah)  
i was believing in you  
(ah ah ah ah)  
was i mistaken  
do you say  
do you say what you mean  
i want our love to last forever  
but i'd rather you be mean  
than love and lie  
i'd rather hear the truth  
and have to say goodbye  
i'd rather take a blow  
at least then i would know  
but baby don't you break my heart slow  
no
