At my window  
Watching the sun go  
Hoping the stars know  
It's time to shine  
Daydreams  
Aloft on dark wings  
Soft as the sun streams  
At days decline  
  
Living is laughing  
Dying says nothing at all  
Baby and I are laying here  
Watching the evening fall  
  
Time flows  
Through brave beginnings  
And she leaves her endings  
Beneath our feet  
Walk lightly  
Upon their faces  
Leave gentle traces  
Upon their sleep  
  
Living is dancing  
Dying does nothing at all  
Baby and I are laying here  
Watching the evening fall  
  
Three dimes  
Hard luck and good times  
Fast lines and low rhymes  
Ain't much to say  
Feel fine  
Feel low and lazy  
Feel grey and hazy  
Feel far away  
  
Living is sighing  
Dying ain't flying so high  
Baby and I are lying here  
Watching the day go by
