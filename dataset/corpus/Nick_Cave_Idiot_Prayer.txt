They're taking me down, my friend  
And as they usher me off to my end  
Will I bid you adieu?  
Or will I be seeing you soon?  
If what they say around here is true  
Then we'll meet again  
Me and you  
  
My time is at hand, my dove  
They're gonna pass me to that house above  
Is heaven just for victims, dear?  
Where only those in pain go?  
Well it takes two to tango  
We will meet again, my love  
I know  
  
If you're in heaven then you'll forgive me, dear  
Because that's what they do up there  
If you're in hell, then what can I say  
You probably deserved in anyway  
I guess I'm gonna find out any day  
For we'll meet again  
And there'll be hell to pay  
  
Your face comes to me from the depths, dear  
Your silent mouth mouths, 'yes', dear  
Dark red and big with blood  
They're gonna shut me down, my love  
They're gonna launch me into the stars  
Well, all things come to pass  
Glory hallelujah  
  
This prayer is for you, my love  
Sent on the wings of a dove  
An idiot prayer of empty words  
Love, dear, is strictly for the birds  
We each get what we deserve  
My little snow white dove  
Rest assured
