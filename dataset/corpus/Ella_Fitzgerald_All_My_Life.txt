All my life  
I've been waiting for you  
My wonderful one  
I've begun  
Living all my life  
  
All my love  
Has been waiting for you  
My life is sublime  
Now that I'm  
Giving all my love  
  
You seem so lovely, so far above me  
I'm almost afraid to look  
But I adore you, I pledge before you  
A heart that's an open book  
  
All my life  
Hold me close to your heart  
But all else above  
Hold my love  
Darling, just hold my love
