And there I stood, just like a soldier  
I was tough, until I saw her  
I said hello, but she just turned away  
  
Hey romeo, whatcha doin with my girl,  
Who are you using now, well I turn and walk away (turn and walk away)  
  
Im gonna please her, now you can believe it  
Ill be there to catch her when she falls  
  
Oooo, here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im a man (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Here we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)  
So run if you can cause you know  
Im a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
  
Im on the outside, looking inside  
Youre with him, whos on the wrong side now  
Do you still think of me  
  
Ive tried to call, but no one answers  
Two silhouettes, a private dancer  
Lights go dim, as the music starts to fade, away (turn and walk away)  
  
Im the one who needs you, now you can believe it  
Ill be there to catch you when you fall  
  
Ooo you better believe Im the man (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)  
And we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)  
So run if you can cause you know  
Im a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
  
Solo  
  
Ooohh  
And when I hold out my hands Ill be reaching for you  
I give it all that Ive got, thats all I can do  
When youre waiting for love  
Ill be waiting for you (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Only for you (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Oh baby for you (on the edge of a broken heart)  
So run if you can, you know  
Im a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (of a broken, broken, broken broken, broken, broken, broken)
