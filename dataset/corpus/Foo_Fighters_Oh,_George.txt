The train that I got onto up and left that town  
Threw it up as it went down  
Strange enough it left me rude and turned around  
Watched as they all took their vows  
  
Fools were drawing trying to save that day  
I don't doubt that anyway  
  
Phase it out until the older ones return  
Have a seat and watch it burn  
Trace around the corner this is what I've learned  
Always waited for my turn
