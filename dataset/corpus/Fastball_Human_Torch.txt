Turned 'round 6 o'clock and I'm still sleepin'  
I don't have to work on Saturday  
But I do anyway  
'Round the corner right on up to the shop  
I come creeping, but it don't matter anyway  
  
'Cause I know it's just as well  
And even so I feel like hell  
You can say that it's alright  
But I am wrapped up tight  
And I can see the forest through the trees  
I am on my knees  
I don't know if I am supposed to stay  
Or I'm supposed to leave it all behind  
  
The door the world outside still spins  
Waiting there behind the door but I won't let it in  
Not today, not tomorrow, not next week  
You're just gonna have to pay five bucks to see the geek  
  
'Cause I know it's just as well  
And even so I feel like hell  
You can say that it's alright  
But I am wrapped up tight  
And I can see the forest through the trees  
I am on my knees  
I don't know if I am supposed to stay  
Or I'm supposed to leave it all behind  
  
Please pay your attention high above the center ring  
Up in the rafters, 500 feet above the crowd  
My hair is soaked in kerosene  
My clothes are wet with gasoline  
You only get to see this once  
The human torch is going down  
Going down, going down, going down
