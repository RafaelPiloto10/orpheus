CHORUS:  
While the poor people sleepin'  
With the shade on the light  
While the poor people sleepin'  
All the stars come out at night  
After closing time  
At the Guernsey Fair  
I detect the El Supremo  
From the room at the top of the stairs  
Well I've been around the world  
And I've been in the Washington Zoo  
And in all my travels  
As the facts unravel  
I've found this to be true  
  
CHORUS  
  
They got the house on the corner  
With the rug inside  
They got the booze they need  
All that money can buy  
They got the shapely bods  
They got the Steely Dan T-shirt  
And for the coup-de-gras  
They're outrageous  
  
CHORUS  
  
Show biz kids making movies  
Of themselves you know they  
Don't give a fuck about anybody else  
  
CHORUS
