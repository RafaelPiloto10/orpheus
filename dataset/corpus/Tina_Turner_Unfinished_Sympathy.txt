Baby, baby, baby  
I know that I've been mad in love before  
But how I can be with you  
You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby  
How could you have a day without a night?  
You're the book that I have opened  
And now I've gotten no much more  
Baby, baby  
The curiousness of your potential kiss  
Has got my mind and body aching  
You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby  
How could you have a day without a night?  
You're the book that I have opened  
And now I've gotten no much more, ohh  
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missing every part, hey yeah  
Hey  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missin' every part  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missin' every part  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missin' every part  
You really hurt me baby, you really hurt me baby  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
I'm missin' every part  
Ohh hey
