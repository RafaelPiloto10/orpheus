Your eternal word formed the universe  
And You speak to me whisper I'm your greatest love  
You're the saving Lord, beauty in a storm  
Everything I need more than I could ever want  
You are my heart's desire  
And I have fallen to the point of no return  
More than my heart could know  
More than in love with you  
You're the saving Lord, beauty in a storm  
Everything I need more than I could ever want  
You are my heart's desire  
And I have fallen to the point of no return  
More than my heart could know  
More than in love with you  
You are my heart's desire  
And I have fallen to the point of no return  
More than my heart could know  
More than in love with you, with you  
You are my heart's desire  
And I have fallen to the point of no return  
More than my heart could know  
More than in love with you
