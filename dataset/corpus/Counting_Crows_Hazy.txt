When you disapear on me it's like parades in the rain,  
Every time I see you, you just disapear again.  
Every time your leavin' I don't know what to say.  
I wanna see all that damn go away.  
  
So would you tell me, why your leavin'  
'Cause' I don't know why it has to be so.  
So could you tell me? Why your leavin'?  
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  
  
All this everlasting love songs, come into my eyes.  
Every time I see you. I'm alive. I'm alive.  
  
So could you tell me, why your leavin'  
'Cause I don't know why it has to be so.  
So could you tell me? Why your leavin'?  
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know
