Vince  
When I fall, you're my place to land.  
I lose my touch, you're my hands,  
The one I hold on to.  
If you run out of reason to try  
I'll love enough for both you and I  
I'll be the one you can run to.  
Barbra  
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through  
Than to spend one day without you by my side.  
Both  
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?  
If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too.  
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.  
My love's inside you, even more than you know.  
  
Barbra  
In a world of anger and lies  
I find peace in your eyes  
A flame in the darkness.  
  
Both  
Ooh, And through all space and time  
'Til every star refuses to shine  
  
Barbra  
You know where my heart is.  
I'd rather go through any pain love puts us through  
  
Both  
Than to spend one day without you by my side  
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?  
If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too, Woah.  
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.  
  
Barbra  
Where you may go  
  
Both  
My love's inside you, even more than you know.  
  
And I can't remember life without you  
The way it used to be  
Feels like a million years away.  
  
Vince  
Well Hold me 'til the angels sing.  
  
Barbra  
Tell me every little thing.  
  
Both  
Promise me forever from this day  
  
If you ever leave me, will you take me with you?  
If you're ever lonely, I want to be lonely too, Woah.  
My home's beside you, no matter where you may go.  
  
Vince  
Where you may go  
  
Both  
My love's inside you, even more than you know.  
  
Barbra  
Even more than you know.  
  
Vince  
Even more than you know.  
  
Both  
Even more than you know.  
Even more than you know.
