Here I am  
Writing my last song for you  
Hear the words carefully  
And you'll see it's you  
I'm leaving  
Don't want to be the one to tell you  
That I can't stay another day  
  
I'll throw the pages on the floor  
I'm starting over like before  
I'll change this stupid ending  
And stay with you forever more  
But when I'm lying next to you  
It's hard to bargain with the truth  
Cause when you know the love is gone  
The time has come to write your last song  
  
There you are  
Smiling at me from the next room  
Beautiful as the first day I met you  
And I'm so sorry  
I couldn't be the one to love you  
The way that you deserve to be  
  
I'll throw the pages on the floor  
I'm starting over like before  
I'll change this stupid ending  
And stay with you forever more  
But when I'm lying next to you  
It's hard to bargain with the truth  
Cause when you know the love is gone  
The time has come to write your last song  
  
It's hard to think of you and I  
As total strangers  
I've lived this last goodbye  
A million times or more in my mind  
My mind, my mind  
  
Oh and I'm gonna miss you  
But I can't go back  
Even just to kiss you  
Cause I can't exist  
Just living a lie  
Gotta lot of love to give  
You know before I die  
And as I watch you  
Sing along  
It's killing me to know  
That it's your last song
