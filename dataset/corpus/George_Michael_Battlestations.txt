You ask too much of me  
You try my patience  
Your tongue - it's like a razor  
You choose your words like weapons  
Here we go - battlestations  
  
I never have the guts to let you look inside  
I don't think you'd appreciate the things that I hide  
  
Chorus:  
Monday was the worst day  
And friday wasn't my day  
But wednesday was the best day  
Because on wednesday night we made love  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(than we ever do in bed)  
  
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone  
Are you standing there?  
But - you won't pick up the 'phone  
Why lie to my face?  
(when you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place)  
  
Today I did something I thought I'd never do  
I opened up your diary and read about you  
  
Chorus  
  
Monday was the worst day  
Wednesday we made love  
And friday - ooh but -  
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of  
Come in baby- come in close  
(take off your designer clothes)  
Cause you know what I'm thinking of  
Do you remember me, do you remember us -  
Do you remember love?  
  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(than we ever do in bed)  
  
La premiere fois tu m'as fait beaucoup rire  
Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais du piano  
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami c'est l'argent  
Au revoir, cheri  
Au revoir, mon amour
