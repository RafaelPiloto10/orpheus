(Iron Maiden)  
  
Life in a city living in L. A.  
Is a long way from Huddersfield town  
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven  
But that's where he get's his pork pie  
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy  
Rugby and cricket's unknown  
Baseball and football they're making him lazy  
Your fan club says "Rodney come home"  
  
[Chorus:]  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
Look down on Hollywood Hills  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels  
  
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels  
The Nautilus rusts in the yard  
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning  
He'll always live in L. A.  
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket  
And never comes out to pay bills  
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker  
And he always cheats when he deals  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
(Rodney's rap)  
Hello, let me introduce meself!  
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.  
When I were a lad, I could lift up five  
Navies on an end of a shovel.  
The reason I never took martial arts because  
I was immensely fearsome and  
I'd probably kill everybody  
I came into contact with it.  
I was phenomenally strong.  
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,  
Is what makes the world rotate.  
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield  
But I don't live there anymore.  
I live in Los Angeles.  
It's great!... I think  
  
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed  
To wrench himself up in the morn'  
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed  
You'll wish you'd never been born.  
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead  
He slumbers for most of the day  
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast  
Your problem Rodney L. A.  
  
(repeat chorus)
