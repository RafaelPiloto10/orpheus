They used to tell me I was building a dream  
And so I followed the mob  
When their was earth to plow or guns to bear  
I was always their right on the job  
  
They used to tell me I was building a dream  
With peace and glory ahead  
Why should I be standing in line  
Just waiting for bread?  
  
Once I built a railroad, I made it run  
Made it race against time  
Once I built a railroad, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime?  
  
Once I built a tower up to the sun  
Brick and rivet and lime  
Once I built a tower, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime?  
  
Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell  
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dumb  
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell  
And I was the kid with the drum  
  
Say, don't you remember, they called me "Al"  
It was "Al" all the time  
Why don't you remember, I'm your pal  
Say buddy, can you spare a dime?  
  
Once in khaki suits, ah gee we looked swell  
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dumb  
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell  
And I was the kid with the drum  
  
Oh, say, don't you remember, they called me "Al"  
It was "Al" all the time  
Say, don't you remember, I'm your pal  
Buddy, can you spare a dime?
