Warm winds blowin'  
Heat 'n' blue sky  
And a road that goes  
Forever...  
  
Been thinkin' 'bout it lately  
Been watchin' some TV  
Been lookin' all around me  
and what has come to be  
Been talkin' to my neighbor  
And he agrees with me...  
It's all gone crazy  
  
Well, my wife returns from takin'  
My little girl to school, she got  
Beads of perspiration  
As she tries to keep her cool  
She says "Unless it don't get no better,  
there's gonna come a day,  
someone's gonna get killed out there"  
And I turn to her and say, "Texas"  
She says "What?"  
"They got big long roads out there".  
  
Warm winds blowin'  
Heat 'n' blue sky  
And a road that goes  
Forever...  
I'm goin' to Texas. (one,two,three)...  
  
We gotta get outta here  
We gotta get outta here  
  
Well I got a little brother  
Several meters high  
Yeah, he's built just like a quarterback  
And he swears he'll testify.  
He says he's been to Texas  
And that's the only place to be  
Big stakes, big cars, no trouble here  
That's the place for me  
I'm going to Texas (yeah, yeah)  
I'm going to Texas (yeah, yeah)  
I'm going to Texas  
  
Watch me walkin'  
Watch me walkin'  
Watch me walkin'
