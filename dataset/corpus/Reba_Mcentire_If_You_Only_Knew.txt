So here you are again  
Standing at my door  
You know I'd understand  
Well that's what friends are for  
  
What's he done this time  
What did he say  
To make you so darn mad  
That you're running away  
Now you say you want to be like me  
Independent and free  
  
[Chorus]  
But if you only knew  
What a single girl goes through  
The long working days and the lonely nights  
The empty I love yous  
Oh if you only knew what it's like to be alone  
You'd put your anger down  
Turn around and go back home  
  
My life looks good to you  
I'm always in control  
No one to answer to  
But no one there to hold  
You see in my eyes you are the lucky one  
With loving arms that you can lean upon  
I'd give anything I could to say  
What you're throwing away  
  
Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know it's hard to face that love ain't perfect everyday  
But I know a hundred girls who would gladly take your place  
  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'd put your anger down  
Turn around and go back home  
If you only knew
