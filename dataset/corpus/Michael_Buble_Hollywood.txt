Could you be a teenage idol  
Could you be a movie star  
When I turn on my TV  
Will you smile and wave at me  
Tellin' Oprah who you are is strange  
So you want to be a rock star  
With blue eyed bunny's in your bed  
Well remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this,  
You'll be famous 'cause you're dead.  
  
So don't go higher for desire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
  
I don't want to take you dancing  
When you're dancing with the world  
Well you can flash your caviar and your million dollar car  
I don't need that kind of girl  
But you could be that next sensation  
Or will you set the latest style  
You don't need a catchy song  
'Cause the kids will sing along  
When you shoot it with a smile  
  
So don't go higher for desire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
  
So don't fly higher, for your fire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
Keep it on your head Hollywood is dead.  
  
Well you can do the mighty tango  
You can strut your little thing  
You can swing from vine to vine  
While the kiddies wait in line  
With the money in their hands  
  
But if you get to California  
Save a piece of gold for me  
If it's the only thing you'll save  
Then I'll bet you'll never wave when I watch you on tv.  
  
So don't go higher for desire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead you can find it in yourself.  
  
So don't fly higher, for your fire  
Put it in your head  
Baby Hollywood is dead  
You can find it in yourself.  
  
Keep on loving what is true and the world will come to you,  
You can find it in yourself  
Love what is true and the world will come to you,  
You can find it in yourself  
  
No no no no no  
Keep it in your head, Hollywood is dead  
Come, come Hollywood is dead babe woo hoo  
Oh Hollywood is dead yeah yeah  
Oh Hollywood is dead babe woo hoo  
Keep on loving what is true and the world will come to you,  
Hollywood is dead, get it in your head, Hollywood is dead
