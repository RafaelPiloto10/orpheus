Ooh, I like it  
You call me up and treat me like a dog  
You call me up and tear me up inside  
You've got me on a lead  
Ooh, you bring me down  
You shout around  
You don't believe that I'm alone  
Ooh, you don't believe me  
  
Sweet lady  
Sweet lady  
Sweet lady sweet lady...ooh, stay sweet  
  
You say  
"You call me up and feed me all the lines  
"You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese  
"Waiting on the shelf  
"You eat me up  
"You hold me down  
"I'm just a fool to make you a home  
"Ooh, you really do me  
  
"When you say  
"Sweet lady (sweet lady)  
"Sweet lady (sweet lady)  
"Sweet lady...ooh, come on, stay sweet"  
  
My sweet lady  
Though it seems like we wait forever - oo ah oo  
Stay sweet baby  
Believe and we've got everything we need (got everything we need)  
Ow  
  
Sweet lady  
Sweet lady  
Sweet lady...ooh, ooh, stay sweet, stay sweet  
Oh runaway, come on, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, sweet lady  
Wooh
