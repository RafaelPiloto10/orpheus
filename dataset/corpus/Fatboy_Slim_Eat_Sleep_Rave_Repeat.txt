Then get the fuck out of my restaurant

And like a general feeling of happiness  
And he was like no that fucking song man

And I order some food  
Suddenly it was tomorrow  
And then tomorrow was today  
And then I found this club  
And I went into the club  
And the club was banging  
And the music was like really loud  
And I was raving
