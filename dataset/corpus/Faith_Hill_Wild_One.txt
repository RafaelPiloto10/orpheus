They said change your clothes,  
She said no I won't,  
They said comb your hair,  
She said some kids don't,  
And her parents dreams went up in smoke.  
  
They said you can't leave,  
She said yes I will,  
They said don't see him,  
She said his name is Bill,  
She's on a roll and it's all uphill.  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
She's a wild one,  
Runnin' free.  
  
She loves rock and roll,  
They said it's satan's tongue,  
She thinks they're too old,  
They think she's too young,  
And the battle lines are clearly drawn.  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
She's a wild one,  
Runnin' free.  
  
She has future plans,  
And dreams at night,  
They tell her life's too hard,  
She says that's all right, yeah,  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
She's a wild one,  
Runnin' free.
