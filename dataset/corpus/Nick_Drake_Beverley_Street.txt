A crowded room on Beverley  
A party for the rent  
You were sitting casually  
With a few of your fabulous friends  
I asked you what your name was  
But you just turned and laughed  
Then a little later  
I finally caught your eye  
And even though you tried so hard  
You couldn't hide your smile  
I followed you downstairs  
And we talked for a long long time  
  
Would you call that love  
Who's to say  
I don't know much about love  
But you're the best I ever had  
  
It wasn't long before you changed  
Your phone number to mine  
You said that you were movin' in  
But you needed a little time  
So I kept all your messages  
Til you made up your mind  
Now the rain is fallin' and the clouds are gathering  
And the sun refuse to shine  
Your promises and whispered words  
Are forever on my mind  
And I'm left here smokin' cigarettes  
That you left behind  
  
Would you call that love  
Who's to say  
I don't know much about love  
But you're the best I ever had
