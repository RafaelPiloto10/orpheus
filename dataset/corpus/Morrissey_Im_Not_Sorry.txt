On returning, I can't believe this world is still turning,  
The pressure's on,  
Because the pleasure hasn't gone  
And I'm,  
Not sorry for,  
For the things I've done  
And I'm,  
Not looking for,  
Just anyone  
  
On competing,  
Oh, when will this tired heart stop beating?  
It's all a game,  
Existence is only a game  
And I'm,  
Not sorry for,  
For the things I've done  
And I'm,  
Not looking for,  
Just anyone  
  
I'm,  
Slipping below the water line,  
I'm,  
Slipping below the water line  
Reach for my hand,  
And,  
And the race is won  
Reject my hand,  
And,  
The damage is done  
  
I'm,  
Slipping below the water line  
I'm,  
Slipping below the water line  
  
The woman of my dreams,  
She,  
She never came along  
The woman of my dreams,  
Well,  
There never was one  
  
And I'm,  
Not sorry for,  
For the things I've said  
There's a wild man in my head,  
There's a wild man In my head
