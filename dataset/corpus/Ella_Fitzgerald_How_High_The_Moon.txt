Somewhere there's music  
How faint the tune  
Somewhere there's heaven  
How high the moon  
There is no moon above  
When love is far away too  
Till it comes true  
That you love me as I love you  
  
Somewhere there's heaven  
It's where you are  
Somewhere there's music  
How near, how far  
The darkest night would shine  
If you would come to me soon  
Until you will, how still my heart  
How high the moon  
  
How high the moon  
Is the name of this song  
How high the moon  
Though the words maybe wrong  
We're singin' it because you ask for it  
So we're swingin' it just for you  
  
How high the moon  
Does it touch the stars  
How high the moon  
Does it reach out to mars  
Though the words maybe wrong to this song  
We're askin' how high high high high is the moon  
  
Though the words maybe wrong to that song  
We're askin' how high high high high is the moon
