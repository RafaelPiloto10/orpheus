Five names that I can hardly  
Stand to hear  
Including yours and mine  
And one more chimp who isn't here  
I can see the ladies talking  
How the times are getting hard  
And that fearsome excavation  
On Magnolia Boulevard  
  
[CHORUS:]  
And I'm going insane  
And I'm laughing at the frozen rain  
And I'm so alone  
Honey when they gonna send me home  
Bad sneakers and a Pina Colada  
My friend  
Stompin' on the avenue  
By Radio City with a  
Transistor and a large  
Sum of money to spend  
  
You fellah, you tearin' up the street  
You wear that white tuxedo  
How you gonna beat the heat  
Do you take me for a fool  
Do you think that I don't see  
That ditch out in the valley  
That they're digging just for me  
  
[CHORUS]
