Ain't it true  
No matter what you do  
Someday when life is through  
They're gonna bury you  
Beneath the cold, cold ground, girl  
  
Big or small  
Or short or fat or tall  
It's gonna get us all  
Someday we're gonna fall  
Beneath the cold, cold ground, girl  
  
So you best believe it  
No matter what you do  
Yes, you best believe it  
Ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
  
My poor heart  
Was almost torn apart  
Because you played a part  
You thought that you were smart  
And now you're gone  
Gone, gone, girl  
  
All your life  
You treated me so bad  
You took the love I had  
And left me feeling sad  
But I'll go on, on, on, girl  
  
Cause I know that someday  
Your time will be due  
Yes, you'd best believe it  
Ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true  
  
I don't want to be the one  
To see you in such misery  
Not even for the things  
You went and done, done, done, girl  
  
There is time for  
You to change your mind  
And leave your cheating heart behind  
And turn the righteous kind  
Come back to me, girl  
  
And I will forgive you  
Here's what I'll say  
On that final day  
They lay you away  
There was never another like you  
  
Ain't it true, girl  
Ain't it true, girl  
  
And I will forgive you  
Here's what I'll say  
On that final day  
They lay you away  
There was never another like you  
  
Ain't it true, girl  
Ain't it true, girl
