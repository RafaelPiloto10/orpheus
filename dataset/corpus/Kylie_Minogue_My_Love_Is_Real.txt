Don't ya think it was a good thing baby?  
Don't ya think we nearly got it right?  
We could work to a rhythm baby  
If we come together overnight  
  
My eyes are open and my, my heart is?  
I'll never ever faulter  
You know my love is real  
It's just my situation  
Can't help the way I feel  
No time for contemplation  
You know my love is real
