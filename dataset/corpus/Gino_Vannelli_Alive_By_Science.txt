Respirators, ventilators  
High and holy legislators  
Give me agony, pure agony  
Aah, vegetation, indignation  
Endless one-way conversation  
Ain't living to me, yeah  
And when I lose all my self-reliance  
Don't keep me hooked up to no appliance  
Ooh, don't keep me if you love me  
Don't keep me alive by science  
Alive by science  
And I hear an angel banging on my door  
Big daddy, on the top floor  
Shoutin' free, you gotta be free  
This is my life cest mon affiare  
Fat lady's singin', I don't stand a prayer  
Now, be a love and pull the plug on me  
Now babe, if you be true to our alliance  
Please don't pump my lungs without my compliance  
Yeah, don't keep me  
Oh, don't keep me  
Alive by science  
Alive by science  
Ooh, and when I lose all my self-reliance  
And don't keep me hooked up to no appliance  
Aah yeah, don't keep me  
Yeah, don't keep me  
Alive by science  
Alive by science  
Yeah, I beg you baby, don't keep me  
(Alive by science)  
Baby, don't keep me

Oh, don't baby, don't keep me  
(Alive by science)  
Yeah, oh, baby, don't keep me  
(Alive by science)  
Oh, don't keep me  
(Alive by science)  
Oh, yeah  
Family members mortgage lenders give me agony  
(Alive by science)  
I'm stuck in bed seeing red blood flows but my brain is dead  
(Alive by science)  
To be or not to be  
(Alive by science)  
Baby, don't keep me  
(Alive by science)  
Don't dare and keep me  
(Alive by science)
