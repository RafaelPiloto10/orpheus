Step right up and listen please  
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease  
Everybody gather round all aboard the underground  
You've got to get in before you get out  
And gettin' out is what it's gonna be about  
If you find that you are blind  
Open your bashful mind  
Let my band step inside  
And take you on a cosmic ride  
With honest sounds I'll paint your brain  
For in this song I do proclaim  
That once aboard this moving train  
I'll do my best to ease your pain  
Slinky as my speech may be  
On this trip you'll ride for free  
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily  
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus  
Once aboard and feeling smooth  
Like a liquid you will ooze  
Into a state of mind that soothes  
Aw be my quest inside my grove  
Cause what I've got to give to you  
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm  
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm  
Life's too short to be in a hole  
So bust into your funkiest stroll  
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus  
Take your body shake it around  
Do the dog on the ground  
And if I can't make you dance  
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants  
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
