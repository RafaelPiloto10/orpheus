Been under fire sixteen years, just waitin' for his time to come  
He fought the lies, fought back the tears, can't wait to hear that starting
gun  
There ain't nobody gonna step on his dreams  
So he held his hands high and screamed  
  
[Chorus:]  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, take me far away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
  
He's on the edge, he can feel it in his heart  
This time the pressure's really on  
He's gonna fight it, might even steal a guitar  
This time tomorrow he'll be gone  
There ain't nobody gonna tell him what to do  
Think he's a little like me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's on the run, won't stand for second place, but his turn may never come  
He's not a victim, you can see it in his face  
But he can't see what he's become  
Well, he wants it bad, but he wants no charity  
He seems to think it's his destiny  
  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
  
[Chorus]
