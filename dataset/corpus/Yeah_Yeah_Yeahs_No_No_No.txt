Well I'm frozen like a soldier  
Don't know where it stays all over the place  
Time froze like an ocean  
Don't know the taste of a never ending ache  
  
No no no no  
Why I hurry when I'm home  
I hurry when I'm home, I'll go  
No no no  
Why I hurry when I'm home, I'll go  
Oh I'll go  
  
It's really not bad not worse than you thought  
He'll never come back, he's the man you dropped  
He'll never come back, he's the man you loved  
  
It's really not bad not worse than you thought  
He'll never come back, he's the man you dropped  
He'll never come back, he's the man you loved  
  
I told her, I told her, I told her, I'll go  
I told her, I told her, I told her...  
No no no no no
