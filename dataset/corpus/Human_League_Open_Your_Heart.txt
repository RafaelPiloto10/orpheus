And when it hurts you know they love to tell you  
How they warned you  
They say "Don't be surprised at someone's lies"  
They think they taunt you  
But if you can stand the test  
You know your worst is better than their best  
And so you stand here with the years ahead  
Potentially calling  
With open heart or with a spirit dead  
You walk on  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart  
  
Dare to feel  
Take the chance  
Make the deal  
Being an island  
Shying from trying  
Seems the easy way  
Such an easy way  
But there's no future without tears  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart  
  
But if you can stand the test  
You know your worst is better than their best  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart
