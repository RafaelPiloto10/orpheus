Don't know why but I'm feeling so sad  
I long to try something I never had  
Never had no kissing  
Oh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be  
  
The night is cold and I'm so alone  
I'd give my soul just to call you my own  
Got a moon above me  
But no one to love me  
Lover man, oh, where can you be  
  
I've heard it said  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with a prayer  
That you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
  
Someday we'll meet  
And you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet  
Little things in my ear  
Hugging and a-kissing  
Oh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be
