Come with me come with me now  
Inside the garden  
Inside the garden of God  
Smell the sand it's running through your hands  
It's where we're from  
And where we'll go in the end  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
You gotta spread the  
You gotta spread the seed  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
Sit in the shadow just smell the grass  
Where the past is buried  
Where the future grows so fast  
  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
You gotta spread the  
You gotta spread the seed  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
You touch me so  
You touch me so deep  
I only wish my eyes could see  
The way you feel for me  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
You gotta spread the  
You gotta spread the seed  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
Take my hand  
Make me see
