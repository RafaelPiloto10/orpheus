Papa was a rollin' stone  
  
It was the third of september  
That day i'll always remember, yes I will  
'cause that was the day that my daddy died  
  
Never had a chance to see him, no  
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him  
Mama, i'm depending on you to tell me the truth  
Mama just hung her head and said  
  
Chorus  
"papa was a rollin' stone  
Wherever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died  
All he left us was alone" (repeat)  
  
Hey, mama, is it true what they say  
That papa never worked a day in his life  
Some bad talk going around sayin'  
Papa had there outside children  
And another wife  
That ain't right  
  
Heard some talk about papa and his storefront  
Preachin'  
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time  
Leaching  
And dealing in dirt  
Stealin' in the name of the lord  
  
But mama she just said  
  
Chorus  
  
Say, I heard my papa was a jack of all trades  
Is that what sent papa to an early grave?  
Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal just  
To pay his bills.  
Hey, mama, folks say papa was never much on thinkin'  
Spent most of his time chansin' women and drinkin'  
But mother, i'm depending on you to tell me the  
Truth  
  
But my mama she just said  
  
Chorus(2x)
