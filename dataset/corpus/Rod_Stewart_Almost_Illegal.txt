Yeah, I said yeah  
I remember the first time  
That I ever seen her face  
I was standing by the drug store  
Tryin' to save the human race  
  
Took a raincheck on a blind date  
To get her prescription filled  
We had a short talk and a long walk  
Through the lazy cottonfield  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
She's wonderful, so beautiful  
So delectable, she's mine  
She's desirable, so lovable  
And it's criminal, almost illegal  
  
Well we woke up in a barnyard  
When I heard a farmer shout  
"Get away, boy, from my daughter!"  
When a shotgun rang out  
We took off  
She was right behind me  
Ran like the wind  
What a crazy lady  
  
She's fabulous, so sensuous  
She's marvelous, she's mine  
I'm delirious, it's serious  
Kinda dangerous, almost illegal  
  
Bring it down, now.  
We had a one child by the springtime  
And another on the way  
I got a new life and a good wife  
Ain't that amazing grace  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
She's wonderful, she's beautiful  
She's desirable, she's mine  
I'm delirious, she's serious  
It's kinda dangerous, almost illegal  
Wonderful, so beautiful  
She's not a radical, but she's mine  
She's fabulous, so sensuous  
And it's marvelous, almost illegal  
Beautiful and she's wonderful  
So desirable, almost illegal
