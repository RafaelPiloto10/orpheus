Key f writers, aubry gass and tex ritter  
(f) well when i woke up this mornin',  
There was a note upon my door,  
Said don't make me no coffee babe,  
'cause i won't be back no more,  
And that's all she wrote, dear john,  
I've (c7) sent your saddle (f) home.  
  
Now jonah got along in the belly of the whale,  
Daniel in the lion's den,  
But i know a guy that didn't try to get along,  
And he won't get a chance again,  
And that's all she wrote, dear john,  
I've fetched your saddle home.  
  
Now she didn't forward no address,  
Nor she didn't say goodbye,  
All she said was if you get blue,  
Just hang your little head and cry,  
And that's all she wrote, dear john,  
I've sent your saddle home.  
  
Now my gal's short and stubby,  
She's strong as she can be,  
But if that little old gal of mine,  
Ever get's a-hold of me,  
That's all she wrote, dear john,  
I've sent your saddle home.  
  
Now jonah got along in the belly of the whale,  
Daniel in the lion's den,  
But i know a man that didn't try to get along,  
And he won't get a chance again,  
And that's all she wrote, dear john,  
I've fetched your saddle home.  
  
Now i went down to the bank this morning,  
The cashier said with a grin,  
I feel so sorry for you hank,  
But your wife has done been in,  
And that's all she wrote, dear john,  
I've sent your saddle home.
