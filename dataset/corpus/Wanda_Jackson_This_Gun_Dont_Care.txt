I don't like the way you touch my baby if you're smart you turn him loose  
Unless you crave danger or you're crazy cause this gun don't care who it
shoots  
You better take your hands off my baby or they're gonna bury you in your boots  
  
Keep what I'm saying for I ain't fooling and this gun don't care who it shoots  
This old gun of mine has no conscience shows no favors as never caught the
tree  
So it's all up to you now pay attention cause this gun don't care who it
shoots  
  
I'm glad to see you've made a right decision just stuck away you'd better pull
up roots  
And let's hope that you'll never cross my vision  
'Cause this gun don't care who it shoots  
This old gun of mine...  
No this gun don't care who it shoots
