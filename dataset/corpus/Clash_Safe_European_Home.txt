Well, I just got back an' I wish I never  
Leave now  
Who dat Martian arrival at the airport?  
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?  
The Johnny on the corner was a very sympathetic  
  
I went to the place where every white face is an  
Invitation to robbery  
An' sitting here in my safe European home  
I don't want to go back there again  
  
Wasn't I lucky n' wouldn't it be loverly?  
Send us all cards, an' have a laying in on a Sunday  
I was there for two weeks, so how come I never tell  
That natty dread drinks at the Sheraton hotel?  
  
Now they got the sun, an' they got the palm trees  
They got the weed, an' they got the taxis  
Whoa, the harder they come, n' the home of ol' bluebeat  
Yes I'd stay an' be a tourist but I can't take the gun play
