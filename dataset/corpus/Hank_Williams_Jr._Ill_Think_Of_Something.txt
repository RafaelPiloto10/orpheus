I don't know how I'll get her ioff my mind  
But give me time and I'll think of something  
I can't say today that I'm alright  
But by tonight I'll think of Something  
  
I'll find so many things to do  
That I won't have the time to think of her  
And then if she's still on my mind  
I'll try to drink enough to drown the hurt  
And if that don't work I'll think of something  
  
Where do I go for love that I still need  
Now that I'm free I'll think of something  
And if someday by accident we meet  
And I can't speak I'll think of something  
  
If I can't say a word to her  
I'll blame it on this lump that's in my throat  
And standing there what will I do  
To hide my love enough that it won't show  
I don't know I'll think of something  
Well, I don't know I'll think of something
