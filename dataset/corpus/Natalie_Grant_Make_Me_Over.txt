I've been silent instead of speaking up  
Gave my advice instead of giving love  
I have been unfair, faithless and unkind  
I have shut my eyes just so I would stay blind  
It's not what I meant to do  
Cause I wanna honor you  
Make me over, make me new  
Make me a mirror, a reflection of you  
Take me all apart  
Take me to your heart and pull me closer  
Oh, Jesus, make me over  
Take away the pride that whispers in the dark  
Take the stone out of the middle of my heart  
Hidden underneath my insecurities  
Is the servant that you've destined me to be  
But day after precious day  
I get in my own way  
Make me over, make me new  
Make me a mirror, a reflection of you  
Take me all apart  
Take me to your heart and pull me closer  
Sweet savior, make me over  
I am only made of your imagining  
I'm dust and clay on the wind  
Wash me in the river of your sacrifice  
Until I'm changed, purified  
Take me all apart  
Take me to your heart and pull me closer  
My Jesus, make me over  
Make me over
