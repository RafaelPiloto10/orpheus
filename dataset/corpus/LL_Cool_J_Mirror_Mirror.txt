Yeah, yeah  
"Oh my God"  
(he's back) success (he's back)  
"They love success!"  
(Where you been?)  
Right here baby  
  
Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale  
About a mogul named Uncle L  
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision  
(He excels, they all fail)  
Undisputed, the game got so polluted  
That he turned his 'Radio' off  
He 'Needed A Beat' so he could 'Jingle' them bells again  
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin' soft)  
With a leopard print outfit on  
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on  
He's a (uh uh, 'Phenomenon')  
Ice glistenin', listenin' to 'break of dawn'  
He went from, 'Hollis to Hollywood' in fact  
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ  
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'  
"Exotic Motorcars," we want a deal on that  
  
[Chorus]  
Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)  
What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)  
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)  
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)  
  
'Around the way girls be doin' it well'  
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)  
On the Money magazine covers  
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers  
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche  
(Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)  
Ever since 'Boomin' System', damn she missed him  
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him  
In a, warm jacuzzi full of 'Milky Cereal'  
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)  
I been his biggest fan since five years old  
And now I'm twenty two, I love money (ooh)  
'Backseat of the Jeep', you need that  
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that  
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back  
Milk and 'Pink Cookies' he known to eat that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tryin' to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences  
Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin' long, feel me  
  
'Hey Lover', I'm 'Loungin'  
'goin' Back to Cali', cop a crib on the mountain  
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'  
'(Four)-to-the-Three-Two-One', he stopped countin'  
Eliminated competition quickly  
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be  
He feel his flow deep down in your artery  
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be  
'6 Minutes of Pleasure' for 'Jack the Ripper'  
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)  
But uh, he's 'Bad', he got 'The Power of God'  
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage?  
He been there, mini-bars, RandB stars  
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)  
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite  
Readin' e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, ten, faith, power of God  
Yeah, c'mon, work it with me baby  
Work with me ma, uh, it's been too long, ten
