Would you mind if I still loved you?  
(Would you mind if things don't last?)  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I won't crash...?  
  
Morning light, I'm at your door  
One last time, and no one's there  
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, no...)  
Drove all night, just to beat you home  
Would you mind if I waited?  
Would you mind if I wait right here?  
  
And I really, really, wanna love you  
And I'm really only yours  
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know  
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go  
I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you?  
Would you mind if things don't last?  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I won't crash?  
  
Up all night, can't let go  
Won't stop trying, need you to know  
It's worth the fight, if I get back come  
Hope you don't mind I waited  
Would you mind if I wait right here?  
  
And I really, really, wanna love you  
And I'm really only yours  
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know  
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go  
I'm just being honest (I'm still in the moment)  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you?  
Would you mind if things don't last?  
Would you mind if I hold onto  
You so that I won't crash?  
  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
I'm not thinking 'bout nobody else but you  
You're the only one who takes me there  
  
Would you mind if I still loved you?  
Would you mind if things don't last?  
Would you mind if I hold onto
