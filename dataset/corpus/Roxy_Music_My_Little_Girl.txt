Walking home tonight  
It came as no surprise  
Certain parties making out  
Before my eyes  
My little girl  
  
Or woman of the world  
There's a small cafe  
Where lovers take their time  
It's good for rainy days  
Too bad the weather's fine  
My little girl  
  
Or woman of the world  
What's the story?  
True to life or just a lie  
See you later  
What's so new about goodbye?  
My little girl  
Or woman of the world
