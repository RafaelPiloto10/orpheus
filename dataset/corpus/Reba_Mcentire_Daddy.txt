My daddy is a rancher  
He's wrangled cattle dang near all his life  
He also liked to rodeo  
He traveled around with four kids and a wife  
  
Well his old ranch is rocky  
But his ropes sail smooth for several years  
He worked real hard  
And roped real good  
And tried to get his ranch out in the clear  
  
He didn't want us kids to rodeo  
He wanted more out of life for us  
Maybe banking, or a lawyer  
Or maybe even driving some old bus  
  
Well that's when we took up singing  
And his pride grew greater day by day  
And I know his eyes grew misty  
The night I sang up on the Opry stage  
  
[Chorus]  
Now his ranch is so much bigger  
The the days when he first started  
The grass grows now where none used to be  
His roping got him started  
Cattle prices made it better  
And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear  
  
Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his  
Ropes  
But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes  
Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years  
Ago  
Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now he's feeding cattle  
Toting hay  
And branding the Y.O.  
And his hired hand's there to help him  
And she also cooks their meals when they get home  
They built their ranch together  
And listening to the kids sing through the years  
  
Well they worked real hard  
And roped real good and now they got their ranch  
Out in the clear  
Because when a family works together  
They finally get their ranch out in the clear  
Out in the clear
