I am searching through the canyon  
It is your name that I am calling  
Tho you're so far away  
I know you hear my plea  
Why won't you answer me  
Here I am  
  
I am in the blood of your heart  
The breath of your lung  
Why do you run for cover  
You are from the dirt of the earth  
And the kiss of my mouth  
I have always been your lover  
Here I am  
  
I am the promise never broken  
And my arms are ever open  
In this harbor calm and still  
I will wait until  
Until you come to me  
Here I am
