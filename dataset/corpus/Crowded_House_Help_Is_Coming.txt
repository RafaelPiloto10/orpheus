Help is coming  
I heard a whisper  
White caps turning  
Breath of summer  
  
Distant drummin'  
Lire birds callin'  
Escape the anguish of our past  
And pray  
  
Empires crumbling  
Callous winter  
Fear is running  
No longer with us  
  
We sail tomorrow  
For Ellis Island  
Escape, anger of our past  
And pray that peace will come at last  
And dream  
  
Release the anger of our past  
And pray that peace will come at last  
And stay  
Help is coming  
  
Help is coming  
We sail tomorrow  
For Ellis Island  
Help is coming  
  
Dreams come true  
We'll sail tomorrow  
Dreams come true  
Help is coming
