Lonely child you make it easy  
You give me love like no one can  
You're my heart, you keep me movin'  
It seems you always understand  
My love, I'm your man  
  
Lonely child you make me happy  
You take my fears and set them free  
Every night you hold me closer  
Like two notes in harmony  
Come spend your life with me  
  
Lonely child be my lover  
We'll make love in the morning light  
Weave your magic spell around me  
And come spend your life with me
