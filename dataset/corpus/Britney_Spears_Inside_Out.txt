Said you're gonna be here in a minute  
Sitting in the mirror, getting pretty  
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up  
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up  
I can hear you knocking at the front door  
And I know exactly what you came for  
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy  
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy  
  
You  
Touch me and its breaking me down,  
and me down, and me down, and me down  
I'm telling you, let's just give it up  
and get down, and get down, and get down  
  
So come on,  
Won't you give me something to remember?  
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out  
Even though we couldn't last forever  
Baby, you know what I want right now  
  
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing  
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down  
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy  
'Cause you know me inside out  
Inside out  
  
I know that we probably shouldn't do this  
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid  
Said that we were done but you're all up on me  
Said that we were done but you're all up on me  
Tell me how we got in this position  
Guess I gotta get you out my system  
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy  
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy  
  
You  
Touch me and its breaking me down,  
and me down, and me down, and me down  
I'm telling you, let's just give it up  
and get down, and get down, and get down  
  
So come on,  
Won't you give me something to remember?  
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out  
Even though we couldn't last forever  
Baby, you know what I want right now  
  
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing  
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down  
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy  
'Cause you know me inside out  
Inside out, inside out  
  
So come on,  
Won't you give me something to remember?  
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out  
Even though we couldn't last forever  
Baby, you know what I want right now  
  
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing  
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down  
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy  
'Cause you know me inside out
