If I say I love ya  
And lay it on the line  
Yeah  
Could you say you need me  
  
And put your hands in mine  
Oh I got love that grows  
Oh I got love that shows  
I got the love  
  
If you've got the time  
Then I've got the time  
Do you say you want me  
You'll give me everything  
  
Then you could come live here  
I'd even buy a ring  
Oh I've got lots to learn  
Oh I've got love to burn  
  
I got the love  
If you've got the time  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
  
I got the love  
If you've got the time  
Then I've got the time  
Yeah  
  
Do you say you need me  
You'll give me everything  
Then you could come live here  
I'd even buy a ring  
  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
I got the love  
If you've got the time  
  
Then I've got the time  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
I got the love  
  
If you've got the time  
Then I've got the time  
Oh I've got love that shows  
Oh I've got love that grows  
  
I've got the love
