Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.  
Fed up with life and the way things are going,  
He decides to rob a liquor store.  
("I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes")  
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.  
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play  
("Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this")  
  
Alright, stop! (Huh?)  
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store  
And try to get money out the drawer  
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)  
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience  
  
That's nonsense!  
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs  
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs  
Tell her you need a place to stay  
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade  
  
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to  
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you  
Think about it before you walk in the door first  
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns  
  
Fuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!  
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?  
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?  
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?  
  
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)  
Not over this shit (Stop!)  
Drop the biscuit (I will!)  
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you  
(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude)  
  
("It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute")  
("Mm, I don't know!")  
("Look baby")  
("Damn!")  
("Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?")  
("Well OK")  
  
Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. ("Give me a kiss!")  
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,  
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.  
Once again, his conscience comes into play ("Shit!")  
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek  
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink  
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe  
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old  
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)  
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh huh!)  
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare  
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there  
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kid")  
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!  
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)  
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail  
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.  
After coming home from a hard day's work,  
He walks in the door of his trailer park home  
To find his wife in bed with another man.  
("What the fuck!")  
("Grady!")  
  
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'  
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'  
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?  
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!  
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?  
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?)  
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady  
But think about the baby before you get all crazy  
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?  
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?  
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard  
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?  
What you say? (What's wrong?  
Didn't think I'd remember?)  
I'm a kill you motherfucker!  
Uh-ah! Temper temper!  
  
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?  
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?  
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?  
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went  
Been there, done that, aw fuck it  
What am I sayin'?  
Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?
