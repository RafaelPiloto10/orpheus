Maybe there's something in me  
Trying to hitch another ride  
Have you ever felt this moment  
When you're looking out of control  
All the ways I could have taken  
Just add up to indecision  
  
I'm gonna get this back on line  
To me there's no reason why  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Wash away the pain of mine  
  
Get me to the place I'm standing  
There's a reason down below  
Maybe there's something in me  
Trying to take another ride  
Have you ever felt the moment  
When you're loosing all control  
  
I'm gonna get this back on line  
To me there's no reason why  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
Wash away the pain of mine  
  
All my troubles soon be leaving [Repeat: x4]  
  
(Mine)  
(Mine)  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
(Mine)  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
(Mine)  
All my troubles soon be leaving  
(Mine)
