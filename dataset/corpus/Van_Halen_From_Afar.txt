If I cannot see you from afar  
Look into your eyes, that hint of depth  
Hidden inside  
If I cannot hear you from afar  
Whisper in my ear, rest assured that  
You are near  
  
And I know not what it's like  
The aforementioned  
For the distance between us  
As are the stars, I only have you  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
Just to love you  
From afar  
  
If I cannot kiss you from afar  
Press against your lips, taste the sweetness  
Of your breath  
  
If I cannot touch you from afar  
Hold you in my arms, keep you warm and  
Safe from harm  
  
Though our circumstances  
Cause separation  
In the absence, there's a presence in my heart  
I will surrender, I'll surrender to my  
Quiet contemplation  
My quiet contemplation  
I'll just, I'll just love you  
From afar  
  
There must be a better way (ooo-oooh)  
A better way (ooo-oooh) of, of passing the time  
I can't seem to get her out  
Out of my  
Get her out of my mind  
  
I don't know what it's like  
The aforementioned  
For the distance between us  
As are the stars, I only have you  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
  
Just to love you  
Just to love you  
Just to love you
