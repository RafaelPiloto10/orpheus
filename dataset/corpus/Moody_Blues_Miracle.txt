I closed the door and I walked away  
From the life I knew  
On a night in June.  
I took a chance and I lost control  
Trying to find out why  
On a night in July.  
Why this hesitation?  
I can feel that the night is slipping away.  
want to drown in the ocean of your love,  
want to dance in the moonlight  
Looking for a miracle  
I left the city on a wave of despair  
To stand on my own  
On an August night.  
From the valley of broken hearts  
Gonna make a new start in September.  
Why this confusion?  
I can feel that the night is slipping away.  
want to walk from the shadows to the sun  
Just to dream on a summer night,  
Dream about a miracle  
Looking for a miracle.  
  
Never had the chance before  
To turn the tide my way.  
In the heat of the summer night  
You took my breath away  
Looking for a miracle.  
  
want to walk from the shadows to the sun  
Just to dream on a summer night,  
Dream about a miracle.  
Your love is just a miracle.  
  
I closed the door and I walked away  
From the life I knew  
On a night in June.  
I took a chance and I lost control  
Trying to find out why  
On a night in July.  
Why this hesitation?  
I can feel that the night is slipping away.  
want to drown in the ocean of your love,  
want to dance in the moonlight  
Looking for a miracle.  
Looking for a miracle.
