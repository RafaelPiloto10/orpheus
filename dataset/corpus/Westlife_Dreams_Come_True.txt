Dreams are there to show you the way  
(Better take a look inside)  
Close your eyes find out what they're trying to say  
(You gotta take a look inside)  
  
Only for a minute  
Just to make a start  
Imagine what you want to see  
  
Wake him up, the wizard  
Sleeping in your heart  
Just imagine what you want to be  
  
Don't you know that  
  
Dreams come true, they do  
Dreams come true  
From all of us to all of you they do  
  
Don't you know that dreams come  
  
True love is just a second away  
(Better take a look inside)  
Make that magic rule, let the miracle stay  
(You gotta take a look inside)  
  
Only for a minute  
It's not a fantasy  
Just imagine what you want to be  
  
Don't you know that  
  
Dreams come true, they do  
Dreams come true  
From all of us to all of you they do  
  
Don't you know that dreams come true  
Don't you know that dreams come true  
  
Only for a minute  
You can make your dreams come true
