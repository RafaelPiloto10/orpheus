Look at me I'm so disgusting  
I will never find another  
Quite like you  
You make me blue  
With the things you do  
  
Look at you you're so familiar  
We could be so cool together  
All the time  
Could all be fine  
  
We're on the line  
The line is fine  
Open up ma window  
The line is fine  
  
Standing on the ledge  
Well I don't look down  
Looking at the people  
Well they all look fine  
  
It's not just life or death  
Yesterday we talked together  
But tonight it's just the weather  
Chillin' me  
  
What's the point in silly talking  
We could get there quicker walking  
Down the line  
Could all be fine  
But we're on the line  
The line is fine  
  
Open up the window  
The line is fine  
Standing on the ledge  
Well I don't look down  
Looking at the people  
Well they all look fine  
  
But staring at the faces  
Standing in a row  
Thinking of all the places  
That they have yet to go  
they don't know  
  
Open up the window  
The line is fine  
Standing on the ledge  
Well I don't look down  
Looking at the people  
Well they all look fine  
It's not just life or death  
The line is fine  
It's not just life or death  
The worst line is mine  
  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
  
Fine  
Fine  
Fine
