World turns black and white  
Pictures in an empty room  
Your love starts fallin down  
Better change your tune  
Reach for the golden ring  
Reach for the sky  
Baby just spread your wings  
  
We'll get higher and higher  
straight up we'll climb  
We'll get higher and higher  
leave it all behind  
  
Run, run, run away  
Like a train runnin off the track  
The truth gets left behind  
And falls between the cracks  
Standing on broken dreams  
But never losin sight  
Spread your wings  
  
We'll get higher and higher  
straight up we'll climb  
We'll get higher and higher  
leave it all behind  
  
So baby dry your eyes, save all  
the tears you've cried  
Ohh that's what dreams are  
made of  
Cause we belong in a world  
that must be strong  
Ohh that's what dreams are made of  
  
We'll get higher and higher  
Straight up we'll climb  
Higher and higher leave it all  
behind oh we'll  
Higher and higher who knows  
what we'll find  
  
And in the end on dreams we  
will depend  
Cause that's what love is  
made of
