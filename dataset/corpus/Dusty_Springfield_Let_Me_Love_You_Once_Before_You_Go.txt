It's like looking in the window of a fine boutique  
Knowing there is nothing that I could ever buy  
Still I want your love so much that I could die  
But I just can't lead a double life  
Being one man's lover, one man's wife  
  
But you can start a fire raging  
Just by touching me  
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch, no  
Oh, I never wanted anyone so much  
How I wish that I had found you first  
Don't you see my heart's about to burst?  
  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So don't keep saying no  
Let me love you once and you will see  
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me  
  
Let me lock the door  
Open up all my love to you  
All the love I've longed to give you since we met  
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get  
And I just can't let it disappear  
Sweet baby, please come over here  
  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So don't keep saying no  
Let me love you once and you will see  
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me  
  
Ahh  
(Let me love you once before you go)  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So don't keep saying no, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh  
(Let me love you once and you will see)  
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
(Let me love you once before you go)  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
(Let me love you once, ahh, ahh)  
(Ever gonna love)
