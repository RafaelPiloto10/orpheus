She'll sing a West-Side song  
You could be the boy in the film  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Where are the West-Side boys?  
Fighting on the scaffold of love  
Scripted pleasures made forever  
Easier said than done together  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Here is her model home  
Listen to the call of the wild  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Facts are an awful shame  
The shadow of a doubtful affair  
Scripted pleasures made forever  
Easier said than done together  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Act One's the same as you read in the book  
Could this be the thing that they shout about?  
No more in distress, now it's rushed through the door  
And you can't believe that the secrets out  
Scripted pleasures made forever  
Easier said than done together  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret
