When the last drop of rain has fallen  
When the final note has drifted away  
When the earth ceases to turn  
And the last fire has burned  
  
When the wind stops its ceaseless blowing  
When the last wave has come into shore  
When the sun has called it a day  
And the stars have all floated away  
  
My heart will still be yours, baby  
My dreams will still be yours, darlin'  
You and I will find nothing has changed  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love (remains)  
  
When we have grown old together  
And the hourglass runs out of sand  
Darlin' you will kiss me and then  
Forever starts all over again  
  
My heart will still be yours, baby  
My dreams will still be yours, darlin'  
You and I will find nothing has changed  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love (remains)  
  
My soul is one with yours, baby  
Just to hold you drives me crazy  
In your eyes I see... you feel the same  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love remains  
  
Love remains like an endless flame  
Through the brightest joys and the darkest pain  
In the end  
  
My heart will still be yours, baby  
My dreams will still be yours, darlin'  
You and I will find nothing has changed  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love (remains)  
  
My soul is one with yours, baby  
Just to hold you drives me crazy  
In your eyes I see... you feel the same  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, still remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, still remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, still remains  
Oh, love, love, love  
Love, love, love  
Oh, love, love, love
