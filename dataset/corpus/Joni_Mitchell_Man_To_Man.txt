No demands  
Just pleasurable sensations  
Hand in hand  
No far reaching plans  
No, no-hand in hand  
Well I keep on trying to understand  
Daylight bright  
How come I keep moving  
From man to man to man?  
Giving my sweet love,  
Tasting sweet love,  
Woman to man  
  
Sometimes it's easy  
You drift with the empty gladness  
Like it all belongs  
Sometimes it's low down sadness  
Like it's all gone so wrong  
When I saw you standing there  
I said to myself  
M-m-m here's a place  
I could break down and care  
I'll give him my sweet love,  
Taste his sweet love,  
Real sweet love,  
Woman to man  
  
I don't like to lie  
But I sure can be phony when I get scared  
I put my nose up in the air  
Stoney, stoney when I get scared  
When I saw you standing there  
I was scared  
I thought  
Oh, I hope he can care,  
I sure hope I can care,  
I hope we can really care,  
And share woman to man  
Cause I've been moving  
Man to man to man to man to man  
Oh what am I looking for?  
Man to man to man to man  
A lot of good guys gone through my door  
Man to man to man to man  
To man to man to man  
Man to man to man to man  
Woman to man
