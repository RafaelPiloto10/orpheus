Oh...  
I have been smashed again  
With the men from the  
Old Valhalla Road Crematorium  
Boring men with the same old patter  
  
I am a simple man  
Not much to gain or lose  
And I don't know why I held out  
So long for me and you  
  
Until he drew  
A swallow on my neck  
And more, I will not say  
He drew  
A swallow, deep and blue  
And soon, everyone knew  
  
Then I was wrecked again  
With the men full of bluff and ardor  
From a well-known funeral parlor  
  
I am a simple man  
Not much to gain or lose  
Older and wiser  
Never applies to me  
  
And so he drew  
A swallow on my neck  
And more, I will not say  
He drew  
A swallow, deep and blue  
And soon, everyone knew  
  
Aah...  
Oh...  
  
You have been telling me  
That I have been  
Acting childish  
Foolish, ghoulish and childish  
Oh, I know, I know, I know !  
I know, I know, I know  
But I don't mind  
I don't mind  
I don't mind  
  
Ah...  
I don't mind  
Ah...
