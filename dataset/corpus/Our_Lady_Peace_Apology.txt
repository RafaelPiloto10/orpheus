You, you're me  
I'm the lock, you're the key  
You're the air, the air, I breathe.  
But tonight I'm choking  
  
You are my life  
You are my life  
  
You, you're the sea  
I'm the waves crashing  
On the ground  
The ground under your feet  
I'm a liar, a thief  
And I'm, I'm an apology  
  
You are my life  
You are my life  
  
You are my life  
You are my life  
  
Don't go  
Don't go  
Don't go  
Don't go  
Don't go.
