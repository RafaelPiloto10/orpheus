I got 36 expressions!  
Sweet as pie to tough as leather  
And that's 36 expressions more than all those Baltimores puttogether.  
So 'stead of just kicking me why don't they give me a lift?  
Well, it must be a plot!  
'Cause their scared that I got...such a gift?  
Well, I'll miffed.  
  
Cause I'm  
The Greatest Star  
I am by far!  
But no one knows it--WAIT!  
They're gonna hear a voice  
A silver flute (ah ah ah ah)  
They'll cheer each toot  
(Yeah, that kids terrific, mmm)  
  
When I expose it  
(Now can't ya see to look at me that)  
I'm a natural Camille.  
As Camille I just feel  
I've so much to offer  
(Now listen Mr. Z I know I'd be divine because)  
  
I'm a natural cougher  
(ahoo, aheh, ahay)  
Some ain't got it, not a lump  
I'm a great big clump of talent  
Laugh!  
(ha ha ha ha)  
  
They'll bend in half  
A thousand jokes  
(Stick around for the jokes!)  
A thousand faces  
I reiterate  
  
When your gifted, then your gifted  
These are facts  
I've got no acts to parade  
Hey, what ya blind?  
In all of the world so far  
I'm the greatest star  
  
Who is the pip with pizzas?  
Who is all ginger and jazz?  
Who is as glamorous as?  
Who's an American beauty rose?  
With an American beauty NOSE!!!  
And ten American beauty toes?  
  
Eyes on the target and wham  
One shot on gun shot and BAM!  
Hey Mr. Keeney!  
Here I am!  
  
I'm the greatest star  
I am by far  
But no one knows it  
That's why I was born  
I'll blow my horn  
'Til someone blows it  
  
I'll light up like a light  
Bright up like a light  
I'll flicker and flare up!  
All of the world's gonna star up!  
Looking down you'll never see me,  
Try the sky cause that'll be me!  
  
I can make 'em cry!  
I can make 'em sigh!  
Someday they'll clamor for my drama  
Have ya guessed YET!  
Who's the best yet?  
  
If ya ain't I'll tell ya one more time  
You bet ya last dime  
In all of the world so far  
I am the greatest, greatest  
Star!
