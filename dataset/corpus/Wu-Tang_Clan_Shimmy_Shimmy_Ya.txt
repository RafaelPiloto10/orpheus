[Oh, fuck, you can't even sing]  
Hey, baby, I like it rawww...  
Yeah baby, I like it raawww!!!  
Ooh, baby, I like it raww...  
Yeah baby, I like it rawww!!!  
Sh...  
  
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay  
Gimme the mic so I can take it away  
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage  
Yeah, from the home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn squad  
Wu-Tang Killerrr Bees on a swarm!  
Rain on ya dollar's ass, disco dorm!  
For you to even touch my skill  
You gotta have the one Killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill. Now  
My producer slam, my flow is like bam!  
Chop that down, pass it all around!  
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground!  
For any MC in any fifty two states  
I gets psycho killerrrr Norman Bates!  
My producer slam, sharp like bam!  
Jump on stage, and then I dun-daaaah!  
[I like the way you come]  
Hey, baby, I like it rawww...  
Yeah baby, I like it rawww!!!  
Ooh, baby, I like it raww...  
Yeah baby, I like it rawww!!!  
  
(Repeat)
