Paint a picture, using only gray  
Light your pillow, lay back, watch the flames  
I'll tell a story, no one would listen that long  
  
It's hard to imagine, it's hard to imagine.  
Tear into yourself, count tales on your arm  
Ah the beating, tickin' like a bomb  
After having seen all that they saw  
  
It's hard to imagine, it's hard to imagine.  
Things were different then, all is different now  
I tried to explain, somehow.  
Things were different then, all is different now  
I tried to explain, somehow.  
  
Things were different then, all is different now  
I tried to explain, I hope this works somehow.  
Things were different then, all is different now  
I tried to explain, oh, somehow.  
Ooh, oh, oh.
