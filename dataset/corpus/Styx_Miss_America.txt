You were the apple of the public's eye as you cut the ribbon at the local mall  
A mirage for both you and us. How can it be real?  
We love your body in that photograph, your home state sure must be proud  
The queen of the United States, or have you lost your crown  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Well are you really who we think you are  
Or does that smile seem to wear you down  
This girl who you once were is screaming jump out  
This dream that you must live, a disease for which there is no cure  
This roller coaster ride you're on won't stop to let you off  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Miss America, Miss America  
Miss America, Miss America  
  
Well it's true just take a look  
The cover sometimes makes the book  
And the judges, do they ever ask to read between your lines  
And in your cage at the human zoo, they all stop to look at you  
Next year, what will you do when you have been forgotten  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love
