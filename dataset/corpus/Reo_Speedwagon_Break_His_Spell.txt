You got that far away look in your eyes.  
But are you looking at me or at some other guy  
Who's got you hypnotized,  
Got you mesmerized,  
Keep you tranquilized with ever kind of lie.  
Still he makes you cry,  
So baby realize that I  
  
I'm gonna break his spell.  
I'll put him in his place and get you out of this hell.  
I'm gonna break his spell.  
Take this relationship and send it straight to the well.  
I'm gonna break his spell.  
Baby I'm gonna break his spell.  
Yes I will.  
  
It's been a while since I've known something's wrong.  
At first you had me thinking everything was gone.  
I got a late start.  
I let him steal your heart.  
I let that fool come in and tear our world apart.  
But he's not that smart.  
Another love shark and I  
  
I'm gonna break his spell.  
I'll put him in his place and get you out of this hell.  
I'm gonna break his spell.  
Take this relationship and send it straight to the well.  
I'm gonna break his spell.  
Baby I'm gonna break his spell.  
Yes I will.
