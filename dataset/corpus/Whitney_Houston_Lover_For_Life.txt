Hey yeah baby hoo boy  
yeah oh baby  
I hope you realize baby  
Just what you mean to me (uh)  
Hey you where I run for cover  
Your love is shelter for me  
And when I find myself needing  
Some lifting up  
One night with you and  
That always is enough  
How you make being in love  
A true rare affair  
So take me I'm your prisoner  
  
[Chorus]  
Will you sentence me  
To be your lover for life  
Your lover for life  
Will you sentence me  
I want to be your lover for life  
Your lover for life  
Your lover yeah yeah yeah  
I just want to hear you say  
You'll be my lover, lover for life  
Capture, there's no getaway  
You're my lover, my lover for life  
  
Under your spell or  
Under my own power  
It really doesn't matter to me  
No boy  
See I fell in love  
The first time I saw you  
And have been falling in love  
Ever since mm boy  
  
You heard my testimony  
You've seen my evidence  
Hey, it's a crime of passion  
In every sense  
And justice would be served  
If you stay here in my world  
So take me I'm your prisoner  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm your prisoner  
Take me  
I'm your prisoner  
And sentence me to be  
Your lover for life  
want to be  
Take me baby  
Your lover, your baby
