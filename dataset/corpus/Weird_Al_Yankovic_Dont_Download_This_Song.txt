Once in a while maybe you will feel the urge  
To break international copyright law  
By downloading M-P-3's from file-sharing sites  
Like Morpheus or Grokster or LimeWire or KaZaA  
But deep in your heart you know the guilt would drive you mad  
And the shame would leave a permanent scar  
'Cause you start out stealing songs, and then you're robbing liquor stores  
And selling crack and running over school kids with your car  
  
So don't download this song  
The record store's where you belong  
Go and buy the C-D like you know that you should  
Oh don't download this song  
  
Oh you don't want to mess with the are I double A  
They'll sue you if you burn that C-D-are  
It doesn't matter if you're a grandma or a 7-year-old girl  
They'll treat you like the evil, hard-bitten criminal scum you are  
  
So don't download this song  
Don't go pirating music all day long  
Go and buy the C-D like you know that you should  
Oh, don't download this song  
  
Don't take away money from artists just like me  
How else can I afford another solid gold Humvee?  
And diamond-studded swimming pools, these things don't grow on trees  
So all I ask is everybody, please  
  
Don't download this song (Don't do it, no, no)  
Even Lars Urlich knows it's wrong (You can just ask him)  
Go and buy the C-D like you know that you should (You really should)  
Oh, don't download this song  
  
Don't download this song (Oh please don't you do it)  
Or you might wind up in jail like Tommy Chong (Remember Tommy)  
Go and buy the C-D (Right Now) like you know that you should (Go out and buy
it)  
Oh don't download this song  
  
Don't download this song (No no no no no no)  
Or you'll burn in Hell before too long (And you'd deserve it)  
Go and buy the C-D (Just buy it) like you know that you should (Ya cheap
bastard)  
Oh, don't download this song
