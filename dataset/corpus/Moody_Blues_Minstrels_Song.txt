Words a simple song  
A minstrel sings  
A way of life in his eyes  
Hear the morning call of waking birds  
When they are singing, bringing  
Love - love.  
Everywhere love is all around,  
Everywhere love is all around.  
  
Now the winter's gone  
Cold wind has blown  
The endless stream in our lives  
Where the minstrel sings  
This simple song  
He's always bringing, singing,  
Love - love.  
Everywhere love is all around,  
Everywhere love is all around.  
  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love.  
Follow our friend,  
Our wandering friend,  
Listen to the one,  
Who sings of love.  
Everywhere love is around,  
Around, around.  
  
Here the nations sing  
Our minstrel's song,  
As he walks by in their lives  
Soon the spring will come,  
And everyone will all be singing, bringing  
Love - love  
Everywhere love is all around,  
Everywhere love is all around.  
  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love.  
Follow our friend,  
Our wandering friend,  
Listen to the one,  
Who sings of love.  
Everywhere love is around,  
Around, around.
