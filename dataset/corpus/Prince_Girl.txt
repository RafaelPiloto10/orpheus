Oh, girl  
If I could hold your hand  
I'd make you touch my body until you understand

Caress the flower  
Warm, warm  
Bring it to the garden

I don't know, I, I guess you frighten me  
Cause I've never wanted anyone like this before  
To feel this way it's like, I don't know, it's like a sin  
Cause sometimes I feel bad  
Sometimes I want you so much I can--
