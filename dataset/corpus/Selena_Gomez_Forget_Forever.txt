I told, I told, I told myself again  
I'm never running back on what I said  
Trying not to run but you're so far away  
So far away  
Won't listen to the conscience in my head  
I'm conscious but I'm lonely halfway dead  
Tired of the thing you never, you never said  
You never said  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You left me wanting what we were  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name  
  
I know, I know, I know we can't pretend  
That we never lovers in the end  
I tried to tell myself that this pain would go away  
Just go away  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You left me wanting what we were  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name  
Forget forever  
Forget forever
