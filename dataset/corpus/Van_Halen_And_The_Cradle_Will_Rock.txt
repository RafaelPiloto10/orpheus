Well, they say it's kinda fright'nin' how this younger generation swings.  
You know, it's more than just some new sensation.  
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep and he don't come home for half the week.  
You know, it's more than just an aggravation.  
  
And the cradle will rock.  
Yes, the cradle will rock.  
And I say, rock on!  
Rock on!  
  
And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town.  
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."  
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets,  
and he's unemployed.  
  
And the cradle will rock.  
Yeah, the cradle will rock.  
And I say, rock on!  
Rock on!
