Dreaming of a love I lost, the day the final bridge was crossed  
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget  
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around  
Leaving me low and leaving me down  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart  
'Cause I can't keep us apart, forgiving you  
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned  
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
You're leaving right now
