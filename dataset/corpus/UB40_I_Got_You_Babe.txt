They say we're young and we don't know  
Won't find out till we grow  
Well I don't know why that's true  
Cause you got me baby, I got you  
  
Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe.  
  
They say our love won't pay the rent  
Before it's earn'd our money's always spent  
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot  
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got  
  
Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe.  
  
I got flowers in the spring  
I got you, you wear my ring  
And when I'm sad, you're a clown  
And if I get scared you're always around  
And then they say your hair's too long  
But I don't care, with you I can't do wrong  
Then put your warm little hand in mine  
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb  
  
Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe.  
  
I got you to hold my  
I got you to understand  
I got you to walk with me  
I got you to talk with  
I got you to kiss goodnight  
I got you to hold me tight  
I got you I won't let go  
I got you who loves me so  
I got you, babe
