Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely.  
  
Always believe and never doubt  
That wizards cast their spells about  
There's such a lot you won't lose count  
If you look closely.  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
So choose one wisely.  
  
Not all angels can grow wings  
They seem to soar by other means  
You can fly although it seems  
A little slowly.
