You built me up with your wishing hell  
I didn't have to sell you  
You threw your money in the pissing well  
You do just what they tell you  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
I she'd the skin to feed the fake  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
Whose mistake am I anyway?  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now you'll see your star  
Prick your finger it is done  
The moon has now eclipsed the sun  
The angel has spread it's wings  
The time has come for bitter things  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
I she'd the skin to feed the fake  
REPENT that's what I'm talking about  
Whose mistake am I anyway?  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now you'll see your star  
The time has come it is quite clear  
Our antichrist  
Is almost here  
Cut the head off  
Grows back hard  
I am the hydra  
Now you'll see your star  
(When you are suffering, know that I've betrayed you)
