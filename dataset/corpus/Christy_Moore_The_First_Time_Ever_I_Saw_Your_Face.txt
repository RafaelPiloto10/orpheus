The First Time ever I saw your face  
I Thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and the endless sky, my love  
  
The first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move in my hand  
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command, my love  
  
The first time ever I lay with you  
I felt your heart so close to mine  
And I knew our joy would fill the earth  
And last 'till the end of time, my love  
And last 'till the end of time
