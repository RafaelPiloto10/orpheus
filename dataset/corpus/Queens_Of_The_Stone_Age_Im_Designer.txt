My generation's for sale  
Beats a steady job  
How much have you got?  
  
My generation don't trust no one  
It's hard to blame  
Not even ourselves  
  
The thing that's real for us is: fortune and fame  
All the rest seems like work  
It's just like diamonds  
In shit  
  
I'm high class, I'm a whore  
Actually both  
Basically, I'm a pro  
We've all got our own style of baggage  
Why hump it yourself?  
  
You've made me an offer that I can refuse  
'Cause either way I get screwed  
Counter proposal: I go home and jerk off, uh  
  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own, you don't own  
You don't own what none can buy  
You don't own  
(You don't own)  
Neither do I  
  
High and mighty, you say selling out is a shame  
Is that the name of your book?  
Push a silver spoon in your ass  
No more holding us  
Down, dog, down, mutt, nice mutt  
  
You're insulted you can't be bought or sold  
Translation: offer too low  
You don't know what you're worth  
It isn't much  
My piano's for sale  
How many times must I sell myself  
Before my pieces are gone?  
I'm one of a kind! I'm designer!  
  
Never again will I repeat myself  
Enough is never enough  
Never again will I repeat myself  
  
It used to be the plan was screwing the man  
Now it's have sex with a man  
(After he buys your dot-com for sale at a low, low price)  
  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
It's truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own me  
You don't own what none can buy  
You don't own...  
You don't own what none can buy  
Neither do I
