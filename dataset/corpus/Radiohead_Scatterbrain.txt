I'm walking out in a force-ten gale  
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail  
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails  
Your voice is rapping on my window-sill  
  
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind  
Yesterday's people in a scatterbrain  
Any fool can easy pick a hole  
(I wish I could fall in)  
A moving target in a firing range  
  
Somewhere I'm not  
Scatterbrain  
Somewhere I'm not  
Scatterbrain  
Lightning fuse, powercut  
Scatterbrain
