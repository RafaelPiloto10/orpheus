Starts with a typical ZZ riff, sounds like ZZ meets James Bond.  
  
Black fly buzzin', buzzin' around  
Black fly flyin' from town to town  
Black fly lookin' around and around  
What's he gonna do when he finds her?  
  
He got the mojo workin' overtime  
Makin' it, layin' it on the line  
Chasin' his honey with a honeysuckle vine  
Who's so lucky and gets to kiss her?  
  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, that's right  
  
Flyin' round lookin' for a black cat bone  
Flyin' with John the conqueror showin'  
Messin' around with a honey-bee  
Will she kiss him or sting him, what's it gonna be?  
  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, that's right  
  
Black fly buzzin, buzzin' around  
Black fly flyin' from town to town  
Black fly zzzzz'n all around  
Fly gonna fly when he find her  
  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, that's right  
Black fly, yeah that's alright
