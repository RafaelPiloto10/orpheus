There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together and time to spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
  
Some day, somewhere  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Time together and time to spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
  
Some day, somewhere  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, some day  
Somewhere
