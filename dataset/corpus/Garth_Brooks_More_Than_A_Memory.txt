People say she's only in my head  
It's gonna take time but I'll forget  
They say I need to get on with my life  
But they don't realize  
  
Is when your dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone.  
Driving cross town just to see if she's home.  
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be
alright.  
When your finding things to do not to fall asleep  
'Cause you know she'll be there in your dreams.  
That's when she's  
More than a memory  
  
Took a match to everything she ever wrote  
Watched her words go up in smoke  
Tore all the pictures off the wall  
But that ain't helping me at all.  
  
'Cause when your talking out loud and nobody's there  
You look like hell and you just don't care  
Drinking more than you've ever drank  
Sinking down lower than you've ever sank  
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees,  
Praying to God, begging him please  
That's when she's  
More than a memory  
  
She's more  
She's more  
  
'Cause when your dialing her number just to hang up the phone  
Driving cross town just to see if she's home  
Waking a friend in the dead of night, just to hear 'em say it's gonna be
alright  
When our finding things to do not to fall asleep  
'Cause you know she'll be waiting in your dreams  
That's when she's  
More than a memory  
  
People say she's only in my head  
Its gonna take time but I'll forget
