Down in the city  
Where the girls look pretty  
Some just like a miracle  
  
They're so attractive  
So hyperactive  
But they're cool and they talk cynical  
  
Give me a chance  
I don't want romance  
Don't be so serious (oh nooo)  
  
Let's get some action  
Some real satisfaction  
You're so mysterious  
I can't wait any longer  
  
Tonight's the night  
I want you to show me baby  
Tonight's the night  
Now is the time, the time to go over the top  
  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around  
  
Move around, around, around  
  
Down in the city  
Where the girls are pretty  
Some just like a miracle  
  
Oooh, I'm on the road  
Get out of control  
I'm losing my mind  
It's time to get wild  
  
Tonight's the night  
I want you to show me baby  
Tonight's the night  
Now is the time, the time to go over the top  
  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around  
  
Move around, around, around  
  
Tonight's the night  
I want you to show me baby  
Tonight's the night  
Now is the time, the time to go over the top  
  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around (over the top)  
You're running me down  
And don't you ever stop messing around  
  
Move around, around, around.
