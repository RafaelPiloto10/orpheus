Mama,I found someone  
Like you said would come along  
He's a sight, so unlike  
Any man I've known  
I was afraid to let him in  
'Cause I'm not the trustin' kind  
But now I'm convinced  
That he's heaven sent  
And must be out of his mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Mama, he's crazy  
Crazy over me  
And in my life is where he says  
He always wants to be  
I've never been so in love  
He beats all I've ever seen  
Mama, he's crazy  
He's crazy over me  
  
And Mama, you've always said,  
"Better look before you leap!"  
Maybe so, but here I go  
Lettin' my heart lead me  
He thinks I hung the moon and the stars  
I think he's a livin' dream  
Well, there are men  
But ones like him  
Are few and far between  
  
[Chorus]
