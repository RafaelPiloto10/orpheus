Bad girls  
Talking about the sad girls  
Sad girls  
Talking about bad girls, yeah  
  
See them out on the street at night, walkin'  
Picking up on all kinds of strangers  
If the price is right  
You can't score if you're pocket's tight  
But you want a good time  
  
You ask yourself who they are  
Like everybody else, they come from near and far  
  
Bad girls  
Talking about the sad girls  
Sad girls  
Talking about bad girls, yeah  
  
Friday night, and the strip is hot  
Sun's gone down, and they're out to trot  
Spirit's high, and legs look hot  
Do you want to get down?  
  
Now, don't you ask yourself who they are?  
Like everybody else, they want to be a star  
  
Now, you and me, we're both the same  
But you call yourself by different names  
Now, your mama won't like it when she finds out  
Girl is out at night  
  
Hey, mister, have you got a dime?  
Mister, do you want to spend some time? Oh, yeah  
I got what you want, you got what I need  
I'll be your baby, come and spend it on me  
  
Hey, mister I'll spend some time with you
