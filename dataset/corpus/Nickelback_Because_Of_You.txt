Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer  
Can't make this all go away  
Now that you're bleeding, you stare at the ceiling  
And watch as it all fades away  
  
From what you do...because of you...  
  
You know I can't be there each time that you call  
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all  
I know by the look that I see in your eye  
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die  
For what you do..  
  
(What you do, what you do, was because of you) x2  
  
Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness  
Doctor could you be my priest  
Say you're mistaken, but look what you've taken  
You laugh as you lie through your teeth  
  
From what you do...because of you...  
  
You know I can't be there each time that you call  
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all  
I know by the look that I see in your eye  
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die  
For what you do...  
  
(What you do, what you do, was because of you) x2
