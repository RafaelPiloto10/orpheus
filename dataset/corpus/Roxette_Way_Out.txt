I used to work it out with my head in a cloud  
A record machine playin' out loud  
I guess my fate had to turn  
Followed a star to a candle that burned  
  
Bag full of crackers an' chocolate bars  
Breakin' my back, sleepin' in cars  
Ha! I always woke up in doubt  
Well, now I know what the fuss is about  
  
Way out, out of the blue  
I met a young girl  
It could've been you  
Hey, what was I supposed to do  
I didn't want to fall in love  
  
Try to keep sane an' savin' the light  
Two things to do when you can't fight the night  
I always lay down in doubt  
Well, now I know what the fuss is about  
  
Way out, out of the blue  
I met a young girl  
It could've been you  
Hey, what was I supposed to do  
I didn't want to fall in love  
  
Sometimes you don't decide for yourself  
Sometimes you don't decide for yourself  
Sometimes you can't decide for yourself  
  
Way out, out of the blue  
Hey, what was I supposed to do  
  
Way out, out of the blue  
I met a young girl  
It could've been you  
Hey, what was I supposed to do  
I didn't want to fall in love  
  
Way out, out of the blue  
I met a young girl  
It could've been you  
Hey, what was I supposed to do  
I didn't want to fall in love  
  
I didn't want to fall in love
