Ooo  
Ooo  
Ooo, a storm is threatenin', my very life today  
If I don't get some shelter, oh I'm gonna' fade away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Ooo, see the fire sweeping up every street today  
Burns like a red coal carpet, mad bull lost it's way  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Ooo, a storm is threatenin' my very life today  
If I don't get some shelter, oh I'm gonna' fade away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
I said a love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away  
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away, kiss away, kiss away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away  
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away  
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
