[Verse 1]:  
For the love poured out  
For the price of freedom  
Let the whole earth sing  
The praises rising  
We stand in awe of what you've done  
For us, at the cross  
  
[Chorus]:  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know you forever, to love you forever  
You are our everything  
  
[Verse 2]:  
Our sin erased,  
We're forgiven  
You made a way  
You are our ransom  
And we owe this life for all you've done  
For us, at the cross  
  
[Chorus]:  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know you forever, to love you forever  
You are our everything  
  
[Bridge]:  
All we need is You  
  
[Chorus]:  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know you forever, to love you forever  
You are our everything
