Two dozen roses  
A question that poses  
As someone, who's calling your name  
Listen, the loner  
The man on the corner  
Is singing you songs at the end of the day  
  
Lady be good, lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady, my love  
Lady I run, lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
I'll wait for you there, forever I swear  
My lady, my love  
  
He gulps and he chances it  
Dances his way cross the floor  
To the place where you stand  
He's walking, he's flying  
The poor boy is trying to be by your side  
When the waltzing begins  
  
Lady be good, lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady, my love  
Lady I run, lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
I'll wait for you there, forever I swear  
My lady, my love  
  
Lady be good, lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady, my love  
Lady I run, lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
I'll wait for you there, forever I swear  
My lady, my love  
My lady, my love  
My lady, my love.
