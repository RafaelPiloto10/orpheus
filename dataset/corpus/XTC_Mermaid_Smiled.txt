From pools of xylophone clear  
From caves of memory  
I saw the children at heart  
That we once used to be  
Borne on foaming seahorse herd  
Compose with trumpeting shell  
From lines across their hands  
A song as new as new moon  
As old as all the sands  
Shrank to stagnant from Atlantic wild  
Lost that child 'til mermaid  
Smiled  
  
Summoned by drum rolling surf  
As laughing fish compel  
The young boy woken in me  
By clanging diving bell  
Breakers pillow fight the shore  
She wriggles free in the tide  
I'm locked in adult land  
Back in the mirror she slides  
Waving with comb in hand  
I was lucky to remain beguiled  
Grown to child since mermaid  
Smiled
