Would you like to hear the story of  
A girl that many soldiers know  
It's a tale of love and all its glory  
They tell when the lights are soft and low  
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate  
Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
She waits for the boy who marched away  
And though he's gone she hears him say  
"Oh promise you'll be true fare thee well Lili Marlene till I'll return to you  
Fare thee well Lili Marlene"  
With the kiss she gave her promise  
To be constant as the stars up above  
Every soldier knows she kept her promise  
And she has been faithful to her love  
(Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate  
Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
For this is the place a vow was made and breezes sing her serenade)  
Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene till I'll return to you  
Fare Thee well Lily Marlene  
  
Although each tale must have an ending  
No one knows just what the end will be  
But tonight when twilight is descending  
If you'll come along here's what you'll see  
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate  
Standing all alone every night you see her wait  
And as they go marching to the prey  
The soldiers all salute and say  
"We'll tell him you've been true.  
Fare thee well Lili Marlene till he returns to you  
Fare thee well Lili Marlene"
