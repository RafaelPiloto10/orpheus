Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
Fell apart, broke my heart, need your love, need your love  
If I could go around the world  
I couldn't find another girl, need your love  
Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
  
You make me lonely  
Why should you care  
I give you everything  
That's hardly fair  
I give you lovin'  
It's what you need  
I give you everything  
Everything in me  
It might surprise you  
But that's not the reason  
  
Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
Fell apart, broke my heart, need your love, need your love  
If I could go around the world  
I couldn't find another girl, need your love  
Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
  
You make me lonely  
Why should you care  
I give you everything  
That's hardly fair  
I give you lovin'  
It's what you need  
I give you everything  
Everything in me  
It might surprise you  
But that's not the reason  
  
Need your love
