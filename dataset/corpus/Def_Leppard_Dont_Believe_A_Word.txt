Don't believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you  
  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
That I wrote this song for you  
There might be some other silly pretty girl  
I'm singing it to  
  
Don't believe a word  
For words are only spoken  
Your heart is like a promise  
Made to be broken  
  
Don't believe a word  
Words can tell lies  
And lies are no comfort  
When there's tear in your eyes  
  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you  
  
Don't believe a word
