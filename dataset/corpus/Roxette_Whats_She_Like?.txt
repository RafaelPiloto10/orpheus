What's she like when she turns around to kiss you goodnight?  
When she wakes up in the morning by your side?  
What's she like?  
  
What's she like?  
The yellow moon or the deep blue of the sea?  
Do you feel the same way you did when it was me?  
What's she like?  
  
Oh I've been holding on  
I've been holding on for far too long  
I've been holding on  
I've been holding on much too long.  
  
What's she like when you're making love and stars are in her eyes?  
When you're looking for the answers in her smile?  
What's she like?  
  
Oh I've been holding on  
I've been holding on for far too long  
I've been holding on  
I've been holding on much too long  
Too long.  
  
I never knew I could love somebody the way I loved you  
I never thought I'd be the broken-hearted  
Well, nothing hurts you like the truth.  
So what's she like when she turns to you,  
When push comes to shove?  
When she whispers in your ear that she's in love?  
What's she like?  
  
Oh I've been holding on  
I've been holding on for far too long  
I've been holding on  
I've been holding on much too long  
So what's she like?
