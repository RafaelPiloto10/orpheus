If there is a tear on my face  
It makes me shiver to the bones  
It shakes me, Babe  
It's just a heartache that got in my eye  
And you know I never cry, I never cry  
Sometimes I drink more than I need  
Until the TV's dead and gone  
I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
And the night may pass me by  
But I'll never cry  
Take away, take away my eyes  
Sometimes I'd rather be blind  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
Open it up but don't you leave it alone  
'cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried  
And you know I'll never cry  
And you know I'll never cry  
And you know I'll never cry  
Never cry, I'll never cry  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
'cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried  
And you know I'll never cry  
Never cry  
I'll never cry
