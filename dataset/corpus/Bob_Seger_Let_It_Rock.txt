In the heat of the day, down in mobile, alabama  
Workin' on the railroad with a steel drivin' hammer  
Tryin' to get some money, get some brand new shoes  
Tryin to find a lady, chase away my blues  
Hot and wasted lord sweatin' in the sun  
'cause I'm not a foreman 'till my work is all done  
Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low  
I'll be out there waitin' for the whistle to blow  
Sittin' in the teepee smokin' out on the track  
Rollin' them bones (meaning dice) till my foreman get back  
Suddenly I hear the breakman up and shout  
There's a non-stop train comin' two miles out  
Everybody jumpin' and a scrambling around  
Tryin to get the line an get the teepee down  
Railroad owner's 'bout to go insane  
Tryin' to get the workers out the way of the train  
Here come the engineer honk his horn  
He got a non-stop train, we got to let it roll on!
