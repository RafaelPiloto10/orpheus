There is a house in new orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And god i know i'm one  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sewed my new bluejeans  
My father was a gamblin' man  
Down in new orleans  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk  
  
Oh mother tell your children  
Not to do what i have done  
Spend your lives in sin and misery  
In the house of the rising sun  
  
Well, i got one foot on the platform  
The other foot on the train  
I'm goin' back to new orleans  
To wear that ball and chain  
  
Well, there is a house in new orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And god i know i'm one
