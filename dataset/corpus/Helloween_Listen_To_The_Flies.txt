Why do you run, answer me  
Who do you follow, talk to me  
What is the hidden, that I cannot see  
What is the prize, you try to hide from me  
  
I see you dying and I listen (listen)  
And I listen (listen)  
Listen to the flies  
Listen to the flies  
  
Who is the idol you obey  
Give me a reason, you're afraid of me  
You'd never been punished or never had pride  
I see you circle round and round the shite  
  
I see you dying  
I see you dying  
  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
  
Why do you run, answer me  
Who do you follow, talk to me  
What is the hidden, that I cannot see  
What is the prize, you try to hide from me  
  
I see you dying  
I see you dying  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies
