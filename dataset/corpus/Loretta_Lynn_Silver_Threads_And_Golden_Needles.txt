I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room  
All I want is the love you promised beneath the hallow moon  
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name  
And hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheating game  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare never drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine  
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare never drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine  
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare never drown my sorrows in the warm glow of your wine  
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
