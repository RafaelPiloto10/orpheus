Why must I cry  
These tears from mine eyes  
Why must I cry  
These tears from mine eyes  
  
Making believe you love me only  
(just to love)was my great sin whoa)  
(just to love)was my great sin whoa)  
(just to love)was my great sin whoa)  
  
But I will never fall in love again  
'cause only my heart feels the pain  
  
Why must I trod  
This lonely, this lonely road  
Why must I carry  
This heavy, this heavy load  
  
Making believe you love me only  
Was my great sin  
Was my great sin  
Was my great sin  
Mm my great sin  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
'cause only my heart feels the pain  
Feels the pain  
Sad pain  
  
I will never fall in love again  
'cause only my heart feels the pain  
Feels the pain  
Why must I cry these tears from mine eyes  
Why must I cry these tears from mine eyes
