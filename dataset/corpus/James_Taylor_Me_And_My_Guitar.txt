Me and my guitar  
Always in the same mood  
I am mostly flesh and bones  
And he is mostly wood  
Never does grow impatient  
For the changes I don't know, no  
If he can't go to heaven,  
Maybe, I don't want to go, Lord.  
  
Picture me in the key of E,  
Call me Uncle John  
Any fool can easily see that we  
Go back a long time  
Feel something like fine to me,  
There's no such thing as the wrong time  
He hops up on my knee, singing,  
Get down, Pops, it's song time.  
  
Every now and then I'm a lonely man,  
It's nice to know that I've got a friend  
Puts his power right in my hand,  
All I've got to do is the best I can, if I can  
Got a dog named David,  
Got a bird named Dinah,  
Got a birthmark on my thigh  
In the shape of mainland China  
Got a somewhat southern accent  
Cause I come from Carolina,  
And if you want to find us,  
We'll be walking right behind you.  
  
I hear horns, I hear voices, I hear strings,  
Seems I was born with too many choices  
Now what am I going to do with all these extra things,  
As they serve to confuse me, really  
It's me and my guitar,  
Essentially me and my guitar  
Oh, maybe a few friends fall by for tea,  
A little bit of "who do you love?"  
But pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,  
It's me and my guitar  
Having fun, boogie-woogie, uh-huh,  
Me and my guitar.
