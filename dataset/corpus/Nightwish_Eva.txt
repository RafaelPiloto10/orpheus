6:30 winter morn  
Snow keeps falling, silent dawn  
A rose by any other name  
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home  
A kindest heart which always made  
Me ashamed of my own  
She walks alone but not without her name  
  
Eva flies away  
Dreams the world far away  
In this cruel children's game  
There's no friend to call her name  
Eva sails away  
Dreams the world far away  
The Good in her will be my sunflower field  
  
Mocked by man to depths of shame  
Little girl with life ahead  
For a memory of one kind word  
She would stay among the beasts  
Time for one more daring dream  
Before her escape, edenbeam  
We kill with her own loving heart  
  
Eva flies away  
Dreams the world far away  
In this cruel children's game  
There's no friend to call her name  
Eva sails away  
Dreams the world far away  
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
