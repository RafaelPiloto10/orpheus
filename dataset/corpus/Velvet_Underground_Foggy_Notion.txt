She's over by the corner  
Got her hands by her sides  
They hit her harder harder harder  
Till they thought she might die  
  
Well I got a foggy notion,  
Do it again  
Over by the corner,  
Do it again  
I got my calamine lotion baby,  
Do it again  
I got a foggy notion,  
Do it again  
  
She made me do something  
That I never did before  
I rushed right down  
To a flower store  
I bought her a bundle  
A beautiful batch  
Don't you know something,  
She sent 'em right back  
  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae,  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae,  
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
