If you just stop to think, here's a lesson for you  
What a word or a smile can convey  
With a word you can make someone happy or blue  
With a smile you can make them sad or gay  
  
So be careful what you say  
And be careful how you smile  
It's so easy for us to make  
Someone's life worthwhile  
  
There are smiles, that make us happy  
There are smiles, that make us blue  
There are smiles, that steal away the teardrops  
Like the Sunbeams steal away the dew  
  
There are smiles, that have a tender meaning  
That the eyes of love alone can see  
But the smiles, that fill my life with sunshine  
Are the smiles that you gave to...  
  
But the smiles, that fill my life with sunshine  
Are the smiles that you gave to me!
