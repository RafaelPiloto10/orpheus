There is an aching in my head  
From the bed I can't get used to  
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread  
As I spend my first night alone without you  
  
Honey, half of me has gone away  
With all the love I learned to cling to  
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way  
To live the rest of my life alone without you  
  
You taught me how to live  
How to be myself  
And how to give  
Oh, but now it's you  
Who's given up on giving  
  
You've lost the thing, no one to teach  
Changing and now you're out of reach  
And my life tonight just don't seem worth living  
No, no  
  
I've been sitting learning how to read  
Cause back in school I never liked to  
It's just one of those little things I'm gonna need  
As I put my life together, baby, without you
