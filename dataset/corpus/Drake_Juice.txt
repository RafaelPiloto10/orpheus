Yeh, ah... Ah  
Boy wonder... Drizzy  
Ah... Ah... Uh  
  
Yall aint really like me  
I can understand  
My flow is sitting right inside da pocket on ma pants  
I'm still fly, you can't float  
Run this ship, you same boat  
A write your favorite records, aah, you singin thoses  
20 thousand for a verse, is our routine quote  
I'm getting rich, aah, you staying broke  
Chilling if even if I'm in a goosed down coat  
I cant' see you through the Mosley Tribes  
So I don't even flinch when you throw me hi fives  
They try to measure up, but there's no my size  
Whatever 40 smokin bout to low my eyes  
Beast mode on them, a never take a night off  
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off  
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off  
Baby go ahead and cut the lights off  
Cuz It's about to go...  
  
Beat plays  
  
I hear ma phone ringing when they call  
I aint picking up or entertaining them at all  
Got your girl face down and banging on the wall  
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall  
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmmmmm  
I cannot relate  
Riding with some tags that a got from out-a-state  
Riding with a swag that a got from out-a-space  
Just show me who's the hottest Ima knock him out his place  
Call me homeside drizzy, about to kill your ego  
I'm about ma green, puffin goody like I'm celo  
You can go and take a glance at your hero  
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero  
Fantasy to you, reality to me  
And yeah ma g-pass is as valid as can be  
I'm, I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree  
Waving at your girl  
While she's smiling back at me like...
