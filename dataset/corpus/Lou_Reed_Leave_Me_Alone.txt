Everybody's gonna try to tell you what to do  
And never, never, never, never  
Let it be said that it's true  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone  
  
They're the kind of people that'll always let you down  
I know you, too, you don't ever give it a frown  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...  
  
Don't you know some people  
They just don't know when to stop  
They can't tell the floor from the ceiling or the top  
And there're other types, they always make you wait  
And they're always the first to say  
The state you come from  
  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever  
Love me, love me, love me...  
  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...
