One two button your shoe  
Put on your coat and hat  
I'll play a game like that  
While I'm waiting for you  
Three four open the door  
Hurry for heaven's sake  
I count every step you take  
While I'm waiting for you  
Five six my eyes are fixed  
On that picture of your charm  
Seven eight you're at the gate  
And you walk into my arms  
Nine ten kiss me again  
Tell me you get a thrill  
Just as I hope you will  
While I'm waiting for you
