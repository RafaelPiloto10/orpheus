My friends feel it's their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me  
But my answer yeah to all that use me stuff  
Is I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
Oh you just keep on using me until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
My brother sit me right down and he talked to me  
He told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me  
And I'm sure he meant well yeah but when our talk was through  
I said brother if you only knew you'd wish that you were in my shoes  
You just keep on using me until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
Oh sometimes yeah it's true you really do abuse me  
You get in a crowd of high class people and then you act real rude to me  
But oh baby baby baby baby when you love me I can't get enough  
I and I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
Oh you just keep on using me until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do  
It ain't too bad the way you're using me  
'Cause I sure am using you to do the things you do  
Ah ha to do the things you do
