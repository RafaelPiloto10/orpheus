Is this your life, Jackie Brown?  
Poorly educated and forced to live on the poor side of town.  
Is this your daughter, Jackie Brown?  
This pretty little girl  
In the worn out clothes  
That have been hand-me down.  
Is this your wife, Jackie Brown?  
With sad blue eyes, walking on eggshells so you don't see her frown.  
Is this your family, Jackie Brown?  
  
Dream of vacationing on a mountain stream  
And giving the world more than it gave you.  
What ugly truths freedom brings  
And it hasn't been very kind to you.  
Is this your life, Jackie Brown?  
  
Is this your meal, Jackie Brown?  
Barely enough, I've seen people throw more than this out.  
Is this your home, Jackie Brown?  
This three room shack  
With no running water  
And the bathroom out back.  
Is this your grave, Jackie Brown?  
This little piece of limestone that says another desperate man took  
Himself out.  
Is this your dream, Jackie Brown?  
  
Going nowhere and nowhere fast  
We shame ourselves to watch people like this live.  
But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown?  
Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his.  
One helluva life Jackie Brown.  
Forevermore, Jackie Brown  
Amen and amen - Jackie Brown?
