By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising  
And she'll find that note that I left hanging on the door  
And she'll laugh when she reads the part  
That says: "I'm leaving"  
Cause I've left that girl so many times before  
  
  
And by the time I get to Albuquerque, she'll be working  
And she'll take off time just to give me a call  
And she'll hear that phone keep right on ringing and ringing  
On the wall, yeah oh, that's all  
  
  
And by the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping  
She'll turn softly in her sleep and call my name out low  
And then she'll cry just to think that I'd really leave her, I left her  
But time after time after time I tried to tell her so  
But she just didn't know That I would really go  
That I would really go
