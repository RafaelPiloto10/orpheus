Well, you're a good looking woman  
Any man would go for you  
You got everything you need, darling  
Yeah, you know how to use it too  
If you let me be your love one  
I'll do anything you wish me to do  
I'd be true to you, baby  
And I would not mess around  
You make me so happy, darling  
Take you anyplace in town  
Yes, I belong to you alone  
Until you put me down  
I'm gonna try for your love, baby  
In ev'ry way I know how  
I'm gonna tweet, tweet, tweet  
Gobble, gobble or meow, meow  
I'll even quack, quack, quack or moo, moo  
Or bow, wow, wow, wow  
Yeah, I'm hung up on you, baby  
You're a fox and I ain't lying  
Ooh, the things I'll do for you  
Let me love you, I'll blow your mind  
Till that satisfaction comes  
I'll be stone lie steady trying
