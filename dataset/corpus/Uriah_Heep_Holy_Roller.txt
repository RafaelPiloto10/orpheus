I was born an only boy  
Away from palm of water  
Never heard of right or wrong  
I was given words to use  
But I knew I was different  
They wanted me to play along  
  
How much fear can I keep  
Locked away inside me  
Will all these words  
Disguise my pain  
When all your scriptures fell  
And leave us in the open  
I will survive and try again  
  
Here comes the holy roller  
Here comes the book of life  
Don't come knockin' round here  
'Cause you ain't no friend of mine  
Here comes the ghost of holy  
He comes to twist your mind  
Don't come knockin' round here  
'Cause you ain't no friend  
Ain't no friend of mine  
  
What is the price that you've put  
On your own salvation  
Count the costs for savin' souls  
Where is the sense in all this  
Door-to-door damantion  
When you're just left out in the cold
