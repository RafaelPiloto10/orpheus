I wish the world was run by all the little children  
We could be happy once again  
We won't hurt when we're like little children  
And we won't ever feel the pain  
  
Now when my fight for life on earth is over  
And i leave 'cause i can't stay  
All my love belongs to you hereafter  
And we'll all join hand another day  
  
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand  
Ev'rybody's got t fall in love , yeah  
To make ev'rybody understand  
Ev'rybody's got to give , take a hand  
  
I love you , yes i do  
I told you a million times now  
Now do you believe the words i say  
All my life belongs to you hereafter  
And we'll all join hands another day  
  
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to fall in love , yeah  
To make ev'rybody understand  
Ev'rybody's got to give , take a hand  
  
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand  
Ev'rybody's got to fall in love , yeah  
To make ev'rybody understand  
Ev'rybody's got to give, take a hand
