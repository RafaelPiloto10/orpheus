How can I go on  
When I know I gave it all  
Have I given too much?  
Something inside your heart is pushing me aside  
And it seems so on you baby  
But it's so hard on me  
What is it I'm seeing in your eyes?  
The story that I'm reading says goodbye  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
Searching for answers  
But they're oh so hard to find  
'Cause I'm still loving you, baby  
Oh, are you still loving me?  
Baby don't you turn and close the door  
Is it you don't love me any more?  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
Don't leave me now, all alone  
Don't bring me down  
'Cause I'm not that strong  
I need your love to carry on  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
Tell me baby where did we go wrong?  
How did we lose a love so strong?  
What can I say to make things right?  
Baby hold on, don't leave tonight  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye  
There's no reason why this part of us should die  
Don't say goodbye
