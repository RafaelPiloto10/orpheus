Your mother loves her brother  
But her brother loves his lover  
And his lover is my cover  
My one and only other - my angel  
  
My angel Trilby  
Who said I will be  
What I should still be  
Genius would fill me - she loves Hymie  
  
Only one Hymie  
No one else on earth could ever blind me - like this  
Or even find me - such bliss  
If you were gone  
You'd still be here  
  
Only one Hymie  
Why can't they see that life excites me  
This boy ignites me  
His family fights me  
But he's still here  
  
Only one Hymie...
