I've never had what I wanted  
I had to fight for what I've got  
I'd gamble with anything to keep from feeling  
Like a dime in a dollar slot  
  
But that's alright  
I've got one more pitch to throw  
I'd better hang on to myself tonight  
I've got one more round to go  
  
I've always had too much ambition  
And it's making me a wreck  
I'm bad with small talk,  
Feel like I've got the hand, but not a full deck  
  
But that's alright  
I've got one more ace to show  
I'd better hang on to myself tonight  
I've got one more round to go  
  
Oh, all that I want is to be left alone  
But they keep calling, thinking I'm stalling  
Oh, all that they want -give it heart  
Give it soul, don't forget rock and roll  
And by morning, need it by morning  
They say, "Let's go"  
  
My baby's been giving me a hard time  
And I don't know what to do  
I'm up sleepwalking, keep on talking  
Hell, I don't know who to  
  
But that's alright  
I've got one more chance to blow  
I'd better hang on to myself tonight  
I've got one more round to go  
I'd better hang on to my ass tonight  
I've got one more round to go
