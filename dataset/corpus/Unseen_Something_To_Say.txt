I've got something to say  
And I just can't fucking hold it anymore  
It means more to me today  
Then it ever fucking did before  
I'm a punk  
And I've finally learned what it means to me  
It doesn't dictate who I am  
I define what the word means  
  
'Cause I ain't ever scared to say  
I'm proud to be where I am today  
Always follow your dreams  
If I ever cared what people say  
I wouldn't be who I am today  
Be yourself to be free  
  
Use destruction  
It's the only way to pave salvation  
But don't forget creation  
It's the real history of this nation  
Hate and fear your government  
Because what they steal is your only covenant  
Love your land, your nation  
But don't forget there's a whole world out there waiting  
  
'Cause I ain't ever scared to say  
I'm proud to be where I am today  
Always follow your dreams  
If I ever cared what people say  
I wouldn't be who I am today  
Be yourself to be free  
  
Free!  
  
Be yourself to be free  
Be yourself to be free  
Be yourself to be free  
Be yourself to be free  
  
'Cause I ain't ever scared to say  
I'm proud to be where I am today  
Always follow your dreams  
If I ever cared what people say  
I wouldn't be who I am today  
Be yourself to be free
