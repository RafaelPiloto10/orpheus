Another day just like all the rest  
Time marches in place at this address  
I can't bring myself to change a single thing  
Every photograph still haunts me from its frame  
I still can't believe I lost your love  
Half empty closets should be proof enough  
Tho' you made it clear, there would be no turning back  
This flame burns in the face of cold hard facts  
  
Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window  
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring  
Faithfully, when I should be letting go  
Holding on like late November leaves  
Crazy Me  
  
I guess that I should get on with my life  
Soon as my heart learns the meaning of goodbye  
Take the pieces up and put them in their place  
If reality was something I could face  
Your memory is something I just can't erase  
  
Crazy Me, there's a light on in the window  
Crazy Me, waits for the phone to ring  
Faithfully, when I should be letting go  
Holding on like late November leaves  
Crazy Me
