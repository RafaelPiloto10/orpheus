Me just happy robot  
Live on hill of beans  
You and I cut from same cloth  
Rippin' at the seams  
Cut, snip, cut  
  
Don't forget to remember  
The devil's got pills in his eyes  
Look, laugh, but don't touch  
Cut you down to size  
Cut, up, cut (shut up)  
Cut, up, cut  
  
You would know  
  
My girl's all out of focus  
I ain't no big surprise  
Daddy got his gun loaded  
Got cross hairs in his eyes  
Shut up, oh  
Shut up, oh  
  
You would know  
  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know  
You would know
