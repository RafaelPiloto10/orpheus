Stop the clocks and turn the world around  
Let your love lay me down  
And when the night is over  
There'll be no sound  
  
Lock the box and leave it all behind  
On the backseat of my mind  
And when the night is over  
Where will I rise?  
  
What if I'm already dead  
How would I know?  
What if I'm already dead  
How would I know?  
  
Lost inside my head, behind the wall  
Do they hear me when I call?  
And when the night is over  
Where will I fall?  
  
And when the fight is over  
Where will I fall?  
  
What if I'm already dead  
How would I know?  
But if I'm already dead  
How would I know?  
  
Stop the clocks and turn the world around  
Let your love lay me down  
And when the night is over  
There'll be no sound  
And now the night is over  
There'll be no sound  
And now my fight is over  
There'll be no sound
