Can you see me? Begging you on my knees  
Wo yeah  
Can you see? Me baby  
Baby please don't leave  
Yeah if you can see me doing that  
You can see in the future of A thousand years  
  
Can you hear me?  
Cryin' all over town  
Yeah babe  
Can you hear me baby?  
Crying cause you put me down  
What's with ya  
If you can hear me doing that  
You can hear A freight train coming from A thousand miles  
  
Ah yeah  
Can you hear me?  
Singing this song to you  
Ah you better open up your ears  
Can you see me baby?  
Singing this song to you  
Aw shucks  
If you can hear me sing  
You better come home like you supposed to do  
  
Can you see me?  
Hey hey

Wo yeah

I don't believe you can  
You can't see me
