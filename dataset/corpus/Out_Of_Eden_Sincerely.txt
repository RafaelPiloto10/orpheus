If I had been You I would have left  
Said there's nothing else that I can do  
But You saw somethig deep inside of me  
I had no idea but I was crying for you  
Didn't have to make the sacrifice  
Didn't have to come and save my life  
Didn't have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely I'm not worthy  
Didn't have to give all that You gave  
No way I could ever walk away  
Here's the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy  
I can't believe You've chosen to reveal  
Never ending mercy towards a heart that's been so faithless  
The fact that You want to show Yourself to me  
My knees grow weak can hardly speak  
For your love has been relentless  
Didn't have to make the sacrifice  
Didn't have to come and save my life  
Didn't have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely I'm not worthy  
Didn't have to give all that You gave  
No way I could ever walk away  
Here's the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy  
How can I repay You for the things that You've done for me  
Dear God  
I call to You  
Make me more like You  
My way to say thank You  
Is do all that you say  
Didn't have to make the sacrifice  
Didn't have to come and save my life  
Didn't have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely I'm not worthy  
Didn't have to give all that You gave  
No wayi could everwalk away  
Here's the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy
