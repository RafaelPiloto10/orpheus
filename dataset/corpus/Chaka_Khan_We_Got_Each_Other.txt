CHORUS:  
Walkin' hand and hand  
As only lovers can  
You must understand  
We've got each other  
They can scream and fuss  
It won't bother us  
And that is because  
We've got each other  
I can recall memories we shared  
Such love, none other could compare  
Do you remember when you were loving me?  
Holding me? How could this love not be?  
CHORUS  
Lost in dreams, I spend the hours  
Scared in the dark, in a room that once was ours  
Do you remember when you were loving me?  
Holding me? How could this love not be?  
BRIDGE:  
We are one sharing each other's dreams  
With a love that only we could bring  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you too)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you)  
We've got each other  
I've got you (I've got you too)  
We've got each other  
We've got each other  
We've got stride for stride  
Movin' side by side  
With a strength and pride  
We've got each other  
They can scream and fuss  
It won't break our trust  
What we've got is us  
We've got each other  
We've got each other  
We've got each other
