She's been waiting in the cold  
Waiting for her moment  
Killing time  
Sitting in the ballroom  
Hoping he will notice  
  
Heavenly  
She put a spell on me  
Heavenly  
Where's she gone?  
Amelia  
  
She's been caught up in the twilight  
Always on the outside  
Slowly drowning in the water  
Drowning from the tears  
Those green eyes  
She's a pretty flower  
Waiting in wind  
  
Heavenly  
She put a spell on me  
Heavenly  
Where's she gone?  
  
So don't disappear  
Shine  
So don't disappear  
Shine  
Don't know how sometimes  
Don't know shine, shine  
See your Amelia  
There's nothing to fear  
Don't disappear  
Shine  
See your Amelia  
There's nothing to fear  
Don't disappear  
Shine  
There's noting to fear  
Don't disappear  
Amelia  
There's nothing to fear  
So don't disappear  
Shine (x2)
