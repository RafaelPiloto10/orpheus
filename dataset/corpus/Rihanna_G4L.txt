I lick the gun when I'm done  
'Cause I know revenge is sweet, so sweet  
This is a gang.  
Ladies bang, baby, bang.  
Tell me what you need? Oh  
  
Any motherfucker wanna disrespect  
Playin' with fire finna' get you wet  
How it feel down there on your knees?  
Got these girls like a solider, trippin',  
It's goin' down, down, down  
  
I'm ready to roll  
Girl, I'm with you  
If they get you they get me  
So come on! Let's go!  
Bitch, I'm with you  
If he whip you he whip me  
  
[Chorus]  
You know I'm down  
I'm down for life, loaded, reloaded  
Let's go!  
Gangsta for life 'til the day that I die  
Yeah, I promise I'll standin' high  
You know that I'm there, you know we down  
Gangsta for life  
  
We drivin' by with them headlights off  
We know where you stay  
Know what you did  
We don't play that shit  
Nigga, we don't play, no  
  
Everybody quiet when you did your dirt  
Actin' like a bitch finna' get you hurt  
Break your life down to the knees, oh  
I got these girls like a soldier, trippin',  
It's going down, down, down  
I'm ready to roll  
Girl, I'm with you  
If they get you they get me  
So come on! Let's go!  
Bitch, I'm with you  
If he whip you he whip me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl, come on we ain't done yet  
Got a lot to handle  
We ain't take over the world yet  
Boom!  
We a army  
Better yet a navy  
Better yet crazy  
Guns in the air

Can't hurt us again when you come around here  
We got our guns, got our guns, we got our guns, got our guns  
We got our guns in the motherfucking air, oh  
  
I'm down for life  
Gangsta for life  
I'm down for life  
Gangsta for life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I lick the gun when I'm done  
'Cause I know revenge is sweet
