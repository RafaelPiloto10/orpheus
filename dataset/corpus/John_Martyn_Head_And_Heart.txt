There's just now way to say how much I love you  
You never made me cry and that's just fine  
Only got my fear to put above you  
You know we all get scared from time to time  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me from your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
There's just no way to play the things I'm feeling  
No way to tell you all the things you need  
Every day I only feel like stealing away  
to where I know I can be clean  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me from your head and heart  
Love me when I'm wild  
  
Laying down the ways to say I need you  
Scared of looking tall and feeling small  
Running through the days I have decided  
Scared of being wrong and that's it all
