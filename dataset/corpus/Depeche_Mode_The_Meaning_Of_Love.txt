I've read more than a hundred books  
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times  
But despite all the places I've looked  
It's still no clearer  
I'm still no nearer  
The meaning of love  
  
Noted down all my observations  
Spent an evening watching television  
Still I couldn't say with precision  
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above  
But what's the meaning  
The meaning of love  
(tell me)  
  
From the notes that I've made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
I'm just not sure you see  
I've never been in love before  
  
Next I asked several friends of mine  
If they could spare a few minutes of their time  
Their looks suggested that I've lost my mind  
Tell me the answer  
My Lord high above  
Tell me the meaning  
The meaning of love  
  
From the notes that I've made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
I'm just not sure you see  
I've never been in love before  
  
The meaning of love  
(tell me)  
Tell me the meaning of love  
(tell me)
