Dear Mother, said a poor blind boy  
That little bird sings very long  
And do you see him in his joy  
And is he pretty as his song?  
  
The mother looked and replied  
I see that bird on yonder tree  
The poor boy smiled and softly said  
Mother I wish that I could see.  
  
Yet, I the fragrant flowers can smell  
And I can feel the green leaves shade  
And I can hear the notes that swell  
From those dear birds that God has made.  
  
So mother God to me is kind  
Though sightless he has not given  
But tell me is there any blind  
Among the children up in heaven.  
  
Blind, oh no, my friend I am not blind  
My eyes may be closed but I don't mind  
For I see things far beyond your sight  
'Cause God gave me a sense to guide me alright.  
  
You don't understand  
How happy I can be  
Friend life's not made up alone  
Of what our eyes can see.  
  
Why you can see mountains  
And rivers and trees  
And you can find beauty in the flowers  
And the birds and the bees.  
  
Why I find a beauty  
That you'll never know  
The kind that comes from way inside  
The kind that comforts so.  
  
I've learned to think of everything  
As beautiful and bright  
'Cause God gave me that inner sense  
To take the place of light.  
  
Oh nom my darlin', they all see  
But why ask me, but why ask me you think so odd  
Why mother, God's so good to me  
I thought I'd like to look at God.  
  
Will be so nice when I can see  
But mother when you get up there  
Please tell me, mother, that it's you  
Because I've never saw you here,  
  
He said no more but fondly smiled  
Until the finale blow was given  
And God took up that poor blind boy  
And opened first his eyes in heaven...
