Though the river flows  
Gently to the sea  
He was on the shore  
Rooted like a tree  
She was here and there  
Riding on the waves  
Through it all she heard his call  
And gave it all she gave.  
  
And though their love was hangin' on a limb  
She taught him how to dance and start again  
And though their love was hangin' on a limb  
She taught him how to dance.  
  
And when the melody  
Through the window called  
It echoed in the courtyard  
And whispered in the halls  
He played it through the night  
She knew he had to go  
There was something about freedom  
He thought he didn't know.  
  
And though their love was hangin' on a limb  
She taught him how to dance and start again  
And though their love was hangin' on a limb  
She taught him how to dance.  
  
Though the river flowed  
Gently to the sea  
He was on the shore  
Rooted like a tree  
She was here and there  
Riding on the waves  
Through it all she heard his call  
And gave it all she gave.  
  
And though their love was hangin' on a limb  
She taught him how to dance.
