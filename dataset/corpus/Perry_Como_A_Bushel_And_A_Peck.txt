Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doodle oodle, ooh doo  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doo  
What'cha doin' Hutton?  
Doodlin', can you doodle?  
Can I doodle? I can't get it outta my noodle  
How come?  
'Cause I love you a bushel an' a peck  
A bushel an' a peck and a hug around the neck  
Hug around the neck and a barrel an' a heap  
Barrel an' a heap an' I'm talkin' in my sleep  
About you, about me? Yes, about you  
My heart is leapin', havin' trouble sleepin'  
'Cause I love you a bushel an' a peck  
You bet your purdy neck I do  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doodle oodle, ooh doo  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doo  
Do you like me Perry? Oh very, do you like me Hutton?  
Like a glutton, so, where's your 'Como' button?  
Oh, I love you a bushel an' a peck  
A bushel an' a peck though you make my heart a wreck  
Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess  
Make my life a mess, yes a mess of happiness  
About you, about me? Yes, about you  
You're gonna grieve me, if an' you ever leave me  
'Cause I love you a bushel an' a peck  
You bet your purdy neck I do  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doodle oodle, ooh doo  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doo  
Heh heh, it's gettin' kinda quiet around here  
Oh, we can fix that Perry boy, let's go  
I love you a bushel an' a peck  
A bushel an' a peck and it beats be all to heck  
Beats me all to heck how I'll ever tend the farm  
Ever tend the farm when I wanna keep my arms about you  
About you, the cows an' chickens  
Let 'em go to the dickens  
'Cause I love you a bushel an' a peck  
You bet your purdy neck I do  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doodle oodle, ooh doo  
Doodle oodle ooh doo, doo  
It's gettin' kinda quiet again  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doodle oodle, ooh doo  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doo  
An octave lower please!  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doodle oodle, ooh doo  
Doodle oodle, ooh doo, doo
