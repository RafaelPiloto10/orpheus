I don'T wanna talk about it anymore  
As far as I'M concerned you'D best be out that door  
I'M tired of making things work out all by myself  
I suggest you go and find somebody else ooh...  
I thought I couldn'T live without you here with me  
Guess I was just A fool I was too blind to see  
Now I ain'T gonna make the same mistakes again  
Oh I can'T believe how hard it is for you to understand  
That to love me  
You gotta be true you'Ve gotta be true  
You'Ve got to know just what to say  
(can'T tell you what to do)  
You wouldn'T make me cry  
Wouldn'T hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
I remember when we used to talk (used to talk, and...)  
I remember when we used to walk (hand in hand)  
I'D see how much you love me when I looked into your eyes  
But now it seems like no matter what I do or say  
To try to show you how much I miss our yesterday  
I just can'T get through to you  
What I must do to make you realize  
That to love me  
You gotta be true you'Ve gotta be true  
Got to know just what to say (can'T tell you what to do)  
You wouldn'T make me cry  
Wouldn'T hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
Ooh... I wanna feel that way again  
Tryin' hard to fight the pain from deep within  
I don'T wanna let go after all that we'Ve been through  
But if you don'T feel the same anymore  
If you no longer love me like you did before  
Just tell me so I'Ll know what I'M supposed to do  
Save my heart for someone who...  
Someone who will love me  
Who'Ll always be true, who'Ll always be true  
Who'S gonna know just what to say  
Who'Ll always know what to do  
Who'Ll never make me cry  
Never hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
Ooh I remember when you used to love me  
(You used to love me)  
Ooh... ooh...  
I remember mmmmm.
