And now the air is clear, my dear and you're still here and so  
A certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise  
Silence has never been my thing  
I'm one of those, I love to shout and sing about my love  
Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise  
  
Soft and certain, tell the moon? My love is how I think of you and so  
With certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise  
Laughter has always been my thing  
I'm one of those, oh I love to shout and sing about my love  
Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise  
  
Oh, we're too sensitive, my dear two fugitives from fear and so  
With a certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise  
Silence has never been my thing  
I'm one of those, I love to shout and sing about my love  
Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise
