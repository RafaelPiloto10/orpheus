[Hello.  
It's nice to meet you.  
Your very cute.  
Rubber man.]  
  
I can't help myself,  
I'm in love.  
  
And when I get back,  
From outer space,  
I'm gonna punch him in his face.  
  
He's the moon,  
Then I'm eclipsed  
  
I'm so lunar yeah,  
When I get to him,  
I'll run him over with my rocket ship.  
  
My eyeliner,  
Runs, in, constellations  
For you dear.  
If only, I could,  
Reboot my mechanical heart,  
I'd think clear.

Baby with you I'm a different girl,  
(Uh-oh, oh)  
You're my future love.  
  
Baby could we make a home in the stars,  
Baby somewhere in a galaxy far,  
(Uh-oh, oh)  
You're my future love.

And our situ-ations,  
Workin' out our sex equations  
  
And I'm no,

Cause' my hair is blond,  
But my heart is brunette,  
If I'm not on you,  
  
And at lease I'm honest.

Runs, in, con-ste-llations,  
For you dear,

For a minute.
