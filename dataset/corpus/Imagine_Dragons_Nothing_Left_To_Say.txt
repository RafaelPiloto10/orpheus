Who knows how long  
I've been awake now?  
The shadows on my wall don't sleep  
They keep calling me  
Beckoning...  
Who knows what's right?  
The lines keep getting thinner  
My age has never made me wise  
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on  
  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
  
Below my soul  
I feel an engine  
Collapsing as it sees the pain  
If I could only shut it out  
I've come too far  
To see the end now  
Even if my way is wrong  
I keep pushing on and on and on and on  
  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
  
I keep falling, I keep falling down...  
If you could only save me  
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul  
  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...
