Saturday night and I just got paid  
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save  
My heart says "go go, have a time"  
Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine  
  
I'm gonna rock it up  
Rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up  
Gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it  
And ball tonight  
  
Well almost 'bout ten I'll be flying high  
I'll rock on out unto the sky  
I don't care if I spend my dough  
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul  
  
I'm gonna rock it up  
Rip it up  
I'm gonna shake it up  
Gonna ball it up  
I'm gonna rock it  
And ball tonight  
  
Saturday night and I just got paid  
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save
