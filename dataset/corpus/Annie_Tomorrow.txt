The sun will come out  
Tomorrow  
Bet your bottom dollar  
That tomorrow  
There'll be sun!  
  
Just thinkin' about  
Tomorrow  
Clears away the cobwebs,  
And the sorrow  
'Til there's none!  
  
When I'm stuck with a day  
That's grey,  
And lonely,  
I just stick out my chin  
And Grin,  
And Say,  
Oh  
  
The sun come out  
Tomorrow  
So ya gotta hang on  
'Til tomorrow  
Come what may  
  
Tomorrow!  
Tomorrow!  
I love ya  
Tomorrow!  
  
You're always  
A day  
Away!  
  
Tomorrow!  
Tomorrow!  
I love ya  
Tomorrow!  
  
You're always  
A day  
Away!
