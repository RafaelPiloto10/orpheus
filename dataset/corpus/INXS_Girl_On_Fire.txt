I just landed  
Girl on fire  
I felt the heat  
From Sydney to London  
  
Well she shut my mouth  
With her repartee  
I opened hers  
With the rest of me  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
  
Outta the shadows  
Comes a dirty song  
Yeah, the same old faces  
Try to keep you in line  
  
I saw you laughing  
At the very first show  
You lit up the city  
From the twenty-sixth floor  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Aw, what's saving her?  
  
Burn, burn, burn  
Burn, burn, burn  
  
I just landed  
Girl on fire  
I felt the heat  
From New York to London  
  
Well she shut my mouth  
With a repartee  
I opened hers  
With the things that I say  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
That's the heat that burns  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
How the flames make you learn  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
How the flames make me yearn  
  
Girl on fire  
Girl on fire  
Girl on fire  
Girl on, girl on  
  
Flame's are rising  
Flames are rising  
Girl, girl, girl, girl girl on fire  
Burning brighter
