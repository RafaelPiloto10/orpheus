Spectators line the avenue  
The players step out right on cue  
And every night just seems the same  
Nameless faces play their game  
  
The midnight gamblers place their bets  
The tight-rope walkers check their nets  
Then comes the queen of broken hearts  
This is the way it always starts  
  
Finders find love for the evening  
Keepers keep the love they've found  
Losers lose and wind up weeping  
But it's the only game in town  
  
All hail the third string debutante  
She tries to act so nonchalant  
Chasin' the prince of alibis  
Into a smokescreen made of lies  
  
Finders find love for the evening  
Keepers keep the love they've found  
Losers lose and wind up weeping  
But it's the only game in town  
  
My window looks down on the set  
Each night the players strut and fret  
So if you'd like to join the rest  
Just choose the part that suits you best  
  
Finders find love for the evening  
Keepers keep the love they've found  
Losers lose and wind up weeping  
But it's the only game in town
