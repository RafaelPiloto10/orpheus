Autumn, it feels like autumn  
Although the breeze is still  
I feel the chill of autumn  
Oh, yes, it's autumn  
It's always autumn  
However green the hill  
To me it still is autumn  
I can feel the frost now  
That makes my spring and summer dreams  
Seem lost now  
Why can't the autumn haze  
Recall the days of warm summer laughter?  
That faded soon after in the autumn  
He left in autumn  
And though another season's here  
I feel the emptiness of autumn  
All the year...
