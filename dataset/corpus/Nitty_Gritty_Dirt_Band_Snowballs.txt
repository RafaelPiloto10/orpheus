If I could borrow from the future  
And I'd spend it with you, darling, in a very special  
I'd treat you to a sundae on a Saturday afternoon  
And we'd spend the night together throwing snowballs at the moon  
  
We'd be aiming high and we'd be aiming low,  
Winding up together, lord, and lettin' them snowballs go  
And after every throw we'd share a little kiss  
Make sweet love together every time we'd miss  
  
Oh I'd like to meet the artist who painted up the sky  
And I'd ask him what that color was he brushed against your eyes  
And could he paint a picture of two lovers in one balloon  
Who go flying off together to throw snowballs at the moon  
  
We'd be aiming high, we'd be aiming low  
Winding up together, lord and letting them snowballs go  
And after every throw we'd share a little kiss  
Make sweet love together everytime we'd miss  
  
If we could stop the world from spinning take it nice and slow I bet that we
could hit once just before we go  
But we keep aiming high, we keep aiming low chorus
