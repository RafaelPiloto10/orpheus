"Lucky" I call you 'cus that's the way you make me feel.  
Love in the air and the wind in my hair is makin' me real.  
Look out Lucky there's a mountain in front of you.  
And with a little luck we'll see it thru.  
What's lucky for me is lucky for you.  
  
I used to think that luck was just another four letter word.  
But now that I found you it's the finest one I've ever heard.  
Do you see the stars now do you Lucky?  
They're not all that far, now are they Lucky?  
What's lucky for you, is lucky for me,  
And what's lucky for me, is lucky for you.
