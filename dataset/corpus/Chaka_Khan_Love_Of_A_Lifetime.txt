Love of a lifetime  
Good for you (heart of change)  
Got to be the heart of change  
Good for me - a heart of change  
I know we'll get it better  
Stir it up (got to be)  
Stir it tender heartedly  
Stir it and  
The whole world's gettin' better  
  
[Bridge]  
I believe the world to be  
Fast and ever changing  
That's the way my love will be  
Got to last and satisfy me  
  
[Chorus]  
You got the love of a lifetime  
You're such a rock steady lover, baby  
Keep up the good love for chaka  
You can hold it, boy  
'cause you don't let it go  
  
Good for you  
Good for me  
The way we work together  
Short and sweet (hit and run)  
I know where you're comin' from  
We can steal  
And baby, we'll hit and run together  
  
[Bridge]  
  
We got the love of a lifetime  
Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby  
Keep up the good love together  
We can hold it, boy  
And never let it go  
  
We got the love of a lifetime  
We got to keep on rockin' steady  
I really think I'm ready now  
Baby, I'm burnin', burnin', burnin'  
  
You got the love of a lifetime  
You're such a rock steady lover, baby  
Keep up the good love for chaka  
You can hold it, boy, never let it go  
We got the love of a lifetime  
Ooh, we're such rock steady lovers, baby  
Keep up the good love together  
Hold it, boy  
  
Love of a lifetime  
(love of a lifetime)  
We got the love, we got the love  
We got the love  
Guess it's just a heart of change  
We got the love, we got the love  
We got the love  
It's got to be a heart of change  
We got the love, we got the love...
