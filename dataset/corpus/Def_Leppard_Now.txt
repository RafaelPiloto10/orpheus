I want to know you better  
Let's spend some time together  
I'm gonna be what's on your mind  
  
Look in my eye's they're calling  
I need your love to fall in  
If you could just give me a sign  
  
I can't get over baby  
I can't get over now  
I can't get over this feeling, I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Now,right now  
It's the fire inside you  
Feels like I feel  
NOW,right now  
Deep inside me  
Deep inside me  
  
I'm tired of make believin', I'm lost and barely breathin'  
I'm on the ceiling help me down, yeah  
I'll be the risk your takin'  
And I won't rest until your mine, oh  
  
I want to show you baby  
I want to show you now  
I want to tell you this feeling I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't get over this feeling I feel right now  
Yeah.  
Now,right now  
Let the fire inside you  
Burn like I burn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deep inside  
Deep inside me  
Deep inside me  
Deep inside
