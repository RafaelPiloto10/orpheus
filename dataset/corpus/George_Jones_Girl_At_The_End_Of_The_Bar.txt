If you'd ever been drinking  
I know that you'd seen her  
At the end of the bar all alone  
She knows what you're thinking  
When you try to approach her  
And anything you say might be wrong.  
  
She's not there for company  
She don't like to remember  
She once let herself go too far  
She's not there to complain  
She just wants to remain  
The girl at the end of the bar.  
  
The girl at the end of the bar  
Who once let herself go too far  
Now carries love like a scar  
The girl at the end of the bar  
  
She had so many hard knocks  
She don't play the jukebox  
She's lived all those sad songs first hand  
What's made her so bitter  
And why love has quit her  
Is because she has loved the wrong man.  
  
The smile she's not wearing  
Is the sign she's not caring  
And the part of her permanence call  
She's not there to complain  
She just wants to remain  
The girl at the end of the bar.  
  
She's the girl at the end of the bar
