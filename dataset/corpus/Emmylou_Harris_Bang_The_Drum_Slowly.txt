I meant to ask you how to fix that car  
I always meant to ask you about the war  
And what you saw across a bridge too far  
Did it leave a scar  
  
Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel  
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal  
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels  
How did it feel  
  
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  
To dust be returning from dust we begin  
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy  
Above and below me world without end  
  
I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost  
And your fate was in a game of dice they tossed  
There was still that line that you would never cross  
At any cost  
  
I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed  
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve  
And if you ever really were deceived  
By the likes of me  
  
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  
To dust be returning from dust we begin  
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy  
Above and below me world without end  
  
Gone now is the day and gone the sun  
There is peace tonight all over Arlington  
But the songs of my life will still be sung  
By the light of the moon you hung  
  
I meant to ask you how to plow that field  
I meant to bring you water from the well  
And be the one beside you when you fell  
Could you tell  
  
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  
To dust be returning from dust we begin  
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy  
Above and below me world without end
