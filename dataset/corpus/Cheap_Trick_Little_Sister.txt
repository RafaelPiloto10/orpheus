Well I've been around here for way too long  
It's really time to go  
But there's reasons for my madness  
Though it doesn't show  
I sit and wait and contemplate what am I gonna say  
When the telephone rings I hear her voice  
She speaks that special way  
Alright now, little sister  
Wait all night for the call  
She's alright with me  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
Something's flowing through my veins  
What it is I don't know  
It's a three alarm fire in my heart  
Hope it doesn't show  
Call the doctor, call the judge  
Justice of the peace  
Pluck this flower in full bloom  
This relative's no niece  
Alright now, little sister  
Wait all night for the call  
  
She's alright with me  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
I'm at the crossroads waiting for a call  
Back against the wall again  
But I'm not just expecting anyone  
When I get the call that says it all  
She says yeah (robin, I'll be right over)  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister  
  
Oh, I like it when you talk dirty to me  
  
She's so hot, she's on fire  
Oh little sister  
Fills me up with desire  
Oh little sister  
Sun goes down when she gets up  
I don't think I can get enough  
Little sister, little sister  
Little sister, little sister
