Cut me, cut me with your tongue then love me when it?s over  
You don't even know just how you much you taunt me  
Taunting and provoking, keep words unspoken  
Pandora?s box is open  
Blame brings pain, accusations seal these walls  
Walls built up to shield from pain  
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain  
And we need to stop  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it babe  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it babe  
Piercing, piercing with my actions, spitefully ignore you  
I don't even care just how much you take  
Bitten and it?s potent, you hate it and I know it  
Pandora?s box is open  
Blame brings pain, accusations seal these walls  
Walls built up to shield from pain  
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain  
And we need to stop  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it babe  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it babe  
These walls get high baby  
These walls get high baby  
These walls get high baby  
It won't ever come down  
These walls get high baby  
These walls get high baby  
These walls get high baby  
It won't ever come down  
Round and round like the game roulette  
Step on up kid and place your bet  
Round and round is the route we choose  
Play that game man, we all gonna lose  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it babe  
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver  
(It goes around)  
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it babe
