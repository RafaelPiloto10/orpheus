Look at this world  
It's filled with worn out places  
Forgotten faces  
And nothing changes  
  
Whatever happened  
To that new day rising  
We're just surviving  
And living is dying  
  
Are you tired  
Of being let down  
Another day  
Another shakedown  
  
I'm with you  
We hope is gone  
All you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
when it seems no use  
I'm with you  
  
I'm with you  
If I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
  
I walk in shadows  
That seem all familiar  
I've read the papers  
A life forsaken  
  
A mumble some from  
I'm one more for sale sign  
Down on Main street  
You just walk by  
  
How many times you gotta  
Break down  
Before somebody's  
Gonna shout out  
I'm with you  
  
We hope is gone  
All you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
When it seems no use  
I'm with you  
  
If I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
  
When hope is gone  
And all you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
When it seems no use  
It seems no use, It seems no use  
  
When I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)
