Listen to me now  
No words, I can say, can describe  
How I hate your fucking face  
And do you hear me now  
You stole my soul with your lies  
Your killing zone's where I lie  
There you watched me die  
  
You fucken suck  
  
Can you see yourself I lie in my bed  
Fantasizing your death  
Here I lie  
Can you see yourself  
And how do you sleep with what you are?  
What you turned out to be  
Fuck you, kill yourself  
  
You fucken suck  
  
Liar you know I do I wish you well  
Liar I died for you I wish you well in hell ...in hell
