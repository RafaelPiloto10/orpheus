My first impression of you  
Was like the sight of flowers in spring  
You were a glorious thing to see  
  
My first impression of you  
Was something indescribably new  
I stood there looking at you  
Smiling at me  
  
If you had stepped right out of heaven  
It wouldn't surprise me more  
I thought you were an angel  
From heaven's door  
  
It may sound silly, but true  
My heart just stopped  
When I caught your eye  
So overwhelming  
Was my first impression of you
