They all were there, the court was full  
The king beside his queen  
His love was cold, the fool will dance  
for her 'till end of time,  
  
The queen is in love,  
The queen is in love.  
  
She couldn't help her burning heart,  
And now he's burning too.  
Their love was blind,  
They will dance until the end of time.  
  
Queen is in love  
Queen is in love  
  
The furious king now has learned  
He sentenced them to burn.  
Forever one,  
They are joined in death eternally  
  
Queen is in love  
Queen is in love
