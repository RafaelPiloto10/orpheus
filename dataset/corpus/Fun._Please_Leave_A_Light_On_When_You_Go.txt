How fast can a heart shatter  
Before you're walking on splinters?  
Your head aches just to feel what it knows  
Please leave a light on when you go  
  
How can you fix something  
That you can't touch without hurting?  
The lesson you've learned is leaving you dumb  
Please leave a light on when it's done  
  
Standing high above the flood line  
Watching all your belongings go by  
  
How can you see the ending  
When you're lost at the beginning?  
The day hides all that the night left behind  
Please turn a light on when it dies
