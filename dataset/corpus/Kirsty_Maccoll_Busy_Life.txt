A busy life keeps a body busy  
With so many same old things to do  
So why not stop a while and take a good look around?  
Maybe you will find out something new to you  
Like how do the trees make noises?  
And where does the wind come from?  
When and why do dragonflies say "Hey, what's going on?"A busy life keeps a
body busy  
If you never take the time of day  
To ask yourself "Is there something else?"  
And maybe find the answer's just a stone's throw away  
A busy life keeps a body busy
