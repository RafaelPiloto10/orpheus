No, he is not extra-special  
At time he stress another face in the clouds  
But each time he smiles, that's when I stumble  
I'm so proud he's the one that I love  
Refrain:  
Oh, he's good, he's my boy  
True his strength, I could not explain just  
Why I loved him  
Yes, he may be so old-fashioned  
At times, he dresses in a way out of style  
Oh, each time he holds me, and that's when I stumble  
I'm so proud he's the one that I love  
(Repeat Refrain)  
He's my boy,  
I could not explain just  
Why I loved him  
Yeah, he's not rich neither handsome  
Then I'm not myself a queen nor a star  
Oh, but I know for sure  
I know that he cares for me  
I'm so proud he's the one  
I'm so glad I'm the girl that he chooses to have  
I'm so proud he's the one...  
He's the one that I love.........
