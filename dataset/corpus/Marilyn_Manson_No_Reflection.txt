Crushing, cheating, changing  
Am I deaf or dead?  
Is this constricting construction  
Or just streets with rusty signs  
Of something violent coming?  
  
This'll hurt you worse than me  
I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak  
Don't run from me I won't  
Bother counting one, two, three  
  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
Show myself how to make a noose  
A gun's cliche, and a razor too  
I'm not a death share vacation, vacant station  
Made of scars and filled with my old wounds  
  
This'll hurt you worse than me  
I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak  
Don't run from me I won't  
Bother counting one, two, three  
  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
You, you don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you  
  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
I don't know which me that I love  
Got no reflection  
  
No Reflection  
No Reflection  
  
I've got no reflection
