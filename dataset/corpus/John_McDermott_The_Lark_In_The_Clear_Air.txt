The lark in the clear air : to my sister margaret  
  
Dear thoughts are in my mind  
And my soul soars enchanted  
As I hear the sweet lark sing  
In the clear air of the day  
For a tender beaming smile  
To my hope has been granted  
And tomorrow she shall hear  
All my fond heart would say  
I should tell her all my love  
All my soul's adoration  
And I think she will hear me  
And will not say me nay  
It is this that gives my soul  
All it's joyous elation  
As I hear the sweet lark sing  
In the clear air of the day
