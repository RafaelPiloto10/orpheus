I reside in 209, you're in 208  
You moved in last Friday night  
And I just couldn't wait  
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday  
But a lineup formed outside your door  
And I was way too late  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else  
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with  
I want to be that someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that you're with  
I've got to be that someone that you're with  
And I'm pacing by the phone  
'Cause I hate to be alone  
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss  
God, I want to be that someone that you're with  
  
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday  
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake  
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at four AM  
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else  
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that you're with  
I've got to be that someone that you're with  
And I'm pacing by the phone  
'Cause I hate to be alone  
And if you're out there with him somewhere, and just about to kiss  
God, I've got to be that someone that...  
I want to be that someone that...  
I've got to be that someone that you're with
