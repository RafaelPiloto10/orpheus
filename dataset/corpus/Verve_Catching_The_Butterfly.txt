As though you were born  
And so you thought  
The future's ours  
To keep and hold  
  
A child within  
Has healing ways  
It sees me through  
My darkest days  
  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
  
In my lucid dreams  
In my lucid dreams  
  
Something now  
Through life no fun  
I want to feel  
I want to run  
  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
  
In my lucid dreams  
In my lucid dreams  
  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
Keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
In that dream of mine  
I'm gonna keep catching that butterfly  
  
In my private dreams  
In my private dreams  
In my private dreams  
My lucid dreams  
  
My forgotten schemes  
I see through you  
You see through me  
I see through you  
  
You see through me  
Be with me  
Be with me  
I see through you  
  
You see through me  
I see through you  
You see through me  
  
To be in your eyes  
To be in your eyes
