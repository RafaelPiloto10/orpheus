Right from the first day one man stood alone  
And somehow he missed what didn't exist how could he have known  
He looked all around him and lifted his head  
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said  
  
This place needs a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
Up through the ages, the story's the same  
A king to himself, alone with his wealth is living in vain  
His castle will crumble and he'll wonder why  
'Cause wealthy or poor, there's one thing for sure, he just can't deny  
  
The need of a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
I was a drifter who couldn't be tamed  
So reckless and wild but lost like a child  
Whose dreams never came  
  
Then I felt the pleasures of love's happiness  
One look in her eyes and I realized  
I've truly been blessed  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man
