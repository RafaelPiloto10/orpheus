Worry 'bout my worries  
Lately all I seem to do  
Worry 'bout my worries  
Lately all I seem to do  
One day I'm gonna get better, babe  
Then I'm gonna take a little time to worry  
All about you  
  
Bad moves of a lifetime  
Moving back to trouble me  
Bad moves of a lifetime  
Moving back to trouble me  
Will consequence keep me waiting  
Or this time, will my anger set me free?  
  
My cats hanging on the wall  
My clocks are roaming about  
I like to keep my feet warm  
But the fire keeps going out  
I've been waiting on good times for so long  
I hope them good times ain't long gone  
  
Big, black car keep on driving by  
Twice a day stopping at my door  
Winter girls dressed for springtime  
I know they're trouble for sure  
I've been waiting on good times for so long  
Hope them good times aren't long gone  
  
Worry 'bout my worries  
Lately all I seem to do  
Worry 'bout my worries  
Lately all I seem to do  
I know I'm gonna get better, babe  
Then I'm gonna take a little time to worry  
All about you  
All about you  
All about you  
All about you
