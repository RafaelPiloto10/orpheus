Ninja? You're a ninja? Get out of here, you're a ninja!  
Yes, I am a ninja.  
  
I read the rules before I broke 'em  
I broke the chains before they choked me out  
Now I pay close attention  
Really learn the code  
I learned to read the map before I hit the road  
  
Hey yo, I know you never heard this before  
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war  
And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it  
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor  
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed  
Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store  
Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts  
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears  
I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse  
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do  
Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose  
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views  
No, I was a first class rookie,  
Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie  
Man of mystery, you know the history  
Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here  
  
I read the rules before I broke 'em  
I broke the chains before they choked me out  
And I pay close attention  
Really learn the code  
I learned to read the map before I hit the road  
  
(But we say)  
  
Nobody's gonna see me comin'  
Nobody's gonna hear a sound  
No matter how hard they tryin'  
No stoppin' me since I've found  
My inner ninja [4x]  
  
Hey yo, I've been high and I've been real low  
I've been beaten and broken but I healed though  
So many ups and downs, roughed up and clowned  
We all got problems, but we deal though  
I'm tryin' to do better now, find my inner peace  
Learn my art form, and find my inner Chi  
When my backs on the wall, I don't freeze up  
Nah, I find my inner strength and I re-up  
Here we go, I know I've never been the smartest or wisest  
But I realize what it takes  
Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises  
But gotta make it to the next day  
It's a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run  
Like you're runnin' outta air and your breath won't come  
And you (uh) wheezin', gotta keep it movin'  
Find that extra (uhn) and push your way through it  
  
I've had bad habits but I dropped em, I dropped em  
I've had opponents but I knocked them out  
I climbed the highest mountains  
I swum the coldest seas  
There ain't a thing I've faced that's been too much for me  
  
(but we say)  
Nobody's gonna see me comin'  
Nobody's gonna hear a sound  
No matter how hard they tryin'  
Nobody's gonna bring me down  
  
Nobody's gonna see me comin'  
Nobody's gonna hear a sound  
No matter how hard they tryin'  
No stoppin' me since I've found  
My inner ninja [4x]

Man, that was dope!  
You think?  
What're you, like, a third degree black belt?  
Actually, I'm not even in karate but I've found... My inner ninja!
