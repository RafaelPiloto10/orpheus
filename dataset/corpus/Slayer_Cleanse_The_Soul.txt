Body that rests before me,  
With every dying breath,  
Spellbound and gagged,  
I commence your flesh to dirt.  
  
Body that lay before me,  
In everlasting death.  
Entombed in abscess,  
To rot and lie stinking in the earth.  
  
Empty altar awaits its victim  
Stained glass windows black.  
Candles burn the midnight oil,  
Incense fills the night.  
  
Observing trance awaking state  
Lying still unknowing.  
Reciting the passages of time  
Prepare for the impaling.  
  
Death's an art, flesh and earth never part,  
A power of the mind.  
Death shines on the air of silence,  
A ritual of endless time.  
  
Purged of your dead body,  
Sacrificed of your life.  
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire  
Enter the kingdom of desire.
