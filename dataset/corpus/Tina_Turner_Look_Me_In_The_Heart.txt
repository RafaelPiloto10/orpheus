Last night we tried to touch but we never got close  
Last night we tried to talk, the words got caught in our throats  
When we finally fell asleep  
We couldn't have been further apart  
  
Look me in the heart  
If you think that love is blind  
Baby look me in the heart  
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby  
And it's not in my mind  
Can't you look me in the heart  
Look me in the heart  
  
You try to say that I'm hiding from you  
You act like a spy always looking for clues  
You've read about my past  
But why don't we try to make a new start  
  
Look me in the heart  
If you think that love is blind  
Baby look me in the heart  
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby  
And it's not in my mind  
Can't you look me in the heart  
Look me in the heart  
  
Remember how good we used to be together  
Remember baby, so be tender baby  
Remember the love we said would last forever  
I know we can make it like that again
