  
Take my hand  
And don't let go  
Trust this man  
And let it flow  
  
Don't take me down  
Cause I'm not done  
Don't steal my crown  
Before it's won  
The wide expanse  
The wheel of chance  
Will turn my way  
The sky will not be gray  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
Take my hand  
And don't let go  
Trust this man  
And let it flow  
  
I drank in every bar in town  
I filled my cup when I was down  
I saw the things I wanted to see  
Became the man I wanted to be  
But then somehow I lost my way  
I've got to get back there today  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
I lie awake at night, or wait until it's light  
I want it to be free, I thought that I was right  
  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right
