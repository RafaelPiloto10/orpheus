So you're back on top again  
Proving everybody wrong  
But I recall the days  
You didn't feel so strong  
When love struck you down  
You thought that you were bound to die  
From all the pain inside  
When love struck you down  
  
When they were handing out the brains  
You were at the head of the queue  
But once she got inside your heart  
They were no use to you  
When love struck you down  
No one else was fooled  
Fear and madness ruled  
When love struck you down  
  
You weren't there  
When she was everywhere  
Her face, her name  
But no matter what you said  
She never felt the same  
  
When love struck you down  
Oh how hard you prayed  
But God didn't come to your aid  
When love struck you down  
  
When love struck you down  
You felt like you were bound to die  
From all the pain inside  
When love struck you down  
  
When love struck you down  
No one else was fooled  
Fear and madness ruled  
When love struck you down
