(Lorrie Morgan)  
  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared  
And the soul felt its worth  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine  
  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error-pining  
Till he appeared  
And the soul felt it's worth  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine
