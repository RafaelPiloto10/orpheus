As he sat down upon the train  
Silence settled in his brain  
He reached out his hand  
And touched her hair  
He struggled with the  
Same old though  
Should he tell her  
Should he not  
He felt her presence  
Everywhere  
  
Whatever comes between us  
Don't let it stand in your way  
This is what he'd come  
Here to say  
  
She just smiled  
And read a book  
Gave him such a  
Gentle look  
He felt a pain right  
Through his chest  
He pictured back to  
When they met  
Open door on a movie set  
Her brown eyes took  
His breath  
  
And every word she  
Spoke to him  
Went like a bullet to his  
Heart  
That's what he remembers  
From the start  
  
Now they're off  
Searching in vain  
Out of control  
Just like a runaway train  
Can't see that it's  
Not up to them  
Soon just like a river  
They'll be rack home again  
  
He sat up through  
The hours it takes  
Passing through the  
Northern lakes  
Til the sleeping giant was in his sight  
He knew that she'd been drifting some  
Wondered where his  
Faith had gone  
He stayed awake most  
Of the night  
Whatever makes you happy  
I won't stand in your way  
Words you hope you never  
Have to say  
  
Now they're off  
Searching in vain  
Out of control  
Just like a runaway train  
Can't see that it's  
Not up to them  
Soon just like a river  
They'll be rack home again  
  
She watched him toss  
And try to sleep  
Struggle with his  
Demons deep  
She thought of all  
That they'd been through  
Imagining her life alone  
No where he was  
That was home  
She wondered if he knew  
  
That every word  
He spoke to her  
Went like a bullet  
To her heart  
That's the way it's  
Been right from  
The start  
  
Now they're off  
Searching in vain  
Out of control  
Just like a runaway train  
Can't see that it's  
Not up to them  
Soon just like a river  
They'll be rack home again
