Everybody loves somebody sometime  
Everybody falls in love somehow  
Something in your kiss just told me  
(That) my sometime is now  
  
Everybody finds somebody someplace  
There's no telling where love may appear  
Something in my heart keeps saying  
(That) my someplace is here  
  
If I had it in my power  
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm  
Then every minute, every hour  
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms  
  
Everybody loves somebody sometime  
And although my dream was overdue  
Your love made it well worth waiting  
For someone like you
