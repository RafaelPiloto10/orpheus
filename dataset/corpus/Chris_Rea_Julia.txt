Eyes so bright, so big and wide  
Make you feel so strange  
Somewhere deep inside  
It's the face of an angel  
Soul of the devil may care  
  
How I'd love to know  
What goes on in there  
  
She needs your love  
She needs it every day  
But speak of love  
See her laugh and run away  
  
Julia, which way will you go  
Julia, I want to know  
Julia, only the moon and stars  
Julia, know just where you are  
Julia  
  
See the dance that needs no alibi  
Oh you don't need to dream  
When you know you can fly  
  
She needs your love  
She needs it every day  
But speak of love  
See her laugh and run away  
  
Julia, which way will you go  
Julia, I want to know  
Julia, only the moon and stars  
Julia, know just where you are  
Julia
