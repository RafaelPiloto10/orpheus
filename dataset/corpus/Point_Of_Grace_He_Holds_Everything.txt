Waiting for that other shoe to drop  
And you swear this world's gonna come to a stop  
Drowning on dry land a can't come up for air  
Your knees are so weak and you look at that mountain  
Say there's no way over and no way around it  
And it feels like you're so far from home  
Even God's not there  
But  
  
Oh but every single sparrow flying  
And every broken soul that's crying  
He can see yeah you're in His reach  
If He can hold an ocean back with one little shore  
Then what's all this worry and doubting for  
Oh I believe He holds everything  
  
When it's late at night and you're staring at the stack of bills  
It don't add up and you don't know how it will  
Clinging to your mother's faith with a half-hearted prayer  
But you still don't know  
When the anchor man breaks in on your TV  
And says these times they won't be easy  
And fear sets in and you wanna give in  
Just let it go  
Oh let it go  
  
Every single sparrow flying  
And every broken soul that's crying  
He can see yeah you're in His reach  
If he can hold an ocean back with one little shore  
Then what's all this worry and doubting for  
Oh I believe, yeah I believe He holds everything, he holds everything
