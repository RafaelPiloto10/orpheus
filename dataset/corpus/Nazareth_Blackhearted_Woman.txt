Black hearted woman  
Can't you see your poor man's down?  
I can't take this baby  
All the lonely nights I've been cryin'  
Tired of all your separate ways  
I can't take your evil lyin'  
Black hearted woman  
Trouble and pain is all you crave  
Black hearted woman  
Trouble and pain is all you crave  
Now that I'm gone my trouble's stopped  
But my truth got in my way, I don't know  
Yesterday I was your man  
But now you don't even know my name  
Yesterday I was your man  
Now you don't even know my name  
Got to find a new way girl  
Before I get back in your game  
One of these days baby  
I'm gonna catch you with your backdoor man  
I said one of these days woman  
You know I'll catch you with your backdoor man  
Keep on down the road, girl  
Or I'll start all over again  
Oh no no no no no  
[Incomprehensible]
