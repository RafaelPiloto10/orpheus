  
  
  
The Floor 'round His Body Slowly Started To Crack  
He Was Screamin' But No One Could Do Nothin' But Step Back  
He Plunged Below Until The Level Beneath  
Broke Five Ribs Both Hands And Blew Out His Teeth  
But The Level Below Is Where They All Want His Position  
They All Look The Other Way And Continue With Bull Shittin'  
The Floor's Crackin' Again He Screams Help Someone  
And Then Smashed Down Right Through It Like Something Engulfed Him  
  
There Once Was A Man Of Power Who Lived On Top Of His High Rise (his High
Rise)  
Bloody Red Were His Eyes, They Say Wealthiest In Town (in Town)  
First His Chair Crushed Beneath Him, Even With The Help Of His Top Guys (top
Guys)  
They Couldn't Lift Him Up That Day Somethin' Was Pullin' Him Down (down)  
  
The Floor 'round His Body Slowly Started To Crack  
He Was Screamin' But No One Could Do Nothin' But Step Back  
He Plunged Below Until The Level Beneath  
Broke Five Ribs Both Hands And Blew Out His Teeth  
But The Level Below Is Where They All Want His Position  
They All Look The Other Way And Continue With Bull Shittin'  
The Floor's Crackin' Again He Screams Help Someone  
And Then Smashed Down Right Through It Like Something Engulfed Him  
  
His Beat Up And Broken Body Blasting Its Way Down The High Rise (high Rise)  
Leaving A Hole On Every Level, Which Others Gather Around (around)  
He's Screaming As He's Falling Don't Let Them Take Me From My Life (my Life)  
Dropping Tier By Tier Something Was Pulling Him Down  
  
Ahhh  
Crashing Down Through Every Level All The People Turn And Look Away  
Somebody Help Me, Help Me  
Somebody Help Me, Help Me  
Crashing Down Through Every Level All The People Turn And Look Away  
Somebody Help Me, Help Me  
Somebody Help Me, Help Me  
  
He Was Old And Weak And Frail (frail Frail), He Casted Hell From His High Rise
(his High Rise)  
Some Say His Building Was So Tall So On The World He Looked Down (down)  
I Bet Now He Wishes It Wasn't Built From The Ground Up A Mile (o O O)  
Every Level Brings Him Closer Down To Whatever's In The Ground (whatever's In
The Ground)  
  
The Floor 'round His Body Slowly Started To Crack  
He Was Screamin' But No One Could Do Nothin' But Step Back  
He Plunged Below Until The Level Beneath  
Broke Five Ribs Both Hands And Blew Out His Teeth  
But The Level Below Is Where They All Want His Position  
They All Look The Other Way And Continue With Bull Shittin'  
The Floor's Crackin' Again He Screams Help Someone  
And Then Smashed Down Right Through It Like Something Engulfed Him  
Nobody Really Seemed To Care Much On Any Level  
Watchin' Him Fall And Guessin' That He'll Meet The Devil  
His Head Hit A Rock Maybe A Pipe I Don't Know And Know  
But He Was Dead And Now He's Still Got Eight Floors To Go  
He Landed In A Kitchen On A Tray Of Steak Blades  
Even Though He Was Dead His Hair Went Flippin' Off The Maze  
What Was Left Of His Body Smashed Through All The Floors  
A Mangled Ball Of Meat Rolled Out The Front Doors
