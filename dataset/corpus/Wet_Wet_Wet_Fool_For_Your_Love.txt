And I heard a story all about you  
That you never started  
And maybe I can learn to give my cheek another turn  
And so I'll drink your point of view  
Blur my vision my feelings too  
Sometimes I don't see, what your giving means to me  
  
She's acting strangely,  
And says her whole world is starting to turn  
She's got a broken heart,  
She's good at playing the part  
I've been tricked again,  
I've been a fool for your love  
  
And every time I've got it made,  
You come and burn it all down, down  
It's always something that I said, hey hey hey  
And don't say a word, don't say anything  
Don't even make a sound  
And hear the rumors scream and shout, yeah  
  
She's acting strangely,  
And says her whole world is starting to turn  
She's got a broken heart, she's good at playing the part  
I've been tricked again, I've been a fool for your love  
  
I remember the time when I first met her  
Since that night I've been trying to hold it together, together  
  
And I heard a story all about you,  
You come and burn it all down, down  
Don't say anything  
And hear the rumors scream and shout, yeah  
  
And I'm acting crazy, 'cause my whole world has started to turn  
I got a broken heart,  
And I stand at playing the part  
I've been tricked again, I'm still a fool for your love
