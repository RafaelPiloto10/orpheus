Baby baby baby, what's wrong with Uncle Sam?  
He's cut down on my sugar, now he's messin' with my ham  
I got the ration blues, blue as I can be  
Oh me, I've got those ration blues  
  
I got to live on forty ounces, of any kind of meat  
Those forty little ounces gotta last me all the week  
I got to cut down on my jelly  
It takes sugar to make it sweet  
I'm gonna steal all your jelly baby  
And rob you of your meat  
I got the ration blues, blue as I can be  
Oh me, I've got those ration blues  
  
I like to wake up in the morning with my jelly by my side  
Since rationing started baby, you just take your stuff and hide  
They reduced my meat and sugar  
And rubber's disappearing fast  
You can't ride no more with poppa  
'Cause Uncle Sam wants my gas  
I got the ration blues, blue as I can be  
Oh me, I've got those ration blues
