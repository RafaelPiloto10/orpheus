I'm a wandering stranger  
Lost all alone  
I'm a million miles away  
I know you're waiting for  
To come home again  
But I'm searching for an answer  
Please try to understand  
  
And I love you  
And you love me  
Someday we can make it together  
Just you and me, oh just you and me  
  
Sometimes I'm lonely  
But I can not own myself  
I must keep moving till I find me  
Oh I'm hurting you  
But I don't want to stay  
My piece of mince is all my master  
Help me if you can  
  
And I love you  
And you love me  
Someday we can make it together  
Just you and me, oh just you and me  
  
Oh my love I do love you  
In my heart I do feel you  
  
I'm a wandering stranger  
Can you help me make it through  
Try to remember  
Woman I love you
