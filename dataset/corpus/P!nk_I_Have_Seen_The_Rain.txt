I have seen the rain  
I have felt the pain  
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow  
I don't know where I'm going  
I don't even know where I've been  
But I know I'd like to see them again  
  
Spend my days just searching  
Spend my nights in dreams  
Stop looking over my shoulder, baby,  
I stopped wondering what it means.  
Drop out, burn out, sold your home  
Oh they said I should've been more  
Probably so if I hadn't been in that crazy damn Vietnam war  
  
I have seen the rain  
I survived the pain  
Oh I've been home 30 years or so  
And I'm just stepping off of the plane  
  
Spend my days in searching  
Spend my nights in dreams  
Stop looking over my shoulder, baby,  
I stopped wondering what it means.  
Drop out, burn out, sold your home  
Oh they said I should've been more  
Probably so if I hadn't been in that crazy damn Vietnam war  
  
We have seen the rain together  
We survived the pain forever  
Oh it's good to be home again  
It's good to be with my friends  
Oh it's good to be home again  
It's good to feel the rain
