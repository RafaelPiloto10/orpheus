Where have you been,  
My long lost friend?  
It's good to see you again.  
Come and sit for a while  
I've missed your smile  
Today the past is goodbye.  
Time can't erase  
A lover's embrace.  
Can't you hear it calling?  
A new day dawning  
You were longing to find.  
  
Love's taken you far  
Away from my heart,  
And I've been here all alone.  
Have your eyes failed to find  
What took you from mine,  
A vision that's faded through time?  
But you sailed away,  
A fine summer's day,  
Cause you heard it calling,  
A new day dawning,  
You were longing to find.  
  
There is a way to make you stay.  
Darlin' don't turn away  
Don't doubt your heart  
and keep us apart  
I'm right where you are  
Stay  
  
There is a way to make you stay.  
Darlin' don't turn away.  
Don't doubt your heart  
and keep us apart  
I'm right where you are  
Stay
