Sweet Marie you mean a lot to me  
In my memory I hold you very dearly  
Once in all my dreams, my plans, hopes and future schemes  
There was sweet Marie  
  
But my home is where my heart is  
And my heart is not at home  
Whenever we are parted  
I feel so all alone  
  
With twilight falling  
The moon is calling sweet Marie  
What the sea tells only sea shells  
Are whispering sweet Marie  
  
Into the darkness goes this message sweet Marie  
Some lovers are sometimes parted  
They must end what they have started  
All that's left is the broken hearted, I must depart my sweet Marie  
  
Somewhere out in Arizona  
Such a long way from California  
I felt so alone there  
I was two thousand miles away from home there  
  
Tonight we're going to play Boston  
I still don't know what the hell is going on  
Oh but I wrote this song  
To keep me thinking on about my sweet Marie  
  
Sweet Marie you mean a lot to me  
This melody it keeps haunting me  
My sweet Marie  
In harmony, it's will me constantly, sweet Marie  
  
But my home is where my heart is  
My heart it's not at home  
Now that we are parted  
I feel so all alone
