(feat. Snoop Dogg)  
  
[Spoken:]  
Ladies side to side like this ladies  
Ne-Yo's gon' sing to ya'll real quick  
I'm gon' letmy nephew sing to ya'll  
Real smooth  
You might relate to this right here  
  
[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]  
I seen ya from across the way,  
Lookin like a fantasy,  
You know that I once said,  
This is for the climax,  
You can come and stay,  
I'm just tryin to think of how to say it,  
Girl if you shot me down it would be wasteless,  
Know you'll get mad at me,  
But I gotta tell you honestly,  
I don't even wanna know you,  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
I don't even wanna know your name,  
I just wanna put this thang on you, (if you want)  
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,  
Or exchange information,  
Cause I don't even wanna know you,  
Just wanna hit it,  
And quit it,  
And get with it,  
Can I put this thang on you,  
  
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]  
Babe ain't no reason to get mad, (girl)  
Don't look at me like that,  
I don't wanna disrespect you,  
I'm just tryin to let you,  
(Let me hit it from the back)  
I just wanna skip this,  
Convorsation we want nothing like we're intrested,  
Took a little pen and paper your number forget it,  
Baby even where I'm going I ain't intrested,  
Don't wanna know you,  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
I don't even wanna know your name,  
I just wanna put this thang on you, (if you want)  
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,  
Or exchange information,  
Cause I don't even wanna know you,  
Just wanna hit it,  
And quit it,  
And get with it,  
Can I put this thang on you,  
  
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]  
I'm slick can I get it,  
I'm slick and I'm smooth,  
I'll break your back like that,  
Yea I stick to the groove,  
The mood is smooth the price is right,  
I got a sweet rolled up and we can shake like dice,  
Get in the car and get behind me,  
And when we're finished baby please don't try to find me,  
Quit playin games we can play this thang the same,  
There's a couple things I wanna do to you before I become a stranger,  
(Don't wanna know you)  
  
[Chorus x2: Ne-Yo]  
I don't even wanna know your name,  
I just wanna put this thang on you, (if you want)  
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,  
Or exchange information,  
Cause I don't even wanna know you,  
Just wanna hit it,  
And quit it,  
And get with it,  
Can I put this thang on you,  
I don't even wanna know your name,  
I just wanna put this thang on you, (if you want)  
We ain't gotta have a convorsation,  
Or exchange information,  
Cause I don't even wanna know you,  
Just wanna hit it,  
And quit it,  
And get with it,  
Can I put this thang on you
