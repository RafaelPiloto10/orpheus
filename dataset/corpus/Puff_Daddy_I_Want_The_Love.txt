I hate funerals, I love life  
I hate when I see a whole bunch of people just crying in a funeral on some
fake shit  
They ain't really love a niggaare while he was there  
See, I'm a different type of niggaare, I wanna be honest with y'all  
I need the love now, if you all motherfuckers gonna be crying and be playing
thirty minute specials when I'm gone, an hour special that I'm gone  
Fuck that, love me while I'm here  
Love me while I'm here, I had to tell a bitch  
  
I want the love  
'Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you  
I want the love  
'Cause all I know is getting money  
Knocking at the door, I'm like a wizard, bitch, I tell you  
I want the love  
  
I'm a rich niggaare, I don't get mad, I just get paid  
I don't catch feeling, s I catch flights, that's brick paper  
For one rider at bad boy, that's one side  
These killers with me, don't fuck around, they jump fast like all sides  
I'm about to keep up on the billy, bumping these bottles and willy  
I know they gonna hate when I'm high, but when it's all over they feel me  
If you want your love when I'm dead, you better off just trying to kill me  
'Cause I'm gonna ball on you, and I ain't talking about you, I hate all y'all
niggers  
Ten birkin from your man, hoe, I could buy that  
Last week I made a hundred mil', you should try that  
I'm a real niggaare, they all see it, can't hide that  
I'll touch down in your city, fuck shit up, niggaare, then fly back  
  
I want the love  
'Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you  
I want the love  
'Cause all I know is getting money  
Knocking at the door, I'm like a wizard, bitch, I tell you  
I want the love  
  
Wanted the money and wanted the love  
Wanted them bitches that wanted the drugs  
That wanted the molly, that wanted the weed  
I walk in the building, give love in the club  
Love in the streets, bitch, it's meek milly  
Them niggers was haters, I love what they was  
'Cause all of that hating was my motivation  
Now I got the paper and what what'y what  
It is what it is, look at me now  
Living the life in the fucking eo  
Niggers that hate me still come to my shows  
Shorty ain't ready to fuck up my wrist, give a fuck about gold  
Straight to the money and back to the hood where they taking that money  
We package the good and we ring up the money  
You act like you good better sell you some money, hater  
  
I want the love  
'Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you  
I want the love  
'Cause all I know is getting money  
Knocking at the door, I'm like a wizard, bitch, I tell you  
I want the love
