I want to know how it feels to be  
Alone as it appears to me  
As the start of the day is the end of the night  
So the end of the night is the start of the day  
  
I know that it's true because everybody knew  
Before me, so where can I go now?  
  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well, we know where we are  
And we know that we've come so far  
And we'll never come back again  
  
Now I know that its true 'cause everybody knew  
Before me, so where can I go now?  
  
You take me back to the start  
(Back to the start)  
Where I was falling apart  
(Falling apart)  
Now all the things you want to be  
You never want to be with me  
  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well, we know where we are  
And we know that we've come so far  
And we'll never come back again  
  
You said you knew everything  
You said you knew everything  
About love and peace and hate and lies  
About love and peace and hate and lies  
  
Well, if the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well, we know where we are  
And we know that we've come so far  
And we'll never come back again  
We'll never come back again  
  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
(We'll never come back again)  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
(We'll never come back again)  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
Once it has gone it will never come back again  
Once it has gone it will never come back again  
Once it has gone it will never come back again
