Are you woman enough  
To take a man like me  
Baby, I know what you got  
You make it easy to see  
  
Now I want to give you my loving  
Believe me, babe, it's true  
Maybe more than you bargained for,  
But, now it's up to you  
  
So if you want it, come an' get it,  
I got something for you  
If you want it, come an' get it,  
I'll leave it up to you  
  
Are you a women who takes  
Anything you want  
Or the kind who says that you do  
Then tell me later you don't  
  
Now I want to give you my loving  
I knew the moment we met  
You gotta take me as you find me, baby,  
Cause what you see is what you get  
  
So if you want it, come an' get it,  
I got something for you  
If you want it, come an' get it,  
I'll leave it up to you  
  
Are you woman enough
