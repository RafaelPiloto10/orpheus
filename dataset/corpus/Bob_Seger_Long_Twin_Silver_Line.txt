Well the big train keeps on rolling  
Rolling on down the track  
And the way she's moving buddy  
I don't believe she's a-coming back  
  
The fireman's smoking a big cigar  
Sipping Lafite Rothschild Bordeaux  
And the engineer's so happy  
He's just a-letting that whistle blow  
  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling on proud and fine  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
Down that long twin silver line  
  
Well she just blazed through Chicago  
Nonstop to L. A.  
And the way she's steaming buddy  
You better not get in her way  
She's got the finest fastest pulling twin diesels  
She's got ninety three cars in tow  
She's gonna be on time  
All the way down the line  
Come the rain hail sleet or snow  
  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling on right on time  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
Down that long twin silver line  
Rolling on down the line  
And she just passed in Chicago  
Rolling into Kansas too  
Rolling into Denver  
Doing all she'll do  
And she hangs a big left in Salt Lake City  
  
Southwest to the Nevada line  
Rolling into California  
Right on time  
Rolling on down the line
