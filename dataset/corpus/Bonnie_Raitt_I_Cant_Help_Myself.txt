Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
Billy was a friend of mine  
We used to walk down by the river  
And he'd hold my hand  
We were only ten or twelve years old  
Didn't know about love  
I found out that it could hurt you so  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
Jimmie was the one in high school days  
We used to drive around the city  
Thinking we'd grown up  
Must've been just about sweet sixteen  
I found a brand new world  
Brand new love that I had never seen  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
No matter how hard I try  
I just can't leave it alone  
No use in wonderin' why  
'Cause my heart has a mind of its own  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
But I keep on falling  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
I keep on falling  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I keep right on falling  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
Falling in love
