Wild American  
You're the one they never tamed  
'Cause you stood your ground  
And they could not make you change  
You're the warning they still don't understand  
Watch your back, boy, they'll kill you if they can  
  
When they burn your brother down in the name of freedom  
I don't care if it's left or right  
It's wrong  
If that's all they can do, then you don't need 'em  
You're the one, Wild American
