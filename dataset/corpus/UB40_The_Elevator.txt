1st floor decide what you'll be one day  
With a head full of comment and nothing to say  
2nd floor mixed up it happens that way  
Soon you realize that listening don't pay  
3rd floor in limbo, no easy moves  
Up or down it's time to choose  
  
[Chorus]  
The elevators going up  
Quick the door's about to shut  
Too late we're full just hang around  
It won't be long - it won't be long before it's down  
  
4th floor the job hunt and all that you ask  
Is an honest day's pay for an honest day's graft  
5th floor you may make a little more money  
Now it's apparent downstairs ain't so fuuny  
6th floor a mortgage, a collar and tie  
2 weeks vacation in June or July  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The elevators going up  
Quick the door's about to shut ....  
  
7th floor expenses and private schools  
Pushing a pen you're not turning the tools  
8th floor position, respect and acclaim  
Move up the 9th for fortune or fame  
10th floor for investment and real estate  
Recouping the redies before it's tool late  
11th floor the penthouse the final cut  
With a head full of comment and a mouth that stays shut  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The elevators going up  
Quick the door's about to shut...
