How can you say it's over  
What can there be that we can't overcome  
Why do you turn away  
And you so afraid of needing someone  
  
Didn't we say forever  
I still believe the feeling's strong enough  
Before you walk away  
Let me hear you say you don't need my love  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay with me  
Darlin' after all that we've been through  
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights  
No one gonna love you like I do  
Stay with me  
Can't you see we've got too much to lose  
Oh stay with me  
Stay with me  
Baby please  
  
Where is our happy ending  
And all of our promises did you forget  
Tell me what's the use of love if it can't last  
I can never let you leave it this way  
I want you to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got to make you stay somehow  
Tell me what's it gonna take  
I can't live without you  
So please don't leave me now  
  
[Chorus: repeat until fade]
