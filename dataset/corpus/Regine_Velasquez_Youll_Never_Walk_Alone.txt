When you walk through a storm  
Hold your head up high,  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky,  
And the sweet silver song of a lark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown, ooh, ooh  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You never walk a-lone.
