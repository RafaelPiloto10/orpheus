About to die, the crowds applaud you  
About to die, they'll resurrect you  
Light a candle up in kingdom come  
Light the way for the savior's son  
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city down  
  
About to die, the crowds reward you  
About to die, their cheers ignore you  
Light a candle up in kingdom come  
Light the way for the chosen one  
No candle burned with fire enough to tear that city down  
  
About to die, the crowds applaud me  
About to die, they'll resurrect me  
Light a candle up in kingdom come  
Light the way for the savior's son  
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city down
