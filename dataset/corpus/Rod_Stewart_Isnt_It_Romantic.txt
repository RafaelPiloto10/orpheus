I've never met you, yet never doubt you  
I can't forget you  
I've thought you out, dear  
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss  
Just the thing I miss  
On a night like this  
If dreams are made of imagination  
I'm not afraid of my own creation  
With all my heart my heart is here for you to take  
Why should I quake  
I'm not awake  
Isn't it romantic?  
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.  
Isn't it romantic?  
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.  
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above  
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.  
Isn't it romantic  
Merely to be young on such a night as this?  
Isn't it romantic?  
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.  
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,  
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?  
Isn't it romance?  
  
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above  
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.  
Isn't it romantic  
Merely to be young on such a night as this?  
Isn't it romantic?  
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.  
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,  
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?  
Isn't it romance?  
Isn't it romance?  
Isn't it romance?
