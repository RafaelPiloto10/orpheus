"Thank you for this moment  
I got to say how beautiful you are  
Of all the hope and dreams I could of prayd for  
There you are  
If I could have one dance forever  
I would take you by the hand  
Tonight it's you and I together  
I'm sooo glad  
I'm your man  
  
And if I live a thousand years you know I never could explain  
The way I lost my heart to you that day  
But If destiny decided I should look the other way  
Then the world would never know  
The greatest story ever told  
And Did I tell you that I love you tonight  
  
I don't hear the music  
When I'm looking In your eyes  
But I feel the rhythm of your body close to mine  
It's the way we touch it sends me  
It's the way well always be  
Your kiss, your pretty smile you know I die for  
Ooo baby  
Your all I need  
  
And if I live a thousand years you know I never could explain  
The way I lost my heart to you that day  
But If destiny decided I should look the other way  
Then the world would never know  
The greatest story ever told  
Did I tell you that I love you just how much I really need you  
Did I tell you that I love you tonight  
  
Tonight  
  
If I live a thousand year I never could explain  
The way I lost my heart to you that day  
But If destiny decided I should look the other way  
Then the world would never know  
The greatest story ever told  
Did I tell you that I love you just how much I really need you  
Did I tell you that I love you tonight
