I, I owe owe you  
Absolutely nothing  
I, I know know you  
Positively disagree  
I've heard it said that all is fair  
In love and war so what's life for  
You watch it go out the window  
Stop and go back for more  
More!  
  
Go, go fight fight, punch  
Your way to happiness  
Go, go light light, or  
You'll never be a big success  
  
I heard it said that all is fair  
In love and war so what's life for  
The boy and girl  
Two separate worlds  
The endless tug of war  
Uh!  
  
Go, go fight fight, punch  
Your way to happiness  
Go, go light light, or  
You'll never be a big success  
  
I've heard it said that all is fair  
In love and war, so what's life for
