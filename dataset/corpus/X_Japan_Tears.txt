Doko ni yukebaii anata to hanarete  
Ima wa sugisatta toki ni toi kakete  
Nagasugita yuru ni tobi dachi wo yume mita  
Ikoku no sora mitsumete kodoko wo dakishimete  
  
Nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete  
Owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Loneliness, your silent whisper  
Fills a river of tears through the night  
Memory, you never let me cry  
And you, you never said goodbye  
  
Sometimes our tears blinded the love  
We lost out dreams along the way  
But I never thought you'd trade your soul to the fates  
Never thought you'd leave me alone  
  
Time through the rain has set me free  
Sands of time will keep your memory  
Love everlasting fades away  
Alive within your beatless heart  
  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete  
Owaranai kanashimi wo aoi-bara ni kaete  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete  
Owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Dry your tears with love  
If you could have told me everything  
You would have found what love is  
If you could have told me what was on your mind  
I would have shown you the way  
Someday I'm gonna be older than you  
I've never thought beyond that time  
I've never imagined the pictures of that life  
For now I will try to live for you and for me  
I will try to live with love, with dreams  
And forever with tears
