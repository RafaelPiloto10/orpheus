Pull on up  
To the soapbox stool  
Let me tell ya some stories  
About how life can be cruel  
I had big dreams  
But they turned to dust  
I need another shot of oil  
'Cause it's starting to rust  
  
And I'm tryin' to make a living  
Tryin' to find my way  
I've been bustin' my ass  
To be somebody someday  
Tryin' to make a living  
Tryin' to get ahead  
Shootin' at the moon  
But it shot me down instead  
  
[Chorus:]  
War stories  
I'm kickin' and fightin' for my life  
Through those war stories  
I made it through the battle of life  
And it's on and on until you're long gone  
But the strong keep stickin' it out  
Through those war stories  
Everybody's got 'em, when you hit the bottom and survive  
  
I said have another drink  
This one's on me  
Let me tell ya 'bout pain from A to Z  
I got scars from my head to my feet  
Some like a junkyard car still rolling down the streets  
  
And I'm tryin' to make a dollar  
Tryin' to pay my way  
I've been bustin' my balls  
And then they take it all away  
Tryin' to climb the ladder  
Reaching for the sky  
I ain't going down  
Until they hang me out to dry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And it's on and on, until you're long gone  
But the strong keep stickin' it out  
They got towing the line 'til the sun don't shine  
But all I got left to talk about  
Are those war stories.  
I'm kickin' and fightin' for my life  
Through those war stories  
I made it through the battle of life  
  
War stories  
Through those war stories  
Everybody's got 'em when you hit the bottom and survive
