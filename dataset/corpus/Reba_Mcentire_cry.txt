I might bite my lip, look down at my shoes  
I might clench my fist or just leave the room  
But, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop  
'Cause once I get started out, I may never stop  
  
I might even laugh, right in your face  
When you come out and ask, oh, if I'll be okay  
But, I'm not gonna cry, not one single drop  
'Cause once I get started out, I may never stop  
  
It's gonna take the night of fighting with all I've got  
To keep the first tear from falling down  
But, if I don't hold the waters back  
The dam is gonna crack  
  
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna drown  
So, I'm not gonna cry  
If that's what you thought  
'Cause once I get started out  
  
I may never stop  
No, I'm not gonna cry  
Not one single drop  
'Cause once I get started  
I may never stop  
  
So, I might bite my lip  
Look down at my shoes
