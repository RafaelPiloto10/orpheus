All aboard the disco train hahaha  
All right now, O yeah  
  
O you can tell by the way I move and  
walk im a women's man no time to talk  
Music loud and women warm,  
I've been kicked around since I was born.  
  
It's all right, I'ts okay,  
you may look the other way.  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times' effect on man.  
  
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother  
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'  
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,  
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.  
  
Oh,  
  
Every one one on the dance floor darling  
Where going to dance with the devil  
  
Well, now I get low and I get high,  
and if I can't get either, I really try.  
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes,  
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose.  
You know, it's all right, it's okay,  
I'll live to see another day.  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times' effect on man.  
  
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother  
you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'  
and you're stayin' alive, stayin' alive.  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive,  
ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.  
  
It's all right, I'ts okay,  
you may look the other way.  
We can try to understand  
the New York Times' effect on man.  
  
It's all right, I'ts okay,
