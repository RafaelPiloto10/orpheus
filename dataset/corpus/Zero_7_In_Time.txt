All the words are calling  
Got time on my own  
There's no destination  
Wondering whether I'll feel it again  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
'Cause there's nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself around  
  
The autumn leaves are falling  
Falling down on me  
And there's nothing I can do  
And there's nothing I can say  
That's gonna change the way I feel  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
'Cause there's nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself around  
  
Take this time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself  
Change itself around  
  
I feel it's true  
All alone without you  
I feel it's true  
'Cause you're running with the wind  
And you're running with your life  
Won't you come inside  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
'Cause there's nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself around
