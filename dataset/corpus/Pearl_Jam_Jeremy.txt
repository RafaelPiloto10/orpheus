At home  
Drawing pictures  
Of mountain tops  
With him on top  
Lemon yellow sun  
Arms raised in a V  
  
Dead lay in pools of maroon below  
Daddy didn't give attention  
To the fact that mommy didn't care  
King Jeremy the wicked  
Ruled his world  
  
Jeremy spoke in class today  
Jeremy spoke in class today  
Clearly I remember  
Pickin' on the boy  
  
Seemed a harmless little fuck  
But we unleashed a lion  
Gnashed his teeth  
  
And bit the recess lady's breast  
How could I forget  
He hit me with a surprise left  
My jaw left hurting  
  
Dropped wide open  
Just like the day  
Like the day I heard  
Daddy didn't give affection  
  
And the boy was something mommy wouldn't wear  
King Jeremy the wicked  
Ruled his world  
Jeremy spoke in class today  
Jeremy spoke in class today  
  
Try to forget this,  
Try to erase this,  
From the blackboard.
