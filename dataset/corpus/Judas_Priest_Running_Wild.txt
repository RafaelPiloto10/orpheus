I move as fast as I can  
I like to get around  
I'm crazy like a madman  
My feet don't touch the ground  
I move amongst the night life  
And they just step aside  
'Cause when they see me coming  
They know I'm running wild  
  
Dead or alive there's nothing  
That bothers me at all  
I take on all comers  
They back off or they fall  
They raise their hands to stop me  
I laugh and I defy  
'Cause what's the point in living  
Unless you're living wild  
  
No chains can hold me down  
I always break away  
I never hear society  
Tell me what to do or say  
I taste the life that pleases me  
And raise a storm for all the world to see  
I never stumble, never fall  
Never stop for rest  
I rebel but I walk tall  
And I demand respect  
  
I move amongst the nightlife  
And they just step aside  
'Cause when they see me coming  
They know I'm running wild  
  
I'm running wild  
I'm running wild  
Get outta my way  
I'm running wild  
I'm running wild  
You better believe it
