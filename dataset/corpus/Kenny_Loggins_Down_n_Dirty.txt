Slow talkin', the line you're walkin'  
Look like a viper wearin' silkin' stockings  
You make 'em guess they'd be gettin' the best  
Can't help but wonder if you'd pass the test  
Kissin' my fingers, you touch my face  
'n play your hand like you're holdin' the ace  
But Baby when it comes around, are you gonna pick it up or lay it down  
You make it harder and harder to stop what you've started  
Chorus:  
(Down 'n dirty)  
Oh my little Rosalee, don't you think it's goin' on time we see  
If you're gonna come with me, I bet you, I get you  
I've had enough of this comin' on stuff  
I feel like gettin' down on somethin' tough  
I do believe you're what you're tryin' to be  
Now show me, honey, 'cause I'm dying to see  
Take it baby, make your play, we'll make love in different ways  
I call your bluff and stand, pretty mama, hold me in your hand  
And make it harder and harder to stop what you've started  
Chorus  
[Instrumental]  
Kissin' my fingers, you touch my face  
'n play your hand like you're holdin' the ace  
Baby when it comes around, are you gonna pick it up or lay it down  
You make it harder and harder to stop what you've started  
Chorus  
Rosalee, don't you think it's goin' on time we see  
If you're gonna come with me, I'm dirty, down 'n dirty
