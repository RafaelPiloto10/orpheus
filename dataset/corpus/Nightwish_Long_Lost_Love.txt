Trees have dropped their leaves,  
Clouds their waters  
All this burden is killing me  
  
Distance is covering your way,  
Tears your memory  
All this beauty is killing me  
  
Oh, do you care,  
I still feel for you  
So aware,  
What should be lost is there  
  
I fear I will never find anyone  
I know my greatest pain is yet to come  
Will we find each other in the dark  
My long lost love
