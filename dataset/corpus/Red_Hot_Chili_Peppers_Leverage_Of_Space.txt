Verse 1:  
Shade, stay, know  
But they communicate  
Try, fade,  
The leverage of space  
  
Star, jay,  
The fall dawn aim to place  
With shades on,  
The leverage of...  
  
Chorus:  
Shade, shade, shade,  
The leverage of, the leverage of  
  
Space, shade, shade,  
The leverage of, the leverage of  
  
Verse 2:  
Hate breaks down  
Mountains that we  
Make so tame  
Oh, the leverage of...  
  
Chorus:  
Shade, shade, shade,  
The leverage of, the leverage of  
  
Space, shade, shade,  
The leverage of, the leverage of  
  
Bridge:  
When I was down upon myself  
I walked a road that's always there  
You and I were everywhere  
And I'm alone  
  
She would never know the reason  
That I loved to come and see her  
Where she sits I'll never go  
You know it's always there  
  
Outro:  
The leverage of, the leverage of
