Easy on the eyes, uneasy on the heart  
Sew my wrists shut, sew my wrists shut with hope  
Straight into the light shining bright  
I dare you to dream this  
And I dare you to dream this gone  
What I want to know is which makes you smile less  
  
[Chorus]  
Here's to the pain the light of the oncoming train  
Come on ode to solitude in chains  
Here's to the pain as always heaven in flames now bleeding  
Ode to solitude in chains  
  
Map the scars of a heart bruised and torn  
Loosen the noose love loosen the noose with love  
What I want to know is why you keep me hanging  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I should fail to stay  
Remember not to forget this feeling you have  
I've failed please pretend it never happened baby  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ode to solitude  
Ode to solitude  
Ode to solitude  
Ode to solitude
