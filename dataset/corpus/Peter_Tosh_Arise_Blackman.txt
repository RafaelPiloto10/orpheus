Lift up your heads, o ye gates  
And be ye lifted up, ye ever livin' black people  
The King of glory shall come in  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
We've been sittin' in the dirt too long  
And it seems we don't know when we're right or wrong  
But help me sing my song, Blackman arise  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself right now  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
For the moon shall turn into blood  
And the rivers turn into flood  
And the sun will never shine, Blackman arise  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
Remember we've been down here as slaves  
And to get a little job you have to trim and shave  
Your heaven becomes your grave, Blackman arise  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
For the time of rights is now  
And you don't have to ask me how  
You've got to make a move, Blackman arise  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself right now  
Arise Blackman, arise  
Arise and denote thyself  
Every man on earth is a man  
And every tub have to stand on its own bottom  
No matter where you're from, Blackman arise  
So arise Blackman, arise
