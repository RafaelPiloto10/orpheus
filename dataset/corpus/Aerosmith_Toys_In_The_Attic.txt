In the attic lights  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
[Chorus:]  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
  
Lights  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Yayayayayayayow!)
