I am a bird, watch me go drifting by.  
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by.  
That could mean everything.  
I am a street watching the people walk.  
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk.  
Then I hear everything.  
  
Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers,  
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill  
Till the early hours,  
Then I am everything.  
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers  
  
That could mean everything.  
  
Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers,  
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill  
Till the early hours,  
Then I am everything  
  
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers [Repeat: x4]
