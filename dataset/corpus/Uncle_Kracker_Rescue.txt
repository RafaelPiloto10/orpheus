I stayed out late last night  
But I nothing could drink  
Could help me drink you off my mind  
Everywhere I looked, I saw your face  
And I wonder, and I wonder  
If there still might be  
A little space in your heart for me  
'Cause I'm so cold, I'm so alone  
And I miss you, babe  
  
So won't you come to my rescue  
Shake this pain from my soul  
And take this fool back in your heart baby  
I'll go crazy if you don't  
'Cause I'm a mess here without you  
Ain't no pill for this pain  
So please, please come to my rescue baby  
Make it right away  
  
I was a fool to leave  
Leave behind everything that meant everything to me  
Every day and night my heart pays the price  
And I'm out here, stranded out here  
On this lonely road, I'm so lost won't you lead me home  
  
I need you back, need one more chance  
And I miss you, babe  
  
So won't you come to my rescue  
Shake this pain from my soul  
And take this fool back in your heart baby  
I'll go crazy if you don't  
'Cause I'm a mess here without you  
Ain't no pill for this pain  
So please, please come to my rescue baby  
Make it right away  
  
I'm drowning baby  
I need you to save me, yeah  
Don't leave me like this  
Throw me a line, baby one more time  
  
Won't you come to my rescue  
Shake this pain from my soul  
And take this fool back in your heart baby  
I'll go crazy if you don't  
'Cause I'm a mess here without you  
Ain't no pill for this pain  
So please, please come to my rescue baby  
Make it right away  
  
Make it right away
