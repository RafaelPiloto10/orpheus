Intonation  
The title "As Baile" can be translated as "away from home".  
The song itself is all intonation, although you might say the intonation is
"based" in Irish Gaelic. Enya sings "or, horo, mo-ray he u way, he u way" and
so on. The word "or" is an interjection that could be translated as "oh!" or
"oho!", but the rest of the song is intonation.
