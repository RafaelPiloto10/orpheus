I know that you've been good to me  
And I know it's just a rumor spreading in this town  
And I know know know it's a thing I don't believe  
Cuz you know I'd never let you down baby  
This is love that you see on my face  
And it's impossible to erase  
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear  
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear  
  
But I know that you would never hurt me  
I know you got a real good heart  
Too bad they're talking for nothing  
Trying for nothing  
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love  
(Honey don't you see?)  
  
I know about their jealousy  
And I know about the talk that's growing in this town  
And I know know know that they don't want to believe  
That I'm not just a run-around baby  
They say we will break up, just you wait  
They gamble on the time and the date it will end  
Not much longer, they swear  
You see everybody's talking, I hear rumors everywhere  
  
But I know that you would never hurt me  
I know you got a real good heart  
Too bad they're talking for nothing  
Trying for nothing  
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love  
(Honey don't you see?)  
  
I don't believe what they think of you and me  
When they say that we're in trouble  
Cuz they don't know what they're talking about  
It's just too bad we've got what they've never had  
So they just stay busy talking  
"She don't love him, he don't love her!"  
  
But I know that you would never hurt me  
I know you got a real good heart  
Too bad they're talking for nothing  
Trying for nothing  
Cuz nothing's gonna stop our love  
(Honey don't you see?)  
  
I know that you would never hurt me  
I know you got a real big heart  
Too bad they're talking for nothing  
Trying for nothing  
Cuz nothing's gonna stop us
