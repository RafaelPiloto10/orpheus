The world we live in is silent lucid liquid change  
The king appears well afraid aware in all his rage  
He seeks to tell in unseen terror about poer life and lust  
The rising power of Baphomet is all that he can trust ah  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth  
God bless all who sail in her this ship he built with fright  
Pleasant in his infamy it sails into the night ah  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth  
Reasoning decay decides to plague the nurtured home  
Redesign Colombus Isle where only kings will roam  
The spirit lies in all we see and all that we can touch  
He found the place where gods reside destroyed into the ancient dust ah  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth  
God bless all who sail in her this ship he built with fright  
Pleasant in his infamy with cold and blistered sight ah  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth hell on earth  
The afterlife that mark the moons of distant silent stars  
So on the quest the king is served golden in his light  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth  
Revealing yellowed manuscript in the shadow of the king  
Written here in pages old the secrets of this thing  
Imagination hanging by the lucid threads he claims  
Where all around damnations lie they're locked inside his fevered brain  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth  
God bless all who sail in her this ship he built with fright  
Pleasant in his infamy it sails into the night ah  
Hell on earth sadistic birth hell on earth hell on earth
