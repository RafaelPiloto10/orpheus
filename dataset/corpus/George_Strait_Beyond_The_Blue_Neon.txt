Swingin' doors  
Sawdust floors  
A heartache drowns as the whiskey pours  
There's a hole in the wall  
From some free for all  
The ringin' crack of that old cue ball  
  
I've been fallin' in here  
For what seems like years  
Where the tears and the lonely belong  
And wonder what's going on  
Beyond that blue neon  
  
[Chorus:]  
I hear tell there's people out there who don't know  
What losin' you means  
They don't have a heart  
That just falls apart  
At the mention of your name  
  
I heard they pretend  
The world didn't end  
Right when I knew you were gone  
I guess life still goes on  
Beyond that blue neon  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
But it's a quarter 'til two  
And I don't have a clue  
As to what I'll do from now 'til dawn  
I wonder what's going on  
Beyond that blue neon  
  
Lord, what's going on  
Beyond that blue neon
