She's just a night bird flyin' through the night  
Fly on  
She's just a night bird makin' a midnight, midnight fly  
Sail on  
Sail on  
Well she's flyin' down to me  
Until tomorrow I can set her free  
Set her free  
So all we got baby is one precious night  
All we got is one precious night  
Put on your blues and shoes and things and rags  
Down under the bed  
Just wrap me up in your beautiful wings  
You better hear what I say yeah  
Oh, carry me baby  
  
Please take me through your dreams  
Inside your world I want to be  
Until tomorrow, no tears will be shed  
Hold on until the sun gets out of bed  
Hold on well hold on baby  
  
Sail on sail on sail on  
Sail on  
Right in my arms baby
