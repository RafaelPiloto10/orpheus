[Intro]  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say "My true love ain't here"  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala  
  
[Bridge]  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
  
[Outro]  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas
