Hard bodies, soft emotions  
So fast so smart  
The world's at your feet  
But what about your heart  
Fame and power can't hold you tight  
In the late hours of the night  
  
How do you stop (How do you stop)  
Before it's too late  
You choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop (How do you stop)  
Before it's too late  
You think love will wait  
So you don't hold on and then it's gone  
Then it's gone  
  
You've had some success  
A new group of friends  
You called it the "good life"  
Thought it would never never end  
One minute you're too young  
Then you're in your prime  
Then you're lookin' back  
Through the hands of time  
  
How do you (How do you stop)  
Before it's too late  
You choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop (How do you stop)  
Before it's too late  
You think love will wait  
You don't hold on and then it's gone  
  
How do you stop a runaway train  
How do you stop the pouring, pouring of rain  
How do you stop the night turning to day  
How do you stop love from slipping away  
How do you stop from believing  
How do you stop lovers from deceiving  
How do you stop the tide from coming in  
How do you stop the cold, cold wind  
  
(How do you stop)  
Before it's too late  
You choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop (How do you stop)  
Before it's too late  
You think love will wait  
So you don't hold on and then it's gone  
Then it's gone  
  
(How do you stop)  
A runaway train  
How do you stop pouring, pouring rain  
How do you stop a heart with wings  
How do you stop everything  
How do you stop before it's to late  
Choose and you lose if you hesitate  
How do you stop before it's to late  
It's your life
