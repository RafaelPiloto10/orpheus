Talk to me, don't lie to me, save your breath  
Don't look at me, don't smile at me, just close your eyes  
I was so impressed by you, I was running blind  
I would fall for every trick, every twist of mind  
Heaven is cold without any soul  
It's hard to believe, I was so in love with you  
  
Don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes, just walk away  
Don't phone me up, don't call around, don't waste your time  
You were so in awe of me, you were so divine  
You would do just anything to still be mine  
Heaven is cold without any soul  
It's hard to believe (Hard to believe), I was so in love with you  
  
All the things you said to me, I was so upset (Don't go)  
You were always talking, talking, god I did my best  
Heaven is cold without any soul  
It's hard to believe, I was so in love with you, I was so in love with you  
Heaven is cold without any soul  
It's hard to believe (Hard to believe), I was so in love with you, I was so in
love with you  
Heaven is cold without any soul  
It's hard to believe (Hard to believe), I was so in love with you  
I was so in love, I was so in love, I was so in love with you, so in love with
you
