Take me in your fast car mercedes  
Kissing on your neck while you're driving  
Doesn't care I'm always on my blackberry  
All the time all the time buying into every line  
I'mma flashy little lush but he thinks I'm really fine  
Notorious and wild takes me where I'm gonna shine  
Where the bad boys roll hard dressing like james dean  
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is the only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We gonna get free free free free  
Free free free get free  
  
(Lana del rey)  
Baby we are chancers on the scene  
Grammar in the cutters only so arctic  
See graffiti artists and tabloid queen  
Mix it up, mix it up  
Every dude you ever seen  
We're acting really tough  
Like the world belongs to us  
Cause it does, yeah it must  
But we do create the buzz  
Where the bad boys blow smoke  
Just like they're james dean  
And the air girls blow kisses  
Just like marilyn  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is the only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We gonna get free free free free  
Free free free get free  
  
(Lana del rey)  
Run for your lives  
They got 'em in chains  
Let's hope that we merge  
Create our own games  
Dj's, rockstars, posers, we are  
Then the politicians  
That surrender the additions  
And it's so pornographic and it's tragic  
Nothing magic makes us free  
To be what we wanna be, wanna be  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is our only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is our only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We gonna get free free free free  
Free free free get free  
We gonna get freed
