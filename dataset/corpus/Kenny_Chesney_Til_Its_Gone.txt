(Verse)  
Got nowhere to go and how am I to get there  
But I'm goin' there with you  
Tonight we're runnin' on luck  
If we're gonna use it all there's only one thing left to do  
  
(Chorus)  
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin  
Till it's gone, till it's gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone  
Till it's gone, till it's gone...  
  
(Verse 2)  
You look way 2 good and this feels way 2 right  
It's been way 2 long to start  
But it's sure worth drinkin' to, so baby here's to you  
I don't wanna waste a drop  
  
(Chorus)  
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin  
Till it's gone, till it's gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone  
Till it's gone, till it's gone...  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
(Bridge)  
One life, one chance!  
One ticket to the big dance!  
You and me still holdin' on  
Ride it down to the last song  
  
(Chorus)  
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin  
Till it's gone, till it's gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone  
Till it's gone, till it's gone...  
  
(Outro)  
I'm gonna drink it all up  
Till it's gone, then it's gone, it is gone
