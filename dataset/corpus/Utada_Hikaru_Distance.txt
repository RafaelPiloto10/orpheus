Though it weighs on my mind, I can't ask  
Tired of swimming to you, I fall silent  
Though I want to see you, I'm pushed by invisible waves  
And I find myself even further away  
Keep it going, baby, so it doesn't stop  
If you don't feel the same, then tell me  
Though I don't believe in forcing things  
It's alright to try, if it's just a little  
I wanna be with you now  
Together, let's shrink this distance  
If we do it now, we can make it  
We can start over, though we can't become one  
I wanna be with you now  
Someday, even this distance  
Will become something we can embrace  
We can start sooner, I wanna be with you after all  
You can be hurt this much, by just a single word  
But you'll teach me about loneliness  
When you can't protect it, keep on trying, baby  
Though it isn't how I promised it would be, trust me  
Though I don't believe in forcing things  
It's alright to try, if I'm with you  
I wanna be with you now  
Together, let's gaze at this distance  
If we do it now, we can make it  
We can start over, I want to put it into words  
I wanna be with you now  
Along the way, even this distance  
Will become something we can embrace  
We should stay together, I wanna be with you after all  
I wanna be with you now  
'cause I know this can't be forever  
We can start over, just you and me  
I wanna be with you now  
'cause I know this can't be forever  
We should stay together, just you and me  
I wanna be with you
