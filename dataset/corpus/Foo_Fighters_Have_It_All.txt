You're my size I need to try you on  
Someone in between the right and wrong  
Through everything you kept your wings apart  
Through everything you stayed that same old heart  
And when I've had enough  
  
She drains me  
When I'm empty  
She fills herself  
She takes it all  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
Go on and have it all.  
  
Running through this maze you hold me in  
Searching all these days to find the end  
Your everything, your everything I'm not  
But I'm anything, I'm anyone you want  
And when I've had enough  
  
She drains me  
When I'm empty  
She fills herself  
She takes it all  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
Go on and have it all  
Have it all  
Have it all  
  
Your everything you're everything I'm not  
I'm anything I'm anyone you want  
  
She drains me  
When I'm empty  
She fills herself  
She takes it all  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
In too deep  
She's spilling over me  
  
Have it all
