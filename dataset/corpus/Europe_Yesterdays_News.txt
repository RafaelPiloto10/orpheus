Hey, hey.  
Mm yeah  
I've got something to tell you  
Yeah!  
Oh yeah!  
  
I'm catching the fast train  
Soon I'll be long, long gone  
And I shoot through the night  
Like a bullet from a loaded gun  
They been trying to use me  
Lie and abuse me  
  
They're trying to break me  
No one can take me, no way  
Now I'm way down, I'm way down  
Yes I'm way down, I'm way down  
I'm so down I'm reading yesterdays news  
  
I woke up this morning  
Leaving on my mind  
And I said to myself  
I ain't gonna waste more time, no  
  
I need someone to save me  
Love and embrace me  
They been trying to get me  
Trying to set me up, bad luck  
Now I'm way down, I'm way down  
Yes I'm way down, I'm way down  
I'm so down I'm reading yesterdays news  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I got time on my head  
I know what I'll do  
One made bed  
  
I know I'm come through  
Cause I know in my heart  
There are things to be said  
From the pain that I suffer  
And the crush that I'll pay  
  
Now I'm way down, I'm way down  
Yes I'm way down, I'm way down  
Yes I'm way, way, way, way down  
I'm way, way, way down  
I'm way, way, way down  
  
Way down, yeah  
I'm so down I'm reading yesterdays news
