Well, well  
I really, really, really, really, really, really like girls  
Yeah, I really, really, really, really, really, really like girls  
I like girls (3x)  
I like the way that they giggle,  
When they walk up and ask you to dance  
I like the way that they wiggle,  
Wrapped up in the skin tight pants  
They got style  
They got smiles  
They drive me wild!  
Yeah, I really, really, really, really, really, really like girls  
Yes, I really, really, really, really, really, really like girls!  
I like them small  
I like 'em tall  
I like 'em all!  
Now it don't bother me,  
If a girl don't know how to cope  
Because the things that they know,  
How to do can't be learned in a book!  
They got smarts  
They got hearts  
They got my heart!  
That's why I really, really, really, really, really, really like girls  
Yeah, I really, really, really, really, really, really like girls!  
I want 'em small  
I want 'em tall  
I want 'em all!  
Every day in every way they're here to stay  
They're really really neat  
They're really sweet  
They're real petite  
I like girls!
