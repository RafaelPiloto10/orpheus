The way  
(Hold up, Ne-Yo, ya)  
The way you switch  
Little mama so thick  
I'm so sick  
Body like a shotgun (Bang)  
She's a hot one  
Clock go click  
And she know it  
Measurements 36'24, 4'6  
And everywhere you have a problem  
Probably tired of hearing it  
  
Yeah (Yeah)  
Shorty I don't wanna waste your time (mm mmm)  
It ain't a secret baby girl you fine (mm)  
You could have anybody here that you want, that's right  
Including this fella  
'Cause you're a diamond and I dig your shine  
  
But I don't gotta tell you that  
You know you look good  
(Girl you know you fine)  
So I don't gotta tell you that (no)  
'Cause I know you hear it all the time  
  
Don't wanna gas you up  
But it ain't like I can just pass you up  
Show me your strut  
You make a dude wanna cash you up (whoa)  
But that I ain't how I do  
You look good but I ain't gon' buy you  
Said I just wanna try you  
Hit up my cell if it's cool to slide through  
  
Hey  
Shorty I don't wanna waste your time (Won't waste your time girl)  
It ain't a secret baby girl you fine (Girl you know you fine)  
You can have anybody here that you want, that's right  
Including this fella  
'Cause you're a diamond and I dig your shine  
  
But I don't gotta tell you that (no, no, no)  
You know you look good (you know you know you know)  
(Girl you know you fine)  
So I don't gotta tell you that (no)(don't gotta tell you that)  
'Cause I know you hear it all the time (all the time)  
  
Shorty I don't got no game  
Ain't got no falsie playa wit for me to say  
That girl you are off the chain (so off the chain)  
But I'm sure baby  
Sure you knew that anyway  
  
But I don't gotta tell you that  
You know you look good  
(Girl you know you fine)  
So I don't gotta tell you that (no)  
'cause I know you hear it all the time  
  
[Harmonizing]  
I don't got to tell you that  
  
[Spoken]  
You know you fine  
So what's up?  
You rolling?  
Let's go
