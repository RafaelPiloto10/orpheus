Concentration moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration moon  
Wis I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
How did it start?  
Thousands of creeps  
Killed in the park  
American way  
Try and explain  
Scab of a nation  
Driven insane  
Don't cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly: die die  
Cop kill a creep!  
Pow pow pow  
  
Concentration moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration moon  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends,  
Still running free:  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
Threatened by us  
Drag a few creeps  
Away in a bus  
American way  
Prisoner: lock  
Smash every creep  
In the face with a rock  
  
Don't cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly: die die  
Cop kill a creep!  
Pow pow pow
