Here I am again  
Waiting on the moment you decide  
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere  
I?ve been so close to you so many times  
I feel like I could drown  
I wish that I could fly away from here  
All:  
But I?m still coming down  
AJ:  
From the last time  
All:  
That you came around  
AJ:  
In the starlight  
All:  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night  
Like a lonely satellite  
AJ:  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
We walked on Jupiter  
Flew around the moon a time or two  
Left a mark on every star we could find  
But now I?m burning like a meteor  
That never hits the ground  
Wish that I could fly away from you  
All:  
But I?m still coming down  
AJ:  
From the last time  
All:  
That you came around  
AJ:  
In the starlight  
All:  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
Love is poisoning the atmosphere  
Is keeping everything unclear to me  
Howie:  
Something in your eyes  
Never satisfies  
I?m feeling so alone, tonight  
All:  
But I?m still coming down (still coming down)  
From the last time (the last time)  
That you came around (you came around)  
In the starlight (the starlight)  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity (ooooh)  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night (falling through the night)  
Yes I?m falling through the night (falling through the night)  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
Like a lonely satellite
