Found your heart  
And lost your lover  
Lick your wounds  
And run for cover.  
  
Take your time  
There'll be another  
And don't make the same mistake twice  
Unless you can pay the price.  
  
All the years  
You spent in growing  
End up one more  
Line you're towing  
Don't look now  
Your age is showing  
And it's much too late  
To turn back  
You better pull in the slack  
  
Captured Angel  
Aching to make your break  
Your freedom's at stake  
You better fly now  
Fly now, fly now  
While your wings are still young  
Your cage door's been flung  
Wide Open  
And I'm hoping you see  
That there's a place beside me  
If you ever need it.  
  
Sold your dreams  
For sweet salvation  
Left with righteous indignation  
Now it seems that you face starvation  
And nourishment doesn't come cheap  
You better go back to sleep  
  
Captured Angel  
Aching to make your break  
Your freedom's at stake  
You better fly now  
Fly now, fly now  
While your wings are still young  
Your cage door's been flung  
Wide open  
And I'm hoping you see  
That there's a place beside me  
If you ever need it.
