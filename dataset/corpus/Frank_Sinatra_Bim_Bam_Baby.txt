Hey now, take a mip mack mop, and a brim bram broom,  
And klim klam clean up the rim ram room  
'Cause your bim bam baby's coming home tonight.  
Get my slim slam slippers, and my easy chair,  
  
Run you flim flam fingers through my greasy hair,  
Then kiss me, baby, let me hold you tight.  
Been north and south and east and west,  
But even a honey bee needs some rest.  
  
When I get my jacket and my trousers pressed,  
I'll follow the swallow right back to my nest.  
Don't you wim wam worry if my train is late,  
On the shim sham shuttle on a frim fram freight,  
  
'Cause your bim bam baby is coming home tonight.
