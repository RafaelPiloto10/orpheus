I sat by the ocean  
And drank a potion, baby to erase you  
Face down in the boulevard yet I couldn't face you  
  
There ain't no use in cryin'  
It doesn't change anything, so baby what good does it do?  
Your friends they'll sympathize, maybe I don't need them to  
  
Imagine I'd be your one and only  
Instead I'm the lonely one  
You, me, and a lie  
Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
  
There's nowhere to run away  
Said, 'Boy if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new'  
'Do you know who you really are? Are you sure it's really you'?  
Lies are a funny thing  
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you  
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view  
  
Imagine I'd be your one and only  
Instead I'm the lonely one  
You, me, and a lie  
Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
You, me, and a lie  
Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide  
  
Closer and closer  
We're crashing ships in the night
