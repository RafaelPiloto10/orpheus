If I look like home to you  
If I am your sign  
Don't try to understand it girl  
When I draw the line  
It hasn't come to this  
That you can say I waste my time  
  
Looking everywhere and going nowhere  
  
For the skies they look so lazy now  
Heavy are the clouds  
There's nothing here that I could learn  
Or what it's all about  
You haven't said a thing to me  
And you talk so very loud  
  
Looking everywhere and going nowhere  
  
Well I think I'll try the circus  
Or go back to Mexico  
It's time to make mistakes again  
It's time to change the show  
It's time and time and time again  
To find another way  
It's time to gather forces  
And get out of yesterday  
  
Because I lost what I was looking for  
There's nothing left to share  
I need to take myself away  
To be some other where  
A face, a life, a minute more  
I don't think I can spare  
  
Looking everywhere and going nowhere  
  
'Cause I tell you when you hurt me  
And you just don't seem to know  
I inform you that I'm lonely  
And you still don't think I'll go  
So if I lie to you and smile a thought  
It's only half way here  
It's just the circus and I'm singing I'm never really near  
  
If I look like home to you  
If I am your sign  
Don't try to understand it girl  
When I draw the line  
It hasn't come to this  
That you can say I waste my time  
  
Looking everywhere, looking everywhere  
Looking anywhere and going nowhere
