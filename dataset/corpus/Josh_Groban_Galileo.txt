Galileo fell in love  
As a Galilean boy  
And he wondered what in Heaven,  
Who invented such a joy?  
  
But the question got the better of his scientific mind  
And to his blind and dying days he looked up high and often sighed  
And sometimes cried:  
  
Who puts the rainbow in the sky?  
Who lights the stars at night?  
Who dreamt up someone so divine,  
Someone like you and made them mine?  
  
Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then  
But just remember the alternatives  
For I remember when I was lonely,  
And unhappy and my lips were cold as ice  
But you kissed me and good Heavens,  
Now I'm here in paradise  
  
So if I'm ever not kissing you or looking in your eyes  
I won't be blind and I won't cry  
I'll look up high and gladly sigh  
  
And thank the guy  
Who puts the rainbow in the sky  
Who lights the stars at night  
Who dreamt up someone so divine,  
Someone like you and made them mine  
Someone like you and made them mine
