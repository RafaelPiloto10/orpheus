A Night In The Life Of A Blues Singer  
(Lynott)  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
I had nothin' to live for  
And nothin' to lose  
And all the time  
I was paying my dues  
Like an old blues singer  
And I had no troubles then  
But I had lots of friends  
Friends they come and go  
And sometimes friendship ends  
All the time, I've had a friend on whom I depend  
So blues singer  
Oh...  
Oh mama, mama, mama, this is your boy  
Oh mama, mama, mama, mama, my soul's been destroyed  
Oh mama, mama, your pride and joy  
Is a blues singer  
An old blues singer  
And the party's over now  
Everybody's goin' home  
The band is packin' up  
And I'm on my own  
Oh, but I miss you now you're gone  
Mama, your boy's a blues singer  
Such an old blues singer  
Nothin, oh but nothin's changed  
Oh sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
I lost ya mama  
I lost ya mama  
In the old days  
I could sing the blues  
Had nothin' to live for  
And nothin' to lose  
But all the time  
You must chose  
I'm an old blues singer  
Oh...
