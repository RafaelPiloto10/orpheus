As the sun sets and you let go  
And my dreams go that way too  
And I watch the silhouettes flow out of clear view  
  
We can do this thing right  
Fix what went wrong  
Really make this work  
Turn around real slow  
Walk straight back to me  
Nobody has to get hurt  
  
We can learn from my mistakes now  
I don't ask you to forget  
But forgive my good intentions and where they went  
  
We can do this thing right  
Fix what went wrong  
Really make this work  
Turn around real slow  
Walk straight back to me  
Nobody has to get hurt
