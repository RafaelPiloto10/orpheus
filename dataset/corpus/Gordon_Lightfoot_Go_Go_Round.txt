Alone upon the sidewalks of despair, 'twas there she wandered with her
suitcase in her hand.  
Her fate she pondered, only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care.  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving.  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her,  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way,  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one.  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere.  
  
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended,  
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended.  
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears,  
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him.  
  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere,  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care, a go-go girl in love.
