I know you're out there having a good time.  
Spaced out chicks, love potions and good wine.  
Don't make me laugh, you're not in there alone,  
There's other people's voices in the room.  
  
Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,  
No eye communication, always happens this way.  
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?  
No eye communication always happens that way.  
  
I know I shouldn't let it happen,  
There's no excuse, I felt so alone.  
You know how it is, our lure was meant to trap them,  
And then they find some poison of their own.  
  
Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,  
No eye communication, always happens this way.  
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?  
No eye communication always happens
