Don't you know it doesn't matter  
Who you are or what you'd really like to be  
Cause it's all without your mind  
And you weren't born blind  
  
And you don't have to see  
Just keep it in your heart  
And if it takes you far  
It's a start man  
It's a start  
Women were sent from heaven above  
And love needs to be loved  
Needs to be loved  
  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved  
Love needs to be loved
