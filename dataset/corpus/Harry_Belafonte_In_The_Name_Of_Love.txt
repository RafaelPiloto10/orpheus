What burns and glows without flame?  
What lives and grows without rain?  
What brings a smile that lasts for a little while  
That makes me cry without shame?  
  
How can you please me then torture  
And tease me and do it in the name of love?  
  
Don't you know how to be nice?  
You'd leave me without thinking twice  
Your wall has an oven when you want a little lovin'  
And you go from fire to ice  
  
How can you please me then torture  
And tease me and do it in the name of love?  
  
I'm comin', I'm a goin', is it rainin' or snowin'?  
I got no way of knowin' your mind  
  
You make me rise and fall  
You make me stumble and crawl  
So baby, get with it, you might as well admit it  
Don't love your daddy at all  
  
Cause how can you please me then torture  
And tease me and do it in the name of love?  
  
You make me rise and fall  
You make me stumble and crawl  
So baby, get with it, you might as well admit it  
Don't love your daddy at all  
  
Cause how can you please me then torture  
And tease me and do it in the name of love?  
Do it in the name of love, do it in the name of love
