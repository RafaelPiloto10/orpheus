It's a strange song  
'Bout a boy who went wrong  
Who tried to make it up  
Inside his heart and start again  
To make a manse  
  
For livin' his strange life  
He's never made a change life  
Until one day he found himself alone  
With only him  
And oh how dim his future seemed  
  
On that day  
He searched to find a better way to be a man  
And as he tried  
He cast away his foolish pride  
And I understand  
  
His strange song  
Then he came a sing along  
Where every note was just a proper one  
To hum and sing and have a thing  
That's groovy with  
  
On that day  
He searched to find a better way to be a man  
And as he tried  
He cast away his foolish pride  
And I understand  
  
His strange song  
Then he came a sing along  
Where every note was just a proper one  
To hum and sing and have a thing  
That's groovy with
