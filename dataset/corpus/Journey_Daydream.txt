Shining in the silver moon,  
Crystal ships are sailing to the sea.  
Dreams the joys of pearls and gold,  
And our angel's wings in flight unfold.  
Fly, fly by my window,  
Flyin' so free, yeah.  
  
Yes, they fly, fly by my window.  
Yes, those bright diamonds a-once were stone,  
Rollin' down a silver stream.  
Yes, those bright diamonds a-once were stone.  
  
Sail on a silver wings of fire,  
Sailing dreams beyond the silver moon.  
In silver clouds that fly so high,  
Live the dreams you search,  
But can't find.
