You have your rules and regulations,  
You say his love is my salvation  
Then talk of faith and segregation,  
You say that I must wait,  
He will communicate,  
I will not join your congregation.  
  
You force me into situations,  
Preach bad of sin and fornication,  
Forget your sworded celebration,  
My heart fills up with rage  
Who are you to gauge,  
The purpose of my world's creation.  
  
I cannot see the light your seeing,  
I have my own thoughts to believe in,  
I will not heed the words your hearing,  
I will not be accused, my liberty abused,  
You chose the cross that you are bearing.  
  
why want me to believe the word's you read  
But I don't believe in what your good book says,  
I just believe that when I'm dead, I'm dead.  
You say I must repent,  
Bow down and show respect,  
I am a man and I will not be led.
