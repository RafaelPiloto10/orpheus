It's so fucked I am here doing this  
It's bullshit, things don't end like this  
  
I'm calling,  
Staring into this place,  
Where I cease to exist,  
Wondering, why do things always end up like this  
  
Chorus:  
Jon: Fly  
Take to the sky another dream of empty  
Jon: Lies  
Of promises denied by a forgiving  
Jon: God  
Who eats his young you're nothing you fucking  
Jon: Fraud  
My belief was betrayed I lost my faith in you  
Jon: Try  
To understand the sorrow and the  
Jon: Why  
Of a light that should still be burning  
Jon: Bright  
The angel in flight with a dog by his  
Jon: Side  
When you took him away I lost my faith in even you!!  
  
It's so fucked I am here doing this

Wondering, why do things always end up like this

The angel in flight with a dog by his  
Jon: Side  
When you took him away I lost my faith in even you!!  
  
As I feel emptiness growing in my heart  
I can't help but scream into hating you  
I bet you think it's funny  
You give us a gift and then you take it back
