Oh anytime and anywhere  
I'll give you all my heart I swear  
And when your love begins to turn  
I light the fire, and it burns  
Oh all I want is everything  
But I can't buy you diamond rings  
But I will make your dreams come true  
But one thing I don't want to do  
  
I don't want to be your part time lover  
I don't want to play no silly games  
Oh don't tell me baby there's no other  
I don't want to die in sweet, sweet flames  
I don't want to be your part time lover  
I don't want to play no silly games  
I don't want to be your special brother  
Again, again, again  
  
Oh lonely days and lonely nights  
I'm waiting for your call, that's right  
Oh should I stay or should I go  
There is a place, oh girl I know  
Don't waiting for a star to fall  
Oh hundred times I tried to call  
Oh baby why you telling lies  
And try to break my paradise
