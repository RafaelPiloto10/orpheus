Don't forget to seek out the world  
If you want to stay [stake out]  
Your actions speak much louder than words  
And you get to realize  
  
Just as long as you have control  
Holding the fire  
Just as long as you can control  
This point of your desire  
  
Great days, it will all come to you [Wait as it will ...]  
Feel another future response [Feel it as a...]  
You get the heaven you like  
You get the heaven  
You get the heaven you need  
You get to heaven now  
  
Just as long as you bring the power  
From the inside  
Just as long as you hold the key  
From the inside  
Ascend and create  
Ascend and create  
Ascend and create  
Ascension  
  
They will bring you rain  
They will move the sky  
They will give you light  
It will lift you long (It will live you long)  
  
To the eyes of child  
To the song of songs  
It will bring the moon  
It will transfer you  
  
Whole (home)  
Pushing for the time to call  
Dancing on the moon  
Giving it out (Digging it out)  
  
In the night of nights  
It will shine for you  
With the wings of flight  
It will make it through  
  
To the eyes of child (Through the eyes...)  
And the test of song  
It will comfort you  
It will make you feel  
  
Whole  
Looking for the chance to call  
Making the world  
Independently  
  
Whole  
Watching for the place to run  
Dancing, dancing, move  
  
We will make it right  
We will dance for you  
On this night of nights  
They will make it through  
  
Through the eyes of child  
And the wish you are  
As the thought that comes  
From a distant star  
  
Whatever thoughts you have  
Can become a new dream  
For the perfect stance  
Take you there and back again  
  
And you believe you are  
Independently whole  
Waiting for the signs, whole (home)  
Reaching for the far side show  
  
Whole  
Dancing for the moon  
Dancing for the light  
  
Whole  
Pushing for the mind drive  
Dancing for the hour [earth]  
Dancing for the light  
Whole  
  
Dancing for the light  
  
They will bring the rain  
They will make it right  
It will transfer you  
Each and every night  
  
With her wings of hope  
They will cover you  
They will make it right  
They will shine for you  
  
With the golden wings  
Close around your soul  
It will count for you  
It will make you whole  
  
To the eyes of child (Through the eyes...)  
And the song of songs  
It will make you move  
It will transfer you  
  
And so it comes to this now  
When you walk into the bliss that  
Holds down the fire  
As pleasure will divide (divine)  
  
So close, so let your heart enter  
Succumb and let your heart enter this (So come, and let...)  
  
So close, and let yourself lose control  
Heaven help the love that you send  
Heaven has the love you send.  
Really (Breathe)  
  
Whole  
Watching for the time to call  
Dancing in the light  
Making it right  
Dancing  
Dancing  
  
Whole  
Waiting for the signs  
Whole (home)  
Reaching for the sight to show  
Whole  
Independently  
Whole  
Pushing for the mind drive  
Dancing on the out (earth)  
Dancing in the light  
  
They will bring the rain  
They will shine the light  
Understanding this  
It can come tonight  
  
For the love of love  
And the answers, too  
It begins with me  
It begins with you  
  
Whole  
Wishing for the time to call  
Looking for the sign  
Making it right  
Dancing  
Dancing  
  
Whole  
Waiting for the time to call  
Dancing in the harmless sun  
Entering the mind drive  
  
Don't forget to seek out the world  
If you want to stake out  
Actions speak much louder the words (than words)  
And you get to realize  
Just as long as you have control  
Holding the fire  
Just as long as you get to keep  
This point of your desire  
  
When tense, it will come to you (Wait as it will come to you)  
Fear of the future response (Feel it as a future response)  
You get the heaven you like  
You get to heaven  
You get the heaven you need  
You get to heaven now
