Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone and all the roses falling  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye  
  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen and even down the mountain side  
The summer's gone and all the roses falling  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow  
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so  
  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen and even down the mountain side  
The summer's gone and all the roses falling  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow  
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so
