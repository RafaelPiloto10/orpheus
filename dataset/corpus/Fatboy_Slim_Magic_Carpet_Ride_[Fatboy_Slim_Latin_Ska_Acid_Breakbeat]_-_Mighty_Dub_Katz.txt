I like to dream  
Right between the sound machine  
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night  
Any place it goes is right  
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
You don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?, fantasy will set you free.  
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp, and so I wished that I could stay.  
Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around, a lousy candle was all I found.  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
Well, you don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free.  
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl, let the Sound take you away.  
You don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
