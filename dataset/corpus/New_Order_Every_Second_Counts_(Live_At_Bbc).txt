Every little counts  
When I am with you  
I think you are a pig  
You should be in a zoo  
I guess I should've known  
I'd end up on my own  
Every second counts when I am with you  
  
Every little counts  
When I am with you  
Even though you're stupid  
I still follow you  
The smile upon your face  
It always stays in place  
Every little counts oh, when I am with you  
(Do-do-do-do...)  
Every second counts oh, when I am with you  
  
Every second counts  
When I am with you  
Even though you're stupid  
I still look at you  
The smile upon your face,  
It always stays in place  
Every little counts when I am with you  
(Do-do-do-do...)  
  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Every second counts when I am with you  
(Think you are a pig, you should be in a zoo...)
