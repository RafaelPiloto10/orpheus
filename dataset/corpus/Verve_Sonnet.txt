My friend and me  
Looking through her red box of memories  
Faded I'm sure  
But love seems to stick in her veins you know  
  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
My lord  
  
Why can't you see  
That nature has its way of warning me  
Eyes open wide  
Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye  
  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
Yes, there's love if you want it  
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord  
My lord  
  
Sinking faster than a boat without a hull  
My lord  
Dreaming about the day when I can see you there  
My side  
By my side  
  
Here we go again and my head is gone, my lord  
I stop to say hello  
'Cause I think you should know, by now  
By now  
By now  
By now  
By now  
By now  
Oh, by now  
Oh, by now  
Oh, by now  
Oh, by now
