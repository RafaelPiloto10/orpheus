Hanging out and shooting out all of the lights  
I toss and toss, it's after dark  
Is this real or just a dream, some fantasy?  
And is this real or emptiness?  
  
We're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh, we're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
She still stand beside my parts and in this world  
It's getting sicker all the time  
Say that victim, a victim made society  
Chop her ankle and bring it back to her family, yeah  
  
We're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh, we're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
Dusty highway  
Wait, await and see  
West of passion  
Oh, turn back to me  
Oh, come back to me, oh  
  
Nuclear alarmament, disarmament  
We are going straight to hell  
Kill for problem, kill for pride and kill for fun  
Democracy has just begun, yeah  
  
We're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh, we're getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
We'll never passes with open  
Pass through this way again  
The night is gladly or somewhat, so it seems  
Is this real or just a dream? Yeah  
  
Oh  
Oh
