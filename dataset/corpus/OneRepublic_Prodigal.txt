We say goodbye, I turn my back  
Run away, run away, so predictable  
Not far from here, you see me crack  
Like a bone, like a bone, I'm so breakable  
  
I'll take everything from you  
But you'll take anything, won't you?  
  
Run away, run away like a prodigal  
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me  
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me, and you wait for me  
  
I'm on the road to who knows where  
Look ahead, not behind I keep saying  
There's no place to go where you're not there  
On your rope I hold tight but it's freeing  
  
I'll take everything from you  
But you'll take anything, won't you?  
  
Run away, run away like a prodigal  
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me  
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me, and you wait for me  
  
Everybody wants to be right  
But only if it's not a day light  
I keep trying to find my way back  
My way back  
  
Run away, run away like a prodigal  
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me  
So ashamed, so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me, and you wait for me  
  
Runaway, runaway, runaway  
From you, from you, from you
