[Fabolous:]  
Yeah  
Fabolous  
Brooklyn  
How real is that?  
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S-  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
The games over I'm fed  
Hop out the Range Rover with led  
Inf on it so I won't aim over ya head  
Ya'll niggas that give my name over to feds  
I dump slugs in ya pull ya chain over ya head  
I could hire trained soldiers instead  
Cause I rather flip shit call a dame over for head  
Sip gin 'tiil I wake with hang overs in bed  
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S-  
The skinny hard fellow  
That brainwashed ghettos  
With nickels of crack the size of marshmellows  
Cops heard this heard that  
I come through where I purchased birds at  
Fur this fur that  
Let me find out you givin' words to the Dees  
I push ya top back like  
Going to Guadalupe just to splurge a few gees  
Ya'll want birds and hoochies  
I want birds and cuties  
Guess I'm a lucky guy  
All I stay is ducky high  
Next day in the Rover tryin' to suck me dry  
Throw 20s on me truck me bye  
Unless they crack the dash they ain't tryin' to hold me suck  
These thighs motherfucker  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Fabolous  
Get it right  
Brooklyn  
Clumminati  
Yeah
