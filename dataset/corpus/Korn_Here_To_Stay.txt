This time I'm taking it away, I've got a problem  
When they get it in the way, not by my side  
So I'll take my face and bash it into a mirror  
I won't have to see the pain  
  
This pain is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating  
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again  
  
My hurt inside is fading  
This shit's gone way too far  
All this time I've been waiting  
Oh I cannot grieve anymore  
For what's inside awaking  
I'm done, I'm not a whore  
You've taken everything and  
Oh I cannot give anymore  
  
My mind's done with this  
Okay, I've got a question  
Can I throw it all away?  
Take back what's mine  
So I'll take my time  
Driving humbly down the line  
Each cut, closer to the vein  
  
This pain is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating  
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again  
  
The hurt inside is fading  
This shit's gone way too far  
All this time I've been waiting  
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore  
For what's inside awaking  
I'm not, I'm not a whore  
You've taken everything and  
Oh I cannot give anymore  
  
I'm here to stay (bring it down)  
Bring it down!  
Gonna bring it down  
Gonna break it down  
Gonna break it  
  
This pain is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating  
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again  
  
My hurt inside is fading  
This shit's gone way too far  
All this time I've been waiting  
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore  
For what's inside awaking  
I'm not, I'm not a whore  
You've taken everything and  
Oh I cannot give anymore  
  
Give anymore
