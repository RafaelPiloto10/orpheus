Down at Backwater junction rolling down the line  
In the dark early morning I heard the one-forty-nine  
I was walking down the highway, needed somewhere to go  
A lady laid beside me and she invited me home  
She led me cold, tired and hungry down the backwater road  
  
In a house on the corner looking over the track  
I woke up with a fever and a pain in my back  
She was lying there beside me, my fever started to grow  
Had a funny feeling but the lady said no  
My lover needs a doctor down the Backwater Road  
  
Whatcha lookin' for, whatcha lookin' for  
Lady do you know what cha' lookin' for  
Was I wrong to play along?  
Lady was I right or lady was I wrong?  
  
Backwater doctor, you've got me breathing in time  
It's ten-thirty in the morning and I'm feeling alright  
I went back to my lady but I wasn't to know  
Lady left this morning and she's not coming home  
I was cold when she left me down the Backwater Road  
  
I am just a poor man, got nowhere to go  
All my leaves have fallen, left me all alone  
If I was a rich man, if I was a king  
I would give you all I have, give you everything  
If you'd just take me, just take me now  
If you'd just take me  
  
Never seen my daddy, died when I was two  
Mama did the best she could, taught me all she knew  
Said that love was everything, tears came to her eyes  
Never knew the meaning, now I realise  
Love is all you need, all you need now  
If you just take me  
  
I'm trying hard to get you, I'm not the only one  
Never had a big car, but I'm not on the run  
If love has got a meaning see it in my eyes  
If you see the beginning, then you'd realise  
Love is all you need, all you
