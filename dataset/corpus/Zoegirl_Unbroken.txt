To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
Fallen to pieces  
(I am undone)  
The things you said  
(Manipulation)  
I trusted you like a fool  
While you made all the rules  
So you searched me out  
And you took me down  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
The things you found  
(To use against me)  
Have lost their sound  
(When mercy and truth meet)  
I fell to the Father's feet  
His words washed all over me  
And all the scars you made  
Watch them fade away  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet  
Embraced the victory, and some defeat  
I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet  
I found the beauty in the place they meet  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken
