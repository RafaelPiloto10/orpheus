[Chorus:]  
Somebody remind me where I am  
That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it...  
  
[Drake - Verse 1]  
Tonight I'm into breaking up  
Somebody's home  
I'm drunk as ever  
I'm not alone, I'm with my people  
I know you love it  
I don't jus do it  
I over does it  
I be getting money so long  
It's just paper to me  
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me  
You can never reminisce when you forget it all  
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all  
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio  
Baby forget about it  
I'm headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed  
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it  
My judgements never clouded  
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman  
I'm bout whatever man  
I'm tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland  
But I'm polite about it  
Baby after you  
I've had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
-that's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light  
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night  
Where'd I put my bow tie  
Millionnaire multi  
Rest in peace to B. I. G and praises to the most high  
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions  
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given  
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition  
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of livin'  
I live from it though, I've been down and I got up  
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up  
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen  
Because everythings easier to get into than get out of  
But someone show me to the owner of this city  
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me  
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee  
Ny forever nigga, Diddy,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somebody remind me where I am  
That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So it's on. I was looking for the one  
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And I'mma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You don't even know me  
I'mma do it all  
I'mma do it all  
Probably why I'm back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it
