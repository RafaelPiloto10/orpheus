The old maid's a waitin' for leap year to come the crooner's just waitin' to
sing  
The old cow's standin' by the Bull Durham sign  
Just waitin' for the grass to turn green  
The bar-fly's waitin' for an easy mark the hitchhiker's just waitin' for a
ride  
The lifetimer's waitin' for a prison break the beachcomber's waitin' for the
tide  
Farmer's daughter's waitin' for the salesman to take her into rown  
The city slicker's waitin' for the country boy to lay all his money down  
You know everything comes to standstill nothing seems to make a turn  
Worm must be waitin' for the early bird  
Now I reckon the early bird's waitin' for the worm  
Nobody wants to do nothin' just waitin' to get a finger in the pie  
Waitin' for a call for a big quiz show or a waitin' for some rich uncle to die  
Katy she's waitin' at the garden gate the moonshiner's waitin' at the still  
The gambler's still waitin' for that Ace in the hole and I guess Jack's still
waitin' for Jill  
Everybody's waitin' for something but nothing seems to turn out right  
Cause the night shift's waitin' for mornin' and the burglar he's just waitin'
for night  
The congregation's waitin' for the preacher the preacher's just waitin' for
the groom  
The groom's just waitin' for the June bride and the bride's just waitin' for
June  
Sunflower's waitin' for the sunshine violet's just waitin' for dew  
Bee's just waitin' for honey and honey I'm just waitin' for you
