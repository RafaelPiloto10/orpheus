Me and the vivid girl  
In our hammock to the stars  
Staring into the fire before TV,  
The remote-control's on Mars  
  
In the dope of the pigment,  
In the poetic state of mind  
In a flood of country  
We lay down to kill some time  
  
And we spoke languidly  
Of the Northern Bee  
And collecting dewdrops for tea  
Underneath the cannonball tree  
  
We were high,  
We were sherpa-high,  
We conspired against old friends  
We said we must be friends or die  
And we've died a thousand times  
Since then  
  
And we spoke long, at length  
Of the fight or flee  
And of nothing in particularly  
Underneath the cannonball tree  
  
We spoke off-handedly  
Of new extremes  
And of nothing in particularly  
Underneath the cannonball tree  
  
We're at the point  
Where we love or hate it  
We can write it down  
And obliterate it  
When we're at the point  
When we neither love nor hate it  
We can lay down  
And obliterate it
