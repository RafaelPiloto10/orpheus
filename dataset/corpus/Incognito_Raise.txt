Raise, your voice out into the universe  
Raise, your mind beyond the planets and the sun  
Raise, where there is need, you'll find us there  
Raise, spread the message everywhere  
The dawning of the ages has just began  
Ooh, oh yes, raise your voice out into the universe, oh yes, ooh oh  
Stand, stand tall, head up high above the traitors call  
We come in numbers seeking peace for one and all  
Our history, if nothing else has taught us that we're wrong  
When we destroy, destroy the place where we belong  
Raise, your voice out into the universe  
Raise, your mind beyond the planets and the sun  
Raise, where there is need, you'll find us there  
Raise, spread the message everywhere  
The dawning of the ages has just began  
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh  
Stand, stand tall, head up high above the traitors call  
We come in numbers seeking peace for one and all  
Our history, yeah, if nothing else has taught us that we're wrong  
When we destroy, destroy the place where we belong
