Oh, yes, man, I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?  
  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do, yes  
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?
