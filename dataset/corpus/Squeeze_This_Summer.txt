Brain engages mouth  
Mouth expresses thoughts  
Of how we shared those fun fair rides  
Beneath the brightness of the night  
Time can crowd the head  
Like a sardine can  
The summer that began to blur  
Has put us on the calendar  
  
This summer there won't be a cloud in the sky  
I'm so made up I feel I could take off and fly  
This summer we've pulled all the sheets off the bed  
I'm so happy I can't get you out of my head  
This summer I am so in love with you  
  
Mornings pass us by  
As curtains hide the sun  
Nights we spent out of control  
Like two flags wrapped around a pole  
  
I see the helter skelter lights  
And hear the music in the breeze  
And when we're skimming stones tonight  
It feels so good that you're with me  
  
This summer there won't be a cloud in the sky  
I'm so made up I feel I could take off and fly  
This summer we've pulled all the sheets off the bed  
I'm so happy I can't get you out of my head  
There's no reason to ever feel lonely again  
This summer I am so in love with you
