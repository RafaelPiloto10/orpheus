Ms. lady say she know my name and I ain't even told her yet  
No need ta introduce myself, I let my money do the greeting  
So conceited, that if she ain't worth talking to then I'm not speakin'  
(Gucci!)  
I'm so single ay lets mingle, can I buy you some champagne  
And my sex game gladiator tell me are you entertained  
I'm an entertainer Baby but my name ain't Cedric  
I got cheddar and et cetera.  
So stop the rhetoric  
But enough about me baby, sweetie tell bout ya self  
Are you married or divorced, don't gotta tell me that's your choice

So let nature take its course,

Set and rise  
Or just lay back on the beach and watch the sky  
(Gucci!)  
She's been sent to me, lent to me  
I feel she is God's gift to me  
Its Gucci mane on the mic'  
While Zay control the symphony  
No twistin' it she swichin' it but she not all promiscuous  
Its obvious she's marvelous and wants to be a part of this

Sex so hot and passionate

Yea I'm a bachelor but I'm workin' my masters  
And no I'm not a doctor but my money  
Go way past one, shes hotter than my last one  
Sexy like my last chick I'm checkin' out her assets  
Her ex-boyfriend is past tense  
I talk to her, I listen to her text her then she text me  
I rap to her she walks to me and damn her walk is sexy  
Our last night was so good I think about her next day  
More but then four ashtrays she told me boy you crazy  
Burnin' all my candles and lighting all my incense  
I'm givin' her my imprint cause damn I like her accent
