I'm not part of your elite  
I'm just alright  
Class structure waving colors  
Bleeding from my throat  
Not subservient to you I'm just alright  
Down classed by the powers that be  
Give me loss of hope  
Cast out...buried in a hole  
Struck down...forcing me to fall  
Destroyed...giving up the fight  
I know I'm not alright  
What's my price and will you pay it if it's alright?  
Take it from my dignity  
Waste it until it's dead  
Throw me back into the gutter  
Cause it's alright  
Find another pleasure fucker  
Drag them down to hell
