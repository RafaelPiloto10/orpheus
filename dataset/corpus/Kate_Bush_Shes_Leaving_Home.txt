Wednesday morning at five o'clock  
As the day begins  
Silently closing her bedroom door  
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more  
She goes downstairs to the kitchen  
Clutching her handkerchief  
Quietly turning the back door key  
Stepping outside she is free  
She (we gave her most of our lives)  
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)  
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)  
She's leaving home after living alone for  
So many years (bye bye)  
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown  
Picks up the letter that's lying there  
Standing alone at the top of the stairs  
She breaks down and cries to her husband  
Daddy our baby's gone  
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly  
How could she do this to me  
She (We never thought of ourselves)  
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)  
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)  
She's leaving home after living alone for  
So many years (bye bye)  
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away  
Waiting to keep the appointment she made  
Meeting a man from the motor trade  
She (what did we do that was wrong)  
Is having (we didn't know it was wrong)  
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)  
Something inside that was always denied for  
So many years (bye bye)  
She's leaving home (bye bye)
