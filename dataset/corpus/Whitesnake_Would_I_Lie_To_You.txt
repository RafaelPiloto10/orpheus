Hey girl, if you want me,  
Come an' get me  
Don't hang around  
Or we could spend the night sleeping alone  
  
If you could change your style, for a while,  
An' look in my direction,  
Tell me do I look the kind of guy  
Who takes advantage of a women like you  
  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
Baby, I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to, would I lie to, would I lie to you  
  
Hey girl, if you need  
Some love an' affection,  
I'll whisper all the sweet, sweet nothings  
I know you little girls like to hear  
If you would change your mind  
We could find a night of satin sheet action,  
I promise I won't do anything  
Baby, unless you wanted me to  
  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to, would I lie to, should I lie to you  
  
I don't want to sleep alone tonight,  
After all you put me through.  
I've spent the whole night searching  
For a woman just like you.  
Look in my eyes, tell you lies  
Then, baby, it's just because I want you to stay  
  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to you.  
Would I lie to you, would I lie to you  
Baby, I would do anything that you want me too,  
But, would I lie to, would I lie to, would I lie to you
