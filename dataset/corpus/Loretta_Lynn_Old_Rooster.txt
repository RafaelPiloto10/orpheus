He's forty but he thinks that he's twenty  
He's got that boyish grin and he grins plenty  
At every pretty girl that he's passin  
He thinks that they're all his for the asking  
  
He's never aged a day hear him swear  
Loving cares done wonders for his hair  
Except a few bald spots are showing  
The old rooster's back and he's crowing  
  
[Chorus:]  
The Old roosters back and he's crowing  
Age ain't taught him nothing and it's showin  
One of these days he'll wake up and know  
He's been knocked off his roostin pole  
  
He's the king of the roost see him struttin  
For punishment that ole boy's a glutton  
This old hen might start feather picking  
If he don't stop eye balling the chickens  
  
Adamantly he's taken by the truck load  
He says that he's never gonna grow old  
But I've got news for him that's quite alarming  
He became a grandpa this morning  
  
[Chorus:]
