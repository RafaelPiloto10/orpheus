Do you see the way that tree bends? Does it inspire?  
Leaning out to catch the sun's rays...a lesson to be applied...  
Are you gettin' something out of this all encompassing trip?  
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets oh...  
Or you can come to terms and realize  
You're the only one who can forgive yourself oh yeah...  
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense...  
Have you ideas on how this life ends?  
Checked your hands and studied the lines?  
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light?  
Seems that needlessly it's gettin' harder  
To find an approach and a way to live...  
Are we gettin' something out of this all-encompassing trip?  
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh...  
Or you can come to terms and realize...  
You're the only one who cannot forgive yourself, oh...  
A-makes much more sense to live in the present tense...
