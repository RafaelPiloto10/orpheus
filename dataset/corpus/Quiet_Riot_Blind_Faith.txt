[Verse 1:]  
I?ve been the distance and I?ve seen it all  
I?ve been turned around by love and hate  
I have resided in my private hell  
But I love this life and I live to tell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Blind Faith is the cause of the trouble  
Blind faith what we bleed  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When I was young I didn?t realize  
There was hope and fear with no compromise  
And now I testify before myself  
I keep walking on in my innocence  
  
[Bridge:]  
I know if you follow me- you get what want, you get what you need  
Somebody?s got to set you free- you get what want, you get what you need  
Now don?t you give it and learn to breathe  
You hear a message now before you leave  
You know the fortune here that you have found  
There ain?t no doubt about it, there ain?t no doubt about it
