  
  
  
  
Jesus wrote a blank check  
  
One I haven't cashed quite yet.  
  
I hope I've got a little more time.  
  
I hope it's not the end of the line.  
  
Yeah Jesus wrote a blank check.  
  
One I haven't cashed yet all right.  
  
But if I had to choose a number  
  
I'd want it to be number one.  
  
I don't want to be number two.  
  
Yeah I don't want to be number four.  
  
But I can hear a knock on the door.  
  
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right.  
  
If Jesus saw me dying,  
  
Would angels come a flying down?  
  
I hope I've got a little more time.  
  
I hope somebody lends me a dime.  
  
Now, Jesus wrote a blank check.  
  
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet.  
  
Still I build my towers high.  
  
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky.  
  
Still I wallow in the mire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I build my towers high.  
  
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky.  
  
Still I wallow in the mire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.  
  
Still I burn this earthen fire.
