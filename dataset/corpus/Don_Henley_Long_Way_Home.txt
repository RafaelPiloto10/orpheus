Oh, it's cold and lonely here-  
Here in this telephone booth  
There's three sides to every story:  
Yours and mine and the cold, hard truth  
I think there's something missing 'round here  
I don't know where it's gone  
But it's a long way back home  
  
The heat don't work  
The toaster don't work  
The car don't work  
And I guess I know why  
This house don't work and this dream don't  
Work no more  
And lover, neither do you and I  
I fall asleep with the colors flying  
Over sand and foam  
But it's a long way back home  
  
And it's a long way back home  
And it's a long way back home  
It's a long way back home
