Let me hear you say "Kid Rocks up on the stage"  
Hey slick, check it  
I'm the Rock you know, I'm gonna smoke it up  
So I can rock it through old school disco cuts  
  
I'm the crisco slick, checkin sisco's shit  
I'm the ultimate  
Yes the K, to the I to the D-D-D, are-O-see-see-K all motherfuckin day  
While I'm strong, let me steal your rhyme  
  
Got the matches, tank, and the 4 foot bong  
Uh, and I ain't bullshittin  
Suckin motherfuckers with the game I'm spittin  
And ain't a damn thing changed  
  
Come on y'all and tell me, what's my name?  
(Kid Rock, Rock)  
I'm the boy fucked up with the hip and hop  
And on the seven sea's they call me Daddy Rock  
  
I had to coochie watch, back in the day  
But I pawned that shit for a rock, last May  
And now I'm back on track  
I don't smoke the crack, don't shoot the smack  
  
I told y'all once, I don't bang  
But I lick more coochie than Katie Lang  
Uh, and you don't stop  
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body pop  
  
That somebody, anybody, all y'all scream  
(Kid Rock, Rock)  
Check it out yo  
What I want to do is break it down  
  
And show y'all a little somthin about where I come from  
Show you some skills of how I used to rock basement party's  
On the wheels of steel, back in the day in the klem yo  
Check it  
  
(Kid Rock, Rock)  
Some of that yo  
It ain't nothin but a motherfuckin party yo  
Break it down on the lst like this  
  
It ain't no party like a Detroit party  
'Cause a Detroit party don't stop  
It ain't no party like a Detroit party  
When your in the fuckin house with Kid Rock
