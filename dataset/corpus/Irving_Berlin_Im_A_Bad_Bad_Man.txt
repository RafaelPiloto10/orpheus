I'm honored, I'm flattered  
This greeting really mattered  
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned  
I like your attention  
But this I have to mention  
You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned  
  
There's a girl in Tennessee  
Who's sorry she met up with me  
Can't go back to Tennessee  
I'm a bad, bad man  
  
There's a girl in Omaha  
But I ran faster than her pa  
Can't go back to Omaha  
I'm a bad, bad man  
  
There's a girl in Wyoming  
And they're combing Wyoming  
To find the man in white  
Who was out with her that night  
  
There's a girl in Arkansas  
The sheriff is her brother-in-law  
Can't go back to Arkansas  
I'm a bad, bad man  
  
You're making too much fuss  
For we don't give a tinker's cuss  
We've been out, yes, each of us  
With a bad, bad man  
  
We've been chasing up and down  
That other show has just left town  
And the one who played the clown  
Was a bad, bad man  
  
You may love us and leave us  
But the parting won't grieve us  
We'll turn the other cheek  
When the minstrels come next week  
  
When the show folks come to call  
A girl may slip but she won't fall  
We'll give some but won't give all  
To a bad, bad man  
  
For years I have yearned to  
Play towns I could return to  
And "this may be it" from the way that you speak  
I'm glad you're not frightened  
The atmosphere has brightened  
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week  
  
Monday when my show is done  
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun  
You may find it lots of fun  
With a bad, bad man  
  
Tuesday there's no matinee  
But I'll be in my tent all day  
You can come around and play  
With a bad, bad man  
  
Send your mothers on Wednesday  
Because Wednesday's old hens' day  
But Thursday is sublime  
I'll have lots of open time  
  
Friday night will be the test  
If Saturday you're still my guest  
Sunday you can come and rest  
With a bad, bad man  
  
I'm enlightened but frightened  
Tho' my interest you've heightened  
It might turn out to be  
That you're much too much for me  
  
So I'll go back to my tent  
And someday when you're old and bent  
Think of hours you might have spent  
With a bad, bad man
