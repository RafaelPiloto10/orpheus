Believe me, Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance to find  
A go-go dance to disco now  
Please believe me, Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance to find  
A go-go dance to disco now  
  
Forget what they said in Soho  
Leave the oh-no's out  
And believe me, Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance  
  
There is an old cliche  
Under your Monet painting  
Remember the arch of roses  
Right above your couch  
Forget what they said in Soho  
Leave the oh-no's out  
Yes, there is an old cliche  
Under your Monet painting  
You left the station now to the floor  
With speculation, what was it for?  
In that old hallway  
Moses, why don't you say  
You've been away for a long time  
  
Believe me, Natalie  
This is your last chance  
To find a go-go  
Forget what they said in Soho  
And walk away  
If my dreams for us can't get you through  
Just one more day  
It's alright by me  
  
God help me somehow  
There's no time for survival left  
The time is now...  
Cause this might be your last chance  
To disco, oh-oh
