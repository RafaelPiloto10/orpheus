I thought I knew you  
Thought that I knew you well  
We had a rhythm  
But I guess you never can tell  
  
Oh I learned early  
Never to ignore the signs  
You'll be forgiven  
It ain't worth that much to my mind  
  
Lovin' you so easy  
It's hard to say goodbye  
But if it's the way it goes it goes  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think you're in my head  
You been seriously misled  
  
Loving somebody ain't your average nine to five  
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive  
I'm not somebody who commits the crime  
And leaves the scene  
But when I've been dissed  
I don't spend much time on what might've been  
I'm not about self-pity  
Your love did me wrong  
So I'm movin', movin' on  
  
Just a page in my history  
Just another one of those mysteries  
One more lover that used to be  
If you think you're in my head  
You been seriously misled
