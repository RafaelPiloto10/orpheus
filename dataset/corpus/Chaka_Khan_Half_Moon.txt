Half Moon, Nighttime sky  
Silver stone, Heaven's eye  
Silver stone from the seven seas  
Won't you be sure you bring sweet love home to me  
  
You thrill me like a mountain  
You thrill me like a sea  
Nighttime's past but still at last your love  
Half moon, Nighttime stone  
  
You be sure that you call my name  
Telling everybody going around  
Won't you tell the world about sweet, sweet love I found you  
  
Thrill me like a mountain  
Thrill me like sea a sea, lord!  
Nighttime's past, still at last love!  
Half moon, Nighttime sky  
  
Silver stone from the seven seas  
Won't you be sure you bring your sweet love home to me now!
