If I were a painting  
Captured on canvas  
Alone in the portriat I would stand  
And brush strokes bold  
Yet soft as a whisper  
The work of a feminine hand  
  
Caught in a still life  
Surrounded by shadows  
And lost in a background of blue  
  
If I were a painting  
My price would be pain  
And the artist would have to be you  
  
I imagine the colors  
Would all run together  
If you ever allowed me to cry  
So don't paint the tears  
Just let me remember me  
Without you in my LIFE  
  
It's only the frame  
That holds me together  
Or else I would be falling apart  
  
If I were a painting  
I wouldn't feel  
And you wouldn't be breaking my heart
