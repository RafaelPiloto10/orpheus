I'm a soldier of freedom in the army of man  
We are the chosen, we're the partisan  
The cause it is noble and the cause it is just  
We are ready to pay with our lives if we must  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side  
  
I'm a soldier of fortune, I'm a dog of war  
And we don't give a damn who the killing is for  
It's the same old story with a different name  
Death or glory, it's the killing game  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side  
  
Nothing gonna stop them as the day follows the night  
Right becomes wrong, the left becomes the right  
And they sing as they march with their flags unfurled  
Today in the mountains, tomorrow the world  
  
Gonna ride across the river deep and wide  
Ride across the river to the other side
