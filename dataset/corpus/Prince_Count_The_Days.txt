Count the days  
Here's the church, here's the steeple  
Here's a muthafucka that I gotta blow away  
Here's my chance 2 cure the ills of the people  
But not until I make this muthafucka pay  
And oh, baby I count the days  
  
(Yeah yes)  
I count the days  
  
Here's the interview, here's the time  
If I keep your secrets, will you keep mine?  
If we hurry, we can catch the train  
If it was left up 2 you, I would die in pain  
(That's why) I count the days  
  
(Oh yeah)  
Oh, I'm counting (Oh)  
Hear me (Hear me)  
(Days) (Days) Days  
Counting the days  
  
Great day in the morning  
The choir sing a pretty song  
Every day I'm with yo ass  
Is another day wasted, I swear its a day 2 long  
I swear it's a day 2 long  
  
Counting  
Like Frankie Beverly without Maze  
I'm counting  
Muthafucka, I count the days  
  
Can I count on? (Hey)  
Count on? (Counting)  
Count on? (Hey yeah)  
I count the days (Days)  
  
Count the days  
Count the days  
Count the days  
Count the days  
Count the days
