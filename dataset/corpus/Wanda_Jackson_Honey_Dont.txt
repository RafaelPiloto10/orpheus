Well how come you say you will when you won't tell me you do baby when you
don't  
Let me know honey how you feel tell me truth now is love real oh ah ah no
honey don't  
Yeah honey don't honey don't honey don't honey don't  
Say you will when you won't ah ah honey don't  
Well I love you baby and you ought to know I like the way that you wear your
clothes  
Everythin' about you is a doggone sweet you've got a way to knock me off of my
feet  
So ah ah no honey don't  
Well honey don't...  
Now sometimes I love you on the Saturday night  
But Sunday morning you don't look right  
You've been out to paint the town ah ah baby been slippin' around  
So ah ah no honey don't  
Well honey don't...
