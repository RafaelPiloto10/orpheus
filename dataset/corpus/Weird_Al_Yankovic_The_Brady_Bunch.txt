You can watch Mr. Rogers  
You can watch Three's Company  
And you can turn on Fame or The Newlywed Game  
Or The Addams Family  
  
I say, you can watch Barney Miller  
And you can watch your MTV  
And you can watch 'till your eyes fall out of your head  
That'll be OK with me  
  
And you can watch (TV)  
  
You can watch Johnny Carson  
You can watch Phil Donahue  
And you can use TV Guide to help you decide  
With capsulized review  
  
Say, you can watch 60 Minutes  
Even Captain Kangaroo  
But there's only one set, so what ever you watch  
Well, you know I gotta watch it too  
  
Say, give it up, give it up, television's taking its toll  
That's enough, that's enough, gimme the remote control  
I been nice, I been good, please don't do this to me  
Turn it off, turn it off, I don't want to have to see  
  
The Brady Bunch  
Not The Brady Bunch  
Well, The Brady Bunch  
Yeah, The Brady Bunch  
  
It's the story of a lovely lady  
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls  
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother  
The youngest one in curls  
  
It's a story of a man named Brady  
Who was busy with three boys of his own  
They were four men living all together  
Yeah, but they were all alone  
  
Until the one day, one day when the lady met the fellow  
And they knew, and they knew it was much more than a hunch  
Then they knew this group must somehow form a family  
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way they all became  
  
The Brady Bunch  
Well, The Brady Bunch  
Yeah, The Brady Bunch  
Well, The Brady Bunch  
Oh, it's The Brady Bunch  
It's The Brady Bunch  
Oh, The Brady Bunch, yeah  
Oh, The Brady Bunch  
It's The Brady Bunch  
Well, it's The Brady Bunch  
Well, it's The Brady Bunch  
Well, it's The Brady Bunch  
It's The Brady Bunch
