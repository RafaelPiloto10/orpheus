I can't describe the feeling when  
  
I'm in my bed asleep and then  
I wake up with a vision blurred  
And all my efforts are deterred  
To reconstruct this image lost  
  
There're certain things my mind must do  
And even though they're very few  
The image glistens like a gem  
  
Repairing is not one of them  
So I'm awake though in my mind  
The image that's so unrefined  
Is calling to me from the deep  
And tempting me to fall asleep
