Now lay me down on market street  
I'm lookin' for some spare change  
A coast guard ship has been lookin' for me  
And I might have to change my name  
  
Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans  
The local chief's on the radio  
He's got some hungry mouths to feed  
Goin back to Alcatraz  
  
Lay me back down here on the highway  
One hundred and one ways to go  
Solitary is so confinin'  
To the legend of Geronimo  
  
Oh I know I could bring the rain  
Used to dance for ABC  
And all the braves down on death row  
Are pretending to be free  
Back home in Alcatraz  
  
In the land of the great white father  
My American blood runs cold  
I left my home in Oklahoma  
To the Everglades I go  
  
It's just the wings on the silver cars  
And I'm allowed to plow a field  
It's not the life for a nineteen seventy  
(What's an)Indian boy to do  
  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Lay me down on market street  
I'm lookin' for some spare change  
A coast guard ship has been lookin' for me  
  
Might have to change my name  
Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans  
Local chief's on the radio  
He's got some hungry mouths to feed  
  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Here comes Uncle Sam again with the same old bag of beans  
Local chief's on the radio  
He's got some hungry mouths to feed  
  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Goin' back to Alcatraz  
Goin' back to Alcatraz
