On a cold October morning  
As frost lay on the ground  
Waiting to make my move  
I make no sound  
  
Waiting for the mist to cover all around  
I carefully picked my time  
Then took the wall  
  
I'm sick and tired of running  
The hunger and the pain  
A stop to look about then off again  
  
Being at the wrong place  
And the wrong time  
Suspected of a hit that was my crime  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Always looking 'round me  
Forever looking back  
I'll always be a target for attack  
  
Ever moving onwards  
Always on the run  
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Even if I find them  
And get to clear my name  
I know that things can never  
Be the same  
  
But if I ever prove  
My innocence some day  
I've got to get them all to make them pay  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name
