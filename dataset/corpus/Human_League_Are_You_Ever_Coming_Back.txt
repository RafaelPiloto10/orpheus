The sun that's shining through the shattered window  
Is breaking into colors in the car  
Through the heat the dust blows round the pueblo  
The sounds of people drift in from afar  
  
Can we really lose everything  
On a matter of pride?  
Is this really the end of our love?  
How am I to decide?  
  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
  
Another village rises in the distance  
To mark the passage to the journey's end  
The droning of the engine is existence  
It's too far for the mind to comprehend  
  
Can we really lose everything  
On a matter of pride?  
Is this really the end of our love?  
How am I to decide?  
  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?
