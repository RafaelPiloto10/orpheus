Think about what you want  
Think about what you got  
And all things that'll heal or hurt you  
'Cause when that big barns full of peaches  
It don't matter what the preacher preaches  
The days are warm, and the weather's full of virtue.  
  
Yeah, Jack and Jill went up the hill  
To fetch a pail of water.  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
'Cause he was messing with the preacher's daughter.  
  
Open up your wings, make a dead man sing  
Such a good, good thing just can't be wrong.  
Oh no no, you can't get too much love  
Oh, don't you feel it in your belly  
Go get you some  
You can't get too much love  
Oh, time is right for loving, so come on, come on.  
  
Can you feel it in your belly, come on.  
  
Mama's in the kitchen,  
Daddy's in the field.  
Baby girl has gone to town 'cause she like the way it make her feel.  
Swimming in the river, rolling in the mud  
When the juice is dripping of your chin  
One peach is not enough.  
You can't get too much love  
So if you feel it in your belly, come on, come on  
You can't get too much love  
Oh, the time is right for loving come and get you some  
You can't get too much love  
Oh give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up.  
  
Oh, the light that shines upon the gift that everyone has for the taking  
And happiness so pure as this is surely worth the making  
  
Yeah, Jack and Jill went up the hill  
To fetch a pail of water  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
'Cause he was messing with the preacher's daughter  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love love love love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love love love love  
  
You can't get too much love  
Oh, if you feel it in your belly, go get you some  
You can't get too much love  
Oh, the time is right for loving so come on come on  
You can't get too much love  
Gonna eat your belly jelly 'til the kingdom come  
You can't get too much love  
So, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
