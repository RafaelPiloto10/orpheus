It's only been an hour  
Since he locked her in the tower  
The time has come  
He must be undone  
By the morning  
  
Many times before  
The tyrant's opened up the door  
Then someone cries  
Still we close our eyes  
Not again  
  
Meet me when the sun is in the western skies  
The fighting must begin before another someone dies  
Cross bows in the fire light  
Green sleeves waving  
Madmen raving  
Through the shattered night  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Flames are getting higher  
Make it leap unto the spire  
Draw bridge down  
Cut it to the ground  
We shall dance around the fire  
  
No more night  
We have seen the light  
Let it shine on bright  
Hang him higher, higher  
  
Draw bridge down  
Cut it to the ground  
We shall dance all around the fire, around the fire  
  
No more night  
we've seen the light  
let it shine on bright  
  
Hang him higher, higher  
Put the man on the fire  
  
Draw bridge down  
Cut it to the ground  
We gotta dance around the fire, the fire, the fire
