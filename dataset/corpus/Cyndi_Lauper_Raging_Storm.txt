Rich man, poor man, beggar man thief  
You can fool some people  
But you can't fool me  
Harbor all the hate and greed  
Threaten demise of democracy  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a raging storm  
In a troubled sea  
But you're clouding my mind  
With celebrity  
  
There are darker times for me  
Behind smoke and mirrors, amputees  
It's a different world  
Now i see the deflowering  
Of the birds and bees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can fight for the right to be  
But ya better not do a bad show on MTV  
  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief  
You can fool some people but you can't fool me  
Smart bombs, rock stars, suit case queens  
God's love we deliver out destiny  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on people, yea yea, yea, yea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on people, yea yea, yea, yea
