I've got your love I don't now how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
I've got your love I don't know why you hid it  
I've never felt like this before  
  
I won't fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You haven't noticed you never say that any more  
  
I've got your love  
And it's a perfect reason for understanding life some more  
  
Burnt your fingers before  
Burnt your finger before  
  
I've got your love I don't know how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
I've got your love it's such a total feeling  
I don't know where it all began  
  
I won't fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You haven't noticed you never say that any more  
  
I've got your love  
And if I lose all others  
It wouldn't really hurt at all  
I've got your love I don't know how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
  
I've got your love I've got your love  
I don't know why it seemed so long
