I am going where I've never been  
I am going where there's no sin  
There I will join my lord and my friends  
Yes I am going where I've never been  
  
Don't be crying thoses bitter tears  
Don't be crying cause I'm not here  
I'll be happy for the first time in years  
So don't be crying those bitter tears  
  
I have travelled life's weary highways  
And my last journey is at hand  
I can hear the Angels calling  
And I am going where I've never been
