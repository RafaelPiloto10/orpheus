I see your face in my mind as I drive away,  
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way  
People are people,  
And sometimes we change our minds  
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time  
  
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,  
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see  
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,  
Now I don't know what to be without you around  
  
And we know it's never simple,  
Never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,  
  
[Chorus]  
And I can't,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to  
  
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt  
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve  
People are people,  
And sometimes it doesn't work out,  
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out  
  
And we know it's never simple,  
Never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's two am  
Feelin' like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know it's not easy,  
Easy for me  
  
It's two am  
Feelin' like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know this ain't easy,  
Easy for me  
  
And we know it's never simple,  
Never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
  
I can't,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to  
  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to  
  
Sorry (oh) sorry  
Sorry sorry  
Sorry sorry
