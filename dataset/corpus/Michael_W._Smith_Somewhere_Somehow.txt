Standing in our silence  
I hear my heart beating  
And if only I could choose  
I'd stay here with you  
But hold me 'til the train is leaving  
Somewhere down the line  
After you're gone from sight  
Our love will be the same  
And, whispering your name,  
I'll cling to you with all my might  
  
Let me dream of you  
But it's true  
And wake me up when this is over  
Love will be there when this is over and  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere far beyond today  
I will find a way to find you  
And somehow through the lonely nights  
I will leave a light in the dark  
Let it lead you to my heart  
  
There's a love inside us  
Deep down inside  
That goes without saying  
Don't say a word  
But I'll tell you just the same  
And that love will fan the flame  
And that flame will warm the heart that's waiting  
  
You are mine and I'll wait for you my love  
You are mine it may take some time  
Even if it takes a lifetime  
Tell me you'll wait  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And somewhere alone  
I will be praying you home  
I know that somehow our love  
  
Our love will lead me to your arms  
  
[Chorus]
