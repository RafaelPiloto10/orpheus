I know that there's a reason why I need to be alone  
I need to find a silent place that I can call my own  
Is it mine, Lord is it mine?  
When everything's dark and nothing seems right,  
There's nothing to win and there's no need to fight  
I never cease to wonder at the cruelty of this land  
But it seems a time of sadness is a time to understand  
Is it mine, Lord is it mine?  
When everything's dark and nothing seems right,  
You don't have to win and there's no need to fight  
If only I could find a way  
To feel your sweetness through the day  
The love that shines around me could be mine.  
So give us an answer, won't you,  
We know what we have to do,  
There must be a thousand voices trying to get through.
