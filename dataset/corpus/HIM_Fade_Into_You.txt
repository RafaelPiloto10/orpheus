I want to hold the hand inside you  
I want to take a breath that's true  
I look to you and I see nothing  
I look to you to see the truth  
You live your life  
You go in shadows  
I look to you and I see nothing  
I look to you to see the truth  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
  
A stranger's light comes on slowly  
A stranger's heart without a home  
You put your hands into your head  
And then smiles cover your heart  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
I think it's strange you never knew
