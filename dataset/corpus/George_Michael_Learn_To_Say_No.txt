Too strong woah  
  
You're too strong for me baby  
I've got to learn to say no  
Something's wrong with me baby  
I've got to learn to say no  
  
I try to give you up but it's hard  
Playing games left a hole in my heart  
You've got me doing things I can't understand  
Won't someone save me take this gun from my head  
  
You're too strong for me baby  
I've got to learn to say no (ugh)  
Something's wrong with me baby  
I've got to learn to say no  
  
Same situation again and again  
I'll say I'm leaving I just don't know when  
You know that I could turn my back on the pain  
It's just that something called pleasure keeps on calling my name  
  
You're too strong for me baby  
I've got to learn to say no (yeah)  
Something's wrong with me baby  
I've got to learn to say no  
  
Ain't nobody gonna win this one baby  
  
Breakdown

Tell me true  
Alibies  
Little white lies  
Gimme that  
Gimme that

Ain't nobody gonna win this one baby  
  
Something called pleasure keeps on calling my name  
  
You're too strong for me baby  
I've got to learn to say no yeah ooooh  
Something's wrong with me baby  
I've got to learn to say no  
I'm just a slave to your heart

Something's wrong with me baby (Something's wrong)
