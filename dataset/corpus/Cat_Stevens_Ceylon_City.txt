I'm going home to the town where i was born  
Where little children laughed as they sang  
A happy song  
In the little town of Ceylon,  
Ceylon city, Ceylon city  
  
I've got a boat , i hope it's still afloat  
With rusty sails, and an old wooden oar  
It goes along, in the little town of Ceylon  
  
Ceylon city  
My daddy will be waiting there  
My sister will be combing down her silver hair  
My mama will be waiting there  
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere  
  
Ceylon city
