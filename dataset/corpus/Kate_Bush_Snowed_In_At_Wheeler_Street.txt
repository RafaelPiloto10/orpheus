Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you but don't I know you?  
There's just something about you. Haven't we met before?  
We've been in love forever.  
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning.  
  
I just let you walk away. I've never forgiven myself.  
I saw you on the steps in Paris, you were with someone else.  
Couldn't you see that should've been me? I just walked on by.  
Then we met in '42 but we were on different sides.  
  
I hid you under my bed but they took you away.  
I lost you in a London smog as you crossed the lane.  
I never know where you're gonna be next but I know that you'll surprise me.  
Come with me, I'll find some rope and I'll tie us together.  
  
I've been waiting for you so long, I don't want to lose you again.  
Don't walk into the crowd again. Don't walk away again.  
I don't want to lose you.  
I don't want to lose you.  
  
I don't want to lose you again.  
There's just something about you.  
Have we been in love forever?  
9.11 in New York, I took your photograph.  
  
I still have your smiling face  
In a heart-shaped frame.  
Snowed in at Wheeler street, just two old flames keeping the fire going.  
We look so good together.  
  
Can't we just stay there forever? We were so happy.  
I'd live that day over and over but the world won't stop turning.  
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning.  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose you again.  
  
Don't walk away again. Don't leave me lost again.  
I don't want to lose you.  
I don't want to lose you.  
I don't want to lose you again.  
  
I don't want to lose you.  
I don't want to lose you.  
I don't want to lose you again.  
Oh no, not again!  
  
Not again!
