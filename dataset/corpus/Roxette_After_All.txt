Now it's about time I wrote you a letter  
Hey baby it's me for worse or for better  
Got nothing to waste in pace for another lane  
Now last only gain I know all we had  
Has dried like a desert stands from the sand  
Still on my t-shirt and I create a drink  
Of heavenly cool cool rain  
  
And after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret big or small  
After all there wasn't a loop hole  
We were found to take the fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
  
Now it's about time I said all the story  
You slept into late and missed all the glory  
Get stuck in a dream that finally blurred your brain  
I try to stay same, hey love is a blinded  
Pops up the window but no one will find teardrops on my pillow  
As I race the glass of heavenly cool champagne  
  
Cause after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret large or small, oh  
After all we prove any key-hole  
And you'll see we were bounce to fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
Life goes on and on and on after all, after all  
  
And after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret big or small  
After all there wasn't a loop hole  
We were found to take the fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
Life goes on and on and on after all
