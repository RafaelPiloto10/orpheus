Henry  
Brother, got to sing your song  
Brother, is taking us so long  
  
For the elderly brother has raised us by his love  
And to be equal is the freedom of his love  
When will we realized that the skin is just a glove  
To be thankful for the freedom of his love  
  
Sister, stand up tall and proud  
Sister, yell it strong and loud  
I'm black and I'm proud  
  
For no human can change the course of time  
And no human creates the live in mind  
So how can a man makes rules when yet he has no love  
And how can a man a woman fill they are above  
  
For an heavenly brother has raised us by his love  
And to be equal is the freedom of his love  
When will we realized that his skin is just a glove  
And be thankful for the freedom of his love  
  
Brother brother brother  
Brother brother brother brother  
Brother brother brother brother.
