I can feel your goodbye comin'  
Like a storm up from the south  
The rain'll splatter at the back door  
The wind'll whistle 'round the house  
So it's you and Howie Johnston  
Somebody told me at the store  
I guess I'd better get used  
To the idea of you  
Not around anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
And so, I'm doin' my best to prepare for the worst  
And I'd better get use to the hunger and thirst  
I gotta find me a potion  
To take for the pain  
And all you've got to lose  
Is my last name  
  
I know he's cute and he's got money  
I ain't no handsome fancy Dan  
In a way it's sad and kinda funny  
You'll be ok and I'll be damned  
So I best be gettin' ready  
For the bitter nights alone  
Sleepin' on the couch  
Wake up starting out  
Livin' life on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, all you've got to lose is my last name
