Guess who's back.....  
Chorus:  
OKS original killa shit that'll leave yo wrists slit  
OKS niggas with the biscuits mobbin through your district splifted on some
sick shit  
Raisin' up from my tomb  
Time warp on a dime off the shrooms  
Zoom in let me take your mind on a journey  
See what I see visions of bodies burnin'  
Like turnin a pistol and pointin it to your dome  
Cock it back squeeze the trigger blow and it's on  
Brains gone, thrown out the back of your cranium  
Trippin' on your shorts, left your ass a corpse on your Ma's front porch  
About to torch down the house  
Caught your mama and her spouse fuckin on the couch like south  
Bout to make moves off your fam bam  
Madman lyrically from rap to seran next plan  
Let me expand on my artwork genius in my reality  
Pure insanity can it be the angel dust that turns your brains to dust  
Bust lyrics strangle us no one is insane as us  
Chorus:  
OKS original killa shit that'll leave yo wrists slit  
OKS niggas with the biscuits mobbin through your district splifted on some
sick shit  
Takin puffs on the smoke I call the Anti-Christ  
Got me seein red and purple lights  
Mixed with black dots  
Peep the backdrop of the crime scene  
Niggas seein' 19 I'm seein' widescreen  
So much red Visine can't get it out  
From the rage of the slugs as the iron spit it out  
It is I Psycho palmin' the Desert Eagle  
Creepin' through your blocks in the crypt colored Reagal  
Pure evil bumpin brother Lynch season of the sick  
How you gonna reason with the Psycho I'm the desolate  
Watch the devil spit, call the exorcist  
Satanic messages, got me wearin nigases for necklaces  
Yes it is the messenger of death watch yo step  
I'm quite wicked  
Make a motherfucker leak his life liquid  
So why risk it it's a suicide  
When it comes to you and I  
Do or fly nigga you will die
