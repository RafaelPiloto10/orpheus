I think everybody's after me  
They want to know just what I feel  
Pushing wires under my nose  
Everybody's standing on my toes  
Telling the world what I should know  
  
You said you'd seen life from near the floor  
You opened every closing door  
  
Thank you for always being there  
All the nights in which we shared  
And we know we're always there  
  
If it ever gets you down  
You know I'll always be around  
Coz too much just ain't enough  
  
We, we who are your property  
Whose every single move you see  
We don't mind your prying eyes  
We don't mind all your lies  
Or the headlines that you write
