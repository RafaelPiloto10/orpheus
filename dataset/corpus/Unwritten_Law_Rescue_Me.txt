Shut down  
Fallin' over once again  
Dropped out  
Hand extended for a friend  
Looked up  
And there's you lookin' in  
And who cares  
Cause no ones lookin' anyway  
Impaired  
My vision lost it yesterday  
And that's fine  
Don't mind feelin' that way  
Just don't let me lie here by my self  
Let's go  
I know I'm faded  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just rescue me  
I don't wanna go  
Rewind and take me back to start again  
Ducked out cause paranoia's settin' in  
But I'm with you until the end  
  
One ride  
We'll drive around the parkin' lot  
No pride  
Cause I don't seem to care a lot  
No cash  
This change is all I got  
Just don't let me ride here by myself now  
Let's go  
I know I'm faded  
Outta sight  
  
Tonight  
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home  
All right  
Tonight  
Just rescue me, I don't wanna go  
So set still  
One last thrill  
Just stay with me and we'll never go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
Just rescue me and we'll never go home  
Yeah we'll never go home Yeah  
I don't wanna go  
  
One more ride  
One time once again  
Just climb in  
I'm still climbing yeah  
One more ride  
One time once again  
Just climb in  
I'm still climbing  
Outta sight  
  
Tonight  
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home  
All right  
Tonight  
Just rescue me, I don't wanna go  
So set still  
One last thrill  
Just stay with me and we'll never go home  
Outta sight  
Tonight  
So rescue me and we'll never go home
