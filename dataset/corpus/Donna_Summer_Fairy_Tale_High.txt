On a fairy tale high  
Don't you believe that your dreams all come true  
The fairy tale world inside can bring it to you  
You just have to wish, and you'll take off and fly  
  
On a fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
  
On a fairy tale high  
Just look around you, the dark clouds are far  
Stand on your tiptoes, and reach for a star  
As stardust comes sprinkling, it will brighten your eyes  
  
On a fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
  
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher
