Dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Though weve seen shaky times  
Theres still solid ground to be found  
I said dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Though I may seem strong  
Its only because  
Cause youre around  
  
You know me better than I do  
You know how things go to my head  
I said a few things to you  
Things that were better left unsaid  
But dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Cause you know I love you  
And I always  
I always will  
  
Now love  
Loves a sweet kind of pain  
It can give you wings to fly  
Then it drags you on down  
But darling  
Ill never love this way again, no  
Youre the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest love  
Ive ever found  
  
You know me better than I do  
You know how things go to my head  
I said a few things to you  
Things that were better left unsaid  
But dont  
Dont give up on me baby, no  
Cause I love you  
And I always  
Always will
