There are things that I said I would never do  
There are fears that I can not believe have come true  
For my soul is too sick and too little too late  
And myself I have grown too weary to hate  
  
The more I stay in here  
The more it's not so clear  
The more I stay in here  
The more I disappear  
As far as I have gone  
I knew what side I'm on  
But now I'm not so sure  
The line begins to blur  
  
There's somebody on top of me  
I don't know I don't know  
Isn't anybody stopping me  
I don't know I don't know  
I won't try and hold my breath  
I don't know I don't know  
Just how far down can I go  
I don't know I don't know  
  
As I lie here and stare  
The fabric starts to tear  
It's far beyond repair  
And I don't really care  
As far as I have gone  
I knew what side I'm on  
But now I'm not so sure  
The line begins to blur
