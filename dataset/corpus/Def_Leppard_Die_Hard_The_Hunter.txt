Let's welcome home the soldier boy from (far away, far away)  
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy (fire away, fire away)  
Let's toast the hero with blood in his eyes  
The scars on his mind took so many lives  
Die hard the hunter  
  
Welcome home soldier boy  
Put down your pistol, yeah, put down your toy  
Yeah, they can take a gun away from you  
But never take away your attitude  
They can't do that, no, they can't do that  
  
You got no enemy, no front line  
The only battles in the back of your mind  
You don't know how to change from bad to good  
You brought the war to your neighborhood  
You can't do that, no, you can't do that  
  
Back in the city, he's a man on the loose  
He is the shadow that's following you  
He takes no prisoners when he's hunting for game  
He's got a bullet and it carries your name  
  
(Die Hard) Caught in a trap  
(Hunter) There's no lookin' back  
(Die Hard) He's hides in the crowd  
(Hunter) Die Hard and proud
