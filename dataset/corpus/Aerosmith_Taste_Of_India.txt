God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta love the sweet taste of India  
Blame it on the beat of the drum  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
Yeah, she's got that kind of love incense  
That lives in her back room  
And when it mixes with the funk my friend  
It turns into perfume  
  
When you are born  
You're afraid of the darkness  
Then you're afraid of the light  
But I'm not afraid  
When I dance with my shadow  
  
This time I'm gonna get it right  
To think of what I'll get tonight  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
Her Yin and Yang  
Is just the thing  
She's unpredictable my friend  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
It's like your first taste, love, of vindaloo  
That sets your heart on fire  
And if you let her stuff get into you  
It will be all that you desire  
  
When you make love to  
A sweet tantric priestess  
You drink in the bliss of delight  
But I'm not afraid  
When I dance with her shadow  
  
This time I'm gonna get it right  
She's gonna wake my appetite  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
She a friend of mine  
She a concubine  
The sweetest wine  
I gotta make her mine  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta love the sweet taste of India  
Blame it on the beat of the drum  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
Just think of what I'll get tonight  
She's gonna wake my appetite  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
Yow, yow...
