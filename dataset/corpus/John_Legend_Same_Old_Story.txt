[Verse 1]  
Nobody's buying  
There ain't any truth to it  
The fact is you're lying  
But I'm getting used to it  
Promising we'll stay together  
Down in your heart, you know better  
I know what I lost before it's gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me slowly  
Over and over again  
Same old story  
Over and over again  
Tell me slowly  
Over and over again  
Over and over again  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh, say I'm overreacting  
As if you believe in that  
But you answer questions  
That nobody even asked  
Although we may stay together  
Down in your heart, you know better  
You pictured all the ways that you'll move on  
  
[Chorus]  
But you just tell me slowly  
Over and over again  
Same old story  
Over and over again  
Tell me slowly  
Over and over again  
Over and over again  
  
[Bridge]  
I will try to pull the wool over my eyes  
You thought it would keep me warm  
You said it was cold outside  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me slowly  
Over and over again  
Same old stories  
Over and over again  
Tell me slowly  
Over and over again  
Over and over again  
Over and over again  
Over and over again  
Oh, over and over again  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, say it again, yeah  
Keep on, yeah  
Over and over
