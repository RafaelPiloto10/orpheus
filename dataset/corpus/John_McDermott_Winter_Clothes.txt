When our love was new  
Through spring's first morning sun  
We'd run, only beginning  
I never gave a thought  
That sun and seasons change  
It's strange, so soon it's the ending  
Let me get my overcoat  
Let me get my hat  
When I'll lose the warmth of you  
I'll need that  
Let me put my rain shoes on  
I'll need some of those  
When I'll leave the warmth of you  
I suppose, I'll need my winter clothes  
Need my winter clothes  
I never will forget  
My summer sorceress  
Your dress, light as the laughter  
And golden leaves that fell  
Like notes from a lover's song  
Gone wrong, lost ever after  
Let me get my overcoat  
I'll need my scarf and gloves  
When I'll face the chill of night  
Without my love  
Let me put my rain shoes on  
I'll need some of those  
I'll bring the days of golden sun  
Took the clothes  
Need my winter clothes  
Need my winter clothes  
Need my winter clothes
