Mosquito, mosquito, mosquito  
Mosquito sing, mosquito cry  
Mosquito live, mosquito die  
Mosquito drink most anything  
Whatever's left, mosquito scream  
  
[Repeat x2]  
I'll suck your blood  
I'll suck your blood  
I'll suck your blood  
Suck your, suck your  
Suck your blood  
  
Mosquito sing, mosquito cry  
Mosquito live, mosquito die  
Mosquito land on your neck  
Mosquito drink whatever's left  
  
[Repeat x2]  
He'll suck your blood  
He'll suck your blood  
He'll suck your blood  
Suck your, suck your  
Suck your blood  
  
They can see you but you can't see them  
They can see you but you can't see them  
So are you gonna let them in?  
They're hiding beneath your bed  
Crawling between your legs  
They're sticking it in your vein  
Were you itching when they call your name?  
Were you itching when they call your name?  
  
They'll suck your blood  
They'll suck your blood  
They'll suck your blood  
Suck your, suck your  
Suck your  
  
They'll suck your blood  
They'll suck your blood  
They'll suck your blood  
Suck your, suck your  
Suck your blood  
  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck your blood  
Suck
