Un, deux, trois  
Bang, bang, bang  
  
Feathers, I'm plucking feathers  
One by one, by one  
No more skylarking, around my head  
Your information  
But there's no hiding, behind moulting feathers  
  
On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the sho'  
40k contract, take it out the do'  
Dice, symbolize my life, roll 'em on the flo'  
From your grubby hands, as you hand the grandstand  
You live a shitty life, we live a bon, bon vie  
Hotter than the book, while we watch the tv  
Think you got us fooled, ooh never again  
First time, shame on me, second time, your time will end  
  
No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
  
No way, no, (the clock) it's ticking forward  
No way, it's just a cruel, cruel world  
  
Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hittin'  
With late night divisions, and lab app decisions  
But based with decisions, to fight a fricassee  
And you've clearly decided, on how to handle me  
Difficile, imbecile, is it fake, is it real  
Are we dying on our feet, are we trying in our sleep  
There's a rumour goin' 'round, 'bout the suits runnin' town  
If you look into the sky, them birds fly high, high, high  
  
Numbers, you got that number  
You're looking outwards, and don't see the big picture  
Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words  
Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings (your own wings)  
  
No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
  
We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin'  
We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin'  
We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin'  
We're believin' in the proof, we're believin' in the truth  
We're believin' in each other, not you, you, you  
  
Stories (you with the tall tales), how many stories (so many tall tales)  
We climb the structure (you scale the ladder)  
You build it higher (you make us madder)  
We take our aim (so now we're bearin' off)  
You perch above your nest (in your charms)  
The stories in your head (it's a crazy bald head)  
That's what got you dead  
  
No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
Je te plumerai la, tete  
  
Un, deux, trois  
No one ever does it like that anymore  
Bang, bang, bang  
When feathers fly, you deny everything (alouette)  
Un, deux, trois  
No one ever does it like that anymore  
Bang, bang, bang (alouette)  
When feathers fly, you deny everything yo
