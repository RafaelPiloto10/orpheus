Don't make a move  
Don't make a sound  
I've got my eyes trained on you  
The target is found  
  
You waited too long  
Soon you'll be gone  
I'd rather stand on my own  
Ain't no more blanks left to fill  
In my list of sins  
I'm at the end of my rope  
  
The louder you speak  
The less I hear  
I gotta let off some steam  
and driven by fear  
  
Tell me I'm wrong  
'cause this can't go on  
I'd rather stand on my own  
Ain't no more blanks left to fill  
In my list of sins  
I'm at the end of my rope  
  
Leave me alone  
This can't go on  
Not anymore, no  
  
You waited too long  
Listen and soon you'll be gone  
Tell me I'm wrong  
'Cause this can't go on
