Waiting up all night  
There's something on my mind  
I need to tell you why  
He's playing you for a fool  
He's fooling 'round on you  
And I just lost my cool  
Feeling so sad  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause he waits too long so he can't  
Come back again  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause I'm rright here waiting to make  
That girl forget  
Too bad for the running man, goodbye  
Life isn't what it seems  
Or something in a dream  
That's not quite what I mean  
I need to say goodbye  
You think I didn't try  
I'm not that other guy  
I'm feeling so sad  
Too bad for the running man  
Cuase he waits too long so he can't  
Come back again  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause I'm right here waiting to help  
That girl forget  
Too bad for the running man goodbye  
Too bad for the running man  
Cause he waits too long so he can't  
Come back again  
Too bad for hte running man  
Cause I'm right here waiting to help  
That girl forget  
Too bad for the running man goodbye  
It's too bad for the running man  
It's too bad for the running man  
It's too bad for the running man  
It's too bad  
It's too bad  
It's too bad for the running man  
It's too bad for the running man  
It's too bad for the running man  
It's too bad  
It's too bad
