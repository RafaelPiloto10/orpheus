It started like a joke  
I never thought it would come to this  
Today I'm walking in the bushes, like a criminal  
Today I'm walking so slow, like a predator  
Just to get a glimpse of you  
As you play in the play ground.  
Your mother spoke to the lawyers  
Told them I was not good around you  
The lawyers spoke to the judges  
Told the I was not good around you  
The judges gave your mother a letter  
That is keeping me away from you  
Don't worry, you are never far from me  
Inside my heart, I keep a little box  
It is the box of memories I created about you  
  
Chorus  
You are the one, you are the one.  
  
Whenever I miss you bad,  
I walk around the park  
Looking at little boys and girls  
They remind me of you  
There's a lot of stories I'd like to share with you  
There's a lot of games, I'd like to play with you  
Tears come down my face  
When I think about what happened  
  
The lawyer spoke to the judges  
Told them I was not good around you  
The judges gave your mother a letter,  
That is keeping me away from you.  
Don't worry, you are never far from me.  
Inside my heart I keep a little box,  
It is a box of memories I created about you.  
  
Chorus  
You are the one, you are the one.  
  
Till fade.
