When I think how life used to be, Always walking in the shadows.  
Then I look at what you've given me, I feel like dancing on my tip toes.  
  
I must say everyday I pray  
When realize you're by my side,  
I know I'm truly  
  
Blessed for everything you've given me,  
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,  
Do my best with every breath that's in me,  
Blessed to make sure you never go.  
  
There are times that I test your faith, 'til you think you might surrender.  
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say, that my hopes will grow in splendor  
  
You walked by in the nick of time  
looking like an answered prayer  
You know I'm truly  
  
Blessed for everything you've given me,  
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,  
Do my best with every breath that's in me,  
Blessed to make sure you never go.  
  
Blessed with love and understanding,  
Blessed when I hear you call my name,  
Do my best with faith that's never-ending,  
Blessed to make sure you feel the same.  
  
Deep inside you fill me with your tender touch  
  
Blessed for everything you've given me,  
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,  
Do my best with every breath that's in me,  
To see you never go
