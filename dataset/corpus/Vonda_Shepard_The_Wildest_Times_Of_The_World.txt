I have fallen, I have stood up, I've had the patience of a tree  
  
You have trembled, you have stayed still, you have tumbled like a weed  
  
All the mountains, all the deserts, go for miles and miles around  
  
We have driven for years now, baby, just to get bak to a place we had  
  
already  
  
found  
  
Now you're driving me downtown, baby, on a rainy night  
  
You're driving me crazy, baby, is this really life?  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Oh I never thought I'd be here with you tonight  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life  
  
I was mistaken, our love was forsaken, the worst mistake I ever made  
  
Were you lonely, were you brave, now?  
  
I guess the two are one and the same  
  
Now I'm singing here with my sweet, sweet darling in my eye  
  
Ain't it funny how you're walking through life and it turns on a dime?  
  
I was missing you crazy, baby, are you really mine?  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Oh I never thought I'd be here with you tonight  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life  
  
Hey Hey Hey...
