I've been waiting every night after school  
For five long years, five long years!  
I'll keep waiting there for five nights a week  
'Cause I'm no fool  
  
Ooh reeling and a-rocking  
Rolling till the break of  
Ooh reeling and a-rocking  
Rolling till the school breaks out  
  
I'm thirty, but I feel like sixteen  
I might even know your daddy  
I'm dirty, but my body is clean  
I might even be your daddy  
  
Ooh reeling and a-rocking  
Rolling till the break of  
Ooh reeling and a-rocking  
Rolling till the break of  
  
I like you, will you like me, yes!  
Sorry, but I have to grab you  
You look better completely undressed  
Sorry, but I have to have you  
  
I'm thirty, but I feel like sixteen  
How would you like some candy?  
I'm thinking more than a kiss  
With me, spank me, grab me
