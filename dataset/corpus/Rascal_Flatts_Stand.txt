You feel like a candle in a hurricane  
Just like a picture with a broken frame  
Alone and helpless, like you've lost your fight  
But you'll be all right, you'll be all right  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when push comes to shove  
You taste what you're made of  
You might bend till you break  
'Cause it's all you can take  
On your knees, you look up  
Decide you've had enough  
You get mad, you get strong  
Wipe your hands, shake it off  
Then you stand, then you stand  
  
Life's like a novel with the end ripped out  
The edge of a canyon with only one way down  
Take what you're given before it's gone  
And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on  
  
'Cause when push comes to shove  
You taste what you're made of  
You might bend till you break  
'Cause it's all you can take  
On your knees, you look up  
Decide you've had enough  
You get mad, you get strong  
Wipe your hands, shake it off  
Then you stand, yeah, then you stand  
  
Every time you get up  
And get back in the race  
One more small piece of you  
Starts to fall into place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, then you stand, yeah  
Yeah, baby  
Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo  
Then you stand, yeah, yeah
