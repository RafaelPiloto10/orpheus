Feelings are strange  
Especially when they come true  
And I had a feeling  
You'd be leaving soon  
  
So I tried to rearrange  
All my emotions  
But it seems the same  
No matter what I do.  
  
[Chorus]  
Blue umbrella  
Rest upon my shoulder  
Hide the pain  
While the rain  
Makes up my mind  
  
Well, my feet are wet  
From thinking this thing over  
And it's been so long  
Since I felt the warm sunshine  
  
Just give me one good reason  
And I promise I won't ask you any more  
Just give me one extra season  
So I can figure out the other four.  
  
Day time  
Makes me wonder why you left me  
Night time  
Makes me wonder what I said  
  
Next time  
Are the words I'd like to plan on  
But, last time  
Was the only thing you said.  
  
[Chorus]
