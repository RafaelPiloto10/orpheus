[Chorus]  
It's 4 in the mornin'  
She callin' my phone  
She wanna be grown  
We gone get it on  
She said that she lonely  
Cause hes never around  
Said she like my style  
He can lay you down  
Say he can lay you down  
But I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
He can lay you down  
But I'm a beat it up  
I'm a beat it up  
  
I hopped up out my bed  
Got my swag on  
Stronger than fillet Mignon  
Two Gs blown just for cologne  
Money never limited  
So Icey with benefits  
My driver needs a passport  
All my cars are immigrants!  
It's so sickening  
History you're witnessing  
I had a girl she quit me  
Now I'm single want to get with me?  
Sticky again they stick to me  
If you see your chick with GUCCI  
Think before you confronting ruley  
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'  
430 stepped on purp it  
08 verty rollin' dirty  
Wardrobe clean as this detergent  
Got your girlfriend picking purses  
Say she lonely  
Gucci only one with to meet me in person  
When she met me home  
My bitch told me that shes over first  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your girlfriend keep callin' me  
I feel like she stalkin' me  
You at home  
And she with me  
So morning it's an argument  
Gucci Mane be doggin' it  
Beatin' her down  
Straight poundin' it  
Drillin' on your sheets  
Got your blanket at the laundromat  
Wait baby girl throw it back  
Old man might catch heart attack  
Gucci Mane not hardly that  
Smack you like I'm mad at that  
Swear this sex so passionate  
Oral sex she mastered that  
Pornographic poses  
Like she posing for the internet  
Wait I was not finished yet  
Never been a minute man  
Always been a business man  
Gotta catch your feelings man  
Got a man?  
Oh really now?  
Acting like I give a damn!  
  
Used to like her now I don't  
Got a real short attention span  
Gucci!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gucci Trey Songz put it on  
My shirt off when I perform  
She say this her favorite song  
She got on my favorite thong  
She so hot  
Too hot to touch  
Truthfully too much for lames  
Gucci mane I'm extra game  
So extra rubbers I'm a bring  
Got your main thang screaming Gucci  
Every Tuesday night we cool whip  
Wish we could do it more often  
But I'm often somewhere flossin'  
Lay it down like carpet barbie  
Aston martin double park it  
Beat it like we got a problem  
Pop her till she call me poppa  
Freakin' partners  
Why we never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'  
Freakin' partners  
Why they never bother with a second option  
Hoppin' got the mattress poppin'  
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'  
Gucci  
  
[Chorus]
