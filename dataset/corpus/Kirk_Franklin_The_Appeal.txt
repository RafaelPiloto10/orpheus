Lord, I stand in Your presence  
Wanting You and needing You  
And I am here and I surrender  
All of me so I can see  
Your will is where I desire to be  
Take all of me  
All that I have and all that I do  
I give it to You, Lord, it's for You  
Just take my hand  
And I'll follow You  
For all that I am  
And all that I do, it's for You  
You are my song  
It's Your love that keeps me strong  
And You are the light  
In the darkness of my night  
I'm lost without You  
Broken without You  
Oh, how I need You  
Oh, how I need You  
You make life worth living  
Your grace always keep giving  
I'm lost without You  
Broken without You  
Oh, how I need You  
Oh, how I need You  
Lord, have mercy, Lord have mercy  
Ooh, have mercy  
We need Your healing  
Please give us healing  
Lord, have mercy  
Have mercy  
Lord, have mercy  
Have mercy  
Oh Lord, Lord, I come  
Broken in this place  
Weak and poor  
For all I have is Yours, all Yours  
This life, these things  
They can't compare to You  
No wealth, no fame can separate  
The one my heart adores  
Yet, we take our eyes off You  
We're blind in reaching for the truth  
And now this whole world cries  
Because it realizes  
There is none quite like You  
The earth, the stars, the universe  
They just repeat these words so true  
Life begins and life will end with You  
Hear me singing  
When I die, what will they say about me?  
Will the work that I've done  
Be enough to help someone?  
When I die, will I draw men's hearts to You?  
At the setting of the sun  
Wanna hear You say  
Well done, when I die  
Well done, well done  
I know He will make me the spirit and the [Incomprehensible]
