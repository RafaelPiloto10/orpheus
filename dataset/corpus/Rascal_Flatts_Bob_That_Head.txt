Bob that head  
Awwh, awwh, ah  
Yeah yeah, yeah,yeah  
  
Tricked out truck kit  
Runnin' boards black lit  
KC roll bar  
Had to mow an extra yard  
Just so he could  
Install satellite  
Rascal Flattin'all night  
King cab, bass tubes  
Stop light, boom-boom  
Five days, all week  
Two jobs so he can  
  
[Chorus]  
Bob that head  
Every Friday night  
Got the windows rolled down  
The seat reclined  
Givin' everybody that rock on sign  
Yeah, turn it up to ten  
Hey, y'all join in  
Bob that head  
Come on, bob that head  
Bob that head  
  
Hot girl wants a ride  
Climbs up inside  
Feelin' that rhythm  
Right along with him  
Now he's cruisin'  
Don't want to lose it  
Loop around Sonic  
And right back on it  
Low gear, drive by  
Up and down  
That's right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on, feels good  
Let it go, shake it loose  
Don't it make you wanna  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bob that head  
Every Friday night  
Bob that head, bob that head  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Bob that head-yeah  
Bob that head  
Bob that, bob that  
Bob that head  
Bob that, bob that  
Bob that, bob that
