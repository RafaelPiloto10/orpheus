Exponentially serving  
Perpetually unnerving  
Vehicle swerving  
The adjectives they are all a blurring  
Freud walking the sidelines  
Clipboard, score on the brain  
Black magic viente why tres  
Makes me sane  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Don't matter anyway  
Phantom pain in my brain  
It's all that's left of my leg  
Black and red and yellow, black and red and yellow  
Heard you repeat a what ya heard  
Me knowing the truth I cannot concur na-na  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Doesn't matter anyway  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Yo bro tell us what's happenin' um I'm on the west  
West side of, on the west coast  
Give me a jingle uh when you get in  
From where the fuck you're at  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain  
Doesn't fucking matter anyway  
Hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah  
Please don't make me explain
