When we were together  
Those were the happiest time in all my life  
Now were separated I don't know what I will do  
'Cause I can't ever love another  
No matter how hard I try  
'Cause I know. It's impossible  
Where ever you may be  
I hope you'll hear my song  
Then maybe you'll realise  
My love that you were wrong  
  
'Cause I can't ever love another  
No matter how hard I try  
'Cause I know. It's impossible  
  
The sunset outside my window  
Has lost all it's glow  
The rose in the garden  
Doesn't bloom any more
