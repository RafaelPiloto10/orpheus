Joe Walsh:  
  
Everybody Partys on a New Year's Eve  
Waitin' for the countdown  
Make a lot of promises they never keep  
Party with the lights on  
  
Standing still, dressed to kill, holding a glass of champagne  
Everyone having fun tryin' to get out of there brain  
  
Everybody partys on a New Year's Eve  
Party with the light's on  
(Tell me what you see)Bringin' in a New Year  
(Everything's alright with me)Party on New Years Eve!  
(Tell me what you see) The peak of the Holiday Season  
(Everythings alright with me) Bringin in the New Year  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
(Tell me what you see)Bringin' in a New Year  
(Everything's alright with me)Party on New Years Eve!  
(Tell me what you see) The peak of the Holiday Season  
(Everythings alright with me) Bringin in the New Year  
  
Everybody parties on a New Year's Eve  
Waitin' for the countdown  
Everybody lookin at the big tv, talkin' at the same time  
Bongin smokes, telling jokes, standin' in the punchline  
Everybody parties in the new years eve gonna have a good time (X's 2)  
  
(Tell me what you see)Bringin' in a New Year  
(Everything's alright with me)Party on New Years Eve!  
(Tell me what you see) The peak of the Holiday Season  
(Everythings alright with me) Bringin in the New Year (Repeat last four lines
until fade-out)
