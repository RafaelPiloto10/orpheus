Can we talk about automatic satisfaction  
Sittin' back relaxin' floored  
What's wrong with kickin' it  
When you're bored and lit  
Lets smoke some cigarettes  
And catch up on the back porch  
Fire up another roach  
  
We don't need a rest this is just a test  
'cause we're alright, we're up all night  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time no reason why  
To see the sun come up again.  
  
The more we try to change  
The more we stay the same  
We're caught up in the game and now  
Just like empty picture frames  
So now were to blame  
  
Said we were gettin' down, on henessey and fountain  
Smelled another mountain now  
If you ain't gettin' down, you'll come around  
And were alright, we're up all night  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time, no reason why  
To see the sun come up again.  
  
So lets smoke some cigarettes  
And catch up on the back porch  
Fire up another roach  
  
We don't need a rest, it's just a test  
And as the world spins we'll watch it with a grin  
And look in as the day begins  
Well now it's on again, it's dawn again.  
Yeah! Yeah!  
And we're alright  
We're up all night  
  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time, no reason why  
To see the sun come up again  
Yeah we're alright, yeah we're alright  
Yeah we're alright, up all night  
Yeah we're alright, yeah we're alright  
To see the sun come up again now!
