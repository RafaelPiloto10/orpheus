Put your little hands in mine  
Say you'll love me all the time  
My heart is sighing, it's almost dying  
My eyes are crying for you  
Hold me close and squeeze me tight  
If you would only treat me right  
My heart is sighing, it's almost dying  
My eyes are crying for you  
I loved you since time began  
And I always will  
I need you here by my side  
This world's to know how I feel  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Little words like "I love you dear"  
My heart is sighing, it's almost dying  
My eyes are crying for you
