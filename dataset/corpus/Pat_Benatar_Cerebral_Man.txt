What's your line this time, Cerebral Man  
Whenever you walk through my door, I start to sweat  
I'm falling in slow motion, and I'm losing control  
And the walls are too high to jump  
The walls are to high to jump  
  
I hear thunder, it's in my soul  
Can you hear the thunder roar, you better get back  
I hear thunder, who's in control  
Can you hear the thunder roar  
Better get back, Cerebral Man  
  
The cutting edge, it hides behind those eyes of woe  
Your tears won't make a bed of roses  
What we had I cannot love  
The walls are to high to jump  
The walls are to high to jump  
  
I hear thunder, it's in my soul  
Can you hear the thunder roar, you better get back  
I hear thunder, who's in control  
Can you hear the thunder roar  
Better get back, Cerebral Man  
  
And the walls are too high to jump  
The walls are to high to jump  
  
I hear thunder, it's in my soul  
Can you hear the thunder roar, you better get back  
I hear thunder, who's in control  
Can you hear the thunder roar  
You better get back  
  
I hear thunder, it's in my soul  
Can you hear the thunder roar  
You better get back  
I hear thunder, who's in control  
Can you hear the thunder roar  
Better get back, Cerebral Man  
  
Cerebral Man, Cerebral Man
