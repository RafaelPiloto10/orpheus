[Verse 1]  
We don't know where this is going now  
But I'm feeling love for you  
I'm feeling something new yeah yeah  
We don't know where this is going now  
But don't be afraid tonight  
Don't be afraid of heights no  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me open your heart wide  
When your angels fall out of the sky  
I'll be the wings that make you fly  
When you come down I'll take you high  
I'll take you high  
I'll take you  
I'll take you  
  
[Verse 2]  
If I'm dreaming don't roll over yet  
Perfect like porcelain  
This could be heaven sent yeah  
Kiss the wind and just hold on to me  
Cause in the freefall is when we get to live again yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me open your heart while  
When your angels fall out of the sky  
I'll be the wings that make you fly  
When you come down I'll take you high  
I'll take you high  
I'll take you  
I'll take you  
  
When we feel down and we're lost  
And we're wasting away  
Let's escape  
There's a place deep in your heart  
Where the trouble can't go  
That's a heart  
Yeah!  
  
[Outro]  
I'll take you  
I'll take you  
I'll take you
