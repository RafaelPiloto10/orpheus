Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA  
There's not a soul I know around everybody's leavin' town  
Some caught a freight some caught a plane find the sunshine leave the rain  
They said this town'll waste your time I guess they're right it's wastin' mine  
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
  
You know my heart keeps telling me you're not a kid at thirty-three  
You play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life  
I got my pills to ease the pain can't find a thing to ease the rain  
I'd love to try and settle down but everybody's leavin' town  
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues
