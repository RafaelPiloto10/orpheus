'What the fuck is that?'  
'Hi, guys, are you in a band or something?  
I mean it would be so cool  
If you were in a band 'cause you're  
Driving a big bus with band on the front of it'  
'Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?'  
'Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave  
And, and you got a beer,  
I'd like a Heineken if you've got one'  
That's real cool, that's great, yeah!'  
'Would you like to see Black Bart?'  
'Who's Black Bart?'  
'Let me introduce you'  
  
Black Bart's seen it  
Black Bart knows  
Black Bart's done it  
The Black Bart blues  
Suspended in suspension  
Medieval nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems  
Black Bart's lookin'  
Don't know where she's been  
Maybe she's an acrobat  
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart tried most anything  
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing  
So he asked me to tell ya  
Try it for yourself and you will see  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
'What did you do that for?'  
'I'm sorry, I just, I guess I'm not used to...  
'Shut up and get on with it will you'  
  
Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now  
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow  
So if you are a dancer,  
You could dance his pole in May  
That's a maypole  
  
Black Bart's coming  
Now Black Bart's gone  
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song  
Whatever and however,  
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!  
We all got to do the Black Bart blues  
Here comes the guitar solo  
  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!
