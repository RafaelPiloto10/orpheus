Glad you came, glad you're here.  
Have some champagne, imported beer.  
Dig down in your dirt bag  
And roll us out a spliff.  
  
Been erect here now for thirteen days  
And I came to get relief  
At Bob's Party Time.  
Pack my nose with cocaine  
Feed my filthy hole.  
  
Bust out the dancin' women  
I'm prone to lose control.  
And if by chance I fall down  
And bust my head on the floor,  
Just wrap my wound in a porterhouse steak  
And point me towards the shore.  
At Bob's Party Time.
