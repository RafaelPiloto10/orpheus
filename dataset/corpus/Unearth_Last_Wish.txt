This life will soon come to an end  
I'll leave my convictions  
  
Day by day  
I feel this life slipping away  
Much further away  
I know I've lost it all  
  
Hold out your hands  
And take me from my misery  
There's no coming back from this  
I'll never wake  
  
I'll never wake, I never  
  
I never wanted to leave you all  
I never wanted to leave this life  
Nothing can save my now  
No one can save me  
  
I was left with no choice  
  
Freedom, my last wish to be  
Held on all I could  
Free me from this misery  
You know I'll never wake
