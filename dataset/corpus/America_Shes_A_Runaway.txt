Found on your move, the very best of America, and highway.  
  
Yesterday she stood here with me  
I kissed her mouth, I had her in my hands  
That kind of love, it could last forever  
And together we made our plans  
  
And then I woke up today  
There on the table her letter lay  
Tellin' me she's goin' away  
  
Runaway, boy have you seen a  
Girl like an angel runnin' in the night  
She's run away, boy if you see her  
I'm beggin' you to stop her on sight  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
She's a runaway, a runaway  
And why she'd leave I still can't believe  
That she would run away, run away  
Run away, run away  
She's a runaway  
  
I walked the streets through the heart of the city  
Go to the places where she might be  
I see her friends they say it's a pity  
I get the same thing from everyone that I see  
  
I'll keep searchin' if it's gotta be  
And when I find her I'll make her see  
No other man could love her like me  
  
Runaway, boy have you seen a  
Girl like an angel runnin' in the night  
She's run away, boy if you see her  
I'm beggin' you to stop her on sight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run away, run away  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
She's a runaway, a runaway  
And why she'd leave I still can't believe  
That she would run away, run away  
  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
She's a runaway, a runaway  
And why she'd leave I still can't believe  
That she would run away, run away
