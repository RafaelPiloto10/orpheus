[Chorus]  
It's your thing, do what you want to do.  
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.  
  
If you want me to love you, maybe I will.  
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal.  
You need love now, just as bad as I do.  
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to.  
  
[Chorusx2]  
  
I'm not trying to run your life, I know you want to do what's right.  
Give your love now, to whoever you choose.  
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now.  
  
[Chorusx2]  
  
If you want me to love you, maybe I will.  
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal.  
You need love now, just as bad as I do.  
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to.  
  
[Chorusx2]  
  
I'm not trying to run your life,I know you want to do what's right.  
Give your love now, to whoever you choose.  
How can you love, with the stuff you use now.  
  
[Chorusx2]  
  
If you want me to love you, maybe I will.  
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal.  
You need love now, just as bad as I do.  
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to.  
  
[Chorusx2]  
  
I'm not trying to run your life,I know you want to do what's right.  
Give your love now, to whoever you choose.  
How can you love, with the stuff you use now.  
  
[Chorusx2... Fade]
