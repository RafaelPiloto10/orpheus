Yah,  
Yah,  
Yahlah,  
They say there is religion  
There is a kind of taste  
Get me the celebration  
And I will give you the waste  
There will be no danger  
No trouble at all  
We need a stand-up together  
Those curtains are not to fall  
Arabian nights  
Arabian nights  
There's no way out for me  
This dream will capture me for years  
Yellow night light  
In a city of white  
I'm stranded in the desert  
I'm stranded in a fight  
Arabian nights  
Arabian  
Arabian nights  
There's no way out for me  
This dream will capture me for years  
Yellow night light  
In a city of white  
I'm stranded in the desert  
I'm stranded in a fight  
There's no one here who's  
Gonna safe you [should probably be "save"]  
There's nothin' sweeter than Arabia  
There's no way out for me  
This dream will capture me too far  
In a city of white  
I'm stranded in the desert  
I'm stranded  
En-cha-la  
Arabian nights  
A-RA-BI-A  
There's nothin' sweeter than Arabia
