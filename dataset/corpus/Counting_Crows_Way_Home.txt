If you don't stop lying' on the floor.  
You don't know what your dying' for.  
The last thing that you need is imbeciles and indecision.  
The discussion nearly ends  
She says, "I'm leaving' my friend.  
And I don't wanna see you when I'm walking' on my way home  
It is always on my way home"  
Maria quietly talks to me  
She says, "Adam, what do you see."  
The people lying in the ---- hours of imperception  
And I believe I --- the ground  
She says, "Hey, what have you found?"  
And everything I see is only walking on my way home  
[chorus:]  
Look at all the silly people out there  
Can't you see?  
Oh, all the silly people lying, crying, dying  
Believe me and this is what I see  
And if you don't, amuse me  
We walk in circles and we walk back between indecision  
Between the currents we will swim  
And then it's over my friend  
And everything I see is only walking on my way home  
Look at all the silly people out there  
Can't you see?  
Oh, all the silly people lying, crying, d-d-d-dying  
Maria she belongs to me, in between the garden and the sea  
I walk in circles and the women walks right here beside me  
And if we talk about this town,  
I must say, "I've been feeling down."  
And I've been sliding all the falls,  
I've seen currents on my way home.  
[Chorus:]
