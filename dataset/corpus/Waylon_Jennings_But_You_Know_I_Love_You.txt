When the morning sun streaks across my room  
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you  
Yes I'm on the road once again it seems  
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams  
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you  
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live  
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give  
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart  
That the dollar sign chould be keeping us apart  
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you  
And if only we could find our way back to the times  
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds  
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes  
I'd come running back to you I'd come running back to you  
[ guitar ]  
But you know we can't live on dreams alone  
And to pay the rent got us leave you all alone  
But you know I made my choice many years ago  
Now this traveling life is the only one I know  
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you  
Yes you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
