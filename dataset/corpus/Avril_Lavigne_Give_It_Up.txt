Everytime you go away  
It actually kinda makes my day  
Everytime you leave  
You slam the door  
  
You pick your words so carefully  
You hate to think you're hurting me  
You leave me laughing on the floor  
  
'Cause I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know, I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I'm not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks he's all that  
  
I thought we were just hanging out  
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?  
You thought the way you taste would get me high  
You went to all your friends to brag  
Guys are always such a drag  
Don't ya know the reason that  
I kissed you was to say goodbye  
  
Cause I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I'm not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks he's all that  
  
Hangin', Hangin' out  
I am simply  
Hangin', Hangin' out  
I am simply  
Hangin', So why'd ya kiss me on the mouth?  
Don't ya know that I...  
I don't give a damn about you  
I wont give it up now for you  
I don't give a damn about you  
I wont give it up now for you  
I'm not gonna cry  
About some stupid guy  
A guy who thinks he's all that  
  
Cause I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
  
I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that  
You know I don't give it up  
I don't give a damn  
What you say about that
