Well, if you want to rock  
I got to be your rockin' horse  
If you want to roll, Lord  
I could roll you  
Right out the door, yes I could  
We'll shake the world, yeah  
When it's time to crash  
But when I get home tonight, Lord  
I guess I got to shake myself lookie here  
You need some lovin'  
You must have the blues  
You fucked your mind baby  
It's a good thing to do  
Now do the shake  
The rattlesnake shake  
Now do the shake  
Yes, chuck away 'dem blues  
Chuck dem blues  
You need some lovin', you must have the blues  
You fucked your mind baby  
It's a good thing to do  
Do the shake, oh  
The rattlesnake shake  
Now do the shake, yeah  
Chuck away, chuck away  
Chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck
