Girl, I know the grass is greener just around the bend,  
Gotta say goodbye, but don't you fear,  
Though the road is broken, I might fail to find the end,  
I won't disappear.  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you.  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
Looking high, I'm looking low,  
When I find my boots I know I got to go.  
Back up on my feet...ah, ah.  
Maybe I will be a star, or maybe just a clown,  
Girl, I'll never know until I try,  
Maybe I will meet a girl who'll try to keep me down,  
But you won't have to cry.  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you.  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
Looking high, I'm looking low,  
When I find my boots I know I got to go.  
Back up on my feet ah, ah.  
  
Maybe I will meet a girl who'll try to keep me down,  
But you won't have to cry.  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you.  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
I'll be back up on my feet,  
Looking high, I'm looking low,  
When I find my boots I know I got to go,  
When I find my boots I know I got to go,  
When I find my boots I know I got to go.
