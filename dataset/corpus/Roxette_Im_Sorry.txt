The first time we met time stood still  
You left me breathless  
Suddenly speechless.  
  
Within the hour we were one  
Two total strangers kissing the moonlight.  
  
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go  
I'm really sorry it had to die  
I'm really sorry I made you cry  
Cry.  
  
We fell in love between the nights  
Of too many lovers and too many teardrops.  
  
And fate won't resist some satin sheets  
I was so helpless  
Totally ruthless.  
  
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go  
I'm really sorry you're hurt inside  
I'm really sorry I made you cry  
Cry, cry.  
  
Love is lifting you up and draggin' you down  
Makes you go round and round and round  
Time makes a stop then it's all gone  
Funny how memories keep lingering on.
