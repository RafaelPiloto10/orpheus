Never win first place  
I don't support the team  
I can't take direction and my socks are never clean  
Teachers dated me  
My parents hated me  
I was always in a fight  
Cuz I can't do nothin right  
Every day I fight a war against a mirror  
I can't take the person staring back at me  
I'm a hazard to myself  
Don't let me get me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you don't know yourself  
So irratiting  
Don't want to be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
I wanna be somebody else  
Yeah  
L. A. Told me  
You could be a pop star  
All you have to change is everything you are  
Tired of being compared  
To damn Britney Spears  
She's so pretty  
That just ain't me  
So doctor doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin  
A day in the life of someone else  
Cuz I'm a hazard to myself  
Don't let me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you don't know yourself  
So irratiting  
Don't want to be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Yeah  
Don't let me get me don't let me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you don't know yourself  
So irritating  
Don't wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
So doctor doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin  
A day in the life of someone else  
Don't let me get  
  
Oh I'm a hazard to myself  
Yeah  
Don't let me get me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you don't know yourself  
Yourself  
So irritating  
Don't wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Don't let me get me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you don't know yourself  
So irritating  
Don't wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Don't let me get me
