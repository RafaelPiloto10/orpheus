"Foolish Games"  
  
you took your coat off and stood in the rain,  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window,  
always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn,  
Somebody more like myself  
These foolish games are breaking my heart  
your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You took your coat off and stood in the rain  
you were always like that
