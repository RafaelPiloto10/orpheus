At any moment he'll be walking through that door  
But he won't find me behind it  
'Cause the feeling is gone and just won't come back any more  
I worked so hard to find it  
  
I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again  
All around tryin' to get the feeling again  
That one that made me shiver  
Make my knees start to quiver every time he walks in  
I've look high, low, everywhere I possibly can  
But there's just no tryin' to get the feeling again  
It seemed to disappear as fast at it came  
  
[Chorus]  
Read every book, looked, for every meditation and poem  
Just to bring home that old sweet sensation  
But it ain't no use to me to try to get the feeling again  
  
When did it leave me  
How did I come to miss use such a beautiful bonnet  
But baby believe me, I've done everything I can do  
But somehow it's no returnin'  
I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again  
Like a bloodhound searching for a long lost friend  
Could you help me rediscover  
The way to re-be his lover once again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to get that feeling again
