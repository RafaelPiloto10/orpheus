Lately I've been sleeping  
Far too long in bed  
I've been dreaming of you lover  
Oh the things inside my head  
  
I don't want to wake up  
I'm scared to break the spell  
Oh I'm sleeping like a baby  
I hope you sleep so well  
  
You know I'm hoping, hoping  
  
[Bridge]  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us,  
Been on our minds  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us  
I know there's a dream for us,  
We're gonna find  
  
[Chorus]  
I know there's a dream for us  
I believe it's true  
In a word, love you  
And I'm hoping our dream comes true  
  
You know I'm hoping, hoping  
Miracles and moonbeams, wishes on a star  
These are things I dream of, I know it sounds bizarre  
I see familiar faces, or is it deja vu  
The one recurring vision  
Is a dream I have of you  
  
You know I'm hoping, hoping  
(Repeat bridge)  
Come on now baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you find someone you find someone you love  
You know you can't believe it  
When you find someone you know you can't deceive it  
Your love takes you high  
  
I know there's a dream for us  
I'm sure there's a dreams for us  
  
[Chorus]
