There's a time for feelin' as good as we can  
The time is now, and there's no stoppin' us  
There's a time for livin' as high as we can  
Behind us you will only see our dust  
  
You know we're havin' good days  
And we hope they're gonna last  
Our future still looks brighter than our past  
We feel no need to worry  
No reason to be sad  
Our mem'ries remind us, maybe road life's not so bad  
  
Just keep smilin', move onward ev'ry day  
And try to keep our thoughts away from home  
We're trav'lin' around, no time to settle down  
And satisfy our wanderlust to roam  
  
Well from sea to shining sea, and a hundred points between  
Still we go on diggin' ev'ry show  
The cities in the land all extend a welcome hand  
Till morning when it's time for us to go
