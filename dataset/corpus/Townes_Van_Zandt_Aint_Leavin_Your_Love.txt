Mister Gator he's a-glidin' down the bayou  
Mister Buzzard he's a-slidin' through the air  
Mister Turtle be a-hittin' the highway  
I ain't goin' nowhere  
  
I ain't leavin you love, babe  
I ain't leavin you love, babe  
Not for heaven above, babe  
I ain't leavin you love, babe  
  
The poor man got him an airplane  
Tryin to cruise across the traffic jam  
The rich man got him a Chevrolet  
I'm stayin' right where I am  
  
Now Hannibal he climbed the mountains  
Cleopatra danced down the Nile  
Lucky Lindy made it all the way to gay Paris  
I'm stayin right here awhile
