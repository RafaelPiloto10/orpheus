She don't wanna go, go, but that's cool  
Cause she already know, know, how I do  
She waiting her turn, she don't wanna leave  
I can't blame her for wanting here with me, no!  
She no fool, and everybody know, know, I'm not  
So if it ain't her, it would be her friend  
I'm just trying to party like the world is gonna end, oh.  
Oh, now I'm all up in my zone, I've been turning it up  
All eye on one  
And ain't no way I'm leaving, this club is tonight alone  
So who gonna be the lucky one that I take home?  
  
Bridge:  
Who that is?  
I'm looking for a girl who gonna do it for me  
Who gonna be the one that's gonna do it for me  
Cause it's a lot of girls that will do it for me  
So if it ain't you, she gonna do it for me, do it for me yeah  
Do it for me, she gonna do it for me  
She gonna do it, she gonna do it for me, yeah  
She gonna do it, she gonna do it for me, yeah  
Cause it's a lot of girls that will do it for me  
Say, who gonna be the one that will do it for me?  
  
Chorus:  
Why you plan, girl?  
Why, why you plan, girl  
Tell me what you plan,  
Why you plan, girl?  
Why you plan, girl?  
You gonna do it girl?  
You ain't girl!  
  
Shawty dropping ..  
And I like the way, way that she move  
Making it hard for me to chose  
Be either way we go, go, I can't lose, no!  
It's about time for me to pick the one,  
I'mma put on in my ride  
I gotta hurry up, make up my mind  
So baby back it up, cause we're running out of time!  
Now I'm all up in my zone, I'll be turning it up  
All night so I'm on,  
And ain't no way I'm leaving, this club is tonight alone  
So who gonna be the lucky one that I take home?  
  
Bridge:  
Who that is?  
I'm looking for a girl who gonna do it for me  
Who gonna be the one that's gonna do it for me  
Cause it's a lot of girls that will do it for me  
So if it ain't you, she gonna do it for me, do it for me yeah  
Do it for me, she gonna do it for me  
She gonna do it, she gonna do it for me, yeah  
She gonna do it, she gonna do it for me, yeah  
Cause it's a lot of girls that will do it for me  
Say, who gonna be the one that will do it for me?
