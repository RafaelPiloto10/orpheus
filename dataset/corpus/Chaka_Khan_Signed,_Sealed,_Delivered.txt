Like a fool I went and stayed too long  
Now I'm wondering if you love's still strong  
Ooh baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
  
Here I am baby, you got the future in your hands  
Here I am baby, you got the future in your hands  
  
I've done a lot of foolish things  
That I really didn't mean  
  
Seen lot of things in this old world  
When I touched them they did nothing for this girl  
Ooh baby, here I am signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
  
Chorus:  
Here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
Here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
Here I am baby, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours  
Here I am baby, you got the future in your hands  
  
I've done a lot of foolish things  
That I really didn't mean  
  
Oh baby, you set my soul on fire  
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire  
Here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
