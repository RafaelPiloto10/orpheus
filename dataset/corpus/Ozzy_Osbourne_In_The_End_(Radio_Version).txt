It Starts with one thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme  
To explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuble thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the days  
The clock ticks life away  
It's So Unreal  
  
Didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on  
But didn't evn know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go..  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried, It all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,  
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...  
  
One thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how i tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Acting like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
I'm surprised it got so far  
Things aren't the way they were before  
You wouldn't even reckognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,  
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...  
  
I put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this, there's only one thing you should know...(2x)  
  
I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter,  
I had to fall, to lose it all, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...(2x)
