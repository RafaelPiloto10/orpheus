Good morning  
Nice to see you  
How you've been  
The beginning of another lovely day  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Good morning  
  
Get up put your feet on the ground  
Wake up to an ice cold shower  
The coffee's hot but the cream is sour  
  
So get up  
  
Top of the morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Hey  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Can I walk you to the train  
Would you like to get a bagel on the way  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Good morning  
Get on and we go downtown  
Get off and go in the tower  
The boss is old but he has the power  
  
So we're up  
Top of the morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Hey  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
It's another day in the world in which we live  
  
I've got to find a way  
To get past what I can't forgive  
And no matter what we've got to try to move along  
So sing a song  
You can't go wrong  
Good morning  
Nice to see you  
How you been  
The beginning of another, lovely day  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Good morning
