The holy spirits got me pumpin'  
With the beat this place is jumpin'  
Through the sound, the demons can't stand it  
Cuz we know we're gonna shake this planet  
We're gonna shake this planet  
And turn it upside down  
Were going to praise him  
Where his praises can be found  
We're gonna shout his praises  
For he's the one who reigns  
We're gonna sing it till the whole world has been saved  
Shake it  
Planet turn it upside down  
We'll go  
Spirit come and make a sound  
Shake it  
Generation going down  
Spirit  
Cuz we know we're gonna shake this planet  
Cuz we know we're gonna shake this planet  
Cuz we know we're gonna shake this planet  
Cuz we know we're gonna shake this planet
