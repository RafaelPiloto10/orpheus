How many times have you walked through my door  
How many times have you heard my song before  
How many lines until the end of time  
These are the days of our lives  
  
How many times did you hear mother say  
You would do fine if you didn't sleep all day  
Oh mother dear, I'll get a job next year  
These are the days of our lives  
  
How many times did you walk down the street  
Avoiding cracks that were thrown at your feet  
These rainy days were sent to make us pay  
But these are the days of our lives  
  
How many roads must a woman walk down  
How many walls will surround the town  
All that I am could get us out of here  
These are the days of our lives  
  
Did you believe in the stories at night  
Weren't you afraid when they turned out the light  
Oh, such a gas, I'm sorry it won't last  
These are the days of our lives  
  
These are the days that some of us regret  
These are the days we learn to forget  
These are the days that turn us out this way  
These are the days of our lives  
  
Of our lives
