I'm the guy who didn't marry pretty pamela brown  
Educated, well-intentioned, good girl in our town  
I wonder where i'd be today if she had loved me too  
Probably be driving kids to school  
  
(chorus)  
I guess i owe it all to Pamela brown  
All of my good times and all my roamin' around  
One of these days i might come ramblin' through your town  
And i guess i owe it all to Pamela brown  
  
I've seen the lights of cites and i've been inside their doors  
I've sailed to foreign countries and i've walked upon their shores  
I guess the guy she married was the best part of my luck  
She dug him 'cause he drove a pick-up truck  
  
(chorus)  
I don't have to tell you just how beautiful she was  
Everything it takes to get a country boy in love  
Lord, i hope she's happy 'cause she sure deserves to be  
Especially for what she did for me  
  
(chorus)
