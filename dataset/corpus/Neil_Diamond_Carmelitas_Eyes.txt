Quizas algun dia  
La encuentre otra vez alli  
En una frontera  
Me robo el corazon  
  
Yo sabia que a ella la perdia  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Camelita's eyes  
She took me somewhere,  
Somewhere that's far beyond  
Was going no where  
  
And I couldn't go for long  
The waitin' and prayin'  
Was makin' me tell myself lies  
And all I could see was my  
  
Carmelita's eyes  
Vi todoun mundo en  
Carmelita's eyes  
How did I live it before?  
  
I just don't understand  
Afraid that she'd read me and  
Finally deceive me  
I closed my eyes and I ran  
  
But I want to be  
Carmelita's man  
Hey, hey  
Yes I lost her 'cross the border  
  
It was higher than I realize  
And I left my whole world in  
Carmelita's eyes  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Carmelita's eyes  
I saw the whole world in  
Carmelita's eyes  
Vi todoun mundo en  
  
Carmelita's eyes  
I saw the whole world in  
Carmelita's eyes
