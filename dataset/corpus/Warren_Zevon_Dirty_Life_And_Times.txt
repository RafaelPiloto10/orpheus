Some days I feel like my shadow's casting me  
Some days the sun don't shine  
Sometimes I wonder what tomorrow's gonna bring  
When I think about my dirty life and times  
  
One day I came to a fork in the road  
Folks, I just couldn't go where I was told  
Now they'll hunt me down and hang me for my crimes  
If I tell about my dirty life and times  
  
I had someone 'til she went out for a stroll  
Should have run after her  
It's hard to find a girl with a heart of gold  
When you're living in a four-letter world  
  
And if she won't love me then her sister will  
She's from Say-one-thing-and-mean-another's-ville  
And she can't seem to make up her mind  
When she hears about my dirty life and times  
  
Some days I feel like my shadow's casting me  
Some days the sun don't shine  
Sometimes I wonder why I'm still running free  
All up and down the line  
  
Gets a little lonely, folks, you know what I mean  
I'm looking for a woman with low self-esteem  
To lay me out and ease my worried mind  
While I'm winding down my dirty life and times  
  
Who'll lay me out and ease my worried mind  
While I'm winding down my dirty life and times
