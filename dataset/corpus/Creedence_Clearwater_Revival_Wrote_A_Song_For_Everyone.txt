Met myself a comin' county welfare line.  
I was feelin' strung out, hung out on the line.  
Saw myself a goin', down to war in June.  
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wrote a song for everyone,  
Wrote a song for truth.  
Wrote a song For everyone  
And I couldn't even talk to you.  
  
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail.  
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed.  
If you see the answer, now's the time to say.  
All I want, all I want is to get you down and pray.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Saw the people standin' thousand years in chains.  
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same.  
Pharoah's spin the message, 'round and 'round the truth.  
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?  
  
[Chorus: x2]
