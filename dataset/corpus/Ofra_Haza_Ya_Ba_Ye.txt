Ya bi na ya!...  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run?  
My mother's always told me  
ya binti  
Don't forget  
min fain in-Ti  
Remember who you are  
Listen to the voice  
That plays in your head  
Make the right choice  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run?  
My mother says, my mother says  
ya ba ye, ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run?  
I had to see it my way  
'Cause life is very short  
The more I try to learn  
The less I seem to know  
Oh - I cry in my bed  
Ye... I miss my home  
The home I can't forget  
I hear my mother's voice  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You cry?  
My mother says, my mother says  
ya ba ye, ya ba ye  
Don't run away  
ya ba ye, ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run?  
My mother says, my mother says  
ya ba ye, ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
ya bi na ya  
Don't run away  
ya ba ye, ya ba ye  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You cry?  
Don't run away  
ya ba ye, ya ba ye  
Don't run away  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
You run?
