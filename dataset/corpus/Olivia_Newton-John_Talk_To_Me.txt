(Olivia Newton-John)  
When you're having those days when you're feeling deserted  
And everyone leaves you on hold  
When none of your friends seem to care what you're doin'  
And you're feeling old, out in the cold  
When the only thing left of romance is a memory  
And your memory's not strong  
Whenever your clouds lose their silvery lining  
I'll keep you warm, out of the storm  
You don't need no psychiatry  
Come on baby you can talk to me  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
You don't need to be hypnotized  
Lay down here and look me in my eyes  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
Won't you talk to me  
Come on and talk to me  
Oh talk to me  
When you're feeling the blues and there's no one to lean on  
When nobody makes you belong  
You need to be safe in the arms of a someone  
Who'll make you strong, it won't take long  
If you're lookin' for someone that you can believe in  
Let that someone be me  
Can't think of a thing that some lovin' can't handle  
Let's make a start, give me your heart  
You don't need no psychiatry  
Come on baby you can talk to me  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
You don't need to be hypnotized  
Lay down here and look me in my eyes  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
Talk to me  
Oh won't you talk to me  
Oh, keep on talking to me  
You gotta, you gotta talk to me  
(repeats)
