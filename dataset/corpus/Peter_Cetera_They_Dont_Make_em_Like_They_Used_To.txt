It's every young boy's fancy  
It's there hidden deep in the heart of a man  
It's just a feeling  
They won't ever understand  
  
They know they gotta have one  
A brand new model and it's here today  
And don't you know that she's made right here in the U.S.A.  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't ever stop trying  
Don't let her get away  
They don't make 'em like they used to  
I think they're better than before  
It's more than physical attraction  
Keeps you coming back for more  
  
She's a home grown beauty  
She's born and raised with a mind of her own  
And once you find her  
You'll never want to leave her alone  
  
She's making you crazy  
You can't live without her, she's here to stay  
Don't you know that she lives right here in the U.S.A.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They don't make 'em like they used to  
They're so much better than before  
  
I'm so tired of hearing--(I'm so tired)  
Some people say--(what people say)  
Everything is moving much too fast  
Things were better in the good old days  
  
Let them have their opinions--(let them have...)  
Never gonna change their mind--(they'll never change)  
They lived a long time ago  
When times were tough  
And a real good woman was hard to find  
  
They don't make 'em like they used to  
I think they're better than before  
It's more than physical attraction  
That keeps you coming back for more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They don't make 'em like they used to  
They're so much better than before
