You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair  
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere  
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down  
Oh Ruby,  
Don't take your love to town  
It wasn't me that started this whole crazy Asian war  
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore  
Yes it's true that I'm not the man I used to be  
Oh Ruby,  
I still need some company  
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed  
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realize  
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around  
Oh Ruby,  
Don't take your love to town  
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door  
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before  
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground  
Oh Ruby,  
Don't take your love to town  
Oh Ruby,  
For God sakes turn around
