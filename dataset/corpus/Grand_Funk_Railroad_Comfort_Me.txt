I was found after losing my way,  
Safe and sound after many a day.  
I was lost in a world of madness,  
Please take me from all of this sadness.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Comfort me, in whatever I do.  
Comfort me, and I'll comfort you too.  
Follow me, 'cause I'm trying to love you.  
Can't figure out what's wrong with my head,  
I used to think I wish I was dead.  
You took me from all of that sorrow,  
My future's bright, I can't wait 'till tomorrow.  
  
There ain't nothin' to it, anyone can do it,  
It's easy when you're feelin' right.  
I know that I feel good, and I know that you should,  
Stop not doin' what you know is right.  
Don't know what it is that's causing this feeling,  
What ever it is I'm touching the ceiling.  
I won't let go of this beautiful sound,  
I once was lost but now I am found.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just don't want to be your friend, yeah.  
You can trust me 'till the very end, yeah.  
I know just what I'm talkin' about, yeah, yeah.  
I'm talkin' 'bout the love that you can't live without, no, no.
