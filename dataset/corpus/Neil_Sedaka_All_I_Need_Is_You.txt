I don't need money, I don't need gold,  
Your sweet kiss is wealth untold.  
I don't need the sunshine in the sky,  
There is sunshine in your eyes.  
When you hold me oh so near,  
Nothing more can matter, dear.  
Oh, all I need is you.  
  
When I'm lost in your embrace,  
The world becomes a magic place.  
When you hold me, church bells ring,  
When I kiss you, angels sing.  
can't you see I love you so,  
Say you'll never let me go.  
Oh, all I need is you.  
  
Oh darling please believe me,  
My love is not a lie,  
For if you ever leave me,  
Then I would die.  
  
Hold me tight and hold me fast,  
Say your love will always last.  
Darling never set me free,  
Please don't take your love from me.  
what's the sky without the moon above,  
What am I without your love.  
Oh, all I need is you.
