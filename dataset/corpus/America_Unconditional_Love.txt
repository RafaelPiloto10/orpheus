Unconditional love  
Unconditional fear  
Unconditional support  
In your time of need  
Oo, it's unconditionally true  
Oo, it's unconditionally me  
Unconditionally you  
It's a spiritual world  
When the darkness comes  
But you gotta hold your head up  
Hold your head up high  
Oo, you got to take a look around  
Oo, and listen when you hear the sound  
Unconditional love (love)  
This is right, this I know  
I found out, long time ago  
Someday baby we'll get there I know, oh, oh  
Unconditional love  
Unconditional hope  
Unconditional desire  
To have it work out fine  
Oo, it's unconditionally true  
These things we're dreamin' of  
Oo, it's unconditionally yours  
Unconditional love (love)  
Oo, it's unconditionally true  
These things we're dreamin' of  
Oo, it's unconditionally yours  
Unconditional love (love)  
(Love)
