April in Paris  
Chestnuts in blossoms  
Holiday tables  
Under the trees  
April in Paris  
This is a feeling  
No one can ever  
Reprieve  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
Never met it face to face  
I never new my heart could sing  
Never missed a warm embrace  
  
'Till April in Paris  
Whom can I run to  
What have you done to  
My heart...  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
Never met it face to face  
I never new my heart could sing  
Never missed a warm embrace  
  
'Till April in Paris  
Whom can I run to  
What have you done to  
My... hear-eart...
