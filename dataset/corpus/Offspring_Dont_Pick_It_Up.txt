I saw a little kid  
As he walked around  
He picked a candy bar up  
Off the ground  
  
He chowed about a half  
Then his face turned blue  
Turned out that candy bar was doggy-doo  
Don't pick it up I say  
  
Unless you can throw it away  
Don't pick it up I say  
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way  
  
You're out there makin' bacon  
No scrutiny  
You mess around too much  
And you got VD  
  
You know you never think  
And you're sore today  
You're gonna take it back to California  
Don't pick it up I say  
  
Unless you can throw it away  
Don't pick it up I say  
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way  
  
My friend was kinda hurtin'  
For a girl to try  
He saw one that looked like Pat  
On Saturday Night Live  
  
It had a pair of thingies  
But a mustache too  
Not clearly male nor female  
So now what to do  
  
Don't pick it up I say  
Unless you can throw it away  
Don't pick it up I say  
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way
