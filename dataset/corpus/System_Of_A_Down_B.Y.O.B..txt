Why do they always send the poor?  
  
Barbarisms by barbaras  
With pointed heels  
Victorious victorious kneel  
For brand new spankin' deals  
  
Marching forward hypocritic and  
Hypnotic computers  
You depend on our protection  
Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth  
  
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine  
  
Kneeling roses disappearing into  
Moses' dry mouth  
Breaking into fort knox stealing  
Our intentions  
  
Hangers sitting dripped in oil  
Crying freedom  
Handed to obsoletion  
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth  
  
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine  
  
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine  
  
Blast off!  
It's party time!  
And we don't live in a fascist nation!  
Blast off!  
It's party time!  
And where the fuck are you?  
  
Where the fuck are you?  
Where the fuck are you?  
  
Why don't presidents fight the war?  
Why do they always send the poor?  
  
Why don't presidents fight the war?  
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing into

Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth  
  
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine  
  
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun  
  
Where the fuck are you?  
Where the fuck are you?  
  
Why don't presidents fight the war?  
Why do they always send the poor?

They always send the poor!  
They always send the poor!
