It's June in January  
Because I'm in love  
It always is spring in my heart  
With you in my arms  
  
The snow is just white blossoms  
That fall from above  
And here is the reason, my dear  
Your magical charms  
  
The night is cold  
The trees are bare  
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air  
It's June in January  
But only because I'm in love with you  
  
(The night is cold)  
(The trees are bare)  
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air  
It's June in January  
But only because I'm in love with you
