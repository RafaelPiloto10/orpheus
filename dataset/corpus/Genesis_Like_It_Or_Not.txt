Ah, don't you know, I've been on my own  
But I'm coming home.  
And I'd like you to be there,  
I feel a little cold in the air,  
And you're not anywhere.  
You're just another face, I used to know.  
But there is still a chance to hold on to our love,  
Cause I gave you everything, everything I had.  
  
Ooh, like it or not  
You have done it this time  
And like it or not, I've had enough.  
  
Ooh, like it or not  
There's a lot I could say  
Cause I've got a lot on my mind.  
  
It won't be very long  
You're just another face  
That I once used to know  
And I gave you everything,  
But what have I got to show? Oh Oh  
  
Oh, like it or not  
You are out on the street  
And like it or not  
That's where you will stay.  
  
Oh, like it or not  
There's another thing darling,  
Well I just could not stand another day  
Cause if you want to know,  
That there is still a chance to hold on to our love  
Cause I gave you everything  
Everything I had - everything I had.  
  
It's been a long, been a long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone.  
Oh it's been a long, been a long long long time  
But if I'm right or if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?  
  
It's been a long long long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone.  
Ooh it's been a long long long long time  
But if I'm right or if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?  
  
Ooh it's been a long long long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone.  
Oh it's been a long, been a long long long time  
I'm right, if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?  
  
It's been a long long, long long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I held anyone.
