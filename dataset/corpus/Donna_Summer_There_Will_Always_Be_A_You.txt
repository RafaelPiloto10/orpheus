Like the stars that shine above  
In a warn and wind tossed love  
Just like tears that fall forever  
Like the raven and the dove  
Looking for a perfect love  
After rainy, stormy weather  
I am yours and you are mine  
Till the stars fall from my eyes  
There will always be a you  
A ship sailing without end  
A lost, tired, worm down friend  
And old broken run down shoe  
I keep running back for more,  
At least you thought I would be sure  
But I gave up, I broke it's true  
Still there will always be a you  
Don't ask me how  
I tried so long  
And in my heart I know  
I will never go away  
If you wanted me to stay  
Well in a million years  
I wouldn't go  
Cause I love you so  
Yes I do  
I love you so  
I could never leave you  
I love you  
Don't go away  
Don't go away  
There will always be a you  
A ship sailing without end  
A lost tired, worm down friend  
And old broken run down shore  
I keep running back for more  
At least you thought I would be sure  
But I give up, I broke it's true  
Still there will always be a you  
I am yours and you are mine  
Till the stars fall from my eyes  
There will always be a you  
I will never go away  
If you wanted me to stay  
Well in a million years  
I wouldn't go  
Cause I love you so  
Yes I do  
I love you so  
I could never leave you  
I love you  
I love you  
Don't go away  
Can't go away  
There will always be a you  
At night I cry  
Can't find a reason  
I'm left alone  
Can't seem to understand  
At night I cry  
Can't find a reason  
I'm left alone  
Can't seem to understand  
There will always be a you  
There will always be a you  
(Fade)
