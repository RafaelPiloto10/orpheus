There's a spark of magic in your eye  
Candyland appears each time you smile  
Never thought that fairy tales came true  
But they come true when I'm near you  
You're a genie in disguise  
Full of wonder and surprise and  
  
Betcha by golly wow! (wow!)  
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever  
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong  
  
If I could, I'd catch a falling star  
To shine on you so I know where you are  
Color rainbows in your favorite shades  
To show I love you, thinking of you  
  
Write your name across the sky  
Anything you ask, I'll try cause  
  
Betcha by golly wow! (wow!)  
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever  
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong
