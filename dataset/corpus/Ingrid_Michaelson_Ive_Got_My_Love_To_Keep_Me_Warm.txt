The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
I can't remember a worse december  
Just watch those icicles form  
What do I care if icicles form  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
I will weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
I've got my love to keep me warm
