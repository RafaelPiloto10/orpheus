Journalists who lie  
Stealing the money  
Prospering with spite  
Hate-in-a-hurry  
Oh, see how :  
  
They're only trying to make their name  
By spreading Biz myth-lies  
About the ones who've made their name  
Stick in the knife  
Stick in the knife  
  
Journalists who lie  
The truth is, it happens  
Praise, then crucify  
Just follow this pattern  
And see how:  
  
They're only trying to make their name  
By spreading sickening lies  
About the ones who've made their name  
Mate, give us the knife  
Give us the knife  
  
Journalists who lie  
So happy in malice  
Rock star - out of line  
So happy in malice  
Oh...  
  
Journalists who lie  
So sick and belabored  
They only want to be favored  
They only want to be favored  
See how:  
  
They're only trying to make their name  
With unprovable lies  
About the ones  
Who've made their name  
  
In the black hole  
Of your soul  
Still bargaining away the truth  
So easily  
Truth  
  
Journalists who lie  
Stealing the money  
Prospering with spite  
And hate-in-a-hurry  
  
Journalists who lie  
The truth is, it happens  
Praise, then crucify  
Just follow this pattern  
  
Journalists who lie  
So sick and belabored  
They want to be favored  
They only want to be favored
