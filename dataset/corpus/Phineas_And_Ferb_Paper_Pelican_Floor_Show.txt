When we lift off, then you'll be tipped off too,  
How my heart, it soars for you,  
Soon you'll be flying, gravity defying,  
Your dreams will all come true, in the blue,  
  
Flying over a cooton-candy clouds,  
Hanging from a fuselage,  
A walk on a wing, is just the thing,  
For a high in the sky montage,  
  
So darlin' put your goggles on,  
Up-up-and away we'll fly,  
In a big ginormous airplane,  
In a big ginormous airplane,  
In a big ginormous airplane,  
In the Sky!
