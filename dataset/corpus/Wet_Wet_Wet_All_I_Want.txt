And if you open up and let me in  
Let me in  
I feel my world is changing  
It seems so far away  
It's my last chance to make it turn out right  
And if our worlds still lie together  
love will be our satellite  
That takes us round like shooting stars  
I know I'll make you mine  
By giving all my love to you  
I hope you'll understand  
What I have to give  
(What I have to give)  
What I have to give  
All I want is someone to rely on  
All I want is a love that's true  
All I want to do is open up to you  
I feel my worlds on fire  
I can see the sun come up  
I want to spread my wings and fly  
I know I'll make you mine  
By giving all my love to you  
I hope you'll understand  
What I have to give  
(What I have to give)  
What I have to give  
All I want is someone to rely on  
All I want is a love that's true  
All I want to do is spend a little time with you  
Underneath the starry sky  
I sit alone and wonder why  
Where did it all go wrong  
I know I should move on  
Is it just a dream (Is it just a dream)  
Or am I just a dreamer  
Is it just a dream  
(Is it just a dream)  
(Is it just a dream)  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  
All I want is someone to rely on  
All I want is a love that's true  
All I want to do is spend some time with you yeah  
And if you open up and let me in  
I will begin to live again  
Just like the old moon in the sky
