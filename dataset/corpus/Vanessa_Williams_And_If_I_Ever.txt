And if I ever fall in love again  
I'll try to let my heart be free  
Cause I know how it feels to be alone  
Still trapped in old memories  
And if I ever fall in love again  
I'll search to find a love that's true  
I need a lover who will share my life  
And help make my love renewed  
  
I'm not lost I've been here before  
But everything has changed  
No need to cry just dry my eyes  
And let my heart show me the way  
  
Send me someone to love and I'll be on my way  
'Cause I need someone to love  
Forever and always  
  
And if I ever love again  
I know you'll be my lover and friend  
And if I ever hold you in my arms  
No nothing could tear us apart  
And if I ever wanna hear you say  
Darlin' I love you to me everyday  
The only way to know our love is right  
It must pass the test of time  
  
Send me someone to love and I'll be on my way  
'Cause I need someone to love  
Forever and always  
  
I'm not lost I've been here before  
But everything has changed  
No need to cry just dry my eyes  
And let my heart show me the way  
  
Send me someone to love and I'll be on my way  
'Cause I need someone to love  
Forever and always  
  
And if I ever fall in love
