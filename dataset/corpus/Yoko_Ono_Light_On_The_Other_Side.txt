When I come to the dock and sit very still,  
I wonder why on earth we fight and kill.  
I see a light on the other side flickering to me,  
As if to say, you're alright, you'll find your way.  
  
The world is so beautiful when I'm out here,  
Why can't it be the same when we're back there?  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.  
  
Windows are shattered,  
Streets are battered,  
Kids are frightened,  
Men are still at war.  
  
Moms are feeling sad,  
Dads are feeling bad.  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
If the world's gone mad.  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.
