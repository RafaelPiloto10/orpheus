Now it's time to say goodnight  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the sun turns out his light  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Dream sweet dreams for me  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the moon begins to shine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Dream sweet dreams for me  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the moon begins to shine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Dream sweet dreams for me  
Goodnight  
Goodnight baby
