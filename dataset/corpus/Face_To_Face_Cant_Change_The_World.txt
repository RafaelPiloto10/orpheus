People say that it's impossible to fly  
But you don't know what I'm thinking  
Don't want to be just like the other hundred guys  
Yeah you don't know what I'm thinking  
  
Can't change the world?  
Can't change the whole world?  
You say it's crumbling all around you  
And you're trying to get out  
  
People say that out of sight is out of mind  
But you don't know what I'm thinking  
Don't want to listen to the ignorance and lies  
Yeah you don't know what I'm thinking  
  
And isn't it ironic sometimes?  
The things we take for granted are what we wanted  
Before we knew why  
And isn't it the reason we try?  
To make the excuse that it won't go the right way  
Before its gone wrong
