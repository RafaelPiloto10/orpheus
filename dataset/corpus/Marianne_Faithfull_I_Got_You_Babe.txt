Him:  
Ah, they say we're young and we don't know,  
We won't find out until we grow.  
Her:  
Of course I don't know if all that's true  
'Cause you've got me, and baby I've got you.  
Both:  
Babe,  
I've got you, babe,  
I've got you, babe.  
Him:  
They say our love won't pay the rent,  
Before it's earned, our money's always spent.  
Her:  
I guess that's so, we don't have a lot,  
But at least I'm sure of all the things we've got.  
Both:  
Babe,  
I've got you, babe,  
I've got you, babe.  
Him:  
I've got flowers in the spring,  
I've got you to wear my ring.  
Her:  
And when I'm sad,  
Him:  
Oh yeah!  
Her:  
You're a clown  
Him:  
I'm a clown!  
Her:  
And if I get scared, you're always around.  
Her:  
Don't let them say your hair's too long -  
I don't care, with you I can't be wrong.  
Him:  
Then put your little arms in mine,  
There ain't no river or mountain we can't climb.  
Him:  
Babe,  
Both:  
I've got you, babe,  
I've got you, babe.  
Him:  
I've got you to walk with me,  
Her:  
I've got you to talk with me.  
Him:  
I've got you to hold my hand,  
Her:  
I've got you to understand.  
Him:  
I've got you to kiss goodnight,  
Her:  
I've got you to hold me tight.  
Him:  
I've got you and I, I won't let go,  
Her:  
I've got you to love me so.  
Both:  
I've got you, babe.  
Him:  
I've got you, babe  
Her:  
I've got you, babe  
Him:  
I've got you, babe  
Her:  
I've got you, babe  
Him:  
I've got you, babe  
Her:  
Him:  
I've got you, babe.
