You've seen me naked in more ways than one  
You've seen me done up, seen me come undone  
We've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sun  
We've been forever, yet we've just begun  
We've come full circle, all the way 'round  
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs  
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin  
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends  
And you know the soft spots under my skin  
Deep down inside me, where no one has been  
We've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind  
But time's only sweetened this love that we're in  
And we've come full circle, all the way 'round  
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs  
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin  
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends  
We've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sun  
We've come full circle and we've just begun  
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round  
(We've come full circle)  
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round  
You know we've cried in the darkness and we've laughed in the sun  
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)  
But we've stayed together and we've just begun  
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)  
I'm so glad you're still my friend  
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)  
We've come full circle
