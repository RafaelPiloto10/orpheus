Countdown to Christmas  
Countdown to Christmas party time  
We're so happy  
We want you to be happy too  
We're so happy  
And we want to share the secrets of happiness with you  
Grab a woman beneath the mistletoe  
Kiss her lips and make her glow  
No more fighting, no more fuss  
Ah, it's Christmas!

Invite the whole street through your door  
Sing out loud, don't swear or cuss  
Ah, it's Christmas!
