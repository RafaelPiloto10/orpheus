This is the place  
Sit down, you're safe now  
You've been stuck in a lift  
We've been trying to reach you, Thom  
  
This is the place  
It won't hurt, it will not hurt  
  
A smell of recognition  
A face you barely loved  
Empty all your pockets  
'Cause it's time to go home  
  
This is the place  
Remembering all the things you always see  
  
You've been stuck in a lift  
In the belly of a whale  
At the bottom of the ocean  
  
A smell of recognition  
A face you barely loved  
Empty all your pockets  
'Cause it's time to go home  
  
Today is the first day of the rest of your days  
So lighten up, squirt
