In my Promised Land  
In the Middle East  
What will we do about terrorism?  
In my Promised Land  
In the Middle East  
What can we do about fanaticism?  
You and I on parallel lines  
You and I, we are the key  
Dreams are not enough  
To lead and guide us  
To peace  
In the Middle East  
Oh, oh, oh...  
In the Middle East  
Oh, oh, oh...  
Desire for peace  
Such yearning for peace  
Does your country do  
What you believe in?  
In my Land there is war  
And we're losing our soul  
And ideology  
Is losing meaning  
You and I on parallel lines  
You and I, when can we meet?  
Dreams are not enough  
To lead and guide us  
To peace  
In the Middle East  
Oh, oh, oh...  
In the Middle East  
Oh, oh, oh...  
  
Sholem sholem  
Ween sholem  
Sholem sholem  
Wen essalam  
Sholem sholem  
Ween sholem  
Salam  
  
You and I on parallel lines  
You and I, we are the key  
Dreams are not enough  
To lead and guide us  
To peace  
In the Middle East  
Oh, oh, oh...  
Wen essalam?  
Oh, oh, oh...  
In the Middle East  
  
Flare lights, flowers, mothers, fathers,  
Homeland, green fields and tears  
Borders, rivers, desert, Dead Sea  
We are the key  
Flare lights, flowers, mothers, fathers,  
Homeland, green fields and tears  
Borders, rivers, desert, Dead Sea  
When can we meet?  
  
Yerushalaym  
Yerushalem  
Oh, oh, oh...  
In the Middle East  
Oh, oh, oh...  
In the Middle East
