I can't go on this way forever  
Closing my eyes and just imagining  
I'm loving you  
When i'm close to you it feels so right  
Can't sleep at night  
But if i try to stay away can't even  
Make it through the day  
No longer care if it is wrong or right  
I wanna love you, baby, through the night  
Till the morning light  
Can't stop imagining the tenderness of your caress  
Couldn't stop if i wanted to  
There's nothing left for me to do  
  
Please, love me  
Just look into my eyes  
I know you want me  
Say what you feel inside  
Don't be afraid to try  
I'm yours if you say  
Please, love me  
If it's so hard to say then baby, touch me  
I can't take it anymore  
I'm dizzy with your love  
I'm yours if you say baby, stay  
  
You drive me crazy when you look at me  
I'm nearly blinded by my fantasy  
You're making love to me  
If i can't have you  
Don't know what i'll do  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll play any game you wanna play  
But i just wanna hear you say  
  
Please, love me just look into my eyes  
I know you want me  
Say what you feel inside  
Don't be afraid to try  
I'm yours if you say  
Please, love me if it's so hard to say  
Then baby, touch me  
I can't take it anymore  
I'm dizzy with your love  
I'm yours if you say baby, stay  
I'm yours if you say baby, stay
