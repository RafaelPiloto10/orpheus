Eyes  
Like a sunrise  
Like a rainfall  
Down my soul  
And I wonder  
I wonder why you look at me like that  
What you're thinking  
What's behind  
Don't tell me  
But it feels like love  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna take this moment  
And make it last forever  
I'm gonna give my heart away  
And pray we'll stay together  
Cause you're the one good reason  
You're the only girl that I need  
Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen  
I'm gonna take this night  
And make it evergreen  
  
Touch  
Like an angel  
Like velvet to my skin  
And I wonder  
Wonder why you wanna stay the night  
What you're dreaming  
What's behind  
Don't tell me  
But it feels like love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Oh yeah don't tell me  
But it feels like love)  
  
I'm gonna take this moment  
And make it last forever  
I'm gonna give my heart away  
And pray we'll stay together  
Cause you're the one good reason  
You're the only girl that I need  
Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen  
I'm gonna take this night  
And make it evergreen
