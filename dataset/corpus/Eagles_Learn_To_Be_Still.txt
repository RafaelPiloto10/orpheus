It's just another day in paradise  
As you stumble to your bed  
You'd give anything to silence  
Those voices ringing in your head  
You thought you could find happiness  
Just over that green hill  
You thought you would be satisfied  
But you never will-  
Learn to be still  
  
We are like sheep without a shepherd  
We don't know how to be alone  
So we wander 'round this desert  
And wind up following the wrong gods home  
But the flock cries out for another  
And they keep answering that bell  
And one more starry-eyed messiah  
Meets a violent farewell-  
Learn to be still  
Learn to be still  
  
Now the flowers in your garden  
They don't smell so sweet  
Maybe you've forgotten  
The heaven lying at your feet  
  
There are so many contradictions  
In all these messages we send  
(We keep asking)  
How do I get out of here  
Where do I fit in?  
Though the world is torn and shaken  
Even if your heart is breakin'  
It's waiting for you to awaken  
And someday you will-  
Learn to be still  
Learn to be still  
  
You just keep on runnin'  
Keep on runnin'
