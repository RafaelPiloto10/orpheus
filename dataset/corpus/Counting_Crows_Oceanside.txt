(Original by robyn hitchcock)  
  
Did you ever hover in the distance?  
Did you ever swoop down from the sky  
To the bright green rocks all draped with seaweed  
And the deep blue ocean rolling by?  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Did you ever see into the future?  
See the big red sun that won't go down?  
And the giant moths upon the cliffside  
In the deep red scar that was our town?  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Baby, we're the king and queen of nothing  
Everybody glows and then they're numb  
We can make a moment last forever  
Gaze across the ocean to the sun  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Baby, we're the king and queen of something  
Everybody goes and then they come
