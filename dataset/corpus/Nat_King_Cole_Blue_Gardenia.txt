Blue gardenia  
Now I'm alone with you  
And I am oh-so blue  
She has tossed us aside  
And, like you, gardenia  
Once I was near her heart  
After the teardrops start  
Where are teardrops to hide?  
  
I lived for an hour  
What more can I tell  
Love bloomed like a flower  
Then the petals fell  
Blue gardenia  
Thrown to a passing breeze  
But rest in my book  
Of memories  
  
I lived for an hour  
What more can I tell?  
Love bloomed like a flower  
Then the petals fell  
Blue gardenia  
Thrown to a passing breeze  
But rest in my book  
Of memories
