When paradise is no longer fit for you to live in  
And your adolescent dreams are gone  
Through the days you feel a little used up  
And you don't know where your energy's gone wrong  
It's just your soul feelin' a little downhearted  
Sometimes life is too ridiculous to live  
You count your friends all on one finger  
I know it sounds crazy just the way that we live  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And that's as good as it can get for us  
And there ain't no reason to stop tryin'  
  
When this cardboard town can no longer amuse you  
You see through everything and nothin' seems worthwhile  
And hypocrite used to be such a big word to you  
And it don't seem to mean anything to you now  
Just try to live each and every precious moment  
Don't be discouraged by the future forget the past  
That's old advise but it'll be good to you  
I know there's a balance see it when I swing past  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And that's as good as it can get for us  
And there ain't no reason to stop tryin'  
  
Between a laugh and a tear  
Smile in the mirror as you walk by  
Between a laugh and a tear  
And that's as good as it can get for us  
And there ain't no reason to stop tryin'  
  
When paradise can no longer amuse you
