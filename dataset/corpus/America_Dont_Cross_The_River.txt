There's a little girl out lyin' on her own  
She's got a broken heart  
She's not the kind to take you down for long  
She knows and plays it smart  
  
(Ah) And if she's comin' she's showed no mark  
She's heard no whistle blowin' from the dark  
She feels like leavin' and she don't know why  
Without no bridges she's trapped, so I sigh  
  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't try denyin' livin' on the other side  
All your life  
You were on your own  
  
If you want you can ride my train  
And soon forget the reason that you're leaving  
You'll lose yourself and then sometime  
Maybe even save yourself some grievin'  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't try denyin' livin' on the other side  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't try denyin' livin' on the other side  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide ...
