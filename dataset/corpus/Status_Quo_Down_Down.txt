Get down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Get down deeper and down  
I want all the world to see  
To see you're laughing, and you're laughing at me  
I can take it all from you  
Again again again again  
Again again again and deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Get down deeper and down  
I have all the ways you see  
To keep you guessing, stop your messing with me  
You'll be back to find your way  
Again again again again  
Again-gain-gain-gain deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Get down  
Get down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Get down deeper and down  
I have found you out you see  
I know what you're doing, what you're doing to me  
I'll keep on and say to you  
Again again again again  
Again-gain-gain-gain deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Down down deeper and down  
Get down
