The sky is dark  
The wind is cold  
The night is young  
Before it's old and grey  
We will know  
The thrill of it all  
  
The time has come  
It's getting late  
It's now or never  
Don't hesitate or stall  
When I call  
Don't spoil  
The thrill of it all  
  
And before you go to sleep at night  
Preying shadows, do they ask you why?  
And in the morning through the afternoon  
Do you wonder where you're going to?  
  
Every word I use  
Each crumpled page  
Strange ideas  
Mature with age  
Like leaves  
When autumn falls  
Turn gold  
Then they hit the ground  
  
Every time I hear  
The latest sound  
It's pure whiskey  
Reeling round and around  
My brain  
Oh and all oh that jive  
It's driving me wild  
The dizzy spin I'm in  
  
Everywhere I look  
I see your face  
I hear your name  
All over the place  
Hey girl  
Though you're gone  
Still I recall  
The thrill of it all  
  
You might as well know what is right for you  
And make the most of what you like to do  
For all the pleasure that's surrounding you  
Should compensate for all you're going through  
  
So if you're feeling fraught  
With mental strain  
Too much thinking's got you down again  
Well let your senses skip  
Stay hip  
Keep cool  
To the thrill of it all  
  
When you try too much  
You lose control  
Pressure rises  
And so I'm told  
Something's got to give  
High life ecstasy  
You might as well live  
  
I can't see  
I can't speak  
I couldn't take more than another week  
Without you, oh no  
So I will drink my fill  
Till the thrill is you  
  
Oh the thrill of it all  
Oh the thrill of it all  
No I won't forget  
The thrill of it all  
  
No no no no no no no
