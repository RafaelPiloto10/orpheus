She was a girl on a wagon train  
Haded west across the plains  
The train got lost in a summer storm  
They couldn't move west and they couldn't go home  
Then she saw him ridin' through the rain  
He took charge of the wagons and he saved the train  
And she looked down and her heart was gone  
The train went west but she stayed on  
In Lonesome Dove  
  
A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand  
A blooming rose in a bed of sand  
She loved the man who wore a star  
A Texas Ranger known near and far  
So they got married and they had a child  
But times were touch and the West was wild  
So it was no surprise the day she learned  
That her Texas man would not return  
To Lonesome Dove  
  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove  
  
She watched her boy grow into a man  
He had an angel's heart and the devil's hand  
He wore his star for all to see  
He was a Texas lawman legacy  
The one day word blew into town  
It seemed the men that shot his father down  
Had robbed a bank in Cherico  
The only thing 'tween them and Mexico  
Was Lonesome Dove  
  
The shadows stretched across the land  
As the shots rang out down the Rio Grande  
And when the smoke had finally cleared the street  
The men lay at the ranger's feet  
But legend tells to this very day  
That shots were comin' from an alleyway  
Though no one knows who held the gun  
There ain't no doubt if you ask someone  
In Lonesome Dove  
Back to back with the Rio Grande  
A Christian woman in the devil's land  
She learned the language and she learned to fight  
But she never learned how to beat the lonely nights  
In Lonesome Dove, Lonesome Dove
