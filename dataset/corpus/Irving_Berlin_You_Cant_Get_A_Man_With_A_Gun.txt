Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say  
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.  
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,  
And now tell me what have I got?  
I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint  
I'm number one, but my score with a feller  
Is lower than a celler, oh you can't get a man with a gun.  
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal  
Yes, I shine like the morning sun,  
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,  
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.  
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun  
If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle  
You'd have steak when the job was done.  
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder  
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,  
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.  
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring  
When I'm out with my Remington.  
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister  
Oh you can't get a man with a gun  
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers  
In the rain or the blazin sun  
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles  
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.  
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.  
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie  
For a gal who he thinks is fun.  
But they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas  
And you can't get a hug from a mug, with a slug  
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
