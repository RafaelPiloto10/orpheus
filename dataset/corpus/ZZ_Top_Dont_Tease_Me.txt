Baby, baby, I need you,  
I'll lay it on you with a straight shot  
Baby, baby, I love you,  
I'll give it everything I got.  
I'm gonna try my best to hold you baby,  
Hold you in my arms.  
  
Tryin' my best to please you,  
Never ever tease you,  
Don't you go and break my heart.  
Don't burn me like a jet fuel,  
Baby just be cool,  
Don't go tearin' me apart.  
  
Baby, baby I want you,  
I know we're thinkin' 'bout the same thing.  
Lord have mercy,  
I need you, I can read you like a magazine.

Hold you in my arms.

Never ever tease you,  
Don't you go and break my heart.  
Don't burn me like a jet fuel,  
Baby just be cool,  
Don't go tearin' me apart.  
  
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Because I'm givin' you the head lines.  
Baby, baby I love you,  
Let's get ready for the good times.  
I'm gonna try my best to hold you baby,  
Hold you in my arms.
