Can't tell your ass from a hole in the ground  
You'd lose your fucking head if it wasn't screwed on  
You smile and you nod like you understand  
I'll slap that grin off your face with the back of my hand  
You're a drroling fucking moron with a hole in your head  
A shit talking veggie who'd be better off dead  
An imbecile, an idiot a perpetual sap  
You've gotta read the directions on a child-proof cap  
You're stupid and you think it's funny  
I bet you believe in the Easter Bunny  
You're stupid and you thinks its cool  
You think its cute when you play the fool  
[Repeat first verse]  
I hate stupid people [12x]  
[Repeat second verse]
