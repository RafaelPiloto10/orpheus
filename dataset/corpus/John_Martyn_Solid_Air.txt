You've been taking your time  
And you've been living on solid air  
You've been walking the line  
And you've been living on solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round inside  
And I can tell you that it's hard to hide  
When you're living on solid air  
And you've been painting the blues  
And you've been looking through solid air  
You've been seeing it through  
And you've been looking through solid air  
Don't know what's going 'round in your mind  
And I can tell you don't like what you find  
When you're moving through solid air, solid air  
I know you, I love you  
And I can be your friend  
I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
You've been stoning it cold  
You've been living on solid air  
You've been finding it cold  
You've been living on solid air  
I don't know what's going on inside  
I can tell you that it's hard to hide  
When you're living on solid air, solid air  
You've been getting too deep  
You've been living on solid air  
You've been missing your sleep  
And you've been moving through solid air  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But I know you don't like what you find  
When you're moving through solid air, solid air  
I know you, I love you  
I will be your friend  
I will follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
You've been walking your line  
You've been walking on solid air  
You've been taking your time  
But you've been walking on solid air  
Don't know what's going on inside  
But I can tell you that it's hard to hide  
When you're living on solid air, solid air  
You've been painting the blues  
You've been living on solid air  
And you've been seeing it through  
And you've been looking through solid air  
I don't know what's going 'round in your mind  
But I can tell you don't like what you find  
When you're living through solid air, solid air  
I know you, I love you  
And I can be your friend  
I can follow you anywhere  
Even through solid air  
[Incomprehensible] solid air  
[Incomprehensible] solid air  
Solid air
