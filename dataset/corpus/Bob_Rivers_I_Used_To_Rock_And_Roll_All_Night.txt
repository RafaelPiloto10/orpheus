You loved us when the band was hot.  
And now we're gonna give it one more shot.  
We're gettin' old,  
We must be crazy.  
  
We're puttin' on the makeup again.  
It covers up a buncha wrinkled skin.  
You bring the bread,  
We'll make the gravy.  
  
You keep on standin',  
We'll keep on singin.  
  
I used to rock and roll all night  
But now my hair's turning gray.  
I have to get to bed by nine,  
Rub on a tube of Ben-gay.  
  
Haven't picked up my guitar for a while,  
Not since them hula-hoops went outta style.  
It's been a while,  
I'm pretty rusty.  
  
We'll give you everything we got.  
Would you like to see my liver spots?  
You drive us home if we get sleepy.  
If the shirts keep on sellin',  
We'll keep on yellin'  
  
I used to rock and roll all night  
But now my hair's turning gray.  
I have to get to bed by nine,  
Rub in a tube of Ben-gay.  
  
I wanna rock and roll all night  
But I can't stay awake  
I'd like to rock and roll all night  
But then my body would ache.  
I'll try to rock and roll all night,  
If there's some dough to be made  
I wanna rock and roll all night,  
But I get drowsy by eight.
