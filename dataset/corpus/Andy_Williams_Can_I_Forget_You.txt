Can I forget you?  
Or will my heart remind me,  
That once we walked in a moonlight dream?  
  
Can I forget you,  
Or will my heart remind me,  
How sweet you made the moonlight seem.  
  
Will the glory of your nearness fade,  
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?  
  
Can I forget you,  
When every night reminds me,  
How much I want you back again.  
  
Can I forget you,  
When every night reminds me,  
How much I want you back again.
