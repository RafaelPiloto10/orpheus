She says she's no good with words but I'm worse  
Barely stuttered out  
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue  
And weighed down with words too overdramatic  
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"  
Vs. "no one should ever feel like.."  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me  
  
  
You always fold just before you're found out  
Drink up its last call  
Last resort  
But only the first mistake and I  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (love)  
  
Dance, dance  
We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me  
  
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (with love)  
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me  
  
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me
