Do you mean the attack is routine?  
A bird asked of a bird  
In this context, a concave nest  
How do we learn to hurt?  
Do you mean there's no variation?  
Watching a dog charge a flock  
Of birds exploding in congregation  
Why plan, when when we stop?  
I don't know but why suppose  
'Cause it's not the way it should be?  
When you can fly above the great waiting list  
As the crow implies, we won't be missed  
We can leave, we can leave, we can leave, you leave  
It's a routine flight for this bird tonight  
There's more worms than earth in the after life  
Where the blind feed the blind, whispering things like  
"On the money" and "Bullseye"  
She picks up the little leaves  
Where human wrecks are left to seed  
Left to repaint their deities  
And plaster away at their villainies  
Where there's love and there's hope  
And do you hope those earthbound poets  
Could learn to sing as good as us?  
So we can sit back and enjoy our illusions and our quietus?  
Well I don't know but why suppose  
It's not the way it should be  
When you can squawk and wait for a word from above  
And change yourself into something you love when you leave?  
You leave, you leave
