Green in your love on bright days  
You grew sun blind you thought me unkind  
To remind you how winter kills  
  
Lost in daydreams you drove too fast and got nowhere  
You rode on half fare when you got too scared  
How winter kills  
  
Tear at me searching for weaker seams  
Pain in your eyes make me cruel  
Make me spiteful tears are delightful welcome your nightfall  
How winter kills  
  
I'll tear at you searching for weaker seams  
How winter kills
