In the still of the night  
I hear the wolf howl, honey  
Sniffing around your door  
In the still of the night  
I feel my heart beating heavy  
Telling me I gotta have more  
  
In the shadow of night  
I see the full moon rise  
Telling me what's in store,  
My heart start aching  
My body start a shaking  
And I can't take no more, no, no  
  
Now I just want to get close to you  
An' taste your love so sweet  
And I just want to make love to you  
Feel your body heat  
  
In the still of the night  
In the still of the night  
Over here baby  
  
In the heat of the day  
I hang my head down low  
And hide my face from the sun  
Through the light of the day  
Until the evening time  
I'm waiting for the night to come  
  
In the still of the night,  
In the cool moonlight,  
I feel heart is aching  
In the still of the night  
  
Tell me here baby  
  
In the still of the night  
I hear the wolf howl, honey  
Sniffing around your door  
In the still of the night  
I feel my heart beating heavy  
Telling me I gotta have more.  
  
Now I just want to get close to you  
An' taste your love so sweet  
And I just want to make love to you  
Feel your body heat.  
  
In the still of the night  
  
Still of the night,  
Still of the night,  
Still of the night.
