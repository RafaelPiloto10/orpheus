Don't try to tell me the world is changing  
Heart's getting stupid, now that is a strange thing  
I got a heartbeat, I feel the heat rise,  
I got no questions, I got no alibis  
  
Love don't know the difference  
Sands and mountains are insignificant  
  
Now don't try to tell me love is dead,  
It is your body, now it is your head  
I can't stop crying, I can't stop screaming,  
I can't stop talking, I can't stop dreaming  
  
Love is pleasure, love is pain  
Sweet, sweet summer and bitter rain  
  
I gotta have it, I gotta use it,  
I gotta own it, never lose it  
  
Oh oh, whoa whoa,  
I'm just a fanatic  
  
Yeah  
  
Love, love is pleasure, love is pain  
Sweet, sweet summer and bitter rain  
  
I gotta have it, I gotta use it,  
I gotta own it, never lose it  
I gotta use it, I gotta have it,  
I feel the heat rise  
  
Love, love, love  
Yeah  
  
Oh, whoa whoaa whoaaa  
I'm just a fanatic  
I'm just a fanatic  
Yeah, now I gotta have it  
Uh, I'm just a fanatic  
I gotta chose it,  
Just a, just a fanatic  
Ooooo, mmm mmm, love, love, love  
Just a fanatic
