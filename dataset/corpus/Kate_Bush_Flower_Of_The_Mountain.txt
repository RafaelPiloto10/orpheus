Yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth  
And it was leap year like now yes  
Sixteen years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath  
Yes he said I was a flower of the mountain  
Yes so we are flowers all a woman's body yes  
  
Stepping out of the page  
Into the sensual world  
Stepping out, off the page,  
Into the sensual world  
  
And Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain  
Yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used  
Or shall I wear a red yes  
And how he kissed me under the Moorish wall  
And I thought well as well him as another  
  
Stepping out of the page  
Into the sensual world  
Stepping out, off the page,  
Into the sensual world  
  
And then I asked him with my eyes to ask again  
Yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower  
And first I put my arms around him yes  
And drew him down to me so he could feel my breath  
All perfume yes and his heart was going like mad  
And yes I said yes I will yes.  
Ooo yes
