I have a mansion  
Forget the price  
Ain't never been there  
They tell me it's nice  
  
I live in hotels  
Tear out the walls  
I have accountants  
Pay for it all  
  
They say I'm crazy but I have a good time  
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime  
Life's been good to me so far  
  
My Maserati  
Does one eighty-five  
I lost my license  
Now I don't drive  
  
I have a limo  
Ride in the back  
I lock the doors  
In case I'm attacked  
  
I'm making records  
My fans they can't wait  
They write me letters  
Tell me I'm great  
  
So I got me an office  
Gold records on the wall  
Ust leave a message  
Maybe I'll call  
  
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through  
(Everybody sing) I'm cool (He's cool)  
I can't complain but sometimes I still do  
Life's been good to me so far  
  
I go to parties  
Sometimes until four  
It's hard to leave  
When you can't find the door  
  
It's tough to handle  
This fortune and fame  
Everybody's so different  
I haven't changed  
  
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time  
(Everybody sing) Oh yeah (Oh yeah)  
I keep on going guess I'll never know why  
Life's been good to me so far baby,  
Inside the Sad Cafe.
