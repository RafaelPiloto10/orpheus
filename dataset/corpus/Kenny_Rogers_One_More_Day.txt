Just one more day I ask  
One chance to love you  
I can see your face  
Everywhere I go  
It's in my soul.  
No matter how it goes  
God only knows  
I get more than I deserve  
Yes, it's such an easy word  
Give me one more day.  
And time  
Is a river that rows us along  
And love will deliver us  
If we hold on.  
So if you think  
You might not trust your heart tonight  
I'm never gonna drift away  
I'll wait forever if you say  
You'll give me one more day.  
And time...
