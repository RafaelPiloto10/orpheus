I know a girl who's lost and lonely  
Sits by the phone on her own  
But the phone don't ring  
And the birds don't sing in her tree  
She lost herself in a haze of pity  
And doesn't know where to run  
She's a headshrinker now  
And I think it's time we have some fun  
  
Lost in a fog  
I've been treated like a dog  
And I'm out of here  
I got no name  
And I feel no shame  
And I got no fear  
And I bow down  
To the tears of a clown  
Whatever's going down  
Is coming around  
I hope you don't regret today  
  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
For the rest of your lives  
  
Lost in a fog  
I've been treated like a dog  
And I'm out of here  
I got no name  
And I feel no shame  
And I got no fear  
And I bow down  
To the tears of a clown  
Whatever's going down  
Is coming around  
I hope you don't regret today  
  
For the rest of your lives
