There aint no reason you and me should be alone  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
I've got a reason that you who should take me home tonight  
  
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong  
  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Right on the limits where we no we both belong tonight  
  
It's hard to feel the rush  
To push the dangerous,  
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge  
Where we can both fall over in love  
I'm on the edge, of glory  
And I'm hanging on the moment of truth  
I'm on the edge  
The edge x6
