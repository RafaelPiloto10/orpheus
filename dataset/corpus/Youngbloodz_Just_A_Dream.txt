It ain't a thang in this world that's gonna knock me off my feet  
As I unleash total chaos into the streets  
For I observe these dirty words whispering' through your mouth  
So I now I take it you the big dog about the south  
Oh really now, though whose to say that we won't never make it  
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it  
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk, no matter what  
Now who the fuck, just al nut, it's a must for you to get crushed  
So don't rush to get dat' change  
You'd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame  
For everything ain't everything when times are gettin' rough  
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin' bluff  
Now nigga what, yeah  
Oh, a lot of hatin' went on doing this thang here  
Folks just swore we wasn't finna' put it down for the A-town  
You know what I'm saying? I ain't gotta call no names  
Cause you know who you are  
You know what I'm sayin'  
All I got to say to all of y'all is...  
You can't keep nobody from the Attic down  
Know what I'm sayin', and that's on the floor  
Yea, it's me, remember me from back in the day  
The same ol' nigga you thought wouldn't get paid  
Look at me now nigga, shit done changed  
Ain't no mo' gettin' wet in the rain  
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain  
Sho' nuff' you can hear, but you can't feel me man  
And it's a damn shame, we go through what we do  
Playa hatin' while I'm chillin' on the avenue  
Can't hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew  
that's for trill on the blow, straight from me to you  
Better listen up now, cause ain't no tellin' what's next  
The dem' between real and the ones that flex  
All in your face grinnin' when you cash that check  
But when they get down and dirty it's like "fuck dat' bitch"  
Ass nigga, so how you figga' I was wrong  
Got a baby, and a crib to keep clothes on  
Long time ago, way before the grind  
Trouble had become a friend of mine  
You off up in my head, its just a matter of time  
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine  
Like dem' folks open face off in yo' grill  
I ain't tryin' to be greedy, I'm just tryin' to live  
Now that the picture clear, and you know what I mean  
Being broke all again slick it's just a dream
