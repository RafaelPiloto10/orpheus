I was the boy unwanted, a prisoner I'm born to them  
My brother was the one, that couldn't do no wrong  
And I was there dying in the shadow of him  
  
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?  
Feel the strap, cross my back  
Yeah I'm the new whipping boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Who am I - the orphan son you would never need?  
Who am I - cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees  
Who am I - the slave you gave just the air I breathe?  
Who am I - cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees  
  
Oh I got the same old reruns, horror movies in my head  
And I can't rest, the scare me to death  
But if I'm not alive, how can I be dead?  
  
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?  
Feel the strap, cross my back  
Yeah I'm the new whipping boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, why me?  
  
Why him?  
  
Can you tell me?  
  
It's confession again?  
Come talk to me, I see in your eyes  
Titanic misery, ashamed that you're alive  
I'm the face that you see  
When the face isn't yours  
I'm the mirror my boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some people never go crazy  
What truly boring lives they must lead  
Is there no love to shelter me?  
Only love, love sets me free
