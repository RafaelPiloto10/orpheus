O love that will not let me go  
I rest my weary soul in thee  
I give thee back the life I owe  
That in thine ocean depths its flow  
My richer, fuller be  
  
O light that followest all my way  
I yield my flickering torch to thee  
My heart restores its borrowed ray  
That in thy sunshines glow its day  
May brighter, fairer be  
  
O joy you seek me through the pain  
I cannot close my heart to thee  
I trace the rainbow through the rain  
And feel the promise is not vain  
Then morn shall tearless be
