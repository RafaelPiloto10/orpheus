To whom it may concern  
You found another love I know  
To whom it may concern  
My heart won't ever let you go  
You tore my heart apart  
When you found somebody new  
But you found out that your heart could be broken too  
So to whom it may concern  
You've learned that heartache has no pride  
  
Pretending unconcerned won't stop those tears you try to hide  
And when you're all alone with just a memory  
That's when I'll bet you'll learn the one who's most concerned is me  
And when you're all alone with just a memory  
  
That's when I'll bet you'll learn the one who's most concerned is me
