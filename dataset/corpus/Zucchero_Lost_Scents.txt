Heading homeward, home I cannot find, oh love  
Heading home yet I'm lost inside the night  
I may be strong but without you I may fall, oh love  
Betrayed and lost now I cannot hear you call  
  
I will seek you longer  
'Til your scent grows stronger  
  
Still I wish you here as I've been  
Lost for a long, long, long time  
Lost in the rain  
I'm growin' so tired  
  
Still I wish you here as  
I'm lost in the lone, lone, lone night  
Erasin' me, erasin' my world  
  
The night is open a door I will not close to you  
I wait outside and long for a taste of home  
So call out louder than this wind may blow, oh love  
Betrayed and lost now I feel my hunger grow  
  
I will seek you longer  
'Til your scent grows stronger  
  
Still I wish you here as I've been  
Lost for a long, long, long time  
Lost in the rain I'm growin' so tired  
  
Still I wish you here as I'm  
Lost in the lone, lone, lone night  
Erasin' me, erasin' my world  
  
I will seek you longer  
For you scent I hunger  
  
Come here, come on  
Tonight's open for you and I  
A night of tender petting  
Of doors open wide  
  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
  
(I need somebody to love)  
Amore in mano al vento  
(I need somebody to love)  
Lost in the rain  
(I need somebody to love)  
I'm growin' so tired  
(I need somebody to love)  
  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)  
  
I need somebody to love  
(I need somebody to love)
