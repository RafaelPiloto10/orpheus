[Verse 1]  
They might just lock me up for sound abuse  
Bite like a brown recluse, I found a noose  
that grips the ground tight enough to break a town a loose  
Reach back and smack you cause you questioned my validity  
It took a month for my hand to hit him cause my swing started in Italy  
I'm finna diss my nemesis, till he's removed from the premises  
I'm a twisted chemist with brain cells that are limitless  
The mic chord strangles, a life of course dangles  
My inner-changeable language hangs with a snake by your ankles  
We can do this for fun or we can make bets  
I break necks with threats while your cassetts get regurgetated from tape
decks  
You can't digest my words the first time, so you rewind  
I'll write a verse across your brain and let the people read your mind  
You're tryna get at me, not knowin my words are crushin the South  
The style I left so super sick, it left preachers cussin you out  
Your stumbelin, over my words that will leave your skin crumbelin  
All they found was his mouth on the ground hoppin and mumblin  
... I'm The One!  
[Chorus]  
I'm The One, not the 2 or the 3  
I'm the aggravated lyricist straight of the S.P.C. (South Park Coalition)  
I'm The One, not the three or the fo'  
Y'all get knocked out of the frame tryin to step to K-Rino  
[Verse 2]  
I love to release with steel my hollows fool  
My knowledge left scholars bruised  
My esophagus rockets fumes, solid pools of kinetic acidic molecules  
I'm never rattled, in hand, lyric or gun battle  
I strattled hurds of untamed cattle with one sattle  
Dyin from the pain, tried to complain, but see I knew it mane  
Once a month I take out my brain and let the fluid drain  
Battelin me is like you and your girlfriend so you resent it  
Cause when
