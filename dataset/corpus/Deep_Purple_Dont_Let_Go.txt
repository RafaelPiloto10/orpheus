I get lost on a regular basis  
I'm not alone I see the same old faces  
Back on the road it's a worthy opponent  
I get home in the heat of the moment  
  
What's that stuff always rise to the surface  
College cream, it always emerges  
Be what you are I tell myself  
And myself tells me we can't be anybody else  
  
You always sleep with a smile on your face  
Much as I want to put myself in your place  
Not my business I've got dreams of my own  
I try to recall but when I wake up it's gone  
  
Don't let go of that image  
You'll never see it again  
  
I can hear voices they're buzzing in my head  
Eyebrows raised was it something I said  
A long hot night, it crept in like a thief  
The engine stopped, the seat belt popped  
And her jaw dropped in disbelief  
  
Don't let go of that beast  
You'll never see it again  
  
Don't let go of that whiskey bottle  
You'll never see it again
