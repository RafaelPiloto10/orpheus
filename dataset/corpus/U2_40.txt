(Sing this with me, this is 40)  
  
I waited patiently for the Lord  
He inclined and heard my cry  
He lift me up out of the pit  
Out of the mire and clay  
  
I will sing, sing a new song  
I will sing, sing a new song  
  
How long to sing this song?  
How long to sing this song?  
How long...how long...how long...  
How long...to sing this song  
  
He set my feet upon a rock  
And made my footsteps firm  
Many will see  
Many will see and hear  
  
I will sing, sing a new song  
I will sing, sing a new song  
  
(Sing it!)  
  
How long to sing this song?  
How long to sing this song?  
How long...how long...how long...  
How long...to sing this song
