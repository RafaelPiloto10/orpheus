You've got a smile so bright  
You know, you could've been a candle  
I'm holding you so tight  
You know, you could've been a handle  
The way you swept me off my feet  
You know, you could've been a broom  
The way you smell so sweet  
You know, you could've been some perfume  
Well, you could've been anything  
That you wanted to and I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
(The way you do the things you do,  
The way you do the things you do)  
As pretty as you are  
You know, you could've been a flower  
If good looks can cause a minute  
You know that you could be an hour  
The way you stole my heart  
You know, you could've been a cool crook  
And baby, you're so smart  
You know, you could've been a schoolbook  
Well, you could've been anything  
That you wanted to and I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
(The way you do the things you do,  
The way you do the things you do)  
You made my life so rich  
You know, you could've been some money  
And baby, you're so sweet  
You know, you could've been some honey  
Well, you could've been anything  
That you wanted to and I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
(The way you do the things you do)  
You really swept me off my feet  
(The way you do the things you do)  
You made my life complete  
(The way you do the things you do)  
You made my life so bright  
(The way you do the things you do)  
You make me feel all right...
