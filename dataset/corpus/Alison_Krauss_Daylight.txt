Daylight falls  
And I'm lost in the big parade  
Hold my hand, darling  
I'm afraid of the daylight  
  
Shade is dark  
Cool and languid for life or long  
Safe in shadow,  
It's never as dark as the daylight  
As the daylight  
  
When I was just knee high  
My momma told me never try to be  
Someone that I am not  
Yet over time I had forgot  
A wandering child, so lost at play  
He's found himself,  
But he can't find his way  
In the daylight, oh the daylight  
Oh daylight, oh daylight  
  
Life is short  
And there's no turning back the time  
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb  
In that daylight  
  
In my mind  
There's a corner I need to turn  
Lessons left is a lesson learned  
In the daylight  
In the daylight  
  
I miss the forest shade  
That took me there  
The promise I made  
Can never leave the dark so dear  
Safe and soothing yet I fear  
As I recall and I reflect  
I see it's safer to connect  
To the daylight  
Oh the daylight  
Oh daylight, oh daylight  
  
Daylight falls  
And I'm lost in the big parade  
Hold my hand darling, I'm afraid  
Of the daylight, of the day ...
