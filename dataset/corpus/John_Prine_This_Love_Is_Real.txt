I can taste your lipstick in the wine  
I can feel your heartbeat close to mine  
With your love wrapped around me  
I'm silent and still  
I know that this love is real  
I have tasted other lips I thought were true  
I have looked into the eyes I thought were you  
Now touching just to touch  
And feeling just to feel  
I know that this love is real  
Someone should tell our dreams when love is gone  
While still in slumber memories linger one  
Sometimes I lie awake in bed till dawn  
Thinking of you  
Now you're gone  
Tender is the heart that sleeps in rest  
Tender is the hope of tenderness  
Love thy neighbor as thyself  
And thou shall not steal  
I know that this love is real  
Love thy neighbor as thyself  
And thou shall not steal  
I know that this love is real
