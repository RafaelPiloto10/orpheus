If you've got love in your sights  
Watch out, love bites  
When you make love, do you look in your mirror?  
Who do you think of?  
Does he look like me?  
Do you tell lies?  
And say that it's forever?  
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?  
Ooh babe  
Ooh yeah  
When you're alone, do you let go?  
Are you wild 'n' willing or is it just for show?  
Ooh come on  
  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
I know you think that love is the way you make it  
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it  
No!  
  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
It's no surprise  
(Love begs, love pleads)  
  
It's what I need  
When I'm with you are you somewhere else?  
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?  
When you wake up will you walk out?  
It can't be love if you throw it about  
Ooh babe  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
Oh  
  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
It's no surprise  
(Love begs, love pleads)  
It's what I need  
Ooh yeah  
  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
I know you think that love is the way you make it  
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it  
No!  
  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
It's no surprise  
(Love begs, love pleads)  
It's what I need  
If you've got love in your sights  
Watch out, love bites  
Yes it does  
It will be hell
