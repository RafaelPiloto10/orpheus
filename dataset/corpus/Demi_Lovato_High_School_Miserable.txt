I know that you think that this is probably my fault!  
(We do!)  
The catty comments, and the constant assaults!  
(It's cool!)  
I was here once, and seen a lot!  
So listen if you wanna survive  
  
Inside this High School Miserable  
I never thought I'd be invisible  
In this High School Miserable  
You gotta keep being indivisible  
In this High School Miserable  
Don't understand what is happening to me  
In this High School Miserable  
Someone get me back on tv!  
  
I thought the girls here would go crazy for me  
I flubbed a test, I'm clearly getting a D  
I never knew how high my undies would go  
There's tons of wedgies, I didn't know  
Like the the hoodie the Hourglass (ow!)  
The 360 spin! (that hurt)  
The fig leg, The bat the bowling pin (strike)  
The donkey, The monkey, man am I sore  
I can't believe their's 28 more  
Neat!  
  
Someone get me back on tv
