If I lose this dream  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
If I lose this dream  
I'm dreaming about for me and you  
  
If it goes away  
I might as well hang it up  
'Cause I don't know  
If I have the heart or mind  
To make it true  
Or help it grow  
And I only know, I only know, I only know  
  
If I lose this dream  
It's goodbye love and happiness, yes  
You're the one I need  
I don't want a love  
That's second best  
There've been all of my life  
I wanted to do  
That made me blue  
  
Help me hold onto this dream  
For sometimes dreams often come true  
And they all come true, they all come true  
For me and you  
Wait a minute baby  
  
Don't let me lose this dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me lose my dream, no  
Baby, baby be strong  
  
You say that a-you believe that what I say is true  
And that I'm the one and only girl for you  
Just tell me  
That no matter what the people say  
You're in my corner all the way  
And I won't lose this dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me lose my dream, no  
Baby, baby be strong  
  
Don't let me lose this dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me lose, lose my dream  
Baby, baby hold on  
Don't let me, ooh baby
