How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
  
This little Bluebird came looking for you  
I said that I hadn't seen you in quite some time  
This little Bluebird, she came looking again  
I said we weren't even friends she could have you  
  
Don't you think it was hard?  
I didn't even say that you died  
But it wouldn't have been such a lie  
'Cause then I started to cry  
  
This little Bluebird sure won't give it a rest  
She swears that you may be better than all the rest  
I said no-oh  
You've got it all wrong  
If he was something special, I wouldn't have this song  
  
Don't you think it was hard?  
I didn't even say that you died  
But it wouldn't have been such a lie  
'Cause then I started to cry  
  
How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart?  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba  
  
What if when she comes over I am in your arms?  
Taking all I want from you again  
  
(Ba ba ba ba)  
  
How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
  
How the hell does a broken heart  
Get back together when it's torn apart  
Teach itself to start  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
Beating again ba ba ba ba  
  
This little bluebird don't come 'round here anymore  
So I went looking for her  
And I found  
You
