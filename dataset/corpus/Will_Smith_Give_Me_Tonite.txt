[Verse 1 (Will Smith)]  
Uh, check, check  
Yo, yo, yo  
Across the room shared a little gaze with me  
Crazy mama how your scent played with me  
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking  
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking  
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me  
Didn't even say nothing I felt you want to dance with me  
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand  
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man  
I put my finger up don't say nothing  
He ain't here is he? We can play or something  
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him  
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him  
Us could be just a weekend thing  
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma  
Look we can have everything else  
But for tonight let me have you for myself  
Girl holla at me  
  
[Chorus (Tra-Knox)]  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Just give me tonight  
You can have the rest of your life  
Just give me tonight, give me tonight  
  
[Verse 2 (Will Smith)]  
Whoop! Whoop!  
Big Will coming through like  
Whoop! Whoop!  
Tra-Knox coming through with  
Whoop! Whoop!  
East girls off the hook ain't they  
Right, right  
  
[Tra-Knox]  
Baby girl  
You know exactly what I want  
No I'm not trying to replace your man  
I just want one night to you all over  
Baby girl  
This our secret rondevue  
Look in my eyes I'm telling you  
All I'm tryin' to do is change your view  
For a moment or two  
Baby girl  
I don't want to break up your happy home  
Baby I don't want to be alone  
So let me jump in the zone  
Can't you feel the Jones  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3 (Will Smith)]  
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long  
Give me a quarter-inch that's all I'm asking  
Do the math I'm the sun you the earth  
Its you-N-I-verse and its the worst  
Cause I thirst to tape connect her  
I know you got a life momma  
Trust me I don't want to bring your life drama  
I can barely hear my think slide with me  
Dip out the side door take a ride with me  
Let me hear about (Uh)  
What you think about (Uh)  
What you need to do (Uh)  
The things you dream about  
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at  
Let it ring ma call him back  
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you  
Am I goin' be at home alone with a glass slipper  
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella  
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella  
  
[Chorus: x2]
