All the creatures,  
On the beaches,  
Making waves in a motion picture.  
Wont you keep this,  
In between us,  
Search and seizure, wake up Venus.  
  
The dollar bill will,  
Mentally ill bill,  
Mum and dad take your 'don't be sad' pill.  
Turn the screw and,  
Twist my language,  
Don't forsake me I'm contagious.  
  
There's a reason for the twenty first century,  
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be,  
And that it's meant to be.  
  
It's my favorite,  
Combination,  
Coming down with the favored nations.  
Deep rotation,  
Mutilation,  
Learn to give and take dictation.  
  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh,  
Like a Cain and Abel.  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh,  
It's time to run this table.  
  
There's a reason for the twenty first century,  
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be,  
And that it's meant to be.  
  
Read me your scripture now,  
Read me your scripture,  
Read me your scripture and I will twist it.  
  
Show me your wrist and I,  
Show me your wrist and,  
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it.  
  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh,  
Like a Cain and Abel.  
Oh, oh oh, oh oh,  
It's time to run this table.  
  
Simple soldier,  
Hand it over,  
Stop and read what you just wrote her.  
Strangulation,  
Altercation,  
Oral sex and bird migration.  
  
There's a reason for the twenty first century,  
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be,  
And that it's meant to be.  
  
There's a reason for the twenty first century,  
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be,  
And that it's meant to be.
