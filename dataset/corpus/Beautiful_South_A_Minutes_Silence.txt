With a minute's silence for the dead  
And a minute's silence for the long-lost lovers  
No one's really in the mood for beer  
  
With a minute's silence for the child  
And a minute's silence for the grieving mothers  
There's not much talking going down here  
  
With a minute's silence for the girl  
With a minute's silence for the younger brother  
Things have never been so clear  
  
With a minute's silence for your friend  
With a minute's silence for your long-lost folk  
A minute's silence lasts a year  
  
A minute's silence seems a year  
  
And the park is filled with pain  
For this age has laid it's claim  
And the street's about to cry  
Cos it longs for passers-by  
It longs for passers-by
