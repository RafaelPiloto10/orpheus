Check, uh huh  
Check check y'all  
  
Yo Whitey Ford's the name  
The Hunchback of Notre Dame  
Couldn't get more bent when it's time to represent  
I control it like rent in a slum tenement  
Life's hard like some men in the concrete jungle  
I don't smoke jumbo so what you knocking for  
There's locks on my door we rock from the floor  
To the ceiling ain't no drug dealing  
Ain't no gat peeling, you can't fight this feeling  
  
Well, My style's golden, hot like molten rock  
Niggers come bold but leave here holding jock  
High roll patrol, roll through the set on fifth  
Arm's solo, sipping ?molo with a chick  
Niggers take the penitentiary chances at the dances  
Letting off shots, lit off the lanterns  
Mad cause a nigga can't test with no access  
To 'phatness' like this  
  
From one story the cowboy was founded  
I'm surrounded by Casual, and Whitey Ford, the whole world and your girl  
  
From the Bay to LA to my blue end while  
I ain't trying to die, I'm trying to live while I cool out  
And pick up my daughter when the bell says the school out  
Who the hell brought tools in this peaceful event  
Now I can love you, front you, or we could hunt you  
You played too close, take a hit of this dose  
  
A yes, yes, y'all  
A freak, freak, yo  
So fresh y'all  
  
A to the beat y'all  
A yes, yes, y'all  
We don't stop, dog  
Everlast: We keep it rocking till the panties drop, yo  
  
Uh-huh, ha, I see the rappers being ruined by you and whoever is doing that
Crap,  
They got me booin', in fact, I'm gettin' to 'em  
May a electrical, poetical surge give me the urge  
To, consume, the tomb and submerge  
The depths of adverbs, ?  
Analytical, you pitiful trick  
I'm the pinnacle and the prodigal, rhyme style's  
Hip nautical, fuck the article, the artist is hardest to harvest the  
Hard shit  
  
I slave till all my work is done  
I'm cashing in, stack up my money for a grand set  
I like them all house parties rocking, plus I'm up in your ?  
Bitch, turn your head and keep your eyes where they supposed to be  
  
Supposedly, I was seen with something lean, huh  
Brown skin, I keep it bouncing  
I say lounging, on the side with red wine  
I know that shit on my floor ain't swine  
  
Now back it up, stack it up and hit me one more time  
It might be your phone call, but check it, it's my dime  
And I know she's fine but get off my line  
Or I'll break that spine and then maybe your face  
  
You all up in my space like with Puffy and Mase  
But that's just not the case 'cause I'm setting the pace  
While you following and swallowing, savoring the flavor  
In your 40 open now, quick suckin' my style  
  
[Chorus]  
Rock on, to the break of dawn  
Just freak it, ah yeah baby  
Rock on, to the break of dawn  
Just freak it, ah yeah baby  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Cause it's the funky beat  
Cause it's the funky beat  
Cause it's the funk, the funk, the funk, funky beat (beat)  
  
I'll leave a piece of my style flying high up in the air  
And you'll say to yourself, 'damn I'm glad I was there'  
This is as rare as me fricking share  
You people stare  
But behind closed doors you will take it there  
  
Yeah, I be the extraordinary  
Judge from Bay fare to Albee Square  
Tell me where the party at, I'll be there  
Let her hit the coney at, show her where to rock the pony at  
  
I be the man with the large amounts of sapphire fare  
I'm about to cut loose my dog so you all best beware  
You can dance with flare and get out of your chair  
We be smarter than your average boo boo bear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Cause it's the funky beat  
Cause it's the funky beat  
Cause it's the funk, the funk, the funk, funky beat (beat)
