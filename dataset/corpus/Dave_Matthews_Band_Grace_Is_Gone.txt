Neon shines through smokey eyes tonight  
It's 2 A. M. I'm drunk again  
And it's heavy on my mind  
  
I could never love again  
So much as I love you  
Where you end, where I begin  
Is like a river running through  
  
Take my eyes, take my heart  
I need them no more  
If never again I fall upon the one I so adore  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
  
One drink to remember  
Then another to forget  
How could I ever dream to find  
Sweet love like you again  
One drink to remember  
Then another to forget  
  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
One more drink and I'll be gone  
  
You think of things impossible  
Then the sun refuse to shine  
I walk with you beside me  
Your cold hand lay in mine  
  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll go  
Excuse me please, one more drink  
Could you make it strong  
Cause I don't need to think  
She broke my heart  
My grace is gone  
One more drink and I'll move on  
One more drink and I'll be gone  
One more drink my grace is gone
