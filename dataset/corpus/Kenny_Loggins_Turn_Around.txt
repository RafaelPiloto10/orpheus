Where are you going my little one, little one  
Where are you going my baby, my own  
Turn around and you're two  
Turn around and you're four  
Turn around and you're a young girl  
Going out of the door  
  
Turn around  
Turn around  
Turn around and you're a young girl  
Going out of the door  
  
Where are you going my little one, little one  
Little pigtails and petticoats  
Where have you gone  
Turn around and you're tiny  
Turn around and you're grown  
Turn around and you're a young wife  
With babes of your own  
  
Turn around  
Turn around  
Turn around and you're a young wife  
With babes of your own  
  
Where are you going my little one, little one  
Where are you going my baby, my own
