When you're a boy  
Some days are tough  
Lying on your bed  
Playing punk rock and stuff  
Home is a boot camp  
You gotta escape  
Want to go and wander  
In the ticker-tape  
You feel the deals is real  
You're a New York City boy  
So young, so run  
Into New York City  
  
New York City boy  
You'll never have a bored day  
Cause you're a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
  
The street is amazing  
The hoochies unreal  
Check out all the hardware  
At the latest deal  
Hear a song  
That's the bomb!  
If you don't get the mix  
It's gone eighty-six  
You feel the deal is real  
You're in New York City  
  
New York City boy  
You'll never have a bored day  
Cause you're a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
New York City boy  
This is your reward day  
Cause you're a New York  
City boy  
Where Seventh Avenue  
Meets Broadway  
  
Then as the evening falls  
You can return its calls  
  
You feel the deal is real  
You're a New York City boy  
So young, so run  
Into New York City
