One. One perfect lie.  
Was it told too soon?  
And one, one perfect life  
Turned to stone  
Cold mercy  
  
I kneel down by your grave  
I kneel down torn and guilty  
  
Did I let you down,  
Say goodbye too soon?  
And did you understand  
My mistake?  
Forgive me  
  
I kneel down by your side  
I kneel down scared and helpless  
  
One perfect lie  
Wrapped in kindness and tears  
I wish I believed in your heaven  
One perfect life  
Led by blind faith and trust  
If God has a heart he will find you  
  
I'm torn and guilty  
I'm torn and guilty  
I'm torn and guilty
