You're the one that makes my day  
A dream come true  
Yet and still you wonder  
If I think of you  
You ought to see how the other girls behave  
When you're not around  
And only then you would know  
That it's on your finger I'm wound  
  
Uh-huh  
  
Chorus:  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
If you were there you'd know  
That I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Cause it's by your side girl  
That I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends  
When I don't have much to say  
But what you don't know is with you  
I could never act that way  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
I care for you baby  
  
I swear that I care  
  
There's no need for you not to have faith in me  
Cause it's by you're side girl  
That I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends  
When I don't have much to say (Uh-huh)  
But what you don't know is with you  
I could never act that way  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
I care for you baby  
  
I swear that I care for you baby  
I do  
Have faith in me  
  
I care for you baby  
  
Oh-oh
