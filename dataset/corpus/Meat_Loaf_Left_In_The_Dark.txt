You don't need to sneak in the door just come on in to the room  
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone  
I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you  
There's been no reason to move, it's been as still as a tomb  
I needed you oh so badly tonight but I guess you had better things to do  
  
I should have know that it was coming to this  
But I must have been blind  
I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes  
And you still got his eyes on your mind  
You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock  
Now it's a quarter to 3.  
Well whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
Whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!  
But don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again  
  
I should have know that it was coming to this  
But I must have been blind  
I bet you still got a trace of his love in your eyes  
And you still got his eyes on your mind  
You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock  
Now it's a quarter to 3.  
Well whatever you got and whoever it was  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
I guess you couldn't get it from me  
  
But down in my soul - down in my soul I know  
I know that you love me, there's no need to talk  
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof  
And there are no lies on your body, so take off your dress  
I just want to get at the truth  
And there are so many things that I just got to know  
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!  
But don't tell me now, I don't need any answers tonight  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
I just need some love, so turn out the lights  
And I'll be left in the dark again  
Left in the dark again
