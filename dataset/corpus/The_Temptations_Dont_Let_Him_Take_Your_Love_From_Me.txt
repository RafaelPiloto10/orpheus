Hmm, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new  
'Cause I can feel his presence, whenever I'm a kissing you  
How can you ask me to try, try and understand  
Well, just put yourself in my place  
Go on, just see if you can  
  
I'm a begging you (Don't, don't you let him)  
Baby, please (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
I'm begging you, baby (Don't, don't you let him)  
Oh no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
  
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear  
But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear, huh  
My love are like mountains  
That's how strong it is for you  
If you ever walk away in to his arms  
Which will surely break my heart in two  
  
I'm begging you (Don't, don't you let him)  
Oh no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Baby, baby, I'm begging (Don't, don't you let him)  
No, no, no, no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Oh, I couldn't stand it, baby  
  
If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair  
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there  
Now, I'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me  
  
Baby, please (Don't, don't you let him)  
Oh no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Baby, baby, please (Don't, don't you let him)  
I couldn't stand it (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
I ain't too proud to beg (Don't, don't you let him)
