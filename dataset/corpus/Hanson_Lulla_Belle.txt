Lulla Belle won the big show  
Got her picture framed by the window  
In the hall where lovely girls go  
Lulla Belle goes, Lulla Belle no  
  
Lulla Belle, no, no, no, no, no  
Lulla Belle, no, ooh, oh, oh, ooh  
  
Beauty queen that you are  
Put you down for a place in the stars  
Take your picture for all the world to see  
  
Lulla Belle' s leaving the ball  
No more reason to stay  
Or people to see  
Cos everyone here knows your name  
From the light on your face  
In the frame that hangs  
In the hall where lovely girls go  
Lulla Belle goes, Lulla Belle no  
  
Lulla Belle, no, no, no, no, no  
Lulla Belle, no, ooh, oh, oh, ooh
