What child is this who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping  
Whom angels greet with anthem sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
This is Christ the Lord  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
  
Why lies he in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding  
Good Christian fear, for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading  
  
This is Christ the Lord  
Whom shepards guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrh  
Come peasant king to own Him  
The King of Kings, salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
This is Christ the Lord  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary
