It's just too easy to hide in these trees  
Rust in this water up to your knees  
Not many dreamers ever get out alive  
Some kind of sickness sleeps in this town  
I barely got out, but so many drown  
The more you struggle,  
The faster you're gonna sink  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx  
You're beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  
Baby, baby, it's a long way down  
They want to be there when you hit the ground  
You gotta shake it right in their face and smile  
And when you've got 'em right in the palm of your hand  
You don't need 'em 'cause you understand  
So you turn slowly and you give the boys one last wink  
And then...  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx  
You're beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  
  
You gotta face the fools who put sand in the gears  
You gotta shake a fist at a thousand different fears  
You gotta break it, fake it  
But never let 'em know what you think  
While...  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx  
You're beating the odds by the skin of your teeth
