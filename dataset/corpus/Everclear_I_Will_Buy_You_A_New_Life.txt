Here is the money that I owe you  
Yes you can pay the bills  
I will give you more  
When I get paid again  
  
I hate those people who love to tell you  
Money is the root of all that kills  
They have never been poor  
They have never had the joy of a welfare christmas  
  
I know we will never look back  
  
You say you wake up crying  
Yes and you don't know why  
You get up and you go lay down  
Inside my baby's room  
  
Yeah, I guess I'm doing OK  
I moved in with the strangest guy  
Can you believe he actually thinks  
That I am really alive  
  
I will buy you a garden  
Where your flowers can bloom  
I will buy you a new car  
Perfect shiny and new  
I will buy you that big house  
Way up in the west hills  
I will buy you a new life  
Yes I will  
  
Yes, I know all about that other guy  
The handsome man with athletic thighs  
I know about all the time before  
With that obsessive little rich boy  
  
They might make you think you're happy  
Yeah maybe for a minute or two  
They can't make you laugh  
No they can't make you feel the way that I do  
  
I will buy you a garden  
Where your flowers can bloom  
I will buy you a new car  
Perfect shiny and new  
I will buy you that big house  
Way up in the west hills  
I will buy you a new life  
I will buy you a new life  
  
I know we can never look back  
  
Will you please let me stay the night  
Will you please let me stay the night  
No one will ever know  
  
I will buy you a garden  
Where your flowers can bloom  
I will buy you a new car  
Perfect shiny and new  
I will buy you that big house  
Way up in the west hills  
I will buy you a new life  
  
I will buy you a garden  
Where your flowers can bloom  
I will buy you a new car  
Perfect shiny and new  
I will buy you that big house  
Way up in the west hills  
I will buy you a new life  
  
I will buy you a new life  
I will buy you a new life  
  
I will buy you a new life  
I will buy you a new life  
  
I will buy you a new life  
I will buy you a new life
