Early in the morning, before the daylight  
I hear the sound of thunder, comin' through in the night  
I lie awake and I wonder , where my life is goin'  
Am I on a road leadin' nowhere, there's no way of knowin'  
'Cause I've seen the lightning  
And I'm ready for the rain to fall  
  
Now I'm standin' on a mountain, lookin' into the sky  
I see the clouds come rollin' in, water fills my eyes  
I don't know what's in the future, no one can say  
Don't want to think about the past, I've gotta live for today  
'Cause I've seen the lightnin' now  
I need to find my own way, while I've still got time  
  
And I'm ready for the rain to fall  
'Cause I've heard the thunder  
And I'm ready for the rain to fall  
I'm ready, ready for the rain  
I've got to rise above it all  
And get ready for the rain to fall  
  
Did you ever know someone, who had lost their way  
Built their own little kingdom, and just blew it all away  
I'm not ashamed to admit it, that someone was me  
I'm gonna look to the future now, 'cause I've set myself free  
And I've seen the lightnin'  
I'm gonna set myself free, while I've still got time  
  
Get ready for the rain to fall  
'Cause I've heard the thunder  
And I'm ready for the rain to fall  
I'm ready, ready for the rain  
I've got to rise above it all  
And get ready for the rain to fall, while I've still got time....  
[Repeat chorus]
