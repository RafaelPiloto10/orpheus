At the first sign of the morning light  
Old Glory is in the sky  
Cross the pond it's afternoon and the Union Jack flies high  
We're on our first cup of coffee, we're on our third cup of tea  
We can't pretend to live on different planets, you and me  
In this collision of worlds, watch the new day dawn on a distant shore  
In this collision of worlds, oh you can't sit this out no more  
  
Abbey Road, Route 66, cia to the mi6, right lane, left lane  
Metric, Imperial, pounds, dollars, howdy, cheerio  
V8 growl to a V12 scream, Hail to the Chief, well God Save the Queen  
Cops, bobbies, tabasco, wasabi, pistachio ice cream!  
In this collision of worlds, it's too late you can't stop it now  
In this collision of worlds, yeah, find your place and just watch it now,
watch it now  
  
Yeah you're a good old boy, well you're at decent bloke  
I say it's irony, I say it's a joke  
When I look around now I can see  
We ain't so different, you and me  
  
Meat and potatoes, bangers and mash  
Dollars, pounds, dosh, cash, autobahn to the rising sun  
The I10 to the M1, Congress, Parliament, president, the queen  
Petrol you say, gasoline now grab your bird and get your girl now  
It's a small world  
Collision of worlds, watch the new day dawn on a distant shore  
In this collision of worlds, no you can't sit this out no more  
It's a collision of worlds  
It's too late, you can't stop it now  
Collision of worlds find your place and watch it now, watch it now
