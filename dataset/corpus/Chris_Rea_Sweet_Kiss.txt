I lie awake, late at night  
I just don't seem to sleep at all  
Got so high, don't I know why  
Said man I got that Moon-dog call  
Stepping out into the street  
  
Gonna dance till my legs fall off  
Mister policeman say "what's wrong with you  
Why you behaving this way?"  
I said I'm hung on her sweet kiss  
  
My mama told me that the day would come  
So I don't need no alibi  
The judge looked down with a pointed frown  
And said "boy you got to explain why"  
Out on the street, late at night  
Dancing like a crazy fool  
Laughing and singing, what's wrong with you?  
Why you behaving this way?  
I said I'm hung on her sweet kiss  
  
And all the boys they're gonna laugh  
And all the girls gonna talk in class  
But I don't care, there's just no way  
I'm gonna let this feeling fade away  
I said I'm hung on her sweet kiss
