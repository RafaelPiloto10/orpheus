Your love is nothing I can't fight  
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine  
  
I'm in the bedroom,  
With tissues and when,  
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in  
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world  
And I'm a hard girl,  
Loving me is like chewing on pearls  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
Won't go without my fix tonight  
It's a little too rough  
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines  
And she can't get enough  
  
I'm in the bedroom  
With tissues and when,  
I know you're outside banging that I won't let you in  
'Cause it's a hard life, with love in the world  
And I'm a hard girl  
Loving me is like straightening curls  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
I'm shiny and I know it,  
Don't know why you wanna blow it,  
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough.  
  
I'm shiny and I know it,  
Don't know why you wanna blow it,  
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough.  
  
Is it because you don't mean it?  
Or because I don't feel it?  
Yes it's rough.  
  
Is it because you don't mean it?  
Or because I don't feel it?  
Yes it's rough.  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough  
  
You've got me wandering why I  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough I,  
I like it rough
