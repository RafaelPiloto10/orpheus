And the beat goes on  
I'm a happy girl  
It's my birthday song  
In my happy world

Oh yeah, today is my birthday

In my happy world (In my happy world)  
  
Light my candles  
Gotta make a wish  
Wrap up the present  
And seal it with a kiss  
Give me a spanking  
Start the day off right (Ooh wee!)  
Cause it's my day  
You're gonna sing my song tonight

There's no hangover  
So grab your things you better come over  
We get high and we still stay sober  
We throw it down  
And then we gonna start over  
My type of party  
There's no hangover  
  
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on)  
I'm a happy girl (I'm a happy girl)  
It's my birthday song (Oh yeah, it's my birthday)  
In my happy world (In my happy world)  
  
I want a diamond  
Don't give me a fake (That's what I said)

The frosting off my cake (Yeah)
