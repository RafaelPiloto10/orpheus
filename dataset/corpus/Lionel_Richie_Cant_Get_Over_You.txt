I guess I need to say I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you  
I only wanted just to love you  
But now that were through I can't get over you.  
I didn't mean to write a love song  
I didn't mean to share these feeling I have in my heart  
I told myself I could forget you  
Now I know that's not true, I can't get over you.  
And as I walk down through the halls  
I see your pictures hanging on the walls, those memories  
For all the thing that we've been through  
My heart can still feel me and you  
Sweet memories.  
After the pain of losing you  
After the heartache, I know it's true  
Cause when I saw you, I still can say,  
I'm never gonna love anybody else the way I love you today.  
I guess I need to say I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you  
I only want just to love you  
But now that were through I can't get over you.  
I can't get over you  
I can't get.... over you  
Noooo,  
No, nooo  
Know my heart is breaking baby  
Can't get you out of my mind  
Tried so hard to love you  
Ooooh baby  
Now you gone, now you gone, you gone away  
Got my heart in my hand  
You and me baby  
We got a thing going on  
Ooooh baby
