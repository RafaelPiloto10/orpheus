Once I made a man all out of snow  
He had the darkest eyes and a button nose  
I told him all my sadness and my fear  
And he just listened with a snowy ear  
  
But when I came around the next day  
My friend had gone and melted all away  
I saw his eyes lying on the ground  
I made a sound that was something like crying  
  
Oh, one day you will go away from this  
Oh, one day you will know we're men of snow  
We melt one day  
  
And winters come and my love, the winters go  
And time stacks up in piles like winter snow  
And everything you love and hold so dear  
Won't really matter when we disappear  
  
Oh, one day you will go away from this  
Oh, one day you will know we're men of snow  
We melt one day  
  
Oh, one day you will go away from this  
Oh, one day you will know we're men of snow  
We melt, you know, we're men of snow  
We melt one day
