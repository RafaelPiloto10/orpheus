Ms. Maggie M'Gill,  
She lived on a hill.  
Her daddy got drunk  
And left her the will.  
  
So she went down,  
Down to Tangie Town.  
People down there  
Really like to get it on.  
  
Now if you're sad,  
And you're feeling blue.  
  
Go out and buy a  
Brand new pair of shoes.  
  
And you go down,  
Dow to Tangie Town.  
Cause people down there  
Really like to get it on.  
Get it on.  
  
Illegitimate son  
Of a Rock n' Roll star.  
Illegitimate son  
Of a Rock n' Roll star.  
  
Mom met dad in the back  
Of a Rock n' Roll car.  
  
Well, I'm an old blues man  
And I think that you understand.  
I've been singing the blues  
Ever since the world began.  
  
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie M'Gill.  
Roll on, roll on, Maggie M'Gill.
