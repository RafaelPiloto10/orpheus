Well this old world can get you down  
And leave you spinning 'round and 'round  
Not knowing what's for real  
On this crazy wheel  
  
Is part of the deal, baby  
There's only one sure thing I know  
I never want to let you go  
I'll be here by your side  
On this circus ride  
  
Through every drop and climb  
'til the end of time  
When everything is moving fast  
It's hard to stay together  
I know that we can make it last  
We'll find a way to weather  
  
Any storm heaven sends  
We'll see it through to the end  
We've got it made if you can just believe  
You'll always be loved by me  
  
And when you go to bed at night  
And I'm not there to hold you tight  
I'll love you from afar  
No matter where you are  
I'll count the days 'til when  
I'm with you again  
  
And when we're growin' old  
I'll be the one to hold you close  
When everything is fading fast  
We'll face the end together  
We'll find a way to make it past  
One final storm to weather  
  
And even after the end  
I will be with you again  
We've got it made if you can just believe  
You'll always be loved by me
