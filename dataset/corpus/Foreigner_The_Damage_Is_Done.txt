Is there a reason  
For things that you say?  
The way you're treating me  
All the games I won't play  
Well it's too late, no longer one  
Don't want you, the damage is done  
  
Will you miss me  
When I leave you behind?  
Will you tell your friends  
I treated you unkind?  
Well it's over now, and I'm on the run  
I don't want you, the damage is done  
  
There have been rumors  
That my sense of humor is lacking in some ways  
To me that's no reason, it's tantamount to treason  
See what the judge has to say  
You need to find someone half as blind  
As I am to your games  
And maybe you'll find out what it's all about  
And it can drive you insane  
  
Ooh the damage is done  
And now I feel it's too late  
The damage is done  
It's over  
Now I'm on the run  
And baby you and I know  
The damage is done  
  
I feel it's too late  
The damage is done
