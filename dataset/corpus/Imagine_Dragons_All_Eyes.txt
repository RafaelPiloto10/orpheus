Everything you say is just a lie  
And now I'm leaving to the city  
Where the people are awake  
To chase a dream that isn't real  
And we pose to be something that we're not  
Just wanna change a lot and sign their name after the dot  
  
Everything you see is just a century of anarchy  
Among all my corresponding colors  
That symbolize the things we can attest  
A range we can assess we can attain  
We are the intrigue  
Entities to entice and entertain  
  
All eyes, they're on you  
Don't deny you've got to  
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me  
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me  
  
Take my side  
Take my side  
Don't look back  
Now I'm easy  
And that's a fact  
And you're on my mind  
Ohh  
  
Everything you say is just a lie  
And now I'm leaving to the city  
Where the people are awake  
To chase a dream that isn't real  
And we pose to be something that we're not  
Just wanna change a lot and sign their name after the dot  
  
All eyes, they're on you  
Don't deny you've got to  
This is a call that's all you'll ever get from me  
  
Now will the Sun come up tonight?  
Because you're eyes they burn so bright  
I'm all you've got  
When you say  
That you want it all  
You want it alll  
  
All eyes, they're on you  
Don't deny you've got to  
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me  
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me  
  
All eyes, they're on you  
Don't deny you've got to  
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me  
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
