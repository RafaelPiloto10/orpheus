Each time when one more year was over  
You refused to hear heaven's bells sound  
And the happiness in you heart's been set lower  
You were searching for friends but no one seemed to be 'round  
  
You merely should think of the good times  
'cause there are so many ways you can go  
Take a look at yourself, you're still very young  
And big aims always take very long  
  
Now it's time for happiness, stay hard and trust your fate  
Don't forget you're something else you'll never be too late  
Trust your fathers' mighty spell you'll never be alone  
Fate will always turn out well and you'll be number one  
  
Shout at the world don't care what they say  
'cause your life is now, here and today  
Luck is there, everywhere  
Go on, reap its goods, that's the way  
You want to have truth, relief from your pain  
But life takes its toll again and again  
Don't fear the night--your future is paid  
And the tracks to your aims are laid  
  
Now it's time
