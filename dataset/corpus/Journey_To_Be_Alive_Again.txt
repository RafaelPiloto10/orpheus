Doin' time,where it takes you  
You know it's time that can break you  
We get caught in the moment  
Just sleepwalkin' most of our lives  
In your mind (when you need it)  
With a song (to help you believe it)  
You can reinvent your world  
Anytime you like  
  
[Chorus]  
To be alive again  
Wakin' up from where you've been  
Younger now than you were then  
You're comin' round again  
Do you remember when  
Life was so much simpler then  
Like summer nights that never end  
To be alive again  
  
Find the smile you've been missin'  
There's someone that you could be kissin'  
So open your eyes and you'll see  
What's been there all along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be alive again  
  
You're not among the walkin' wounded anymore  
There's a time to fall  
There's a time to rise above it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be alive again  
(To be alive again)
