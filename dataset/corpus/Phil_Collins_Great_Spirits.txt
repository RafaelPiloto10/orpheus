When the earth was young  
And the air was sweet  
And the mountains kissed the sky  
In the far beyond, with its many paths  
Man and nature lived side by side  
but great wisdom does not come without learning  
And great vision not only with our eyes  
We can think that we see  
Truly see all around us  
But when we look  
Do we see with open minds?  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
Teach our children to look deeper than the surface  
See the world through another's eyes  
For to be blind beyond yourself  
Is to look but not see it  
Knowing much is not enough to be wise  
To see the wonder  
In all we've been given  
In a world that's not always as it seems  
On the path that we choose  
Turn every corner  
Follow one, for another begins  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
See from all sides
