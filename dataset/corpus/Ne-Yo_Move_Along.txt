You can move along  
I believe that we are done  
Whatever we was trying to do  
Cause you up and did me wrong  
Cupid got a big gun but a blindfold  
She gave another brother access to her little black dress  
You know the one, short silky and backless  
You need an Oscar, as she was an actress  
I called and met someone, into the mattress?  
Now she's lying to my face  
Eyes burning up like her words was mace  
I don't even hear what she was trying say  
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable  
To the lies I'm deaf  
All I can here is to the left to the left  
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket  
Your stuff, I already packed it  
I'm being polite  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if that's how you feel you can just  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite  
And if I seem a bit chill  
It's because I don't sweat the small  
Find another girl, please believe I will  
I aint tripping off you at all  
A boss from the beginning  
Been there for a minute  
So me losing you was me still me winning  
Found out about you sinning  
So you wonder what the hell I'm dreaming  
Now you're lying to my face  
Eyes burning up like her words was mace  
I don't even hear what you're was trying say  
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable  
To the lies I'm deaf  
All I can here is to the left to the left  
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket  
Your stuff, I already packed it  
I'm being polite  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if that's how you feel you can just  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite  
Please don't get me wrong  
Baby understand I'm trying to say get gone, the nicest way I can  
Cause I'm not what you want  
See I tried to make this work but our loves in the dirt, so lets see who calls
who first  
I'm moving along  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if that's how you feel you can just  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite
