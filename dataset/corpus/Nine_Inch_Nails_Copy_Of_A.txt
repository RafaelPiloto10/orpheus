I am just a copy of a copy of a copy  
Everything I say has come before  
Assembled into something into something into something  
I don't know for certain anymore  
I am just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow  
Always trying to catch up with my self  
I am just an echo of an echo of an echo  
Listening to someone's cry for help  
  
Look what you had to start  
Why all the change of heart  
Well you need to play your part  
A copy of a copy of a  
Look what you gone and done  
Well that doesn't sound like fun  
See I'm not the only one  
A copy of a copy of  
  
I am little pieces  
Pieces that were picked up on the way  
Imprinted with a purpose  
A purpose that's become quite clear today  
  
Look what you had to start  
Why all the change of heart  
Well you need to play your part  
A copy of a copy of a  
Look what you gone and done  
Well that doesn't sound like fun  
See I'm not the only one  
A copy of a copy of a  
  
I am just a finger on a trigger on a finger  
Doing everything I'm told to do  
Always my intention my intention your intention  
Just doing everything you tell me to  
  
Look what you had to start  
Why all the change of heart  
Well you need to play your part  
A copy of a copy of a  
Now look what you gone and done  
Well that doesn't sound like fun  
See I'm not the only one  
A copy of a copy of a  
  
Look what you had to start  
Why all the change of heart  
Well you need to play your part  
A copy of a copy of a  
Now look what you gone and done  
Well that doesn't sound like fun  
See I'm not the only one  
A copy of a copy of a
