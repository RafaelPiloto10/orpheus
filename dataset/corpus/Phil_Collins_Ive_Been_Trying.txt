I've been trying,  
Lord knows that I've been trying  
To understand why  
Can't I be your only man  
  
Now you said you loved me  
So sincerely  
That I believed that you loved me  
Yet I can't understand why  
Can't I be your only man  
  
Day after day you  
Ya Treat me any old way  
I wanna go but my heart says no  
Acting so strange  
But my love still remains  
So keep on trying boy  
She's gonna change

Day after day you  
Ya Treat me any old way  
I wanna go but my heart says no  
Acting so strange  
Yet my love still remains  
It says keep on trying boy  
She's gonna change  
  
Now, I've been trying,  
Lord knows how I've been trying  
But I can't understand why  
Can't I be your only man  
  
I just keep on trying  
Oooh...ohoooh...  
Just keep on trying...  
Oooh...ohoooh...  
Ya gotta keep on trying  
Oooh...ohoooh...
