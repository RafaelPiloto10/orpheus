Taking over, assisting with my revelation  
Empty spaces, as if it was an invitation  
Your invasion, exceeding every expectation  
Now I feed from the many mouths of your persuasion  
Resurrection, infection, as I fade away  
There's no fear, there is nothing left to make me stay  
Fitting in my new skin, just tell me what to do  
I'm defined, I am blind, I am a part of you  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Now I am a part of you, attack  
Now I am a part of you, resist us, fight back  
Now I am a part of you, attack  
Now I am a part of you, resist us, fight back
