Walking wounded with a belly full of pain  
And a big bad attitude  
  
We are shaking shadows for that perfect dark room  
Where we can do just what we want to do  
  
There is a place  
Where we can leave behind  
All those simple minds  
They would not like the way we live  
  
When we are all alone  
In this house that we call home  
You will become my misery whip  
  
(Yes, I said like a misery whip)  
  
Walking hungry with a pocket full of promise  
And a big black song in my head  
  
Yes, I know the answers to my questions  
They are purple black and blue  
And they are waiting for me in my bed  
  
There is a place where we can leave behind  
All those simple minds  
They would not like they way we live  
  
When we are all alone  
In this house that we call home  
You will become my misery whip  
(I will say it again, like a misery whip)  
  
Stop!  
  
I get no pleasure  
When I'm going through the motions  
Of my mediocre day to day  
Whoa, I'm just an actor  
Just like Robert fucking Redford  
When I say those stupid words that they expect me to say  
  
Yes we can leave behind  
All those simple minds  
They would not like the dirty things we do  
Yeah  
  
When we are all alone  
In this house that we call home  
I will fall down like a bitch for you  
  
I need you to hit me and make me shake  
I need you to hurt me and make me beg for more  
I need you to bend me and make me break  
I need you to make me feel like I am your whore  
  
Whoa (whoa)  
  
Oh, I feel complete when I feel sick inside  
I feel complete when I feel sick inside  
I feel complete when I feel sick inside  
I feel complete when I feel sick inside  
  
I need to feel like I am real inside, yeah  
I need to feel like I am really alive  
I need to feel like I am real inside, yeah  
I need to feel like I am really alive  
  
I need you to make me feel  
I need you to make me feel  
I need you to make me feel  
I need you to make me feel  
  
I need you to make me feel  
I need you to make me feel  
I need you to make me feel, whoa!  
  
Oh oh!  
I need you to hit me and make me shake  
I need you to hurt me and make me beg for more  
Oh oh, I need you to bend me and make me break  
I need you to make me feel  
  
Like we can leave behind  
All those simple minds  
They would not like the way we live  
When we are all alone  
In this house that we call home  
You will become my misery whip  
  
Oh oh  
You will become my misery whip  
Whoa  
You will become my misery whip  
Oh, you will become my misery whip  
You will become my friend
