When the waters rose  
In the darkness  
In the wake of the endless flood  
It flowed into our memory  
It flowed into our blood  
  
When something broke the surface  
Just to see the starry dome  
We still feel that relation  
When the water takes us home  
In the flying spray of the ocean  
The water takes you home  
  
Springing from the weight  
Of the mountains  
Like the heart of the earth  
Would burst  
Flowing out from marble fountains  
In the dreams of a desert thirst  
  
Something swam through  
The jungles  
Where the mighty rivers roam  
Something breaks the silence  
When the water takes you home  
I hear the wordless voices  
When the water takes me home  
  
Waves that crash on the shoreline  
Torrents of tropical rain  
Streaming down  
Beyond our memory  
Streaming down inside our veins  
  
When something left the ocean  
To crawl high above the foam  
We still feel that elation  
When the water takes us home  
In a driving rain of redemption  
The water takes me home...
