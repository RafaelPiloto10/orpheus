(Hi there Tex, what you say?)  
Step aside partner, it's my day  
bend an ear, and listen to my version  
of a really solid Tennessee excursion  
pardon me boys, is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?  
(Yes, Yes, Track 29)  
Hey would you give me a shine?  
(Can you afford to board Chattanooga Choo-Choo?)  
I got my fare  
and just the travel to spare  
you leave the Pennsylvania Station by a quarter to four  
you read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore  
dinner in a diner  
nothing could be finer  
and then to have a hammer in the Carolina  
when you hear the whistle blowing into the bar  
then you now the Tennessee is not very far  
shove a all the coal in  
gotta keep a rollin'  
woo-woo Chattanooga there you are  
there's gonna be  
a certain party at the station  
Satin and Lace (ooh)  
I use to call funny face  
(doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
she's gonna cry  
until I promise to never ever roll,  
so Chattanooga choo-choo  
won't you choo choo me home  
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)  
get aboard  
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)  
Chattanooga choo choo  
won't you choo-choo me home  
Chattanooga choo choo  
let's dance
