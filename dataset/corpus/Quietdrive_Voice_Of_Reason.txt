Would you let all your friends down?  
Is your love in drugs and money?  
Did you care enough?  
Not before you said  
It's not too late  
  
We have waited all our lives  
To become something more than nothing  
Did you think more of us now?  
I said  
  
Chorus  
It's not too late  
I'm not that scared  
Of it anymore  
Oh yeah  
That's why  
You are the voice of reason  
I know the reasons why  
We've covered up our treason  
Can't seem to find out why  
  
(Can't seem to find out why)  
  
So I'll take all your advice  
And I'll check to see if I'm running  
'Cause it's not like I can care enough  
It's not too late  
  
Chorus  
(I'm sick and tired of pulling down)  
  
I'll pinch the mouse trap on this one  
I've had the most in on this one  
(You'll turn away, you'll turn away)  
I'll play my cards out on this hand  
I'll separate it while I can  
(You'll turn away, you'll turn away, you'll turn away, you'll turn away)  
  
(You are the voice of reason)  
(I know the reasons why)  
You are the voice of reason  
I know the reasons why  
We covered up our treason  
Can't seem to find out why  
(I'm sick and tired of pulling down)  
  
This time I'm not  
Shy anymore  
Now this time I'm not  
Shy anymore  
Now this time I'm not  
Shy anymore  
Now this time I'm not  
Shy anymore
