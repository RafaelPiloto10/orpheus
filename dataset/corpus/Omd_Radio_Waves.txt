From the transmitter, to the receiver.  
Across the ether, out of your speaker.  
  
Chorus:  
Radio waves have life! Radio waves have life!  
Machines are living too, they're working for me and you!  
  
From the transmitter, to the receiver.  
Across the ether, out of your speaker.  
To the baltic fleet and atlantic fleet.  
Faster than the breeze over stormy seas.  
  
Repeat chorus (2)  
  
Through america to albania.  
Over reagan's head, under moscow's bed.  
To the warsaw pact and the nato pact.  
Down this cul de sac, never turning back.  
  
Repeat chorus
