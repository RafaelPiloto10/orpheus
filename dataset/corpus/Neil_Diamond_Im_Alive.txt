Talk a walk  
We can hardly breathe the air  
Look around  
It's a hard life everywhere  
  
People talk but they never really care  
On the street there's a feeling of despair  
Everyday there's a brand new baby born  
Everyday there's a sun to keep you warm  
  
When its alright  
Yeah, its alright  
I'm alive  
And I don't care much for words of doom  
  
If its love you need  
Well I got the room  
It's a simple thing changed in me  
When I found you  
  
I'm alive  
I'm alive  
Every night on the streets of Hollywood  
Pretty girls come to give you something good  
  
Love for sale  
It's a lonely town at night  
Therapy for a heart misunderstood  
Look around there's a flower on every street  
Look around and its growing at your feet  
  
Everyday you can hear me say  
That I'm alive  
I want to take all that life has got to give  
All I need is someone to share it with  
  
I got love and love is all I really need to live  
I'm alive  
I'm alive  
Everyday there's a brand new baby born  
Everyway there's enough to keep you warm  
  
It's ok  
And I'm glad to say  
I'm alive  
And I don't care much for words of doom  
  
If it's love you got well I've got the room  
It's a simple thing that came to me when I found you  
I'm alive  
I'm alive  
  
And I don't care much for words of doom  
If its love you need well I got the room  
Its a simple thing that came to me and I thank god  
I'm alive  
  
I can take all that life has got to give  
If I've got someone to share it with
