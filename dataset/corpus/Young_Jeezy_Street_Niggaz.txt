[Dee Money Verse 1]  
I relate to niggaz and they relate to me  
Real niggas do real things that's how it supposed to be  
Cut from the same clothes make the same shirt  
Probably had the same glock and got the same worth  
I'll whack ya ass and skip to da N.O  
And lay low in the projects with my kin-folk  
AK-47 with the shoulder strap Set it off had it sounded  
Like the Nolia clap Got 2 strikes nigga dodgin the  
P.O,P.O's This real life leave ya brains in da thresh hole  
I a street nigga mayne pimpin ain't easy leave da block  
Silent holla at em Jeezy.

It's my style They jockin my slang  
I'm a real street nigga  
We ain't the same nigga I'm grown nigga  
So play wit your own kids I'm a street nigga  
I was born in da streetz kid One white girl left  
Save the last dance My partner said you want it  
Well this your last chance Funny how a Murder can get you 50 years  
Like a Co-defendent makin deals like he work at Sears  
Still posted like a stripper dawg  
Judge gettin mo money then a stripper dawg  
Play the game how it go nigga running niggsz quicker then a  
Kitchen sink dirty south nigga on my way 2 da bank
