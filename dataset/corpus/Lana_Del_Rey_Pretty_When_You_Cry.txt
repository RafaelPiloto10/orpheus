[Verse 1]  
All the pretty stars shine for you, my love  
Am I the girl that you dream of?  
All those little times you said that  
I'm your girl  
You make me feel  
Like your whole world  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'll wait for you babe,  
That's all I do babe,  
Don't come through babe,  
You never do.  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I'm pretty when I cry,  
I'm pretty when I cry  
I'm pretty when I cry  
I'm pretty when I cry  
  
[Verse 2]  
All those special times, I spent with you my love.  
They don't mean shit,  
Compared to all your drugs.  
But I don't really mind, I've got my drugs and that.  
Like my memories, I don't need that.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'll wait for you babe,  
That's all I do babe,  
Don't come through babe,  
You never do.  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I'm pretty when I cry,  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
  
[Bridge]  
Don't say you need me when,  
You leaving, you leave again,  
I'm stronger than all my men,  
Except for you.  
Don't say you need me then,  
You leave last, you're leaving,  
I can't do it, I can't do it,  
But you do it best.  
  
[Hook]  
I'm pretty when I cry,  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
I'm pretty when I cry,  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
I'm pretty when I cry,  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
I'm pretty when I cry.  
  
[Outro]  
I'm pretty when I cry.
