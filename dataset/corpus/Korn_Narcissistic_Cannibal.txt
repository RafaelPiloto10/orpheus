Don't wanna be sly and defile you  
Desecrate my mind and rely on you  
I just wanna break this crown  
But it's hard when I'm so run down  
  
And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal  
Got to bring myself back from the dead  
  
Sometimes, I hate, the life, I made  
Everything's wrong every time  
Pushing on I can't escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Holding on I'm lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days  
  
Don't wanna be rude but I have to  
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through  
I just need to look around  
See that life that has come unbound  
  
And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal  
Got to bring myself back from the dead  
  
Sometimes, I hate, the life I made  
Everything's wrong every time  
Pushing on I can't escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Sometimes, I hate, the life I made  
Everything's wrong every time  
Pushing on I can't escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Holding on I'm lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days  
  
Holding on I'm lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days
