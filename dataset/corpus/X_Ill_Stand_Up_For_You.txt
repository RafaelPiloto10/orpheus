When you're too worn out to fight,  
I'll stand up for you. and when you need a bed for the night,  
I'll stand up for you. when my friends put you down,  
I'll stand up for you. when they run you out of town,  
I'll stand up for you. oh, what the hell...  
I'll take a greyhound bus with you.  
They call you a fool, and say that I'm too foolish to see.  
Well, I'll stand up for you, and you stand up for me.  
I'll stand up, I won't sit back. I'll stand up,  
I won't sit back. well, the cigarettes are gone,  
And the ashtrays are full. honey,  
Everyone thinks we're trash, so I take I take it out on you.  
I'm sorry the dreams are gone, and I've made you mad or two.  
That's the exactly wrong time, to pick a fight with you.  
Oh, what the hell... let's call it a night.  
They call you a fool, and say that I'm too foolish to see.  
Well, I'll stand up for you, and you stand up for me.  
I'll stand up, I won't sit back. I'll stand up, I won't sit back.
