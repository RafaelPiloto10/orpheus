Sick and tired of hearing all these people talk about  
What's the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out  
The thing you got to realize, what we doing is not a trend  
We got the gift of melody, we gonna bring it 'til the end  
  
It doesn't matter,  
'bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck  
All that matters,  
Is that you recognize that its just about respect  
It doesn't matter,  
About the clothes I wear and where I go and why  
All that matters,  
Is that you get hyped 'cause we'll do it to you every time  
(come on now)  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you ever wonder why, this music gets you high?  
It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock  
(your body starts to rock)  
Baby you can't stop  
(you can't stop),  
And the music's all you got, come on now  
This must be, pop  
  
Dirty pop, that you can't stop  
I know you like this dirty pop  
This must be, pop  
  
Now, why you want to try to classify the type of thing we do  
Cause were just fine doin what we like, can we say the same for you  
Tired of feelin all around me animosity  
Just worry about trust cause I'ma get mine, people can't you see  
  
It doesn't matter,  
'bout the car I drive or the ice around my neck  
All that matters,  
Is that you recognize that its just about respect (oh)  
It doesn't matter,  
About the clothes I wear or where I go and why  
All that matters,  
Is that you get hyped 'cause we'll give it to you every time  
(come on)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
Man I'm tired of singing  
Dirty, dirty, dirty pop  
Dirty pop  
Do you ever wonder (echo)  
NSync  
(oh) Do you ever wonder why  
(every wonder why)  
This music gets you high?  
(music gets you high)  
It takes you on a ride, feel it when your body starts to rock  
(when your body starts to rock)  
Baby you can't stop  
(baby don't stop),  
And the music's all you got, come on now  
This must be  
  
[Chorus]
