You know when you gave your love away  
It opens your heart, everything is new  
And you know time will always find a way  
To let your heart believe it's true  
You know love is everything you say  
A whisper, a word, promises you give  
You feel it in the heartbeat of the day  
You know this is the way love is  
  
[Chorus]  
Amarantine  
Amarantine  
Amarantine  
Love is always love  
  
You know love may sometimes make you cry  
So let the tears go, they will flow away  
For you know love will always let you fly  
How far a heart can fly away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know when love's shining in your eyes  
It may be the stars fallen from above  
And you know love is with you when you rise  
For night and day belong to love
