Now I know what you need  
And you know what I need  
The whole dang block knows this whole house needs  
A love revival, love revival up in here  
Now I know I'm preaching  
'Cause I'm certainly not leavin'  
But it's time to get excited and the neighbors aren't invited  
To this love revival, love revival up in here  
So sit up and listen boy  
'Cause I'm tired of being nice  
Now Momma's gonna tell you what she needs tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Revival, Revival  
Well, give me something soulful  
Honey, all I need are your two arms around me again  
So, if you're in this 'till the end  
Then let the love revival begin  
  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit movin'  
  
So I pray you won't deny me  
Now that I've said my peace  
And I'll say it again son  
Just in case you were asleep  
I want a love revival, love revival up in here  
'Cause I know what you need and you know what I need  
This whole dang block knows  
This whole house needs  
A love revival, love revival up in here  
So sit up and listen boy 'cause I'm tired of bein' nice  
Now Momma's gonna tell you what she needs tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well we're both in this till the end  
So let the love revival begin  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
I feel the spirit  
The spirit's moving  
  
[Chorus: x2]
