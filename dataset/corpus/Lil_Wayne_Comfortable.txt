[Chorus]  
I'm not saying this to shake you up  
I'm just saying this to wake you up  
Its all good when we making love  
All I ask is don't take our love  
For granted, its granted  
My love for you, is real  
Baby if you don't love me  
Somebody else will, so baby girl  
Don't you ever get too comfortable  
  
Yeah to the left to the left  
If you wanna leave be my guest, you can step  
Feeling irreplaceable listen to Beyonce  
But OK I'll put you out on your B-day  
Now if you rocking with Weezy  
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe  
I got game like E.A.  
But I wanna let you play  
And don't I treat you like souffle  
Don't I look at you like a I see a new day  
And don't I do, what I do say  
I'm threw talking so I'm a let you, face  
And let ya do ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah let me catch my breath  
You talking bout leave baby you ain't gone yet  
And if you leave, leave correct  
And I'm a send a jet to pick up the next  
And if you leave, your leaving the best  
So you would have to settle for less  
I am no Elliot Ness, I don't handcuff I don't arrest  
I do confess to the virginsy  
Cause under them sheets I am a mess  
Yes, baby you blessed  
Not chess don't jump ya ness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, it's no sweat no sweat  
I will never 1, 2, 3 4-get  
About you, your love, your sex  
You know I work you out like bowflex  
Our jokes no stress, love,  
Live life, proceed, progress  
Make sure the neighbors get no rest  
We can get together, never disconnect  
Your back, your neck  
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet, to us  
So let's project, you stay in  
Never in, correct  
Face!
