It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
The wait is ova... (8x)  
  
I pitch with a grenade...  
Swing away if you're feeling brave  
  
There's so much power in my name...  
If you pop off in your seat  
Steady I'm gonna do the wave  
  
I'm such a such a lady  
You don't have to be so afraid  
Couse I got room up on my team  
You can play but hold up.  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
It's getting crowded over here...  
But babe... The wait is ova!  
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble don't't you fumble  
That's a flag on the play  
Babe if you don't wanna  
Then you don't have to wait  
  
But together we gon'be taking over  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
So you don't wanna wait  
I hate to hear-That's such a shame  
Couse if you playing tight wears and no  
Diamond in my ears  
Then you already under way...  
I know you want to win and you wish I would let you in  
Get in line over here  
You can play but hold up  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
It's getting crowded over here...  
But babe... The wait is ova!  
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble don't't you fumble  
That's a flag on the play  
Babe if you don't wanna  
Then you don't have to wait  
But together we gon'be taking over  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
Baby put the work in like a champion  
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up  
Couldn't be with no one else  
You're the only way... I win!  
  
Baby got the whole world standing up  
Damn I bet a pitcher took a chance on love  
Baby love... The time is now  
And now-The wait is ova!  
  
The wait is ova (4x)  
Just wait your turn  
The wait is ova (4x)  
Just wait your turn  
  
It's getting crowded over here...  
But babe... The wait is ova!  
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble don't't you fumble  
That's a flag on the play  
Babe if you don't wanna  
Then you don't have to wait  
  
But together we gon'be taking over  
  
It's just the way the game is played  
It's best if you just wait your turn.  
  
Just wait your turn  
The wait is ova (4x)
