Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again  
It's a game I just can't win  
There you are breathin' soft on my skin, yeah  
Still you won't let me in  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah  
Have you ever wanted someone  
You just couldn't have  
Did you ever try so hard  
That your world just fell apart  
Have you ever needed someone so bad  
  
And to the girl I gotta have  
I gotta have you baby  
  
There you go, midnight promises again, yeah  
But they're broken by the dawn  
You want to go further, faster every day, baby  
But in the morning you'll be gone  
And I'm alone  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every dream I dream is like  
Some kinds rash 'n' reckless scene  
To give out such crazy love  
You must be some kind of drug  
And if my time don't' ever come  
For me you're still the one  
Damned if I don't, damned if I do  
I gotta get a fix on you  
  
[Chorus]
