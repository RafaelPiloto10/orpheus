Cryin', cryin'  
Cryin' drunk  
Walker lives on the island  
I'm still stuck in the south  
Walker lives off his hands now  
I still live off my mouth  
The only difference is you've got integrity, I don't  
Only difference is I'll do a lot of things you won't  
You'd like to think I'm sleeping very peacefully, I'm not  
I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin'  
Walker says you're a Cancer  
I just think you're a flu  
Oh, but then again I'm a Virgo  
I'm no match for you  
Yeah, the only difference is that I pretend that it's alright  
So cut up pretendin' I can make it through the night  
You'd like to think I'm sleeping very peacefully, I'm not  
I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk  
I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin' drunk  
The only difference is you've got integrity, I don't  
Only difference is I'll do a lot of things you won't  
You'd like to think I'm sleeping very peacefully, I'm not  
I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk  
I'm cryin'
