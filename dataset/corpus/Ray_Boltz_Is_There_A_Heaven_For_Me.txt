Is There A Heaven For Me?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
She heard him preaching in the church  
She tried but she could not get in  
She was a lonely child on the street  
The wind was cold against her skin  
The wind was cold against her skin  
She heard the sound  
Of strange new words  
That someone else would then explain  
They spoke of heaven  
And a Saviors love  
They said that Jesus was His name  
Chorus:  
Is there a heaven for me?  
A place I wont be hungry or cold?  
That is a place that I would love to see  
Is there a heaven for me  
She waited patiently for hours  
Until at last she saw him leave  
He couldn't understand  
The words she said  
So he asked tell me what she needs  
Chorus (repeat)  
And on that street they knelt and prayed  
And on that night a child was saved  
Listen closely and you'll hear  
More than just a girl  
Youll hear the children of the world  
Youll hear the children of the world  
Chorus (repeat 2X)
