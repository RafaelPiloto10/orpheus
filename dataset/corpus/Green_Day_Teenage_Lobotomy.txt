Lobotomy!  
Lobotomy!  
Lobotomy!  
Lobotomy!  
  
Ddt did a job on me  
Now I am a real sickie  
Guess I'll have to break the news  
That I got no mind to lose  
All the girls are in love with me  
I'm a teenage lobotomy  
  
Slugs and snails are after me  
Ddt keeps me happy  
Now I guess I'll have to tell 'em  
That I got no cerebellum  
Gonna get my Ph. D.  
I'm a teenage lobotomy
