[Chorus]  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasn't no one there,  
Wasn't no one there, yeah eh eh  
Same song to a different beat  
'Cause sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there  
I guess nobody cares, hey  
But everything's good until it goes bad  
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have  
It hurts when it don't last  
No easy way saying bye  
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
I'm tired of being tired  
And dealing with your B.S.,  
All the while supplying  
The money for your request  
Without me you're a dime  
But with me you're a buck fifty, ha ha  
I can get another one quickly  
But I'd rather weight it out  
Take the broken pieces try and fix it  
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision  
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit  
Ha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
Remember what you said  
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel  
I was doing good way before I met you  
Now you're off the set  
And I'm a let you see the show go on without you  
Take a bow, think about it  
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it  
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes  
The story of my life, you're just another page  
  
But everything's good 'til it goes bad  
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have  
It hurts when it don't last  
Easy way saying bye  
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I fly solo  
And I  
  
I had a dream that the whole world was staring at me  
I woke up and wasn't no one there  
Wasn't no one there  
Yeah eh 'eah
