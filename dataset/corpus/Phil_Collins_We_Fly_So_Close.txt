'We never realize just how close we come to disaster whether in love or
everyday life'  
  
My harbor lights are fading fast  
Soon they'll disappear  
Alone I sit in darkness  
Hoping someone might come near  
Though I wait, though I try  
No one ever comes  
And the feeling that I have flood over me  
The river starts to run  
  
We fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
  
Every place you run to, everywhere you turn  
There are places that you know you should not go  
But some bridges just won't burn  
All my life, though I try  
I cannot change the past  
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you  
Make you realize at last  
  
We fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
We fly too close  
  
My heart is racing much faster now  
Life passes before my eyes  
Something's I see, they make me smile  
Something's they make me cry  
So I look, so I try to find  
A lesson I can learn  
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind  
And the ghosts I know return  
  
You know we fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
We fly too close  
  
We fly so close, you and I sometimes  
Sometimes we fly so close,  
We'll never know how many times  
We fly so close  
We fly so close
