I could climb until I reach where angels reside  
Ask around to find out where the junkies applied  
You just up and left me on this rock all alone  
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
  
I could drop until I touch the sinister side  
Visit all attractions flippin' back and aside  
Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone  
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
  
Ohhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
  
I could climb until I reach where angels reside  
I could drop until I touch the sinister side  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
Died  
You ... died  
Died  
You ... died
