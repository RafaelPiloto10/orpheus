If somebody tells you "Look out boy,"  
"That stuff you're doin's way too strong."  
Pay them no mind, just give us time  
Keep your head, you can't do no wrong  
Please don't worry 'bout no jury  
There's so many of us anyway  
If somebody tries to bust you  
'Cause you had their daughter late last night  
Don't get me wrong  
But you must be strong and you just can't get uptight  
Please don't worry 'bout no jury  
There's so many of us anyway  
If somebody says you look funny  
'Cause the way you dress to them ain't right  
Say "Hey can't you see, you look funny to me?"  
"But I'm just tryin' to be polite."  
Please don't worry 'bout no jury  
There's so many of us anyway  
Please don't worry 'bout no jury  
There's so many of us anyway  
Please don't worry, 'bout no jury,  
There's so many, of us anyway
