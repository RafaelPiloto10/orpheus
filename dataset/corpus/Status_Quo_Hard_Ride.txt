Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
I'm gonna lie for it, living a life of it  
Staying alive without you  
I'm living a life for a woman  
I'm stringing a line with it, now that she's gone with it  
Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
Hey Joe, you know what I mean  
It's never been done before  
A hard ride was never my scene  
But now I'm coming back for more  
  
Living a life of it  
Living a life of it  
  
And it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
It's a hard, hard ride all on your own  
It's a hold on with all you've got  
Oh, it's a hard...  
Oh, it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
  
Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
It's running away with me, look at the change in me  
Sleeping alone without you  
When I get up in the morning  
It's no good believing what I've been dreaming  
Living a life without you  
Living a life without you  
All right, it's over and done  
She's never coming back to me  
A hard ride is what I've become  
From now until my dying day  
  
Living a life of it  
Living a life of it  
  
And it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
It's a hard, hard ride all on your own  
It's a hold on with all you got  
Oh, It's a hard...  
Oh, it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
  
(Hard ride, hard ride, hard ride, hard ride  
Hard ride, hard ride, hard ride)  
  
I got a hard ride, ain't nothing new  
With a rocking roll, rollin without you  
It's a long time since you've been gone  
And it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
  
Oh, it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
It's a hard, hard ride all on your own  
It's a hold on while you've got to  
It's a hard ride  
  
Yeah it's a hard, hard, hard, hard, hard ride  
Oh it's a hard, hard, hard, hard, hard ride  
Yeah, it's a hard, hard, hard, hard, hard ride  
Oh it's a hard...  
Oh it's a hard ride down a rocky road  
(It's a hard ride)  
  
Living a life away, living a life away  
Living a life away, living a life away
