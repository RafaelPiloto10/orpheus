I look into the mirror  
See myself, I'm over me  
I need space for my desires  
Have to dive into my fantasies  
I know as soon as I'll arrive  
Everything is possible  
Cause no one has to hide  
Beyond the invisible  
  
Close your eyes  
Just feel and realize  
It is real and not a dream  
I'm in you and you're in me  
It is time  
To break the chains of life  
If you follow you will see  
What's beyond reality
