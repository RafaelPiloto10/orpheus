Flesh wound, flesh wound  
With medication it will fade  
Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray  
Full of hate  
Don't you love how I pray?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let them throw me away  
Ah!  
Keep me and I'll be okay  
Ah!  
?  
Ah!  
Don't let them throw me away  
Ah!  
Don't let them throw me away  
  
Screwed up, used up  
Crumble lying on the floor  
Fucked up, shut up  
All you did back then was thought  
I'm really weak  
Missing parts  
Incomplete  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me up into the light  
Fix the cracks and fix them right  
Keep the pieces in the drawer  
Keep them there for ever more  
Wake a million thoughts someday  
Recycle this shit in someway  
And all that I have to say  
Don't let them throw me away  
  
[Chorus]
