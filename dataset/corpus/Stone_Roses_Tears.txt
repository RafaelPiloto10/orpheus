Our love, girl, is going through changes  
I don't know if I'm alive, dead, dying, or just a little jaded  
Someone throw me a line  
You know I need it  
I need it bad  
  
Lost in a maze of my own making  
No way out that I can find, send home your hard-working jury  
I'm going down this time  
You better believe it  
Yes you had  
  
So if you hear me crying, or talking in my sleep  
Don't be afraid, it's just the hours that I keep  
We gotta love to last for a million years  
A love that could never fade through the tracks of your tears  
  
All I can do is hope that you will see me fall  
Do your best to smash my picture on your wall  
Forgive me baby, absolve me, my dear  
I've seen the future in the tracks of your tears  
  
I've seen the future in the tracks of your tears  
Of your tears  
All those tears  
  
I cast a shorter shadow with every passing day  
No time to think, I'm just fading away  
Some kind of magic in all your hopes and fears  
Shows me the future through the tracks of your tears
