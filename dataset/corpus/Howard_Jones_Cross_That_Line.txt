It's not my fault if you didn't live out your  
Youthful dreams  
Now you want to backtrack, how different it all seems  
Love seems to be like alcohol, evaporates before your eyes  
The bonds that once were welcome, become the chains we despise  
Chorus  
When you cross that line, there's no turning back  
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door  
Everyone has got to take some responsibility  
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me  
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair  
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare  
I'm telling you when I say these words, that  
They're not spoken in bitterness  
That destructive emotion has long ago left  
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me  
Start afresh  
When you cross that line, what more can I say  
When you cross that line, we are no more  
We are no more
