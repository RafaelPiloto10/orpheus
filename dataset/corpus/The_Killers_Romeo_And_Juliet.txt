A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
He finds a streetlight and he steps out of the shade  
And says something like, ?You and me babe, how about it??  
  
Juliet says, ?Hey, it?s Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack?  
He's underneath the window, she's singing, ?Hey la my boyfriend?s back  
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that  
Anyway what you gonna do about it??  
  
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded in my heart  
And I forget, I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet  
  
Come up on different streets and both were streets of shame  
Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same  
Then I dream your dream for you, now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  
  
You can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah  
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah  
You know I used to have a scene with him"  
  
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry  
I said I love you like the stars above, I?ll love you till I die  
And there's a place for us, you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet  
  
I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV  
And I can't do a love song like the way it?s meant to be  
I can't do everything but I?d do anything for you  
I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
And all I do is keep the beat, the bad company  
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Juliet, I?d do the stars with you any time  
  
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry  
I said I love you like the stars above, I?ll love you till I die  
And there's a place for us, you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet  
  
And a lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
He finds a convenient streetlight and steps out of the shade  
And says something like, ?You and me babe, how about it??
