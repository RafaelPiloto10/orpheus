When is it gonna end?! (2x)  
  
I'm not a bad man (bad man),  
Just excel in anger and hatred!!  
Do the best, with what I have.  
I'm a constitution, yeah...  
Everyday I'm tested!  
With the worst of what you have...  
  
Here's to your problem.  
Here, Mr. Know-It-All...  
Here's to the solvin' of a problem in yer head.  
Here's to your problem,  
Here Mr. Can't-Be-Wrong...  
Here's to the solvin' of the problems in yer head.  
  
When is it gonna end?! (2x)  
  
You're not a bad man (bad man),  
You excel in cold frustration.  
You know I bleed, for what it's worth.  
Think I hear the distance comin',  
Down fast on your face is gunnin',  
Bloodspots in the eye give you away.  
  
(3 again)  
When is it gonna end? (4x)  
  
Do it if I can,  
You expect to much and I can't..!  
Be bothered with! What you do.  
Hey! What's your problem? (3x)  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
  
(3 again)  
  
When is it gonna end?!
