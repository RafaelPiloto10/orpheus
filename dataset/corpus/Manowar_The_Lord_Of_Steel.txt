In the nights  
We take flights  
Witness the sites  
The power and glory of steel  
  
I fought and died  
Lived many lives before  
I am immortal like my sword  
I kneel to no one except the lord  
And my lord is steel  
  
If you see me you just passed your time  
To the hills you can run but not hide  
Blood and death are wherever I ride  
Armed for battle the lord on my side  
Stand and face the lord of steel  
The lord of steel  
  
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned  
Let your punishment begin  
Only by death you atone  
You shall not die alone  
  
For the glory of battle  
I will fight until I die  
Live one day as an eagle  
Or a lifetime as a fly  
Like a candle burning  
The wheels of time are turning  
The lord of steel commands you  
To die by my hand  
  
Stand and fight the lord of steel  
Time to face the lord of steel
