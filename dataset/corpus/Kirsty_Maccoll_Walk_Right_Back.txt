I want you to tell me why you walked out on me  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I want you to know that since you walked out on me  
Nothing seems to be the same old way  
  
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you  
The good times we had before you went away, oh please  
Walk right back to me this minute  
Bring your love to me, don't send it  
I'm so lonesome every day  
  
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I want you to know that since you walked out on me  
Nothing seems to be the same old way  
  
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you  
The good times we had before you went away from me  
Walk right back to me this minute  
Bring your love to me, don't send it  
I'm so lonesome every day  
  
Walk right back to me this minute  
The Nicky Campbell show's on, innit?  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I'm so lonesome every day
