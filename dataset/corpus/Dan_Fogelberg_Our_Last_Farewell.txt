Once I loved you and you loved me  
We believed our souls were meant to breathe as one  
And could never come undone again  
  
And once I believed that you and I  
Were the two that would defy the fickle gods  
And win out against the odds and go on forevermore  
  
But now that your heart has turned away  
I must try to find a way to let you go  
Even though I know you will never leave me  
  
Cause you were my life's one great romance  
And I will always see you dancing through my dreams  
And as hopeless as it seems, I will always love you  
  
And now if you think we've said it all  
Let the final curtain fall on us at last  
And just put it in the past and say our last farewell
