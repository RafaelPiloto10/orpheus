This song was first released on the All Aboard! album. It is the only album it
has been released on.  
  
Do you hear that whistle down the line  
I figure that it's Engine Number 49  
She's the only one that'll sound that way  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke rising 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts set the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes whoo oo oo oo  
Hey Jim, you better get the rig whoo oo oo oo  
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big  
  
And they'll all want a lift to Brown's Hotel  
'Cause lots of them been traveling for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadel phi a  
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
All Aboard! All Aboard!  
  
Let her rip, let her rip, Mr. Engineer  
Gotta go, gotta go far away from here  
While the man at the fire, shovels in the coals  
Stick your head out the cab and watch the drivers roll  
See the towns and the roads go a whizzing by  
Fare-the-well Laramie and Rocky Mountain High  
Yes sirree, here we are, going all the way  
Mustn't quit till we hit Califor ni a  
  
See the old smoke rising 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts set the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe
