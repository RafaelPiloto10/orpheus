Orpheus, it could have been  
You could have held me again  
You said your songs had all gone  
And that the road back up was too long  
But it was there for us  
It was there for us  
I loved you all along  
  
Orpheus  
The part of me that died  
Was ready to be reborn  
And you called of the hounds  
Of hell with your songs  
Orpheus, Orpheus  
I loved you all along, Orpheus  
  
Orpheus, It could have been  
You could have held me again  
But you couldn't wait  
Somewhere along the road  
You lost your faith  
Out of despair and believing  
I was gone  
You gave up on my love  
You gave up on us  
  
But it was there for us,  
It was there for us  
I loved you all along  
Orpheus
