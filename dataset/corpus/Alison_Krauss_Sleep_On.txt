Could your heart ever be mine  
Your arms hold me so close to you  
All through the night  
Your eyes gaze into mine  
Saying I should believe you  
I always do, I don't know why  
  
Cause you taught me a lesson the hard way one time  
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind  
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now  
Sleep on  
  
Could your heart ever be mine  
My arms hold me so close to me  
All through the night  
My heart warned me this time  
But I need to believe you  
I do, just for tonight  
  
But you taught me a lesson the hard way one time  
Promised you loved me but then changed your mind  
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now  
Sleep on  
Sleep on
