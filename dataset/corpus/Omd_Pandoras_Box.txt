Born in kansas  
On an ordinary plain  
Ran to new york  
But ran away from fame  
Only seventeen  
When all your dreams came true  
But all you wanted  
Was someone to undress you  
  
And all the stars you kissed  
Could never ease the pain  
Still the grace remains  
And though the face has changed  
You're still the same  
  
And it's a long long way  
From where you want to be  
And it's a long long way  
But you're to blind to see  
  
Frame of silence  
Of an innocence divine  
Is a dangerous creation  
When you fail the test of time  
  
And all the photographs  
Of ghosts of long ago  
Still they hurt you so  
Won't let you go  
And you still don't know  
  
And it's a long long way  
From where you want to be  
An it's a long long way  
But you're to blind to see  
  
When you look around yourself now  
Do you recognize the girl  
The one who broke a thousand hearts  
Terrified the world  
  
And all the stars you kissed  
Could never ease the pain  
And if the face has changed  
The grace remains  
And you're still the same  
  
And it's a long long way  
From where you want to be  
An it's a long long way  
But you're to blind to see....
