A do-dooooo. A do-dooooo.  
I saw the splendor of the moonlight on Honolulu Bay.  
There's something tender in the moonlight on Honolulu Bay.  
And all the beaches are full of peaches  
Who bring their ukes along.  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song.  
  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you.  
If you want to linger where it's shady,  
Ukulele lady linger too.  
If you kiss a ukulele lady  
While you promise ever to be true,  
And she see another ukulele lady fool around with you.  
Maybe she'll sigh, maybe she'll cry,  
Maybe she'll find somebody else  
By and by-why-why  
To sing to when it's cool and shady,  
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo woo woo.  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you.  
  
Someday I'm goin'  
Where eyes are glowin'  
And lips were made to kiss,  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the songs I missed.  
  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you, you, you.  
If you want to linger where it's shady,  
Ukulele lady linger too.  
If you kiss a ukulele lady  
While you promise ever to be true true, true,  
And she see another ukulele lady fool around with you.  
Well, maybe she will sigh, maybe she will cry,  
Aah, but maybe she will find somebody else  
By and by-why-why  
To sing to when it's cool and shady,  
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo woo woo.  
If you like a ukulele lady,  
Ukulele lady like a you like a me like I like a you  
We like a both the same.  
I'd like to say this very day  
Ukulele lady like a you-ooo-oooo.  
Laughing
