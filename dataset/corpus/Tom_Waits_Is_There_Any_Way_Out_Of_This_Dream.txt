I can clearly see nothing as clear  
I keep falling apart every year  
Let's take a hammer to it  
There's no glamour in it  
Is there any way out of this dream  
I'm as blue as I can possibly be  
Is there someone else out there for me  
Summer is dragging its feet  
I feel so incomplete  
Is there any way out of this dream  
Summer is dragging its feet  
I feel so incomplete  
Is there any way out of this dream
