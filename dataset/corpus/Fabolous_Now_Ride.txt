Yeah, yeah (haha) haha  
Yeah, uh (uh-huh-uh)  
Uh (uh-huh-uh)  
Uh (uh-huh-uh) uh  
  
Niggaz ain't gon' be happy till I click on a rage  
Pick up a gauge, and it's my face, that they stick on front page  
Gotta be careful, I could pull a thick of the age  
Chick on the stage, and winde up, sick in a cage  
  
When I come through, it's usually in Dickies that's beige  
Pushing a "Eleanor", like I'm Nicholas Cage  
And it's funny how a few bucks can  
Get you put under a white sheet, like you in the Ku Klux Klan  
  
It's Street Fam' for life, we ride to the death  
We play hard dog, don't cry to the rest  
I don't know you, please move to the left  
Or stay here and get introduced to the tefs  
  
I'm riding till the wheels come off it (yeah)  
Grindin till a mil' come off it (yeah)  
This is my plate, I eat every meal from off it  
Why why'all try and steal crumbs off it, jump!  
  
[Chorus]  
(Now ride) Top down, chrome rims spinnin and  
(Now ride) Gun cock, hollows in the clip now  
(Now ride) Chop rocks, put it on a strip now  
(Now ride) why'all know Street Family gon' (ride)  
(Now ride) Top down, chrome rims spinnin and  
(Now ride) Gun cock, hollows in the clip now  
(Now ride) Chop rocks, put it on a strip now  
(Now ride) why'all know Street Family gon' (ride)  
  
Now when I spray wit the sauer, I gotta spend a day wit the lawyer  
Worryin bout, who say that saw ya  
Keep yay wit the oyers, two kids on the block  
Like when Mourning and Mutumbo, used to play wit the Hoyas  
  
I'ma boss, that you can never upstand  
Or get a red dot on you, like a 7Up can  
Some of why'all caught feelings from way back  
Others waited till I came through, short willing the Maybach  
  
But I'm still bucking like, five, duce, four, trey  
Still tucking and letting the fo' spray  
Still ducking where ever the po's lay  
And still fucking, and making them hoes say, WHOA!  
  
...And I know Fed's seen  
The old school Chevy, with the dope head lean  
why'all love the way I are-I-D-E  
Call my D.E., and put you on a R.I.P.T., ghetto  
  
[Chorus]
