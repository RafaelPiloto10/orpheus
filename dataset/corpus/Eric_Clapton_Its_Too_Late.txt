It's too late, she's gone.  
It's too late, my baby's gone.  
Wish I had told her she was my only one.  
It's too late, she's gone.  
  
It's a woman that cries,  
So I guess I've gotta hide my eyes.  
Yes, I will miss her more than anyone.  
It's too late, she's gone.  
  
She's gone, yes she's gone.  
She's gone, my baby's gone.  
She's gone, yes she's gone.  
Where can my baby be?  
  
And I wonder does she know  
When she left me, it hurt me so.  
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait.  
Tell me it's not too late.  
  
Chorus
