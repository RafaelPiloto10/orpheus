Have you seen the sunlight pouring through her hair  
And felt her warm mouth on you in the summer's air  
Running in a field of brown, laughing, rolling on the ground now  
Smiling as she pulls you down  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you  
If your dreams should wake you shaking in the night  
She can touch your face and take away all fright  
Like a tree in a meadow wind she will bend to take you in  
Makes no difference where you been  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you-yeah  
If you wake up screaming, scared about what you're dreaming  
You know she is there, she can share  
You're aware she cares about you  
In the morning wake up laughing with the day  
She will smile and ask you with her eyes to stay  
Like the sunshine warms the sand  
She will touch you with her hand now  
Touching makes you understand  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
If you wake up screaming, scared about what you're dreaming  
You know she is there, she can share  
You're aware she cares about you  
In the morning wake up laughing with the day  
She will smile and ask you with her eyes to stay  
Like the sunshine warms the sand  
She will touch you with her hand now  
Touching makes you understand  
Oh that's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you-yeah  
That's the way she feels about you  
That's the way she feels about you
