I've been tossing and turning  
All this hunger is burning  
I need something to feed my soul  
Oh oh oh  
  
I raise my thoughts to the morning  
I got this need that's growing  
Pick you up just to make me whole  
Oh oh oh  
  
Your body is heaven and it feels like home  
Those sweet lips - I'll never let you go  
  
I'm never satisfied  
Not if I even try  
It's keeping me up at night  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I need you all the time  
You bring me back to life  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I take my time, give it all to you  
There ain't nothing else I can do  
I'll follow you anywhere you go  
Oh Oh Oh  
  
Your body is heaven and it feels like home  
Those sweet lips - I'll never let you go  
  
I'm never satisfied  
Not if I ever try  
It's keeping me up at night  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I need you all the time  
You bring me back to life  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I'm tasting Heaven when I think about you  
I'm losing my mind  
I can't stop thinking 'bout your sweet love,  
All of the time  
I don't know if I'm gonna make it alone...  
Make it alone  
  
I'm never satisfied  
Not if I ever try  
It's keeping me up at night  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I need you all the time  
You bring me back to life  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I'm never satisfied  
Not if I ever try  
It's keeping me up at night  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
  
I need you all the time  
You bring me back to life  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love  
I'm going crazy  
For all of your love
