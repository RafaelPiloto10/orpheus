A man that I know from the neighborhood  
Whenever I see him he's up to no good  
Taking from others to get what he wants  
And he thinks that there's no way he'll ever get caught.

Husband and wife a baby girl, there happy  
But then there's a woman from down the street  
Writing letters and  
Sending pictures and,  
Doing all that she can  
Trying hard to gain  
The attention of a married man (girl ya wrong now)  
  
Ya, story is  
I'm just a kid, and it's all in fun  
Ya never stop  
To realize ya hurting someone  
How would you feel if everything was turned around  
and everyday somebody was putting you down (ohh.. too long)
