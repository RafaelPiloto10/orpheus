Life, this is an outrageous life,  
We're living in.  
We call this turmoil our life,  
Oh, and it's gettin' old coming over again.  
But we don't hear nobody,  
Say what they're after.  
And we don't hear nobody,  
Searching for answers.  
John kennedy died,  
They thought he had a solution.  
We want to know,  
What happened to the revolution.  
  
Did we all get hung up in life.  
And do we all know,  
Just where were going.  
Everything's wrong,  
So a change has got to be right (man, baby).  
  
Life, for all the rest of our life,  
Will we be wrapped up in strife.  
Or, are we gonna start it all over again.  
We want to have somebody,  
Come up with the answers.  
We want to be somebody,  
That know's what their after.  
We hope that everybody,  
Can hear what I'm sayin'.  
We know that we will,  
If we just keep on prayin'.  
  
Chorus  
Learning to share what were standing on.  
Learning to care 'cus it's been so long.  
No one so big that they have it all.  
We've got to give to the very small.  
  
Life, give me the rest of my life,  
I want to finish it right.  
So, I don't have to start all over again.  
Let's get together,  
For some satisfaction.  
Let's stand together,  
On a chain reaction.  
We need somebody,  
We could really depend on.  
Don't wait till tomorrow,  
'cause it just might be too long.  
  
Chorus
