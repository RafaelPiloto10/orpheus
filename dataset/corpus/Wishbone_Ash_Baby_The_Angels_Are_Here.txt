No smoke without fire  
If the sky was light  
And the moon shine brightly  
Then we?d be away tonight  
Better chance be taken  
Than love forsaken  
This ain't no mistake that I'm making.  
  
Baby the angels are here,  
Brought me a Bible and a gun,  
Baby I wanted to stay with you,  
But they're saying I?d better run,  
Cause heaven?s a footstep away.  
  
Well I was hoping to make it  
Sometimes you put it together  
Before you try  
Let it take it?s course,  
Because you just can't force it  
And I don't want to break down and cry.  
  
Baby the angels are here,  
Brought me a Bible and a gun,  
Baby I wanted to stay with you,  
But they're saying I?d better run,  
Cause heaven?s a footstep away.
