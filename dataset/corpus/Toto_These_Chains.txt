Everybody keeps talkin' about you, I can't lie anymore  
Been too long, what went wrong? It's a mystery  
Why you ever walked out that door  
What direction should I go? Girl what's next for me, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it gonna get easier than tryin' to break these chains around my heart  
Oh oh  
Does it ever get easier, without you I can't pull these chains apart  
Oh oh  
  
I see your face when I look in the mirror  
I feel your touch but you're not there  
Wakin' up, had enough of this dream of mine, girl this just isn't fair  
What direction should I go? Girl what's next for me, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Day by day, until they break, oh oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]
