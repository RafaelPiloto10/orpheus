He's a fashion victim of his own time  
In his "vintage suit" and tie  
He's a casualty dressed to the teeth  
In the latest genocide  
The new seasons come and go  
At the dog and pony show  
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names  
And follow the dress codes  
What's in a name?...Hey!  
  
She's a scented magazine  
Looking sharp and living clean  
Living well and dressed to kill  
But she looks like hell to me  
  
So when you're dancing through your wardrobe  
Do the anorex-a go-go  
Cloaked with style  
For pedophiles as the credit card explodes  
  
You auctioned off your life  
For the "most" expensive price  
Going once...  
Going twice...  
Now it's gone  
  
You auctioned off your life  
For the "most" expensive price  
Going once...  
Going twice...  
Now it's gone  
  
What's in a name, hey?  
What's in a name, hey?  
What's in a name?
