(Calling all cars, calling all cars)  
(Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples)  
(Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers)  
(Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east)  
(Alias L.L. Cool J)  
(He's bad)  
  
No rapper can rap quite like I can  
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand  
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop  
Make you say, "Go L.L. and do the wop"  
  
If you think you can out rhyme me, yeah boy I bet  
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet  
Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good  
I got a gourmet plate that says I wish you would  
  
And when rap begin then I gotta join in and  
Before my rhyme is over you know I'm a win  
Cool J has arrived so you better make way  
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!  
  
Sparring competition that's my hobby and job  
I don't wear a disguise because I don't own the mob  
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped  
So many girls on my jock I think my phone here is tapped  
  
I'm bad

I'm like Tyson icin' I'm a soldier at war  
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more  
Got concrete rhymes been rappin' for ten years and  
Even when I'm braggin' I'm bein' sincere  
  
MC's can't win I make 'em rust like tin  
They call me Jaws my hat is like a shark's fin  
Because I'm bad as can be got my voice all waxed  
Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed  
  
I couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way  
The best rapper you've heard is L.L. Cool J  
Kamikaze take a look at what I've done  
Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one  
  
And can happen on time never standin' on lime  
You want to try me first you better learn how to rhyme  
I'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme  
And I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean  
  
I'm bad  
I eliminate punks cut 'em up in chunks  
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk  
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame  
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane  
  
I'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull  
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full  
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I  
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's withstand I tie  
  
Never retire or put my mike on the shelf  
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself  
Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad  
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad  
  
MC's they retreat cause they know I can beat 'em  
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em  
I'm the best takin' out all rookies  
So forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies  
  
I'm bad  
(Cool J)

Never ever no never  
Never wearin' no Levis battle me why try  
I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye  
Sparrin' MC's and I'm a never get with  
When I retire I'll get worship like a old battleship  
  
L.L. I'm bad other rappers know  
When I enter the center they say, "Yo, yo there he go!"  
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge  
Not a puncher or hunter from a rap cool large  
  
The original Todd teachin' how to be hard  
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod  
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue  
Not Atilla the Hun but no I'm Threwler his son  
  
My pulse exact like rack and pinion in a Jag  
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grab-bag  
No good scavenger catfish vulture  
My tongue's a chisel in this competition sculpture  
  
I'm bad  
(Think I'm gonna need backup)  
(Think I'm gonna need backup)  
(What you need that for?)  
(Yo this is L.L. Cool J)  
(And you'll never catch me so don't even try it)  
(I'm too bad for ya, understand)  
I'm bad!
