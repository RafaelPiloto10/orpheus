Hold your fire  
Keep it burning bright  
Hold the flame  
'Til the dream ignites  
A spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission  
  
I hear their passionate music  
Read the words  
That touch my heart  
I gaze at their feverish pictures  
The secrets that set them apart  
  
When I feel the powerful visions  
Their fire has made alive  
I wish I had that instinct  
I wish I had that drive  
  
Spirits fly on dangerous missions  
Imaginations on fire  
Focused high on soaring ambitions  
Consumed in a single desire  
  
In the grip of  
A nameless possession  
A slave to the drive of obsession  
A spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission  
  
I watch their images flicker  
Bringing light to a lifeless screen  
I walk through  
Their beautiful buildings  
And I wish I had their dreams  
  
But dreams don't need  
To have motion  
To keep their spark alive  
Obsession has to have action  
Pride turns on the drive  
  
It's cold comfort  
To the ones without it  
To know how they struggled  
How they suffered about it  
  
If their lives were  
Exotic and strange  
They would likely have  
Gladly exchanged them  
For something a little more plain  
Maybe something a little more sane  
  
We each pay a fabulous price  
For our visions of paradise  
But a spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission
