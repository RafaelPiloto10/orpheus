Seems like our love is on a road to nowhere fast  
All my life I thought a love like this would last  
But every road can hide a corner we can't see  
I had a vision that I woke up by your side  
I felt you breathing and our souls were intertwined  
But who controls love's destiny? Not me.  
  
We had it all right in our hands,  
We had the space to fly and still a place to land  
  
So I'm calling out, I'm calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what we've done  
Don't leave me hanging on  
I'm reaching out and praying you'll come back again  
It's just darkness I'm living in  
And you're the only place my heart has ever been.  
  
Maybe I'm young and in the ways of love naive  
Maybe I'm desperate for a reason to believe  
There wasn't any way I thought that we would fall.  
I've seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky  
I've seen a child make the coldest grown man cry  
But loving you I thought was greater than them all.  
  
We had it all, just you and me  
Now there's a doorway to my heart without a key  
  
So I'm calling out, I'm calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what we've done  
Don't leave me hanging on  
I'm reaching out and praying you'll come back again  
It's just darkness I'm living in  
And you're the only place my heart has ever been.  
  
Wherever you are right now  
Come back and show me how you feel  
Becasue I'm lost without you here  
  
Calling out, I'm calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what we've done  
Don't leave me hanging on  
And I'm reaching out and praying you'll coem back again  
It's just darkness I'm living in  
Cause you're the only place my heart has ever been.
