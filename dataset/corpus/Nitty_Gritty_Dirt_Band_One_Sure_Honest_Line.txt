I made a living writing lover's dream words,  
I found the notes to hang them on  
I fround a way to play with the meaning of things  
And I came up with a couple good songs.  
And so I oughta have an easy answer,  
I oughta have some pretty things to say,  
But I haven't found the combination  
That'll make you change your mind and wanna stay.  
So I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again  
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure  
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket  
And I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours  
Listen to the laughter of the children  
She scratched on the back of a bill  
As we climbed past the road to the schoolhouse  
On the burnt crust browning pan hill  
To where they don't take sad for an answer,  
A place at the corner of your heart,  
Where music meets with memories,  
So you can recognize the feeling from the start  
How I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again  
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure  
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket?  
I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours  
They'll put us on the radio so you'll know that I am yours
