Bye bye, pretty woman  
I've got to leave you now  
I find you never really cared  
  
Stand back, take a look at you  
You couldn't care if you wanted to  
You keep saying it's gonna change  
But every time it comes back again  
It's a merry-go-round  
  
Endless lies shine in your eyes  
  
It's alright, count to ten  
It will all be better then  
It's alright, the world will go away  
  
Stand back, take a look at you  
You couldn't care if you wanted to  
You keep saying it's gonna change  
But every time it comes back again  
It's a merry-go-round  
  
Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes  
The heartbreak is, if you could only see  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
Endless tears that flowed through the years  
You take it all, and then you take some more  
Then you come running back to me  
  
Play on, pretty music  
Play on and on for me  
Shine on, silver stars  
Over the sea  
  
Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes  
The heartbreak is, if you could only see  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
  
Endless lies shine in your eyes
