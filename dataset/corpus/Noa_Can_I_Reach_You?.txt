Can I reach you,  
Are you there?  
Can reach you  
Do you care?  
Can I reach you  
If I let down my hair,  
If I sit here and stare..  
  
Can I reach you  
If I try?  
Can I reach you  
If I cry?  
Can I reach you  
If I show you my eyes  
If I wear my disguise  
Can I reach you?  
  
What'll it be  
Longing or sorrow?  
What'll it be  
Beauty or light?  
What'll it be  
Honesty, passion?  
What'll it be  
Tonight..  
  
Can you hear me  
Through the dark?  
Can you hear me  
Where you are?  
Can you hear me  
How I give you my soul  
How I swallow you whole  
Can you hear me?  
  
What'll it be  
Frailty or anger?  
What'll it be  
Purity or pride?  
What'll it be  
Sanity, madness?  
What'll it be...  
  
Can I reach you  
With my voice?  
Can I reach you  
With my words?  
Can I reach you  
With my dreams..  
  
Will I be happy?  
  
What'll it be  
Longing or sorrow?  
What'll it be  
Beauty or light?  
What'll it be  
Honesty, passion?  
What'll it be  
Tonight..  
  
What'll it be  
Frailty or anger?  
What'll it be  
Purity or pride?  
What'll it be  
Sanity, madness?  
What'll it be? ?
