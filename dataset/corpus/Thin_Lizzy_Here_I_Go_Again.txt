So we packed our bags and headed for the north sea  
There was eric, brian, freaky pete, charlie, frankie lee and me  
I was feeling homesick but I was in good company  
We went sailing  
We came ashore long before the fighting broke  
Saw the sign and headed for the big smoke  
We met an old woman of the roads, she said "this life is but a joke"  
But we kept on trucking  
I'm always thinking, I'm thinking  
I'm thinking how much I think about it all  
While you're just dreaming, just dreaming, just dreaming  
Had you dreamt it all  
But I'm the one who's fallen  
The one you hear  
Here calling across your floor  
Here I go again feeling low down  
I'll never know, but then I came from the wrong side of town  
We were like the lonesome outlaws  
We would go which way the wind did blow  
Down the open trail that nobody knows  
Sometimes it gets lonesome  
But there you go feeling low down
