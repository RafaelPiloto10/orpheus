There's something I need to say  
I'm not sad you're gone away no way  
Won't be calling information  
Or waiting at the railway station  
You walked out of my front door  
I wasn't then but now I'm sure  
I need to be at least 2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
Had to get me to the church on time  
To say that silly I do I do nursery rhyme  
You've been bitching at me for awhile  
Say hey now baby don't you cramp my style  
Don't go beating me like that  
I'm glad you won't be coming back  
I need to be at least 2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
2000 miles away from you  
Don't go beating me like that  
I'm glad you won't be coming back  
Don't let the Devil tempt you now  
He'll lead you if he gets a chance
