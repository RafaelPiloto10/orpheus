The whole earth overflowing  
With your power and your glory  
There is no one like You God  
There is no one like You God  
  
Mountains bow nations tremble  
At your feet we cry Holy  
There is no one like you God  
There is no one like you God  
  
Let creation sing of the risen king  
Let the universe resound  
With a shout of love  
We will give to You  
All the highest praise  
  
Let your light shine upon us  
Let your light shine upon us  
For the glory of your name  
Will be over all the earth  
  
Forever, forever I'll sing  
Forever, forever I'll sing
