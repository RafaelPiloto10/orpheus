Dreams are flying like an eagle  
To the orinoco flow  
From the desert of Eldorado  
To the east coast, yes I know  
  
A heart of gold, and she's alone  
Garden Eden is her home  
She's like a storm, she's like a star  
You think she's near, but she so far  
She's like the sun in wintertime  
She's hard to find  
  
She's the witch queen of Eldorado  
High on the mountain, heya heya heya hoh  
For the freedom in Eldorado  
She's the fountain, heya heya heya hoh  
She's the witch queen of Eldorado  
Lady of fire - heya heya heya heya hoh  
And she fighting for Eldorado  
With her desire - heya heya heya heya hoh  
  
She is warming frozen roses - gives you dreams  
Money can't buy - in the desert of Eldorado  
All your dreams will learn to you  
  
She's justified in wounded knee  
Some lies are true, oh can't you see  
Follow the sun, and you will find  
A secret room, just in your mind  
Let's make this world, a better place  
For the human race  
  
Love can move the greatest mountain  
And all your love comes back to you  
In the desert of Eldorado  
Oh some dreams are coming true  
  
Walk on water - walk on fire  
The wind must come, from somewhere  
In the desert of Eldorado  
There is the answer, oh take care
