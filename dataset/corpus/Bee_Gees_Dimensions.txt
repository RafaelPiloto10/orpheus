Hindsight, don't make it right  
She give me trouble enough  
And she's a ball of light  
I'm in the tunnel of love  
With the American dream  
And I was born too soon  
A little good luck, never stuck  
She got me climbing the walls  
Got me hard as a rock  
Within a city of sin, she got a city block  
And she was barkin' at the moon  
  
She likes to show  
So many sides to her  
And I'd be the one to know  
  
[Chorus:]  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
When am I gonna go to where you are  
When am I gonna go to your dimension  
Dimensions of each other keep us goin' strong  
  
Black knight, take a bite  
She can double it up  
And she's a way of life  
And whether dead or alive  
She got a fix on me  
And I was dancin' in the fire  
White steam, never seen  
In every muscle and bone  
She was a love machine  
And she could wrestle me down  
And get a taste of me  
In her web of desire  
  
She changed my world  
How can the body know  
It's touchin' me or her  
  
[Chorus]
