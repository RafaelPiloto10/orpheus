[Verse 1]  
You're shaking, tell me what is the matter babe?  
Do I make you a little nervous? Girl don't be afraid  
I'm not here to hurt you, just the opposite indeed  
You can let your guard down baby, you're safe in here with me  
  
[Hook]  
If you let me take control  
Girl I got you I swear  
More passion than you've ever known  
I'm about to (take you there)  
And you can keep your eyes closed  
But baby don't be scared  
Hold on here we go  
I'm about to (take you there)  
  
[Verse 2]  
These arms are for, for your warmth and protection girl  
Lay your head on my chest, just chill before we start the session girl  
I'm gonna put my love in you baby  
Gonna give you all of me  
Just a [?] of my love baby  
Bite your lip and grip the sheets  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Just let go, go on and let yourself give it up  
Your body worshipped by mine is what this night holds for us  
And if we happen to fall in love I'm not opposed  
Grown enough to handle a real baby  
But let's not sweat it right now  
All I want you to do is focus on how it feels baby  
  
[Hook] (x2)
