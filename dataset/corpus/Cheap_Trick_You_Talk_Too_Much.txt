You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much to me  
  
Dear father, don't mother me  
Dear mother, don't bother me  
If I ever needed your advice, oh  
I would have called you on the telephone  
I've been wrong maybe once or twice  
And that's when I was listenin' to you  
  
You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much to me  
  
Dear preacher, you won't reach me  
Dear teacher, don't preach to me  
If I ever needed your advice, oh  
I would have called you on the telephone  
I've only been wrong maybe once or twice  
And that's when I was listenin' to you  
  
Oh, shut up!  
  
You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much, oh yeah
