Little one it's so nice to have you near me  
To feel once again the love you bring here  
Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt  
Say the word and daddy will make it disappear  
  
Oh my little one  
Bring your love here  
Little one  
I need you near  
  
Little one  
Don't live in fear of the future  
'Cause I will always be there  
Oh my little one  
  
Music is my life, I hope you understand  
Travelling on the road with me you can see the way we live  
Oh my little one  
I will always cherish these days with you  
  
As time goes by I hope you see the love I tried to give  
Oh my little one  
Let your love flow  
My little one  
  
Like a flower you'll grow  
Someday you'll have your own little one  
And you will always be there  
Little one, it's so nice to have you near me  
  
To feel once again the love you bring here  
Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt  
Say the word and daddy will make it disappear  
Oh my little one  
  
Bring your love here  
Little one  
I need you near me  
Little one  
  
Don't live in fear of the future  
'Cause I will always be there  
Oh my little one  
Let your love flow  
  
My little one  
Like a flower you'll grow  
Someday you'll have your own little one  
And you will always be there  
  
My little one...
