We used to get crazy ev'ry Saturday night  
We'd drive into town and get feelin' right  
A child of the sixties in seventy four  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
Well I burned the tires off my chevrolet  
Tryin' to impress the girls that I date  
And I'd bet a gambler when I couldn't score  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not that way anymore  
Time's closin' yesterday's door  
But I'm just as happy as I was before  
Cause I'm not that way anymore  
  
American bandstand, the sullivan show  
I listened to the opry on my ra--dee---I--o  
Well dick clark's still lookin' as young as before  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
Well I swapped my loafers for cowboy boots  
Bought me some jeans gave away all my suits  
My razor is rusted, my barber is poor  
'Cause I'm not that way anymore  
  
I'm not that way anymore  
We're not that way anymore
