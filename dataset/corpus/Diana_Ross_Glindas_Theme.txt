Come over here and rest awhile  
Look at the trip you've made  
I know you must be tired by now  
So rest here in the shade  
  
Oh, the journey that you've had to make  
I've watched you bear the load  
But you can always stay at my place  
When you come off the road  
  
And if you ever need someone (need someone)  
Count on me anytime (you can count on me)  
I'll be here to pick you up  
Because a rested body is a rested mind  
Because a rested body is a rested mind  
(Because a rested body is a rested mind)  
A rested body is a rested mind
