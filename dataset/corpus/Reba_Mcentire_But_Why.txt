I can open doors all by myself  
And I'm strong enough to face this world  
Without anybody's help  
But why, why would I want to  
Why, when you love me like you do  
  
[Chorus]  
I could go on livin'  
Without tasting your kiss  
Get by without this moment  
You touching me like this, but why  
  
I could keep this feeling locked in my heart  
I could bury these emotions, and put up my guard  
But why, why start resisting  
Why, look at all I'd be missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But why would I do that  
I'd have to be crazy  
To give up all you give me  
What you do to me baby  
  
Oh I could go on livin'  
Without tasting your kiss  
Get by without this moment  
You touching me holding me and loving me  
Like this, but why  
Why would I want to baby  
Oh, why
