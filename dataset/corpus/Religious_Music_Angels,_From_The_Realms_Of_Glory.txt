Angels, from the realms of glory  
Wing your flight o'er all the earth  
Ye who sang creation's story  
Now proclaim Messiah's birth.  
  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ, the newborn King.  
  
Shepherds in the field abiding  
Watching o'er your flocks by night  
God with man is now residing  
Yonder shines the infant Light.  
  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ, the newborn King.  
  
Sages, leave your contemplations  
Brighter visions beam afar  
Seek the great Desire of nations  
Ye have seen his natal star.  
  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ, the newborn King.  
  
Saints before the altar bending  
Watching long in hope and fear  
Suddenly the Lord, descending  
In his temple shall appear.  
  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ, the newborn King.  
  
Though an infant now we view him  
He shall fill his Father's throne  
Gather all nations to him  
Every knee shall then bow down.  
  
Come and worship, come and worship  
Worship Christ, the newborn King...
