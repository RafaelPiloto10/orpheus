Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
The bottle is almost empty  
The clock just now struck ten  
Darlin' I had to call you  
To our favorite place again  
  
We know it's wrong for us to meet  
But the fire's gone out at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
Your lips are warm and tender  
Your arms hold me just right  
Sweet words of love you remember  
That the one at home forgot  
  
Each time we say is the last time  
But we keep hangin' on  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
Love is find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone
