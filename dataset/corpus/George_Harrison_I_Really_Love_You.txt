(Yeah)  
You, I really really love you  
Nobody else will do  
That's why I love you  
That's why, why, why  
  
(Yeah)  
You, I really really love you  
Nobody else will do  
That's why I love you  
That's why, why, why  
  
Well babe you know I love you so  
I'd pay the world if you could know  
And when I see, you're comin' down the street  
My heart skips (a) beat  
  
You, I really really need you  
But yet you play me for a fool  
Why do you do me like you do, do, do  
(Yeah)  
  
Well babe you know I love you so  
I'd pay the world if you could know  
And when I see, you're comin' down the street  
My heart skips (a) beat  
  
You, I really really need you  
But yet you play me for a fool  
Why do you do me like you do  
Why do you do me like you do  
Why, why
