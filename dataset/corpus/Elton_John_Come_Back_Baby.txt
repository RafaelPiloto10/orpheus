Come back, baby, come back to me, yeah  
And you will see yeah, how I've changed  
'Cause you're the only love I ever had  
You're the only love I ever had, come back to me  
  
Come back, baby, I did you wrong, yeah  
And this is the song I sing, I hope will bring you back to me  
You're the only love I ever knew, you're the only love I ever knew  
Come back come back  
  
Come back, baby  
Come back and treat me right  
Come back, baby  
Come on back, I'll hold you tight  
  
Come back, baby  
Come back I'll treat you right  
Come back, baby, come on back  
Come back and hold me tight  
  
Come back, baby  
Every thing's gonna be fine right now, yeah  
It's gonna be fine right now, yeah it's gonna be fine right now  
You're the only love I ever had and you're coming back  
And I'm so glad you're coming back to me  
  
Come back, baby
