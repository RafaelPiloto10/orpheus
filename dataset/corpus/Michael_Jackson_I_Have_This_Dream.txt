Verse 1  
  
Some people say  
I live in a fantasy  
Because I see the world  
Differently  
Visions come to me  
In my sleep  
I closed my eyes  
To see what God is showing me  
  
Close your eyes  
And imagine with me  
See the wonder  
In every living thing  
If we can live our lives  
The way it is in my dreams  
Love will take us to a place where  
God can be seen  
  
This is my dream  
  
I have this dream  
This I believe  
The world a place for all humanity  
If we could take love to it's highest level  
More than the world has ever seen  
I have this dream  
  
Verse 2  
  
Let's put Gods love opn display  
Angel of love come my way  
It really up to you and me  
One world together in harmony  
  
In my dream I see heaven  
And the face of the one perfect being  
I see people turning into angels  
And God giving them their wings  
  
This is my dream  
  
Chorus  
  
I have this dream  
This I believe  
The world's a place  
For all humanity  
  
If we could take love  
To it's highest level  
More than the world has ever seen  
I have this dream  
  
Repeat chorus
