Nowhere to go, nothing to see  
Except sand and sand and sand, and you and me  
  
Baked from the heat, we've got sun on all sides  
Getting tanned and tanned, like we're couple of hides  
  
Two lost nomads who will never be missed  
Some might interpret this  
As just a karmic slap on the wrist  
But I've just gotta say, it's a heck of a day to be us!  
  
It's a heck of a day to not have a car  
And just walk and walk and walk and not know where you are  
  
We've got no kind of map  
Nothing to shows us the way  
And it's just talk and talk and talk with nothing to say  
It's a heck of a day, heck of a day to be us!  
It's a heck of a day to be us!
