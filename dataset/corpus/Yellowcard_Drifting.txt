When I look into your eyes, I can see  
Such a sad man in disguise  
Waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me  
Hurts my heart to see you cry  
Waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me  
  
I don't know you anymore, wish I knew what's wrong  
Can't we try to slam that door, start a brand new song  
  
I know you're lonely and you cry, wondering why  
I know it's lonely but if once, you could help me understand  
What it takes to be a man  
Look back on what you've said, and the life you've led  
Is it what you dreamed when you were young like me.  
Now it's time you took something back  
Just for the sake of your mind.  
When I look into your eyes, I can see  
Life has buried you alive  
Waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting from me  
You can't breathe  
Heart as big as ocean's wide  
Waiting, wishing, dreaming, drifting
