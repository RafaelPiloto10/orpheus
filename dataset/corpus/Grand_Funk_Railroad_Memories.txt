I'm thinkin' 'bout my baby right now,  
And I'm feelin' sentimental.  
She's all I got in my memory,  
But it really isn't accidental.  
  
  
All I have are these memories,  
Memories keep haunting me.  
All I have are these memories,  
Memories keep haunting me.  
  
  
I think about her though she's gone from me,  
And I want to get her back sincerely.  
I pray to heaven she's alright tonight,  
'cause you know I love her, lover her dearly.  
But, ...  
  
  
All I have is this lonely song,  
Lonely song I'm singin' all night long.  
All I have are these memories,  
Memories keep haunting me.  
  
  
Oooooo, oooooo, oooooo ...  
Oooooo, oooooo, oooooo ...  
Oooooo, oooooo, oooooo ...  
Oh ...  
Oooooo, oooooo, oooooo ...  
  
  
All I have are these memories,  
Memories keep haunting me.  
All I have is this lonely song,  
Lonely song I'm singin' all night long.  
All I have are these memories,  
Memories keep haunting me.  
All I have is this lonely song,  
Lonely song I'm singin' all night long.  
(to fade ...)
