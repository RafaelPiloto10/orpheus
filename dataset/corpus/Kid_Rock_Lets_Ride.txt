Used as a scapegoat and taped to the wall  
Bruised and abused on some foreign soil  
Trained to kill baby, that's what we do  
And programmed to bleed red, white and blue  
  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonight's the night, we fight or die  
  
Grab your guns son, said we headed for war  
Like your uncle JT done years before  
No pussy, no dope, this ain't Saigon  
But keep your heads up for roadside bombs  
  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonight's the night, we fight or die  
  
Even in darkness, you're my strength, my soul, my will to survive  
But in this fight I stand ready to die  
  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon, yeah  
  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa
