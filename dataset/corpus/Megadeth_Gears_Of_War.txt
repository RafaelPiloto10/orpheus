(Gears of war, gears of war, gears of war, gears of war)  
  
Ethnic cleansing with no defending  
These acts of genocide  
A fatal ending with no surrendering  
To cover up the crimes and lies  
  
Smart bombs, precision guided armament  
A more sophisticated way to end up dead  
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons  
That kill each other like the gears of war  
(Gears of war, gears of war)  
Ho-rah!  
(Gears of war, gears of war)  
  
When you ride with thieves, then you die with thieves  
Cross my heart and hope that you die (that you die)  
When the smoke has cleared, the devil's in the mirror  
And you see his warheads paint the sky, now you die!  
  
Smart bombs, precision guided armament  
A more sophisticated way to end up dead  
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons  
That kill each other like the gears of war
