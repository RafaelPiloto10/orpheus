Maybe I'm just a ghost  
Disappear when anybody's close  
Go through you when you try to hold  
Try to hold me near  
  
Maybe I'm just a ghost  
Emptier than anybody knows  
Maybe I'm on the ropes  
Or I'm not even here  
  
Yeah!  
  
Every time I try to walk through walls  
More walls appear  
What's the point of feeling love for you  
When you don't believe I'm here?  
What's the point of trying to raise your voice  
If no one ever hears?  
Every time I try to pull you close  
You disappear  
  
Maybe I'm a ghost  
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke  
A secret that nobody knows  
No one will ever hear  
  
Or maybe I'm a ghost  
A specter on a roller coaster  
A thorn without a rose  
Just something people fear  
  
Yeah!  
  
And every time I thought I walk through walls  
It's all become clear  
What's the point of feeling love for you  
When you don't believe I'm here?  
What's the point saying "Rescue me!"  
If no one ever hears?  
Every time I try to pull you close  
You disappear  
Every time I try to pull you close  
You disappear  
  
And every time I thought I walk through walls  
It's all become clear  
Every time I try to pull you close  
You disappear  
  
Every time I try to pull you close  
You disappear
