I've got you on my mind, I'm feeling kind of sad and low.  
Got you on my mind, feeling kind of sad and low.  
I'm wondering where you are, wondering why you had to go.  
  
Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name.  
Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name.  
But since you went away, nothing seems to be the same.  
  
No matter how I try,  
My heart just don't see why  
I can't forget you.  
If ever it should be  
You want to come back to me,  
You know I'd let you.  
  
I've got you on my mind, I'm feeling kind of sad and low.  
Got you on my mind, feeling kind of sad and low.  
I'm wondering where you are, wondering why you had to go.  
  
Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name.
