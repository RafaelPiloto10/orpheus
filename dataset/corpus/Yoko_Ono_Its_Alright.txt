"mummy! mummy! mummy!"  
"uh-hmm? "  
"mummy!"  
"uh-hmm? "  
"mummy! you have to wake up!"  
"yes, yes, I know..."  
"ma, you have to wake up!"  
"I know..."  
Sometimes it's such a drag,  
I don't feel like getting up in the morning.  
Then something happens, it clicks in my head,  
I feel like crying,  
But I know it's gonna be alright.  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,  
I know it's gonna be alright.  
Sometimes, I'm so afraid, (I'm so, I'm so scared)  
I don't feel like facing the world.  
Then something happens, it clicks in my head,  
I feel like crying,  
I know it's gonna be alright.  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,  
I know it's gonna be alright.  
I guess I'm not the only one, (not the only one in misery)  
There many of us around.  
So when you're feeling down, (down)  
Hold your heart and say, it's gonna be alright.  
Hold your heart and it'll be alright.  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,  
Yes, yes, yes, it's gonna be, it's gonna be alright,  
It's gonna be alright, yes.  
I guess I'm not the only one, (not the only one in history)  
There many of us in history.  
So when you're feeling down, (down)  
Hold your heart and say, it's gonna be alright.  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,  
I know it's gonna be alright.  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,  
I know it's gonna be alright.  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright,  
We're gonna make it, alright.  
(it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, alright)  
(it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, alright).
