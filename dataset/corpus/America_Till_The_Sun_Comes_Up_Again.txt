Think I'll write a different song  
Got a feeling it might take a long time  
Singin' it over again, I can't recall just how it used to be  
Voices across the sea  
Mm, mm, mm.  
  
Will she come to me, to keep me company  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
  
Gotta take the good with the bad  
Sometimes I wish I never had my say  
Always goes that way, or is it just the way I feel today?  
Voices across the way  
Mm, mm, mm.  
  
Will she come to me, to keep me company  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again
