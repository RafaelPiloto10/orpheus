Looks like I'll go on through my life bound in sorrow  
I'm a loser right from the start  
Now I've lost the only one I really loved  
And I'm bound to this pain in my heart  
I am bound because I am so much in love with you  
And I know that this love's all in vain  
When you let anyone have the love you say is mine  
It proves to me I'm a loser again  
I am bound with so many sweet memories of you  
What more can a poor loser do ?  
I can't change your ways, I can't make you love me more  
I am bound to this crave I have for you  
I was bound to lose you when I first fell in love with you  
I thought I'd try and love again  
Oh, I lost, but kept my chin up and I would pull through every time  
But losing you has laid my head in my hands
