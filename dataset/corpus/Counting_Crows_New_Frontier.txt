(come on children, mind the gap)  
  
Miracle people with marvelous hair  
And a knack to do anything  
Better than anyone  
I got a home with electrical air  
And I live in a world  
Smaller than any one  
I got a line a new frontier  
I got a line on a new America  
All of the people are vanishing here  
I could be huge if I could just get from  
  
The outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
  
Purest Aluminum people  
Are walking the streets of London  
So hysterical  
Nobody here gets a word that I say  
And the problems I'm told,  
Are more than medical  
I got a friend from the new frontier  
And Galen, she says,  
"this is not america"  
You need a girl with electrical hair  
And the word that you wanted was al-you-mi-ni-um  
  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside  
  
I was in bed with  
The girl at the end of the world  
She says I'm goin' home  
And you should come home too  
I'm at the end of a new frontier  
Here at the edge of the flat earth ending  
I'm getting off to get lost in the air  
At the end of the world where the light is bending  
  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you
