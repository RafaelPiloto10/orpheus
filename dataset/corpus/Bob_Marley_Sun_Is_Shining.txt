Sun is shining, the weather is sweet  
Make you want to move your dancing feet  
To the rescue, here I am  
Want you to know ya, where I stand  
  
(Monday morning) here I am  
Want you to know just if you can  
(Tuesday evening) where I stand  
(Wednesday morning) tell myself a new day is rising  
(Thursday evening) get on the rise a new day is dawning  
(Friday morning) here I am  
(Saturday evening) want you to know just  
Want you to know just where I stand  
  
When the morning gathers the rainbow  
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too  
So, to the rescue here I am  
Want you to know just if you can  
Where I stand, know, know, know, know, know  
  
We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises  
We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises, yeah  
  
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet now  
Make you want to move your dancing feet  
To the rescue, here I am  
Want you to know just if you can  
Where I stand, know, know, know, where I stand  
  
Monday morning, scoo-be-doop-scoop-scoop  
Tuesday evening, scoo-be-doop-scoop-scoop  
Wednesday morning, scoo-be-doop-scoop-scoop  
Thursday evening, scoo-be-doop-scoop-scoop  
Friday morning, scoo-be-doop-scoop-scoop  
Saturday evening, scoo-be-doop-scoop-scoop  
  
So to the rescue, to the rescue, to the rescue  
Awake from your sleep and slumber  
Today could be your lucky number  
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
