Love is a glass of wine  
It's balanced on the side-rail of a ship  
Across the sea as midnight comes, it may not last till daylight comes  
And the trip is long  
And the waves are strong  
But then again, it might be up there forever  
I've heard of birds that never touch the land  
But sleep on the wind  
And if I'm touched by someone's careless hand  
Asleep on the wind  
Our lives might last until the journey's end  
Alive  
Alive  
  
Our lives are just bubbles of time  
They're rainbow-colored and shining in the sun  
They drift above the treetops now  
In danger that the breeze drops somehow  
And darling, that's all it would take  
Yet we threaten not to break  
Then again we could be up here forever  
I've heard of birds that never touch the land  
But sleep on the wind  
And I'm untouched by someone's careless hand  
Asleep on the wind  
Our lives might last until the love begins  
  
So stay alive and let me try as hard as you do  
To stay alive, please let me be as much alive as you  
Alive  
Alive  
Alive
