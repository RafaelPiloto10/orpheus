Yeeeah...  
Yak goa goa...  
I got a wild thing for you  
We're talkin' hoops you got me jumpin' thru  
You got those lemon drop martini eyes  
And if my karma suits you  
Cross the line into another place and time  
Tell me how pretty she is  
When she turns the colors of the rainbow  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'... yeah  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Ain't no smokin' fantasy  
'Cuz lovin' you is trippin' to me  
You got me psychodelisized  
You got my situation bone-a-fide  
It took a sunset to get me to see  
That all I really needed was your love  
To yeah forever shine on me  
Promise promiscuity is like waiting for your ex-to-see that  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'... yeah  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Get my way with you...trip hoppin'  
In my kaleidoscope I'm lookin' thru  
My only color was a neon blue  
I was hangin' on to yesterday  
And now the only way out is thru  
One more night with you  
(One more night with you)  
One more day won't do  
(One more day won't do)  
Yeah  
How beyond the rainbow is my  
Laying on your emerald pillow  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Yeah...yeah  
Ain't no smokin' fantasy  
'Cuz lovin' you is trippin' to me  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'  
Trip hoppin' trip hoppin'...  
One more night with you... no stoppin'  
Trip hoppin' trip hoppin'...  
Get my way with you...trip hoppin'  
Trip hoppin' trip hoppin'...  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'  
Trip hoppin' trip hoppin'...  
One more night with you  
One more day won't do  
One more night with you  
One more day won't do  
One more night with you  
One more day
