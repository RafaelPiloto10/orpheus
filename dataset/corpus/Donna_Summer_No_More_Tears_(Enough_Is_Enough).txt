[Barbra Streisand]  
It's raining, it's pouring  
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years  
  
[Donna Summer]  
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance  
We don't stand a chance  
  
[Barbra]  
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover  
But he turned out to be like every other man  
Our love, our love  
  
[Both]  
Raining (raining)  
Pouring (pouring)  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waist another tear  
  
[Donna]  
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it  
  
[Barbra]  
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it  
  
[Donna]  
Tell him to just get out,  
  
[Barbra]  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
[Donna]  
Pack his raincoat show him out  
  
[Both]  
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:  
Enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
[Donna]  
If you've reached the end, don't pretend that is right when it's over  
  
[Barbra]  
(It's over)  
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over  
  
[Donna]  
(Over, over)  
  
[Both]  
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
[Barbra]  
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,  
But he turns out to be like every other man  
Our love (I had no choice from the start)  
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)  
Our love (Tearing us apart)  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
[Both]  
No more tears (No more tears)  
No more tears (No more tears)  
No more tears (No more tears)  
No more tears (No more tears)  
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
I've had it, you've had it he's had it, we've had is  
  
[Donna]  
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,  
  
[Barbra]  
But he turned out to be like every other man  
  
[Both]  
I had no choice from the start  
I've gotta listen to my heart  
Tearing us apart  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister  
Goodbye sugar  
  
It's raining, it's pouring,  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waist another tear  
  
No more tears  
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
Is enough!
