Well, it's been building up inside of me  
For oh, I don't know how long  
I don't know why but I keep thinking  
Something's bound to go wrong  
She looks in my eyes  
And makes me realize when she says  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
  
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut  
When I start to brag about my car  
But I can't back down now  
Because I've pushed the other guys too far  
She makes me come alive  
And makes me wanna drive when she says  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
  
She told me, "Baby, when you race today  
Just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I love you, baby  
Nothing could go wrong with you"  
Oh, what she does to me  
When she makes love to me and she says  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
Don't worry baby  
(Don't worry baby)  
Everything will turn out all right  
(Don't worry baby)  
(Don't worry baby)
