I saw you with that girl last night  
The both of you were making eyes  
You did it right in front of my face  
As if I had no pride  
  
And now you're always working late  
You never have much time for me  
And you're expecting me to believe  
That you're not out with she  
  
Tonight I give you my surprise  
I hope that you won't mind  
I'm giving you an eye for an eye  
Baby I've found another  
  
And he is my lover  
And I'm going out for the rest of your life  
  
I betcha never thought I'd go that far  
I betcha never thought I'd break your heart  
I betcha never even thought at all  
I betcha never, no you never  
  
I know that everybody lies, that I know I can't deny  
But what if they're intentional  
The intention of your crimes  
Cause I know how much that I can take  
  
I know my heart demands a change  
If I can't have my way, then all I have to say  
Tonight, I give you my surprise  
In return for all the lies  
I'm giving you and eye for an eye  
Baby I've found another  
  
And he is my lover  
And we're going away for the rest of your life
