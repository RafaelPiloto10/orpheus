Deep waters flow, out to the sea,  
They never needed you or me.  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Blue mountains high and valley low,  
I don't know which way I should go,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Warm summer breeze blows endlessly,  
Touching the hearts of those who feel,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Bird on wing goes floating by,  
But there's a teardrop in his eye,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
One summer dream, one summer dream.
