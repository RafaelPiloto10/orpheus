You don't't need to give me reasons  
I understand  
Somethings are best kept secret  
And you've done all you can  
I want no recompense  
Just as much as you can give of yourself  
If that makes sense  
  
I'll keep it confidential  
It's secret, confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential  
Between you and me  
  
Go on tell me that you love me  
Show me you dare  
We may not venture out in public  
At least I know, you care  
It can't be guaranteed  
Just give me what you can of yourself  
That's all I need  
  
I'll keep it confidential  
It's secret, confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential  
Between you and me  
  
No one will know who I am  
I think it's possible only to love  
  
You play such silly games  
But if everyone knew about us I'd feel no shame
