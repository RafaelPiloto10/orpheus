I've seen him as he awakens in the morning  
He reaches out his hand and without a word  
As his fingers softly fall upon my face  
He lights the flame of desire and makes me want him.  
  
Chorus:  
Love is the foundation we lean on and all you need is love to ease your mind.  
It doesn't have to be right to be called love  
When he gives me more lovin' that a lifetime of looking could ever find.  
(repeat)
