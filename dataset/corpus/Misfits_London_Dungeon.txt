They called us walking corpses  
Unholy living dead  
They had to lock us up  
Put us in their British hell  
  
Make sure your face is clean now  
Can't have no dirty dead  
All the corpses here are clean, boy  
All the Yanks in British hell  
  
I don't want to be here in your London Dungeon  
I don't want to be here in your British hell  
Ain't no mystery why I'm in misery in Hell  
Here's hoping you're swell
