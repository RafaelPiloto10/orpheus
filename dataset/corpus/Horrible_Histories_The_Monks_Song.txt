Welcome to our monastery  
Please have a chair  
Good to see you monks  
So deep in prayer  
Once the praying's finished  
Your chores must be done  
The main rule of a good monk's life is no fun  
  
We have to pray eight times a day  
Seven days a week  
And copy all these manuscripts  
In writing so antique  
I'll finish off this letter 'a'  
Once I've ploughed our field  
Milked the cows, mucked the sows, vegetables peeled  
  
I'll be doing that and praying too  
Very well gents, I'll bid you adieu  
Advenium regnum tuum  
  
(Okay brothers, I think he's gone)  
  
Now the bishop's not around  
Throw off these religious gowns  
Hunky, chunky, funky monks  
Get down!  
  
It's not all hymns and prayin'  
It's not all work and no playin'  
So let's start misbehavin'  
And get with the funk!  
  
We love to have a party  
Eat food that is hearty  
Let's get the boozin' started  
Drunk like a monk!  
Play that monky music, funk boy!  
  
Just wanted to check  
That during my absence  
You're honouring your  
Mealtime vow of silence  
  
Althought we didn't oughter  
We liked to hunt and slaughter  
Don't need no bread and water  
Just funk, funk, funk!  
  
Monastery is jumpin'  
Party beat is thumpin'  
Just lacks a certain somethin'  
A funky nun!  
Get in the party habit, girlfriend!  
  
It's true that life  
Is tough here  
But you obey the rules  
That is clear  
That's why we're a place  
Of great repute  
What's this?  
I see we have a new recruit  
Welcome to our monastery  
What's your name?  
  
She- he can't talk  
And his name is... Wayne  
Amen!  
Ah men!
