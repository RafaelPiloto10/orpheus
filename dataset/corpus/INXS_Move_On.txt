Hey, shake it, shake it, shake it  
There's a monkey on my back  
Been there much too long  
Every time I kick it off  
Another one comes along  
  
I used to be in another world  
I used to be alone  
It's so hard to be yourself  
When you feel like something's wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
There are no words that could explain  
You gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
There are no words that could explain  
You gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
  
She said "I've had enough of your lies  
Can't wait for anyone  
The beginning of the end  
Don't you know that's all wrong  
When you said nothing changes  
you meant to say it won't take long"  
  
I used to be in another world  
I used to be alone  
It's so hard to be yourself  
When you feel like something's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Move it  
  
Move on  
  
There's a question in my head  
Been there all night long  
Well I toss and turn inside my head  
But I won't let it tear me down  
  
Yeah, used to be in another world  
I used to be alone, yeah  
  
There are no words that could explain  
The strongest love in vain  
Oh you gotta move on  
There are no words that could explain  
You gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
There are no words that could explain  
Oh you gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
  
Had enough, oh, gotta move on, yeah  
There are no words that could explain  
The strongest love in vain
