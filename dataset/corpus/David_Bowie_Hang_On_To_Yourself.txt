Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the show tonight  
Praying to the light machine  
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh collector  
Layin' on 'lectric dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
So come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going  
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it  
You better hang on to yourself  
  
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play  
But then we move like tigers on vaseline  
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar  
You're the blessed, we're the spiders from Mars  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
Come on, ah, come on, ah (repeat ad inf.)
