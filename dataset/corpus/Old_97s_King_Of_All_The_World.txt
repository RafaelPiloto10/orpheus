I was in a real bad way  
When you turned the power on  
And you made me feel for all the world  
Like I was the king of all the world  
  
I was on a window ledge  
When you came upon me there  
Everything was upside for the moment  
Right around the time I had to get going  
  
Can't count me out  
'Cause I've got your number  
You make me feel like I'm  
The king of all of the world  
King of all of the world  
The king of all of the world  
  
Now I'm on my way up north  
All its gonna do is rain  
And I'm gonna want to go back to the world  
Where I was the king of all of the world  
  
Can't count me out  
'Cause I've got your number  
You make me feel like I'm  
The king of all of the world  
King of all of the world  
The king of all of the world  
  
I was in a real bad way  
When you turned the power on  
And you made me feel so right at home  
I wonder if I'm ever gonna get back home  
  
Can't count me out  
'Cause I've got your number  
You make me feel like I'm  
The king of all of the world  
King of all of the world  
The king of all of the world  
  
If I wander out  
Of a picture window
