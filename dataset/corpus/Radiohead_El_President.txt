It came from the skies  
It burst throught the gates  
With no mercy or disguise  
With their hearts set out in flames  
I know I've seen the master plan  
  
Well I'm just a man  
I'm not giving in  
All the people understand  
For they all fell down and prayed  
I know I've seen the master plan  
  
They've killed the president  
They've killed the president  
  
It came from the skies  
In all shades of green  
We can always justify  
We can measure up your dreams  
I know I've seen the master plan  
  
They've killed the president  
They've killed the president  
They've killed the president  
They've killed the president  
They've killed the president  
They've killed the president  
  
I'm just a man
