She said, "It's lonely here tonight"  
She's always sad when she's alone  
She said "I need you here tonight"  
She couldn't wait 'til I get home  
She loves me  
And that's all I need to know  
She's part of my life  
Just a part I won't let go  
  
Then she said  
"Love me tomorrow  
Won't you please, promise me  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
Hurry back, can't you see  
I need you more than yesterday"  
  
You know it's always cold at night  
It's always lonely 'til the dawn  
You know it's not what we put on  
Knowing she's there, I'll carry on  
Because she loves me  
And that's all I need ato know  
She's part of my life  
Just a part I won't let go  
  
Then she said  
"Love me tomorrow  
Won't you please, promise me  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
Hurry back, can't you see  
I need you more than any words could say"  
  
She loves me  
And that's all I need to know  
She's part of my life  
Just a part I won't let go  
  
Then she said  
"Love me tomorrow  
Won't you please, promise me  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
Hurry back, can't you see  
Need you much more than yesterday  
Love me tomorrow  
Hurry back, can't you see  
Need you much more than yesterday  
Love me tomorrow  
Love me tomorrow like today  
Love me tomorrow  
I need you much more than yesterday  
Love me tomorrow  
Love me tomorrow like today"
