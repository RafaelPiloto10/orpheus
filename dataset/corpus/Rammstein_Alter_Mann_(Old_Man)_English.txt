He waits on the midday's wind  
The wave comes and lies down wearily  
With a fan every day  
The old one makes the water smooth  
  
I throw the stone for fun  
The water moves in circles  
The old one looks sadly at me  
And swept it smooth again  
  
In the white sand, the old man  
Trembling, smokes his pipe  
Only the water and I know  
Why he needs this fan  
  
The idea sleeps like a volcano  
Hesitating, I asked him then  
His head bent, it seemed he slept  
He said before he died  
  
The water shall be your mirror  
If it is smooth you will see  
How many fairy tales remain for you  
And you will plead for your redemption  
  
The fan pressed against his body  
The hand stiffens with rigor mortis  
They had to break his fingers  
The fan remains back in the sand  
  
I call the old one every day  
He would like to redeem me  
I remain back in the midday's wind  
And I can read in the fan  
  
The water shall be your mirror  
If it is smooth you will see  
How many fairy tales remain for you  
And you will plead for your redemption
