Destiny  
Has once again surprised me  
Oh destiny  
Must want you here beside me  
Quietly  
Like the sunrise with its splendor  
Unexpectedly  
With a passion strong yet tneder  
You draw me in  
Lke the moon draws the tide  
Swept away by this love  
Taken in by your eyes  
If I had to walk away from you  
I know that it would be no use  
'Cause you're so deep inside of me  
Can't deny  
I never want to be set free  
The more you give the more I need  
You can't change what is meant to be  
No you can't change destiny  
Destiny  
Destiny  
Speakd with many voices  
So eventually  
We're obliged to make some choices  
Oh destiny  
Who I thought I owned completely  
Just to toy with me  
Made me fall in love so deeply  
You fill my soul  
Like the sears fill the sky  
Brought to life  
This nnew world  
Where I'm held captive inside  
If I had to walk away from you  
I know that it would be no use  
'Cause you're so deep inside of me  
Can't deny  
I never want to be set free  
The more you give the more I need  
You can't change what is meant to be  
No, you can't change destiny  
If I had to walk away from you  
I know that it would be no use  
No you can't change destiny  
Destiny  
Destiny  
Destiny...
