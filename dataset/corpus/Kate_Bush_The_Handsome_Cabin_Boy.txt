'Tis of a pretty female  
As you may understand  
Her mind being bent for rambling  
Unto some foreign land  
She dressed herself in sailor's clothes  
Or so it does appear  
And she hired with a captain  
To serve him for a year  
Her cheeks - they were like roses  
And her hair rolled in a curl  
The sailors often smiled and said  
He looked just like a girl  
But eating of the captain's biscuit  
Her colour did destroy  
And the waist did swell of pretty Nell  
The handsome cabin boy  
'Twas in the bay of Biscay  
Our gallant ship did plow  
One night among the sailors  
Was a fearful flurry and row.  
They tumbled from their hammocks  
For their sleep it did destroy  
And they sworn about the groaning  
Of the handsome cabin boy  
"Oh doctor, dear, oh doctor,"  
The cabin boy did cry  
"My time has come, I am undone  
And I will surely die."  
The doctor come a-runnin'  
And a-smilin' at the fun  
To think a sailor lad should have  
A daughter or a son  
The sailors when they saw the joke  
They all did stand and stare  
The child belonged to none of them  
They solemnly did swear  
The captain's wife, she says to him  
"My dear, I wish you joy  
For 'tis either you or me's betrayed  
The handsome cabin boy!"
