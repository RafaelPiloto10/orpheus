Wow, I'm sick of doubt  
Live in the life of certain, south, cruel bindings  
The servants have the power  
Dog men and they're mean women  
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors  
  
I'm sick of dour faces staring at me from the tv tower  
I want roses in my garden bower, dig?  
Royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted strangers in the mud  
These mutants blood meal, the plant that's ploughed  
  
They are waiting to take us into the severed garden  
You know how pale, wanton, thrillful comes death  
In the strange hour  
Unannounced, unplanned for  
Like the scary over friendly guest you bought to bed  
  
Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings  
Where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws  
  
No more money, no more fancy dress  
This other kingdom seems by far the best  
Until it's other jaw reveals incest  
And lose obedience to a vegetable  
  
I will not go  
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family
