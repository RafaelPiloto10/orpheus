[Chorus]  
Never been closer to heaven  
Never been further away  
Never been closer to heaven  
Never been further away  
  
Give me hope  
Give me all your love  
Tell me now  
You're coming home tonight  
Have some faith  
In the love we share  
Is it fate?  
Does darkness end in light?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where'd you go?  
Did you lose your way?  
Tell me now  
You're coming back to stay  
In my hopes  
Paradise is real  
Horoscopes  
Can't forecast how we'll feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me hope  
Give me hope  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me hope  
Give me hope
