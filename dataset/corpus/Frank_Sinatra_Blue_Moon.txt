Blue Moon  
You saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue Moon  
You know just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked to the Moon it turned to gold  
  
Blue Moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the Moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own
