If I had a perfect day  
I would have it start this way  
Open up the fridge and have a tall boy  
Yeah  
  
Then I'd meet up with my friends  
Head out to the game again  
We don't even really care who wins (hey) wins (hey) 1, 2, 3  
  
[Chorus]  
Now excitement seems to grow  
When we're hangin' with the bro's  
When we're chillin' and we pound  
A case of stroh's  
Now the game is cool to see  
You can high five on TV  
Count the riot on the 1, 2, 3  
Operation is in sight  
And the field is open wide  
When you break it then you know you're still alive  
If the cops don't make you pay  
And you make your getaway  
Then you know  
That's one fine day  
  
On that day before we're through  
We could torch a car or two  
Then have ourselves another tall boy  
Yeah  
  
Water hoses and batons  
That's the real game that's on  
I don't really give a shit who wins (hey) wins (hey) 1, 2, 3  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe it's my God-given right  
To destroy everything in my sight  
'cause it never gets dull  
It never gets old (whoa-oh)  
The only thing it gets is more bold (whoa-oh-oh)  
Drinkin', fightin', going to the game (whoa-oh)  
In our world it's a way to stay sane (whoa-oh-oh)  
If you're asking me (whoa-oh-oh-oh)  
To have it my way (whoa-oh)  
I'd say that's one fine day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then you know that it's one fine day  
(Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey)
