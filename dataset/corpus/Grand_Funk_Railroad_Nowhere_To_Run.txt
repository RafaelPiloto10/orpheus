Nowhere to run to, baby  
I got nowhere to hide  
I got nowhere to run to, baby  
Nowhere to hide  
It's not love that I'm runnin' from  
It's the heartbreak I know will come  
'Cause I know, you're no good for me  
But you've become a part of me  
Everywhere I go  
Your face I see  
Every step I take  
You take with me, yeah  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide from you baby  
I've got nowhere to run to, baby  
Nowhere to hide  
Now I know  
You're no good for me  
But free from you  
I'll never be, no  
Each night as I sleep  
Into my heart you creep  
I wake up feeling sorry I met you  
Hoping soon that I'll forget you  
When I look in the mirror  
To comb my hair  
I see your face  
Just a-smilin' there  
Nowhere to run to, baby  
Nowhere to hide  
I got nowhere to run to, baby  
Nowhere to hide  
Now I know  
You're no good for me  
But you've become  
A part of me, now  
How can I find a love  
When it shouldn't be?  
When it's so deep, it's so deep  
Deep inside of me  
Oh, reaches so high  
I can't get over it  
It's so wide  
I can't get around it, no  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide from you, baby  
I just can't get away from you baby  
No matter how I try  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to runnin' high
