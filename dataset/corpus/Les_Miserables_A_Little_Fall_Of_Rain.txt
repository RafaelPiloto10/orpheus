Eponine  
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius  
I don't feel any pain  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt me now  
You're here, that's all I need to know  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
And rain will make the flowers grow.  
  
Marius  
But you will live, 'Ponine - dear God above...  
If I could heal your wounds with words of love...  
  
Eponine  
Just hold me now, and let it be.  
Shelter me, comfort me...  
  
Marius  
You would live  
A hundred years  
If I could show you how  
I won't desert you now...  
  
Eponine  
The rain can't hurt me now  
This rain will wash away what's past  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
I'll sleep in your embrace at last  
The rain that brings you here  
Is Heaven-blessed!  
The skies begin to clear  
And I'm at rest  
A breath away from where you are  
I've come home from so far Marius [in counterpoint]  
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius  
I don't feel any pain  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt me now  
Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine  
You won't feel any pain  
A little fall of rain  
Can hardly hurt you now  
I'm here  
That's all I need to know  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
And rain  
Will make the flowers... I will stay with you  
Till you are sleeping  
And rain  
Will make the flowers...  
Grow.  
  
Eponine  
The rain can't hurt me now  
This rain will wash away what's past  
And you will keep me safe  
And you will keep me close  
I'll sleep in your embrace at last  
The rain that brings you here  
Is Heaven-blessed!

[She dies. Marius kisses her, then lays her on the ground.]  
  
Enjolras  
She is the first to fall  
The first of us to fall upon this barricade  
  
Marius  
Her name was Eponine  
Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid.  
  
Combeferre  
We fight here in her name  
  
Prouvaire  
She will not die in vain.  
  
Lesgles  
She will not be betrayed.  
  
[They carry her body off.]
