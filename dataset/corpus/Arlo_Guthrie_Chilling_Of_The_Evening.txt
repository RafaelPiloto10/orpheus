Warm me from the wind and take my haand  
A song is sounding, softly singing  
My song is cast upon the rainbow waves  
Forever splashing in the sunlight  
Prove to me there's a love still left  
In all of this emptiness around me  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
Though you know my love that I must go  
A-following the winds that blow inside me  
I've nowhere left to run or hide  
Except if you will come and run beside me  
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do  
To keep believing  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
And now my time has come down many streets  
I'm coming from a night decaying  
The song that itself sings is all alone  
I cannot even hear it playing  
Now to leave before I understand  
Just what it is I'm leaving  
Take me from the chilling of the evening
