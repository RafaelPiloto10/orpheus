When I left my home  
I was not much more than a child,  
My mother started crying  
She knew that I was born to be wild  
  
'Cuse I was looking for the bright lights of the big city,  
A red hot town where the girls are pretty  
  
I took to the highway,  
Chasing my dream down the line  
Heading out for trouble,  
Never finding my peace of mind  
'Cause I been run out of town so many times before  
An' usually kind of places where I can't go back no more  
  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
  
I never find it easy trying to keep the feeling alive,  
I've always been a dreamer,  
Dreamers find it hard to survive  
When they're living in the bright lights of the big city,  
A red hot town where the girls are pretty  
  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
  
Outlaw, born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Born outside of the law,  
Just another outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun  
Outlaw, outlaw,  
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
