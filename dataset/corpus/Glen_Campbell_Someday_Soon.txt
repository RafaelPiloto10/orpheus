Now there's a young girl that I know and her age is twenty-one  
She comes from down in southern Colorado  
I just got out of the service and I'm looking for some fun  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon  
Her parents could not like me cause I rides the rodeo  
Her father thinks that I will leave her crying  
But I know she would follow me right down the roughest road  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon  
And when I come to call her pa ain't got a good word to say  
Guess it's cause he's just as wild in his younger days  
So blow you ol' blue northern and blow me on my way  
I'm driving in tonight from California  
I love my damned old rodeo almost as much as I love her  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon
