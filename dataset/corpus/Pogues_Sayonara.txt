OK, it's time for Sayonara  
So long yankee break my heart  
Now there's nothing left but sorrow  
Even the best friends they must part  
  
I walked into the nearest bar  
I sat and gazed across the sea  
I wandered lonely on the beach  
The waves just whispered misery  
  
She had a red red scarf  
Around her neck  
Her eyes were green  
Her hair was black  
She had a red red scarf  
Around her neck  
Her eyes were green  
Her hair was black  
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey  
Ooh she gave me Hong Kong Flu  
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey  
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu  
  
(Som-yat-zu, som-yat-zu)  
  
I got new papers in a bordello  
With some luckies and my I.D.  
My heart was pounding like a hammer  
Thai Thai Thai Thai Thai! I am free  
  
She kissed me softly on the lips  
She took my hand without a sound  
This was our happy ever after  
So motherfucker kiss the ground
