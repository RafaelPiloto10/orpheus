Let it be known  
Dreaming hotel  
We just had a quarrel  
I sent you away  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone  
Called you on the phone  
But there was no answer  
Will you never return?  
Will you never want me?  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean  
It was so dismal  
Women all standing  
With shock on their faces  
Sad description  
Oh, I was looking for you  
  
Everyone was singing  
Girl is washed up  
On Redondo Beach  
And everyone is so sad  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Hey little girl  
Everyone cried  
How she was the victim of suicide  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean  
It was so dismal  
Women all standing  
With shock on their faces  
Sad description  
Oh, I was looking for you  
  
Desk clerk told me  
A girl is washed up  
Was small, an angel  
With apple blond hair now  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Picked up my key  
And I didn't reply  
I just went into my room  
And I started to cry  
It was morning, angel  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean  
It was so dismal  
I was just standing  
With shock on my face though  
The hearse pulled away  
And the girl that had died it was you  
You'll never return  
Into my arms  
You'll never return  
Into my arms  
You'll never return  
Into my arms  
'Cause you're gone, gone  
Gone, gone  
Gone, gone  
Oh goodbye
