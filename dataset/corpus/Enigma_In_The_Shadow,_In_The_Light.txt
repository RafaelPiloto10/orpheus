I promise you, for all my life  
I'll be always on your side  
In the shadow, in the light  
  
I'll follow you, wherever life goes  
But I'll always be aside  
In the shadow, in the light  
  
But if we don't understand  
Hell is happy, heaven is sad  
And that's the result of our brain  
Insane  
  
Caravan of life  
By day and by night  
Every tile's a part of life  
If it's shadow, or if it's light  
  
I promise you, even when the tide is high  
I'll be always on your side  
In the shadow, in the light
