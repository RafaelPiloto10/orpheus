Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable  
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable  
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing  
I Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring  
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that  
Yo Z you was packin? You know was strapped  
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em  
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim  
They kept coming, just like I figured  
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas  
What a way to go out, out like a sucker  
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train  
that can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing  
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing  
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross  
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast  
Givin best wishes to the best MC  
And when the spot is blown and yo you know it's me  
Because I'm housin'  
'Cause I'm housin'  
Because I'm housin'  
'Cause I'm housin'  
Because I'm housin'  
  
Because I'm housin'  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
'Cause I'm housin'  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
'Cause I'm housin'  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
'Cause I'm housin'  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
  
Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco  
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco  
Move  
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco  
Gimme the cue, check one two  
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo  
You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild  
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul  
MC's, you know who you are  
On the bandwagon Why Z? 'cause you a star  
This is the year when the joker's are wild  
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style  
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens  
If it gets wild, then I start cappin  
But for now, since everything's calm  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
Because I'm housin  
'Cause I'm housin  
Because I'm housin  
  
Come on  
  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
'Cause I'm housin  
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb  
Because I'm housin  
  
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter,  
relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin)  
'Cause I'm housin
