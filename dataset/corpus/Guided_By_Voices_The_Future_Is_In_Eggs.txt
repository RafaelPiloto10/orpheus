??Roses before sign??  
This one pushed his weight  
??Day the chain??  
Dogs barking, the sign flashing  
Come one and all to the execution  
Shot shot bang go  
??clothing?? to films we  
??Die string to sadist??(I have no clue here)  
And pirate's coffee  
Computer ??the fat birds??  
??Loafing on bringlers??  
Floating on a leg  
Pissing from a keg  
The future is in eggs, the future is in eggs  
Spying without ??chim??  
Choking out a grin  
??Splitting?? kids in cub scout suits  
Are crushed by marching army boots  
Their fearless leader on his back  
??Cut?? from a cocaine heart attack  
You knew we had to go  
It's an ordinary show  
The movie of the year  
Stars realistic beer  
Billy says something  
??Act?? what is does  
There's ??pervertically?? nothing  
To help you and me  
Here is my human machine  
With incredible mileage  
??Invective?? and clean  
You kids aren't smiling, smiling,...  
And all the coalition, no nutrition
