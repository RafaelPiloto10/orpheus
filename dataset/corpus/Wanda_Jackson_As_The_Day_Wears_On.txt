Right now he's looking for his pants and socks  
Can't find the car keys on the dresser top  
He'll spill his milk and leave it in the kitchen floor  
And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more  
He'll go to work without a kiss from me it'll cross his mind he siad I'd never
leave  
Forget his coat and catch a deaf of core  
And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more  
[ dobro ]  
He'll tell the guys he's bothered not at all  
Then drink his lunch so he won't have to call  
He'll tell himself I'm home like the day before  
But as the day wears on he'll doubt it more and more  
He'll come home to a house that's dark and quiet  
And has to face another sleepless night  
He'll watch TV and read and walk the floor  
And as the day wears on he'll miss me more and more  
And then he'll phone and ask me to come home  
That things have gone to pieces cause I'm gone  
His phonecall is all I'm waiting for  
Cause as the day wears on I'll miss me more and more  
Cause as the day wears on I'll miss me more and more
