Sweet little woman can't you see  
That you're the only one for me  
You make me feel good, so good inside  
Stay by me woman for the rest of my life  
And as I think of you more every day  
There's only one thing I can say  
And that's:  
  
Girl, I think the world about you  
Always thinkin' of you  
Girl, I think the world about you  
I'm always thinkin' of you  
  
So many wonders in your world it seems,  
You're the picture of a woman - a little girl's dream,  
You seem so weak sometimes to be so strong,  
You make a man like me finally to belong,  
No words can say how much I need you so,  
But oh my love I want the world to know  
  
Girl, I think the world about you  
Always thinkin' of you  
Girl, I think the world about you  
I'm always thinkin' of you  
  
There's no words to say how much I need you so,  
But oh sweet girl I want the world to know  
  
Girl, I think the world about you  
Always thinkin' of you  
Girl, I think the world about you  
I'm always thinkin' of you
