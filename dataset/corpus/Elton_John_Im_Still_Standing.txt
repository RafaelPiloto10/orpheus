You could never know what it's like  
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice  
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you  
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use  
  
And did you think this fool could never win  
Well look at me, i'm coming back again  
I got a taste of love in a simple way  
And if you need to know while i'm still standing you just fade away  
  
Don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did  
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid  
I'm still standing after all this time  
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind  
  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah  
  
Once i never could hope to win  
You starting down the road leaving me again  
The threats you made were meant to cut me down  
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now
