We were so close yet so far away  
I'd reach out, you'd be gone  
Moments that still talk my breath away  
There's so much more to life than loving you  
You don't need me, no...  
  
I...can't wait all my life, on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love (where are you now)  
Oh I...still wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you  
  
Time washes over, memories  
I can't look back no more  
Change has forsaken, our promises  
There's someone else for you to hold again  
So please stop your crying  
  
I...can't wait all my life, on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love (where are you now)  
Oh I...still wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you  
  
Remember, remember, girl I remember  
I...can't wait all my life, on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love (where are you now)  
Oh I...still wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you (where are you now)  
Should have been you my love (where are you now)  
It could have been you my love, (where are you now)  
Remember...remember...remember
