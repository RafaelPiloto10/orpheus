I can't wait till you try to come back girl  
When things they don't work out for you  
Who do you think you're messing with girl  
What do you think you're trying to do?  
  
Who do you think you're messing with girl  
What do you think you're trying to do?  
Do you really think I want be laughed at girl  
Who do you think you're trying to fool  
  
First you said I was blind  
And it's gonna be different this time  
I thought you made up your mind  
I thought you made up your mind, yeah  
I thought you made up  
I thought you made up  
I thought you made up your mind  
  
So many times I've gotten used to this  
This old idea of being all alone  
Tell me how I'm supposed to get through with this?  
I wish this house felt like a home  
  
Who do you think you 're messing with girl  
What do you think you're trying to do?  
Do you really think I want be laughed at girl  
Who do you think you're trying to fool  
  
First you said I was blind  
You certainly took your time  
I thought you made up your mind  
I thought you made up your mind, yeah  
I thought you made up  
I thought you made up  
I thought you made up your mind
