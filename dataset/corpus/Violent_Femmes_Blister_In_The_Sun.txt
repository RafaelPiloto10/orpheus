When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
I'm high as a kite  
I just might stop to check you out  
  
[chorus]  
Let me go on like I  
Blister in the sun  
Let me go on  
Big hands, I know you're the one  
  
Body and beats,  
I stain my sheets  
I don't even know why  
My girlfriend, she's at the end,  
She is starting to cry  
  
Let me go on like I  
Blister in the sun  
Let me go on  
Big hands, I know you're the one  
  
When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
I'm high as a kite  
I just might stop to check you out  
  
When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
I'm high as a kite  
I just might stop to check you out  
  
Body and beats,  
I stain my sheets  
I don't even know why  
My girlfriend, she's at the end,  
She is starting to cry  
  
When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
I'm high as a kite  
I just might stop to check you out  
  
[Chorus]
