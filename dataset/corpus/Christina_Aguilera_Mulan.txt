Look at me, you may think you see who I really am  
But you'll never know me  
Every day it's as if I play a part  
Now I see if I wear a mask, I can fool the world  
But I cannot fool my heart  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight back at me  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart  
And what I believe in  
But somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart  
And be loved for who I am  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight back at me  
Why is my reflection someone I  
Don't know  
Must I pretend that I'm someone else  
For all time  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
There's a hope that must be free to fly  
That burns with a need to know the reason why  
Why must we all conceal what we think, how we feel  
Must there be a secret me  
I'm forced to hide  
  
I wont pretend that I'm  
Someone else for all time  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am, inside
