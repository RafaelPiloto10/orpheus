Call me a traitor,  
For changing my mind.  
Call me a criminal,  
If thinking's a crime.  
Call me an animal,  
It's hard to define.  
I don't care what you say I came to defy.  
  
I've come so far.  
  
Everything changes.  
With the way that I feel,  
Seems impossible I'll stay the same.  
Time rearranges.  
The more we refuse,  
Is the more time we stand in the way.  
  
And how am I to be myself?  
Everyone's trying to be everyone else.  
Everything changes.  
With the way that I feel,  
Seems impossible I'll stay the same  
  
Go back to the middle,  
Try filling the void.  
Watch thoughts into action  
Its hard to destroy.  
Call me an animal,  
And I wont deny.  
I don't care what you say I came to defy.  
  
I've come so far.  
  
Everything changes.  
With the way that I feel,  
Seems impossible I'll stay the same.  
Time rearranges.  
The more we refuse,  
Is the more time we stand in the way.  
  
And how am I to be myself?  
Everyone's trying to be everyone else.  
Everything changes.  
With the way that I feel,  
Seems impossible I'll stay the same.  
  
What will you do to me,  
When I refuse to go?  
Who's gonna fight all your wars,  
When the people won't show?  
What will you do to us,  
When we won't do what you say?  
What will you do to us,  
When we won't do what you say?  
  
Everything changes.  
With the way that I feel,  
Seems impossible I'll stay the same.  
Time rearranges.  
The more we refuse,  
Is the more time we stand in the way.  
  
And how am I to be myself?  
Everyone's trying to be everyone else.  
Everything changes.
