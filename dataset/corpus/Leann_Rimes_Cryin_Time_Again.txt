Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time.  
Now, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder  
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
Well, my love for you could never be stronger  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
If I lived to be a hundred years old.  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
Now you say you've found someone that you love better  
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time.  
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door.  
That's the way it's happened every time before  
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time.  
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
Yea, it won't be long before it's cryin' time
