Do it 'cause you want you  
You want to 'cause I said so, oh  
  
Everybody looking at her  
They know right away  
You can see it in her movement  
That the girl don't play  
Her walk is danger  
One look in her eyes  
You do what she want you to  
And you won't even know why  
  
Everybody wanna touch it  
Touch it  
And they give up preserve  
She can make you love it  
Love it  
Even if it hurts  
From her head to my toes  
She's out of control  
She can reach right in your chest  
And pull out your soul  
  
[Chorus]  
She said don't ask no questions  
Do it 'cause I said so  
You're under my control  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Just keep on loving me  
Do it 'cause I said so, oh no  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
She said don't ask no questions  
Do it 'cause I said so  
You're under my control  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Just keep on loving me  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
  
She got what you want  
But more than you can take  
Under those dark glasses  
Baby eyes of a snake  
Her swagger is sexy  
So wrong but so right  
And though the venom is deadly  
Still you beg for the bite  
  
Everybody wanna touch it  
Touch it  
And they give up preserve  
She can make you love it  
Love it  
Even if it hurts  
From her head to my toes  
She's out of control  
She can reach right in your chest  
And pull out your soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody wanna touch it  
Touch it  
And they give up preserve  
She can make you love it  
Love it  
Even if it hurts  
  
From her head to my toes  
She's out of control  
She can reach right in your chest  
And pull out your soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She said don't ask no questions  
Do it 'cause I said so  
You're under my control  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Just keep on loving me  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
She said don't ask no questions  
Do it 'cause I said so  
You're under my control  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Just keep on loving me  
Do it 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Just keep on lovin' me  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
Do it 'cause you want to  
You want to 'cause I said so  
  
[Chorus]
