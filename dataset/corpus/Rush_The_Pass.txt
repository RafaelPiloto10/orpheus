Proud swagger out of the schoolyard  
Waiting for the world's applause  
Rebel without a conscience  
Martyr without a cause  
  
Static on your frequency  
Electrical storm in your veins  
Raging at unreachable glory  
Straining at invisible chains  
  
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge  
Staring down into a heartless sea  
Can't face life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be  
  
All of us get lost in the darkness  
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars  
All of us do time in the gutter  
Dreamers turn to look at the cars  
Turn around and turn around and turn around  
Turn around and walk the razor's edge  
Don't turn your back  
And slam the door on me  
  
It's not as if this barricade  
Blocks the only road  
It's not as if you're all alone  
In wanting to explode  
  
Someone set a bad example  
Made surrender seem all right  
The act of a noble warrior  
Who lost the will to fight  
  
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge  
Staring down into a heartless sea  
Done with life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be  
  
No hero in your tragedy  
No daring in your escape  
No salutes for your surrender  
Nothing noble in your fate  
Christ, what have you done?
