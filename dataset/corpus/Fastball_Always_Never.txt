Strange town, shake down  
Sink or swim  
Old flames, stage names  
Shed your skin  
  
Always and never  
We change like the weather  
  
Long gone, house young  
Memories  
Closed doors, cold wars  
You and me  
  
Always and never  
We change like the weather  
When will you ever  
make up your mind (come on) [Repeat: x3]  
  
Jaded, elated  
Time of day  
Time out, freak out  
Games we play  
  
Always and never  
We change like the weather  
When will you ever  
make up your mind (come on)[Repeat: x7]
