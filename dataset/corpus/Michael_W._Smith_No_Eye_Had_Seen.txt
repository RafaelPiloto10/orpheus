No eye had seen  
No ear had heard  
'Til hosts on high  
Proclaimed the birth  
And heaven brought down  
(Quietly with no one watching)  
Its only child  
(From the womb of perfect peace)  
The son of man  
(Wellspring of our joy delivered)  
The world reconciled  
(Into earthly destiny)  
  
And song broke forth  
Angelic strain  
And none could help  
But sing the name  
  
Emmanuel  
(Kyrie eleison we sing)  
Emmanuel  
(Glory to the newborn King)  
Emmanuel  
(Mortal and immortal voices)  
Emmanuel  
(Endless praises echoing)
