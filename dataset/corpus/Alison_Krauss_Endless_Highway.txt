Endless highway,  
As far as I can see  
The road'll take me  
Back to him tonight  
It's been so long since  
I've seen him smile  
I'll be counting all the miles  
'Til I get home  
  
[Chorus:]  
How many hours  
'Til I hold him?  
How many days  
Before we hit the road again?  
Endless highway,  
He don't know  
How much I miss him  
Heading down this road,  
Bound for Tennessee  
  
Lonesome feeling,  
Deep inside my heart  
Longing for  
This weary night to end  
I'll think about him,  
Try to keep my tired eyes open  
Come the morning light,  
I'll be back home again  
  
[Chorus x 2]
