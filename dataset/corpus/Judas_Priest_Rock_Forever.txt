When the day is over,  
I like to ease my mind  
By jucin' up my system,  
With the beat of a heavy kind  
I smack a bottle open,  
I crank the hi-fi high  
I'm in-a seventh heaven  
Ooh I can touch the sky  
  
I'm in love, so in love  
And I can't stop talking 'bout my rock forever  
  
It's got the movin' to me,  
just that I can't explain,  
It's like a brilliant sunshine,  
After standing in the pouring rain  
My skin begins to tingle,  
Ooh right on down my back.  
It's really got me fevered,  
Pounding my senses flat.  
  
I'm in love, so in love  
And I can't stop talking 'bout my rock forever  
  
Rock rock rock forever (I love my)  
Rock rock rock forever (my fever)  
Rock rock rock forever (always gonna)  
Rock rock rock forever  
I can't stop talkin' about rock  
Now get it right, boys  
  
So when you get those blue days,  
Here's just what to do  
Switch into this lifeline  
And feel it rushing through  
Before you know it, blue days  
Are better left behind  
By juicin' up your system  
With this beat of a heavy kind  
  
I'm in love, so in love  
And I can't stop talking 'bout my rock forever  
Rock forever  
I'm gonna rock forever.
