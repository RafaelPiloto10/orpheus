You're gone away  
And you done left me alone, yeah  
I've got nobody to call my own  
I believe it's bye bye, baby, yeah  
I wish you a lot of luck, darling  
But you're still my baby  
my my my baby  
Told you I love you, honey  
Yes, I did  
Many, many, many times again, yeah  
I've always played a losing hand  
But it's bye, bey, bye, baby  
That's what you're telling me  
I wish you a lot of luck, darling  
But I'm letting you know  
You're still my baby  
ooh yeah  
You may be, yes you may be  
A thousand miles away, yeah  
No matter how far or you may be  
Looking at me somewhere  
Right here in this town, Lord, Lord  
But tell me all I, all I  
All I want to know, know  
Tell me, tell me what did I do, honey  
Why, why, why did you put me down  
Darling, darling  
Somebody, somebody help me  
Out of all this pain  
But I've always played a losing game  
But it's bye bye, baby, yeah  
That's what you tellin'  
Lots of luck, darling  
But I want you to know  
That you're still my baby, my baby, my baby, yeah  
You're still my baby, yeah  
I want you to know  
No matter where you go  
No matter where I see you  
I want you to be my baby  
No matter what in the world you do  
Honey, I want you to be my baby...
