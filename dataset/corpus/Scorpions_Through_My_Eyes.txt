Leaving through the back door  
Freezing in the cold  
Communication breakdown  
Emotional overload  
Been through a wall of fire  
Now I feel like, the ashes glow  
  
Cars passing on the freeway  
My mind is on the run  
I keep running from my shadow  
I'm not the only one  
Somewhere in the distance  
Someone's taking flight  
Destination unknown  
Just fade into the light  
  
There's so much said and done  
But after all  
The time has come, to leave it all  
Behind  
  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You's know I tried to change it all  
I've been trying all my life  
To stand up every time I fall  
If you could see it through my eyes  
  
I feel sadness up my spine  
The future on my hands  
I'm standing here alone  
With open arms again  
Tomorrow ain't no stranger  
There'll be a lucky star  
And love will find it's way  
Into someones heart  
  
Too late for tears  
No time to be confused  
It's just the echo of our  
Swan song  
  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You's know I tried to change it all  
I've been trying all my life  
To stand up every time I fall  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You'd see that love will always wait  
Somewhere out there is my life  
A new love that comes my way  
If you could see it through my eyes  
Through my eyes  
  
What was meant to be forever  
Is breaking all apart  
What was meant to be forever  
Leaves the hole inside my heart  
What was meant to be forever  
We throw it all away  
What was meant to be forever  
Was nothing but a game  
What was meant to be forever  
Is breaking all apart  
What was meant to be forever
