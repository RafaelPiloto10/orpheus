Tell me, why are you crying?  
Because I'm happy  
And why are you so choked up?  
From loneliness  
And why are you squeezing my hand  
So tightly  
And your thoughts seem to be wandering?  
I love you so much  
Why?  
Don't be so hard-headed  
Stop doubting me  
Although in the future there's a large sky  
I'm not afraid  
I want to love you  
Don't love me because you think I'm different  
You don't think it's right  
For us to spend this time together  
Don't love me because I know what a lie it would be  
If you don't think I deserve your love  
Don't love me  
I'm going to stay another day  
Don't love me because I'm lost  
Because I change the world  
Because it's my destiny  
Because I can't change  
We are a mirror  
And you are my reflection  
Don't love me  
To be dying in a war of regret and sad thoughts  
Don't love me  
Because in this world  
This great love deserves to soar through the blue sky  
I don't know what to say  
That's the truth  
If people want to want to hurt us, they will  
If you and I part now  
They don't matter  
But in this world  
Don't leave me  
Don't leave me  
Don't leave me  
Don't listen when I say I don't love you  
Don't love me  
Stop breaking my heart with these "I don't love you's"  
Don't love me  
Because my heart is breaking  
That is useless  
I will always love you  
Don't love me  
You have suffered enough  
My heart has turned cold like a million winters  
Don't love me  
To forget about your gray days  
I want you to always love me  
You and I are changing  
One with the other  
And always together  
This love is like the sun  
That comes out after a storm  
Like two comets in the same galaxy  
Don't love me  
Don't love me  
Don't love me  
(Don't love me, don't love me, don't love me)
