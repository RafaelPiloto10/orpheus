When the night  
Seems to say  
All hope is lost  
Gone away  
But I know  
I'm not alone  
By the light  
She stands  
  
There she waves  
Faithful friend  
Shimmering stars  
Westward wind  
Show the way  
Carry me  
To the place  
She stands  
  
Just when you think it might be over  
Just when you think the fight is gone  
Someone will risk his life to raise her  
There she stands  
  
There she flies  
Clear blue skies  
Reminds us with red  
Of those that died  
Washed in white  
By the brave  
In their strength  
She stands  
  
When evil calls itself a martyr  
When all your hopes come crashing down  
Someone will pull her from the rubble  
There she stands  
  
We've seen her flying torn and tattered  
We've seen her stand the test of time  
And through it all the fools have fallen  
There she stands  
  
By the dawn  
Early light  
And through the fight  
She stands
