It isn't what it used to be  
I wake up every night  
On the stairs  
Waiting for the dawn to come  
Every drop of wine  
You can be my time  
Only tomorrow knows  
Why do we beg when we can borrow  
This time we knew  
No more or less  
There's nothing left  
  
It was always special  
It was like water down the drain  
I'm intoxicated  
Every time I hear your name  
I try to remember  
But nothing is the same  
  
It wasn't that I didn't try  
It's not the kind of thing, that you buy  
Written in my destiny  
Life is but a dream  
Covered by the sky  
Stop saying that you're calling time  
Look at your life before you start on mine  
I'm not the kind of person that you need  
I'm sick of trying  
I mean that it's over  
  
It was always special  
It was like water down the drain  
I'm intoxicated  
Every time I hear your name  
I try to remember  
But nothing is the same  
It was always special  
it was like water down the drain  
  
Patiently you wait for me  
You're so blind  
I thought it couldn't be  
Then changed my mind  
Drowning in the endless sea  
Line all those lines  
The traces of your memory  
Don't belong with mine
