If you need a holiday somewhere in the sun  
Let me show you something that is really fun  
Take a sparkling holiday somewhere in bubblegum  
You can lie down in the shadow of electric silver trees  
You can play ferry sinking victim looking water-ski  
And if you want excitement ask the poet kids  
They all look like Charly Manson a bit  
Take a sparkling holiday it's such a fun  
You might have a quite interesting sightseeing tour  
Go to hangover purgatory nightmare shore  
See the damned and the dead and the died for love  
The commercial gurus, the artist and the stuff  
And if you come to lovey church  
Sit down in second row  
You can hear your sister screaming in the room below  
And the priest will claim thus they might be sure  
A girl can either be a saint or a whore  
Take a sparkling holiday  
Come to the old bridge where the jokers  
Juggle with your fears  
Give them a penny and they'll show you  
How to exercise  
And under the bridge the junkies shoot sperm  
It's so expensive these days  
And they substitute the yearning  
And if you want to dine, go to Loony's Inn  
They serve sweet, good collapse with trauma and gin  
And afterwards you may need a rest  
Then I'll tell you Pere Lachaise is the best  
Take a sparkling holiday
