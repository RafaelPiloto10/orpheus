Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth as it circles by  
Get the sky sea creation fly  
  
This point of living  
This point of giving  
This chance of living has got to be known  
  
Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth  
Get the sky  
  
Far away in the depths of Hawking's mind  
To the animal, primalistic grind  
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life (Bring me reason)  
You don't say you're sorry  
  
Call this real love  
Activates this mission to be  
On the same time line  
Call this free love  
Get a ticket on the master plan  
On the freedom climb  
  
Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth  
Get the sky  
  
The point of living  
The point of living  
This chance of living  
Far away in the depths of Hawking's mind  
To the animal, the primalistic grind  
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life  
You don't say you're sorry  
  
Call this free love  
Activate the mission to be on  
The same time line  
Call this free love  
Get a ticket on the master plan  
On the freedom climb

You can activate this message  
On the concourse of your fine mind  
Call this real love  
Get off those chains, get off those chains  
Get off those changes coming to you
