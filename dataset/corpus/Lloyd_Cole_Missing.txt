(She moves on)  
Taking with her when she's gone  
Your jacket, jeans and shirt  
Your better self  
And it hurts and it hurts  
  
(As she moves on)  
What this place needs  
She said when she first stayed the night  
Is a woman's touch  
Well, she gave you that allright, now  
  
Missing, believe lost  
Five feet four and a half  
Of just warm girl  
Lazy blonde curl  
Last seen heading north  
With no visible scars  
Wearing tan suede  
Over a brave face  
  
(As she moves on)  
Into another world  
In which you don't belong  
In which you never will  
And it's wrong, it's alll wrong  
  
(As he moves on)  
She doesn't call  
She won't come back  
She's too far in  
Was her love as fake as her leopardskin?  
  
Missing, believe lost  
Five feet four and a half  
Of just warm girl  
Lazy blonde curl  
Last seen heading north  
With no visible scars  
Wearing tan suede  
Over a brave face  
  
She's missing  
And I'm lost
