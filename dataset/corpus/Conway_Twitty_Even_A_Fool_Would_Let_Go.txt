It's funny how love goes cause I know this could never work out  
But honey how love grows even though there's no reason to doubt  
This can never be you keep saying it's wrong  
Neither one of us is free still I wanna hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go cause he knows there's no use in trying  
Even a child would say no when he knows he'll end up crying  
Tell me now is it wise holding you when even a fool would let go  
  
My love has no reason like the words in a song that don't rhyme  
My love got no season I just know that it's there all the time  
Maybe just you and me I can't believe that's wrong  
Thinking about you and me makes me wanna hold on  
But even a fool would let go  
When even a fool would let go
