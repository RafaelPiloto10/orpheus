Now you say you lonely  
You cry the whole night through  
  
Well you can cry me a river,  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
You drove me mad and drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said,  
Told me love was true for me and...  
Told me you was...you and...me and...Now you say you loved me  
Well, just to prove ya do  
  
Go on an  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you...
