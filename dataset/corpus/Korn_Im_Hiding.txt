Maybe I'm insane  
Walking on a wire  
Maybe I'm the same  
Nothing to take me higher  
Tell me where to start  
Think I'm at the end  
Right now feeling pain  
Make it go away  
  
Maybe I'm to blame  
Maybe I'm a liar  
Maybe we're the same  
Nothing can start the fire  
I can't feel my heart  
But I feel the shame  
Nothing left to say  
Soon I'll fade away  
  
These places all I ever think about is lost in time  
These faces haunting me  
I'm looking back and they are mine  
  
I'm hiding from the things they say  
Doing time and lead astray  
Thinking back to times of yesterday  
I could fly  
  
I'm trying to find a better way  
But I'm trapped  
Can't get away  
All I think is about yesterday  
I could fly  
  
Maybe I'm insane  
Walking on a wire  
Maybe I'm the same  
Nothing to take me higher  
I can't feel my heart  
But I feel the shame  
Nothing left to say  
Soon I'll fade away  
  
These places all I ever think about is lost in time  
These faces haunting me  
I'm looking back and they are mine  
  
I'm hiding from the things they say  
Doing time and lead astray  
Thinking back to times of yesterday  
I could fly  
  
I'm trying to find a better way  
But I'm trapped  
Can't get away  
All I think is about yesterday  
I could fly
