Often, I don't see it when I've been wrong,  
And boy have I been wrong  
Often, I wont need it 'till it's gone,  
But by then it's gone  
  
Often, I make the worst decisions  
Say that it's great when I know it isn't, so  
It's happening so....  
Often  
  
Often, I won't wake up from a dream,  
You know I love to dream  
Often, I don't stand up for what I believe,  
There's nothing left to believe  
  
So often, I make the worst decisions,  
Say that it's great when I know it isn't, so  
It's happening so.... Often  
  
I often wish that you were here,  
I could moan and bend your ear  
  
Do Doo Do Doo Do Doo Do  
Yeah, Yeah  
  
Often, I don't see it when I've been wrong,  
And boy have I been wrong  
Often, I woun't need it 'till it's gone,  
But by then it's gone  
  
Often, I make the worst decisions  
Say that it's great when I know it isn't, so  
It's happening so....
