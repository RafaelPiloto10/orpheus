The way you take over the floor  
Your style, your grace, I'm wanting more  
The way you move under the strobe  
Has got me losing all control  
  
I see you from across the room  
There's nobody in this place but you  
Just take my hand, let me take you away  
By the music is going and going  
  
Can I have this dance  
I've been waiting to get with you all night  
  
All I need is one chance  
So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
So take your time, don't be afraid  
I just take your hand and grab my way  
Get close to me, I feel the heat  
Boy you 'bout to drive me insane  
  
I feel your heart beating with mine  
The mood, the space, the stars align  
So take my hand, let me take you away  
By the music is going and going  
  
Can I have this dance  
I've been waiting to get with you all night  
  
All I need is one chance  
So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
Baby  
Never thought that you'd be feeling the same way  
So caught up in the rhythm, the way that you moving  
I'm so into it, I hope the music never stops  
  
Can I have this dance  
I've been waiting to get with you all night  
  
All I need is one chance  
So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
All I need is one dance with you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
Oh, dance with you, oh  
Oh, I see no one here but you, yeah
