In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
What'll do  
When something new crosses your path  
Out of the blue  
What'll ya do  
What do you do?  
  
I think once upon a time  
Heffalump's ruled the forest  
They rocked and stomped and blew their horns  
To their new and dearest  
They scared all the rest of us  
The Heffalump is as a Heffalump does  
As a heffalump now is a heffalump was  
  
What'll do  
When something new crosses your path  
Out of the blue  
What'll do, what'll do, what'll do?  
What do you do?  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
We claim thee  
In the name of the hundred acre wood  
  
What'll do, what'll do, what'll do
