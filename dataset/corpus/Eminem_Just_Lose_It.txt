OK  
Guess who's back  
Back again  
Shady's back  
Tell a friend  
  
Now everyone report to the dance floor  
To the dance floor, to the dance floor  
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop  
Pajama time  
Come here little kiddies, on my lap  
Guess who's back with a brand new rap  
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case  
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah  
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys  
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything,  
But little boys  
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor,  
I'm just psycho  
I go a little bit crazy sometimes  
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes  
Good God, dip, do a little slide  
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor  
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go  
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it  
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK  
Oops my C-D just skipped  
And everyone just heard you let one rip,  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,  
Yeah boy shake that ass,  
Oops I mean girl  
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)  
Alright now lose it Aah aah aah aah aah  
Just lose it Aah aah aah aah aah  
Go crazy Aah aah aah aah aah  
Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah  
  
It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party  
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day  
Everyday's just a holiday  
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy  
Get the top down, let my hair blow,  
I dunno where I'm goin'  
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body  
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk  
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work  
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair  
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah  
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?  
Man, you must be up out your mind  
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm  
  
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,  
Yeah boy shake that ass,  
Oops I mean girl  
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)  
Alright now lose it Aah aah aah aah aah  
Just lose it Aah aah aah aah aah  
Go crazy Aah aah aah aah aah  
Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah  
  
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up,  
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened  
They say I was running butt naked  
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah  
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember  
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty  
They said save it boy, we got you on tape  
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"  
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down  
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound  
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now  
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves  
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?  
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba  
I don't have any lines to go right here so  
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?  
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?  
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls,  
I'm calling all girls  
Everyone report to the dance floor, it's your chance for a little romance or  
Butt squeezing it's the season  
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasin'  
  
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,  
Yeah boy shake that ass,  
Oops I mean girl  
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)  
Alright now lose it Aah aah aah aah aah  
Just lose it Aah aah aah aah aah  
Go crazy Aah aah aah aah aah  
Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah  
  
Mm touch my body  
Mm touch my body  
Ooh boy just touch my body  
I mean girl just touch my body
