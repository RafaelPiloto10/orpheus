Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the stars above I do!  
I swear on the streetlight on the corner  
Shoving back the shadows!  
One shadow cursing  
Another shadow laughing  
Underneath the streetlight  
I don't know where they're coming from  
I just see 'em passing  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the buildings above I do!  
I swear on a billion yellow and T.V. blue windows!  
Gayboys with their pants so tight  
Out in the neon light  
Underneath the street light  
A m- m- madman-madman  
Kicking over garbage cans  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the blinkin' planes above I do!  
I swear on the truck at the stoplight  
With his airbrakes moaning!  
All night the trucks roll  
Up to the tunnel-toll  
Underneath the streetlight  
They come rollin', rollin'  
Rollin' for a living  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do!  
I swear on the be-bop boys  
Chasing the black bird  
Rock 'n' roll broadcast  
Movin' up now full blast  
Underneath the streetlight  
They come dancin', dancin'  
Really rock 'n rollin'  
Underneath the streetlight  
Yes I do, I love you  
I really love you  
Yes I do, yes I do  
I love you!
