Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But now I'm not afraid  
This rover crossed over  
If I'd never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Going to set my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But now I'm not afraid  
This rover crossed over  
If I'd never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Going to set my feet  
On the sunny side of the street
