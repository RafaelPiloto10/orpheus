This is the point of no return  
'Cause this is where we crash and burn  
And now every time i face this pain  
I can hear it coming back again  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
It's the sound of letting go.  
It's the sound of letting go.  
It's the sound of letting go.  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
Breaking up and breaking down  
This is what we've come to now  
What's the use we can't deny  
Can't you hear it?  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
We could go around all day  
Fine excuses we can say  
In the silence i can hear  
Can't you feel it?  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
It's getting louder and louder  
What we gonna do?  
It's getting louder and louder  
Fillin' up the room.  
I can hear it hear it  
Comin' over us.  
  
I can hear it tellin' me that we had enough  
  
It's getting louder and louder  
What we gonna do?  
It's getting louder and louder  
Fillin' up the room.  
I can hear it hear it  
Comin' over us.  
  
It's the sound of letting go.  
I know you can hear it.  
It's the sound of letting go.  
I know we can't deceive it.  
  
I know you can hear it.  
It's the sound of letting go.  
I know we can't deceive it.  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
I can't let it break me down  
This is what we've come to now.  
What's the use we can't deny (can't you hear it?)  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
Every time i face this pain  
I hear it coming back again  
And i've been calling out your name (can't you hear it?)  
It's the sound of letting go.  
  
I can hear it.  
I can hear it.  
I can hear it.  
  
It's the sound of letting go.  
I can hear it  
I can hear it  
It's the sound of letting go.  
I can hear it  
I can hear it  
It's the sound of letting go.
