There's a man in the station and a train in the rain  
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain  
There's a woman in the dark that's standing apart  
There's a love in the man that's breaking his heart  
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home  
The next train home  
There's one more circle I'm dying to try  
There's a piece of my head that's asking why  
There's a piece of my heart that's dying to fly  
There's a baby in the woman that's waiting to cry  
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home  
The next train home  
There's got to be a way for a lazy face and  
Get up and start loving the human race  
There's just got to be a way for a crazy face  
Get out from under this paper chase  
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home  
Next train home  
There's a man in the station and a train in the rain  
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain  
There's a woman in the dark that's standing apart  
There's a love in the man that's breaking his heart  
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home  
Next train home
