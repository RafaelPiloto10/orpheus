Gazing past the planets  
Looking for total view  
I've been laying here for hours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
  
Wonders of a lifetime  
Right there before your eyes  
Searching with this life of ours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
Out and in, out and in  
  
Will you think it's a joke  
That's all right  
Do what you want to do  
I've said my peace  
And I'll leave it all up to you
