It's midnight Cinderella  
But don't you worry none  
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the Pumpkin Eater  
And the party has just begun  
  
I guess you're prince charming  
Wasn't after all  
'Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball  
I guess that more than horses  
Are turnin' into rats  
And by the way he's walkin'  
I can guess where your slippers at  
  
[Chorus]  
It's midnight Cinderella  
Time that you should know  
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes  
It's midnight Cinderella  
But don't you worry none  
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the pumpkin eater  
And the party has just begun  
  
I'm gonna help you get over  
Bein' under that spell  
You're gonna learn to love midnight  
Inside this pumpkin shell  
I gotta few new magic tricks  
Your Godmother can't do  
And I'll show you want it means to bip, bip, bip, bip, boppity, boo hoo  
  
[Chorus]
