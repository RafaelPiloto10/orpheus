Uh, in no rush to see  
Baby, I'm hanging, hanging on for you  
That's where it is, go 'bout my buisness  
Hanging, hanging on for you  
And you'll be mine in future time  
It's true, ooh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh  
How 'bout we wait a couple years 'till you do it right?  
I gotta little game left  
So, I'mma hang up in a play and share this line  
And you can do the same, yes  
'Cause this horizon soon will focus into view, yeah  
Uh, in no rush to see

Hanging, hanging on for you
