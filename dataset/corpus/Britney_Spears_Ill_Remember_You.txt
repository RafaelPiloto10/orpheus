Hey, what's your name?  
Hey, what's your name?  
'Cause I need to know  
'Cause I need to know.  
  
I've been high and I've been low  
Far behind and far below  
Never seen you before  
If I die before I wake  
Promise me  
Remember me tomorrow  
'Cause I'll remember you  
I'll remember you  
I'll remember you  
I'll remember you  
(I'll remember you).
