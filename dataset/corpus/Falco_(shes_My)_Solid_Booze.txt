And we are growing along spiritual lines  
Will never mean we should stop to have big fun time  
Oh oh oh  
Should it be for the very first of all to pray  
And to report it to your next in an effective way  
  
But whatever our ideals turn to be  
We must be willing to break it through  
We must be willing to make amends where we  
Ever have to put some harm on too  
  
She is my she's my all  
She is my all surrounding solid booze you know  
She is my all surrounding solid booze you knowShe is my all surrounding solid
booze you know  
  
And we are growing along the spiritual lines  
Would never mean we should believe in all thoseDifferent kinds  
Oh oh oh  
Could it be the very first of all to recognize  
Its the better sense to take it once and give it twice  
  
But whatever our ideals turn out to be  
We should be willing to break it through  
We should be willing to realizeThat attitudes have got us too  
  
She is my  
She's my all
