Fill me in on your new vision  
Wake me up with indecision  
Help me trust your mighty wisdom  
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Show me how you question, questions  
Lead the way to my temptation  
Take my hand and give it cleaning  
As I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Easy in an easy chair  
Poop as hard as rock  
I don't like you anyway  
Seal it in a box  
  
Now you  
Damn you  
  
Fill me in on your new vision  
Wake me up with indecision  
Help me trust your mighty wisdom  
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Show me how you question, question  
Lead the way to my gestation  
Take my hand and give it cleaning  
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Easy in an easy chair  
Poop as hard as rock  
I don't like you anyway  
Seal it in a box  
  
Now you  
Damn you  
Now you  
Damn you
