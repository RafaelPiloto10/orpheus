Ol' man river, that ol' man river  
He must know something, but he don't say nothing  
That ol' man river, he just keep rollin' along  
He don't plant 'taters, he don't plant cotton  
'Cause them that plants them is soon forgotten  
And ol' man river, he just keeps rollin' along  
'Cause you and me, we sweat and strain  
Body all achin' and wracked with pain  
Tote that barge, lift that bale  
Get a little drunk and you land in jail  
But I get weary and sick of tryin'  
'Cause I'm tired of livin' but I'm scared of dyin'  
That ol' man river, he just keeps rollin' along  
You and me, we sweat and strain  
Body all achin' and wracked with pain  
Tote that barge, lift that bale  
Get a little drunk and you land in jail  
But I get weary and sick of tryin'  
'Cause I'm tired of livin' but I'm scared of dyin'  
That ol' man river, he just keeps rollin' along
