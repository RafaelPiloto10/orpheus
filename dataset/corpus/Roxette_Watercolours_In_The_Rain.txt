Going through the motions.  
Ending up nowhere at all.  
Can't see the sun on my wall.  
Going through emotions.  
Ending up on a frozen morning  
With a heart not even broken.  
  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life.  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life, all my life  
  
Like watercolors in the rain.  
  
Find a place to settle down.  
Get a job in a city nearby  
And watch the trains roll on by.  
I'll find the falling star.  
I'll fall in love with the eyes of a dreamer  
And a dream worth believing.  
  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life.  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life, all my life.  
Like watercolors in the rain.
