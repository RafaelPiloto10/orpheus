You keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
You you keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
  
Every day  
Wheels are turning  
And the crime  
Still returning  
  
Dawn will soon be breaking, the day has just begun,  
You put your arms around me like a circle round the sun,  
You dance across the seasons,  
To a place where no one knows  
Where angels fear to tread  
  
Dawn will soon be breaking, the day has just begun,  
You put your arms around me like a circle round the sun,  
You dance across the seasons,  
To a place where no one knows  
Where angels fear to tread  
  
You keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
You you keep on moving  
Far away, far away  
  
Every day  
Wheels are turning  
And the crime  
Still returning
