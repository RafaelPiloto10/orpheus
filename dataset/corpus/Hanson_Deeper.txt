She moves with a tender kiss  
And I can't stop feelin'  
She soothes with a tenderness  
And I can't stop' feelin'  
Well, I don't even know her name  
But I can't stop feelin'  
She says that she feels the same  
And I can't stop feelin'  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
Fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah  
  
She turns chaos into art  
And I can't stop feelin'  
A touch and I fall apart  
And I can't stop feelin'  
It's soundin' like an old cliche  
And I can't stop feelin'  
I love her in a thousand ways  
And I can't stop feelin'  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
Fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah  
  
Well, every simple notion is poetry in motion  
Can't you see it's pushin' me over the edge?  
This wreckin' ball you're holdin' has crushed the heart you've stolen  
I'll give you my devotion all over again  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
That I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Yeah  
  
And I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
  
And I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah
