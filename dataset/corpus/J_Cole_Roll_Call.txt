Intro:  
Just got off the phone my nigger smithy  
Shit too real back home. Real  
  
This for my niggers here, hold your head  
I know shit rough but nigger we don't give up  
We don't get mad nigger, we just get tough  
We just get right nigger, we don't get left  
Fuck what they said,  
Cause what we learned coming up  
You can't teach that shit  
Like dealer nigger blows but we eat that shit  
This one here's for my brothers we gonna beat that shit  
Now, I say my prayers  
I got, too many people in my head right now  
So many that's in jail, or they're dead right now  
One time for my nigger crag right now  
He in the feds, damn the times change  
And these stupid niggers talking 'bout crime pays  
You can keep that shit, I just made a million  
Call me when reach that shit  
I ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light  
One time for my granny up would happen tonight  
And a young boy from a show down in hampton  
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer  
Didn't know what to say, I just froze  
Little too deep I suppose  
But after a year of review  
I figured it out it wasn't me  
It was you nigger, congratulations
