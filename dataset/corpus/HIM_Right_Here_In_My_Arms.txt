She's smiling like heaven is down on earth  
Sun is shining so bright it hurts  
All her wishes have finally com true  
Her heart is weeping.  
Happiness is killing her.  
  
She'll be right here in my arms  
So in Love  
She'll be right here in these arms  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
  
So hard she's trying  
But her heart won't turn to stone, oh no  
She keeps on crying  
But I won't leave her alone  
She'll never be alone  
  
She'll be right here in my arms  
So in Love  
She'll be right here in these arms  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
She can't let go  
She can't let go
