Woke up this mornin'  
Jumped to my feet  
Ran to the window  
And down in the street  
The paperboy was jumpin'  
Like a monkey on a leash  
Yellin', read all about it  
Read all about it  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Down on Sunset  
In the summertime  
It gets so hot you think you're goin' blind  
Little girls all dressed up  
And they're ready to go out  
Makes me wanna shout  
Makes me wanna shout  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
You've got nowhere to go  
No one to go there with  
Ain't nobody cares about anything you did  
Lookin' for trouble  
You've got plenty on your mind  
Now we'll read all about it  
Read all about it, baby  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town
