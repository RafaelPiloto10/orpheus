In the corner beside my window  
Hangs a lonely photograph  
There is a reason I never notice it  
Memory that could hold me back  
  
There is a wound that's always bleeding  
There is a road I'm always walking  
And I know you'll never return to this place  
  
Gone through days without talking  
There is a comfort in silence  
So used to losing all ambition  
And struggling to maintain what's left  
  
There is a wound that's always bleeding  
There is a road I'm always walking  
And I know you'll never return to this place  
  
Once undone, there's only smoke  
Burning in my eyes to blind  
To cover up what really happened  
And force the darkness unto me  
  
There is a wound that's always bleeding  
There is a road I'm always walking  
And I know you'll never return to this place
