Please believe in me  
Though my love is hard to see  
Now she's gone (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
I'll remain (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
But these tears (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
I can't contain (She's gone, she's gone)  
So can I count on you to be my light to guide me  
Right through the night beside me  
Is it all right to count on you  
Smile away these blues  
I don't care if I'm accused  
Now she's gone (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
I don't mind (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
But, I got a feelin' (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
It's all designed (She's gone, she's gone)  
To make me call on you to be my light to guide me  
Right through the night beside me  
Is it all right to call on you
