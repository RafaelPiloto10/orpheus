She's getting older  
Yeah, she's getting wise  
But a change has changed the girl  
Gone's the sparkle from her eyes  
  
She wants to be a good mother  
So she'll do the best she can  
But what about the other  
What about the man  
  
Well it's cold to leave a woman  
With family on her own  
It's chill factor  
To the bone  
  
Resignation  
In her sighs  
Is a sorry indication  
Of how time  
Can brutalize  
  
Take away the hope  
And the will will follow  
Take away the faith  
And goodbye tomorrow  
  
Well it's cold to leave a woman  
With family on her own  
It's chill factor  
To the bone  
  
She had her dreams too  
But how can she pursue  
Her ambitions, be they great or small  
  
You took her wings and flew  
But remember when you're through  
Your rise was due  
To somebody else's fall  
  
When the hard part's over  
And the kids are almost grown  
You'll be their big hero  
Whenever you make it home  
Shower them with presents  
Things she could never buy  
Delight them with your stories  
About the great big, great big world outside  
But dig  
  
It's cold to leave a woman  
With family on her own  
It's chill factor  
Chill factor  
To the bone
