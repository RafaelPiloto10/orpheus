Here I sit alone and broken hearted walk the floor all night since we parted  
I'll get over you I don't know how or when it'll take awhile hold by can't
last till then  
Yes it'll take awhile to shake the pain of losing you  
Someone will take your place but I don't know who  
The world outside holds nothing now for me it'll take awhile to shake your
memory  
[ guitar ]  
So I'll do my best to forget you as I think about the things we used to do  
And I'll forget you I don't know how or when it'll take awhile if I'll hold
out till then  
Yes it'll take awhile...
