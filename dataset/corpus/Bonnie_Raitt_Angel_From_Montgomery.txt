Verse 1  
I am an old woman  
Named after my mother  
My old man is another  
Child that's grown old  
  
If dreams were thunder  
And lightning was desire  
This old house would've burned down  
A long time ago  
  
Chorus: Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
Verse 2  
When I was a young girl  
Well I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at  
Just a free ramblin' man  
But that was a long time  
And no matter how I tried  
Those years just flow by  
Like a broken down dam  
  
Chorus: Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
  
Verse 3  
There's flies in the kitchen  
I can hear them there buzzin'  
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening  
And have nothing to say  
  
Chorus Make me an angel  
That flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster  
Of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing  
That I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go  
To believe in this livin'  
Is just a hard way to go
