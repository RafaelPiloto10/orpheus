Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine  
Let me tell you, a fortune like that once was mine  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything  
  
When I found her I'd been looking everywhere  
When I lost her I was lost beyond despair  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything  
  
Dreams are hard to take (dreams are hard to take)  
Could it be I loved her too much  
  
Oo, a special girl  
Oo, a special girl  
She was a special girl  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything  
  
Bottom line is, she was fine in every way  
And it's not with hesitation that I say  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
And I gave her everything  
  
Dreams they come and go (dreams they come and go)  
But thoughts of her are like a floor show  
  
Oo, a special girl  
Oo, a special girl  
She was a special girl  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything
