Baby, now that I've found you  
I won't let you go  
I build my world around you  
I need you so, baby even though  
You don't need me now  
  
Baby, now that I've found you  
I won't let you go  
I build my world around you  
I need you so, baby even though  
You don't need me  
You don't need me no no (mm)  
  
Baby, baby, when first we met  
I knew in this heart of mine  
That you were someone I couldn't forget  
I said right and abide my time  
  
Spent my life looking for that somebody  
To make me feel like you  
Now you tell me that you want to leave me  
But darling, I just can't let you
