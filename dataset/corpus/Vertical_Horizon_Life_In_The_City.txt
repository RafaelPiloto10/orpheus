Cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine it's better on you anyway  
  
Nobody's perfect all the time  
But I know you  
And you know me  
And it's alright  
  
Waking up gonna buy me some shoes  
Take a long walk out of the hindsight start anew  
  
Look around maybe buy a new topcoat  
Stop moping the rain's gonna rain through  
Rain through on you  
Yes it's true that  
  
Nobody's sunny all the time  
But I know you  
And you know me  
And it's alright  
  
And it's your life  
And it's my life  
It's our life in the city  
  
And it's your life  
And it's my life  
It's our life in the city  
  
Got a new piece out in the hills  
Plant a seed I'm in need of a break from the fire drill  
Repaint where all the paint ain't  
Got a clean slate and maybe we can buy a thrill  
I'll foot that bill  
Yes I will  
  
Nobody's busy all the time  
Oh thank God that I know you  
And you know me  
And it's alright  
  
Oh, you cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine it's better on you anyway  
  
Cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine it's better on you anyway
