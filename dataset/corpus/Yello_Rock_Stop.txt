I'm dancing like a mad man  
I hope she likes-a me  
The chance to be just on my own  
I want to silly be  
  
The club is full of people  
Perhaps they think I'm mad  
I close my eyes and I go home  
I feel a little sad  
  
[Chorus]  
I just can't dance  
My only chance  
  
I'm shy, shy, oh so shy  
  
The girls don't like the way I move  
I think at times I've lost it  
Do I look like I can't move  
Or do I move exhausted  
  
If I just knew she loves me  
I know I wouldn't care  
But she talks to the barman  
And I think that's unfair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm sad, sad, oh so sad  
  
And now that girl moves close to me  
I join into her move  
Pretending I enjoy it  
And now I lost the groove  
  
One guy stands tho', between us  
Shows up with all his power  
I now feel like an idiot  
Who stands in a cold shower  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The barman stares at me  
So? So drink  
Then turns around  
And pours a wink  
  
I move away  
But play it cool  
I think she's right  
I'm just a fool  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm shy, shy, oh so shy
