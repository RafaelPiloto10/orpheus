I know you're the only one who understands  
Afore ye go, before you leave  
You always shake my hand  
Even when I'm crazy, on fire and naked  
Just as Nature intended  
No style but easily blended  
  
You always know where I'll be found  
Hanging somewhere near the ground  
Help me up or help me down  
  
Don't want to lose those days  
When everything is just a haze  
I'm dreaming  
  
I believe I could walk before I learned to crawl  
When I look up, the Devil's looking back  
From the mirror on the wall  
You can open the door  
Got my feet stuck to the floor  
I may have lost my way  
But I didn't get where I am today  
  
Don't want to lose those days  
When everything is just a haze  
I'm dreaming  
  
You spin into my empty room  
And once again I'm almost human  
Almost human
