See those trees  
Bend in the wind  
I feel they've got a lot more sense than me  
You see I try to resist  
  
A rubberband bouncing back to life  
A rubberband bend the beat  
If I could learn to give like a rubberband  
  
I'd be back on my feet  
A rubberband hold me trousers up  
A rubberband ponytails  
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband  
  
I'd be a rubberband girl  
A rubberband girl me  
A rubberband girl me  
Oh I want to be a rubberband girl  
  
When I slip out  
Of my catapult  
I gotta land with my feet on the ground  
And let my body catch up  
  
A rubberband bouncing back to life  
A rubberband bend the beat  
If I could learn to give like a rubberband  
  
I'd be back on my feet  
A rubberband hold me trousers up  
A rubberband ponytails  
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband  
  
I'd be a rubberband girl  
A rubberband girl me  
A rubberband girl me  
Oh I want to be a rubberband girl  
  
Give like a rubberband  
Twang like a rubberband  
Snap like a rubberband  
Rub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub  
Rub-a-dub-a-dub  
Rub-a-dub  
One rubberband won't keep you up  
Two rubberbands won't keep you up  
Three rubberbands won't keep you up  
  
Here I go  
Yeah!  
  
One rubberband won't keep you up  
Two rubberbands won't keep you up  
Three rubberbands won't keep you up
