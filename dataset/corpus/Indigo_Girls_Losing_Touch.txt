Here I am  
Shooting for the sky  
You say youve settled in  
Yeah well I guess thats good for you  
But Im still trying to tear myself free  
Well I could take it or leave it  
You know thats what Ive said to myself  
But then I start to tremble  
And Im lost to a powerless cause  
  
Im losing touch  
Sometimes my memories  
They just seem to fade fast away  
Ive been losing too much  
Losing the feel for the dreams I once thought I had  
Sometimes I feel like theyre all circling around  
They keep calling to me and I keep falling down  
Id rather be alone and lonely lying on the ground  
Than in those grips again  
  
Theyre so cruel  
Taught me to fly  
Then they stole my sky  
Taught me to love  
Then they broke me down  
Till there was nothing left but emptiness  
And dont you ever feel like theyre all circling around  
They keep calling to me and I keep falling down  
Id rather be alone and lonely lying on that ground  
Than in those grips again  
  
Well I could take it I could leave it you know hah  
Thats what Ive said to myself  
Ive been down there so many times you know  
And it hurts like nothing else  
Cause Im losing touch  
Ive been slipping away  
Ive been losing too much
