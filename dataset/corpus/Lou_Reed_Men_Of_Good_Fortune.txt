Men of good fortune, often cause empires to fall  
While men of poor beginnings, often can't do anything at all  
The rich son waits for his father to die  
The poor just drink and cry  
And me I just don't care at all  
  
Men of good fortune, very often can't do a thing  
While men of poor beginnings, often can do anything  
At heart they try to act like a man  
Handle things the best way they can  
They have no rich daddy to fall back on  
  
Men of good fortune, often cause empires to fall  
While men of poor beginnings, often can't do anything at all  
It takes money to make money they say  
Look at the Fords, but didn't they start that way  
Anyway, it makes no difference to me  
  
Men of good fortune, often wish that they could die  
While men of poor beginnings want what they have  
And to get it they'll die  
All those great things that live has to give  
They want to have money and live  
But me, I just don't care at all  
  
Men of good fortune  
Men of poor beginnings
