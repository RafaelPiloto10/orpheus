How money polluted my mind  
Dough, what our lives are lived for  
Rae, just a crazy Aussie  
Me, the generation forges on  
Fo, dder for corporations  
Sew, wing our lives together  
LA, such a nice place to get shot  
  
But don't forget the T it  
Follows liber in the Constitution  
Following the part about pursuit  
Of happiness the bi product  
Of colonial precious metal  
Mine extracts which  
Brings us back  
To dough  
  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
  
Today I saw a kid  
Torture a cat  
Too much leisure  
Teenage Norman Rockwell  
Paints it black!  
  
How, did the chain get started  
Mo, re is what everyone wants  
Ney, dy is what none of us are  
Co, operation died last night  
Rup, tured bleeding heart forsight  
Me, I'm just a loo  
  
So don't expect the best you won't be disappointed when you take  
A bite and watch the worm crawl back inside. listen to the  
Fairy tales of million dollar happiness,  
Los Angelistic lifestyle drinking  
Chardonnay over a lobster salad brunch  
  
Do do do do  
Do do do do  
Do do do do  
Do do do do  
  
The pursuit of million dollar happiness  
  
Happiness was killed we watched it bleed, some say it died from hate  
Some say from bleeding heart disease
