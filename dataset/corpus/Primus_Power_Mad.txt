Military show is blastin' off to Kosovo.  
Military show with lightning speed.  
Sensitivity? oh, just a rusty nail in the corporate show.  
How many stabs before we bleed?  
  
Those Pinocchios chattering out in stereo,  
Boy Pinocchio and his golden deed.  
Masculinity? oh, galvanized in the world wide show  
As we fertilize the seed.  
  
Power mad, I didn't chop the tree down dad  
I only try to do what's right.  
Power man, the best friend that you ever had  
Unless of course you choose to fight.  
  
Power mad, driving out of the shadows,  
He never tires when he plays.  
Power mad, he's a streak in the night time  
Speculating how he'll take on the world some day.  
  
Originality? oh, just a rusty nail in a Broadway show  
How many stabs before we succeed.  
  
Power mad, I didn't drop my pants down dad,  
I know my left hand from my right.  
Power man, the best friend that you ever had  
Unless of course you lose the fight.
