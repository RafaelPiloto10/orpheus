Just last night  
I was reminded of  
Just how bad  
It had gotten and  
Just how sick  
I had become  
But it could change  
With this relationship  
De-de range  
We've all been through some shit  
And if were a thing  
I think this things begun  
Tell me now  
What do I have to do  
To prove my love to you  
Special favors come in 31 flavors  
Were out of mints  
Pass the life savers  
I'm droppin' hints  
Candy for candy-coated tongue  
You'd be so good  
So very good for me  
What do you think  
Tell me honestly  
I'm wait wait wait  
Wait wait  
Waiting for you to come  
Tell me now  
What do I have to do  
To prove my love to you  
I'd do anything  
I'd do it all  
I'd do it all for you  
I'd climb a mountain  
I'd cross the ocean  
I'd do it it all  
To prove my love to you
