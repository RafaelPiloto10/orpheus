What the devil's goin' on  
Why don't your turn that music down  
You're going deaf and that's for sure  
But all you do is scream for more  
  
Get the lead out go for broke  
Pop your pills and drink and smoke  
Shoot those chemicals into your vein  
Anything to ease the pain  
  
Heavy metal (heavy metal) poisoning (it's a poison)  
A toxic wasteland (got a toxic wasteland) in your ear canal (in your ear
canal!)  
Overloaded (I'm overloaded), suffering (yeah!)  
Overloaded (overloaded) on sex and drugs  
  
Everything is black and white  
You are wrong and we are right  
First we'll spank your big behinds  
Then we'll twist your little minds  
  
I'm Dr. Righteous (I'm Dr. Righteous), and I'm here to sing (yeah!)  
That heavy metal (heavy metal) is poisoning  
It's a music wasteland, that destroys the young (yeah!)  
They're overloaded (overloaded) on sex and drugs, sex and drugs, sex and drugs  
And rock and roll!

Heavy metal (heavy metal) poisoning (it's a poison)  
A toxic wasteland (got a toxic wasteland) in your love canal love canal!)  
Overloaded (I'm overloaded), suffering (yeah!)  
Overloaded (overloaded) on sex and drugs, sex and drugs, sex and drugs  
sex and drugs, sex and drugs, sex and drugs, sex and drugs, sex and drugs
