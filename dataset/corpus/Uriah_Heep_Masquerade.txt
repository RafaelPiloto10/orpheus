A masquerade of dancing shadows  
Appear before me  
Through my mystic window  
And soon to be seen  
I saw presented  
Became a vision that  
I saw resented  
I stood and watched  
Its image changing  
The unseen hand was rearranging  
And all the time I wondered  
How did it wind  
Slowly, surely it unfolded  
Its simple lines just as  
A pole wind told it  
A temporary revolution  
My problems rose and fell  
With a lapse of illusion  
My mind was telling me, don't fight it  
It's just a hazard in the night  
Don't do those  
Who've lost their way  
It's a masquerade  
Masquerade, it's a masquerade ...
