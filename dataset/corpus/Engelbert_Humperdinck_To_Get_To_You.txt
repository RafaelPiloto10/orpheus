I would walk on all my friends to get to you  
If I lose them all for your love, I'll do that, too  
Guess they mean well when they tell me what to do  
But they don't know how far I'll go to get to you  
  
Burning bridges behind me to get to you  
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you  
I hold your love far above what I'd go through  
I'd give all I own for a stepping stone to get to you  
  
If it's the last I do, I'll get to you  
Because I know how much you want me to  
You're the only thing that can me my world in view  
Every breath I take, every move I make, is to get to you  
  
Burning bridges behind me to get to you  
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you  
I hold your love far above what I'd go through  
I'd give all I own for a stepping stone to get to you
