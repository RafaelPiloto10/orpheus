Flying cross the desert in a TWA  
Saw a women walking  
Cross the sand  
They been walking thirty miles  
In route to L.A. to get  
A brown eyed handsome man  
The destination was  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass  
She had the world  
In the palm of her hand  
But she lost both her arms  
In a wrestling match to get  
A brown eyed handsome man  
She fought and won herself  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Way back in history  
Three thousand years  
Back ever since the world began  
Been a whole lot a good women  
Shedding tears for  
A brown eyed handsome man  
That's what the trouble was  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Beautiful daughter couldn't  
Make up her mind between  
A doctor and a lawyer man  
Mamma told her daughter  
Go out and find herself  
A brown eyed handsome man  
Just like your daddy is  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Arrested on charges  
Of unemployment  
He was sitting in the witness stand  
The judges wife called up  
The district attorney said you better  
Free that brown eyed man  
If you want your job you'd better  
Free that brown eyed man  
  
Way back in history  
Three thousand years  
Back when ever since the world began  
Got a whole lotta good woman  
Shedding tears for  
A brown eyed handsome man  
That's what the trouble was  
A brown eyed handsome man
