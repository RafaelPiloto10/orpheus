Come on, come on now what you say  
Somebody say you leave today  
What's this thing you're doin' to me  
What's this fool you're tryin' to be  
You're talkin' nothin' but a load of guff  
You're tryin' to put somethin' in my lap, lap  
  
Don't go. Please don't leave me  
Don't go in the mornin'  
Don't go. Please don't deceive me  
Don't take it away  
  
I do, I do anything for you  
You make my stormy clouds blue  
Inside out, I'm upside down  
Back to front I'm all around  
Don't cha leave me by myself  
I don't like it  
  
Don't go. Please don't leave me  
Don't go in the mornin'  
Don't go. Please don't deceive me  
Don't take it away
