I know a girl who gets off  
By sticking needles in her vein  
Oh Lord what a shame  
She's got no money so she turns tricks  
  
And plays dirty games  
Oh Lord spare her pain  
What she says she do to you  
You'd have to be insane  
  
The bathroom stall, her bedroom  
The one that's always engaged  
She sleeps and eats with the plague  
She's got a baby in her belly  
  
But she just don't care  
What will be come of the pair  
Oh Lord what can she do  
To get the shit out of her hair  
  
To get the shit out of her hair  
Blues for sister someone  
Oh Lord
