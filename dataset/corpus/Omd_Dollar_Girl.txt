When you know the dollar girl  
Is coming home again  
Then you know that destiny  
Will never be your friend  
  
Her heart is in her pocket  
And her head is in your hands  
You thought it would be easy  
But I guessed she changed your plans  
  
Now you know there's no release  
From all the tears she cries  
Slowly it seems obvious  
She'll love you til she dies  
  
Stay with me now  
Til the end of the day  
If you stay we can talk  
I will hear what you say  
If you leave me tonight  
While my heart is on fire  
Stay with me now  
I will be your desire  
  
And when you go the dollar girl  
Will justify your care  
She burns you with her confidence  
And prays that you won't dare  
  
Now you know there's no release  
From all the tears she cries  
Slowly it seems obvious  
She'll love you til she dies  
  
Stay with me now  
Til the end of the day  
If you stay, we can talk  
I will hear what you say  
If you leave me tonight  
While my heart is on fire  
Stay with me now  
I will be your desire  
  
Now you know there's no release  
From all the tears she cries  
Slowly it seems obvious  
She'll love you til she dies  
  
Stay with me now  
Til the end of the day  
If you stay, we can talk  
I will hear what you say  
If you leave me tonight  
While my heart is on fire  
Stay with me now  
I will be your desire
