Tears in your life  
Nothing but tears in your life  
They come to you in the night  
Tears in your life  
  
Softly they call  
Gathering slowly they fall  
You see those tears and they're all  
Tears in your life  
  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
  
Tears in your life  
Nothing but tears in your life  
Heartbroken fool's paradise  
Tears in your life  
  
Softly they call  
Gathering slowly they fall  
You see those tears and they're all  
Tears in your life  
  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life
