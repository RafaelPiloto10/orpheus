What kind of love is this that leaves me feeling cold  
You look right through me what see nobody knows  
You're in a world all by yourself - needing no one else  
Feeling so secure  
  
You're on the road to nowhere, left your past behind  
What's to become of me, should feelings be denied  
Another time another place, would i be the same old face  
For you to have around  
  
There's no way in, there's no way out i'm caught in the middle  
Why must you leave my heart in doubt  
We have a one way love that flows from me to you  
There's nothing more for me to lose  
  
We're through with talking now we know that it's the end  
We've played our foolish games amd it's useless to pretend  
It seems like only yesterday, that love had come to stay  
How could we be so blind  
  
There's no way in, there's no way out i'm caught in the middle  
Why must you leave my heart in doubt  
We have a one way love that flows from me to you  
There's nothing more for me to lose  
  
I don't know where your heart is or what's inside your head  
If this is love you said it, if this is love forget it  
If this is love then count me out
