I stand accused before you  
I have no tears to cry,  
And you will never break me,  
'Till the day I die  
  
A criminal mind, is all I  
All I've ever had,  
Ask one who's known me,  
If I'm really so bad  
I am  
  
I've spent my life behind these steel bars,  
I've paid my dept in time,  
But being brought to justice,  
That was my only crime  
  
A criminal mind, is all I,  
All I've ever had,  
Ask one who's known me,  
If I'm really so bad  
I am  
  
Before you hand me over,  
Before you read my sentence,  
I'd like to say a few words,  
Here in my own defense  
  
Some people struggle daily,  
They struggle with their conscience 'till the end  
I have no guilt to harm me,  
I feel no wrong intent  
  
A criminal mind, is all I,  
All I've ever known,  
Don't try to reform me,  
'Cause I'm made of cold stone  
  
My criminal mind, is all I,  
All I ever had,  
Ask one who's known me,  
If I'm really so bad,  
I am (yeah!)  
  
Whoa oh I am  
Whoa oh I am  
Made of cold stone  
I'm made of cold stone  
Just like the prison walls  
I'm made of cold stone  
Got a criminal mind  
Whoa oh oh  
Whoa oh oh yeah  
A criminal mind  
I got a criminal mind  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
A criminal,  
Mind
