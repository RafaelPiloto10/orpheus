Do you believe that you're dead when you die  
Or do you believe in a soul  
You have the power to mess with their minds  
You've got them under control  
Everybody wants a piece of you  
To take them higher than they ever were on the ground  
(All I wanna say is)  
Cinnamon, Cinnamon  
Don't let them down  
Cinnamon, Cinnamon  
Don't let them down  
Nobody sees that you smile when you lie  
You'll take that mask to your grave  
You know what you're doing  
God knows you're not blind  
You just don't want to be saved  
Line 'em up and knock 'em down  
You've taken everything and still keep coming around  
Cinnamon, Cinnamon  
Don't let them down  
Cinnamon, Cinnamon  
Don't let them down  
You have the power to mess with their lives  
They're under your control  
Everybody wants a piece of you  
To take them higher than they ever were on the ground  
Cinnamon, Cinnamon  
Don't let them down  
Cinnamon, Cinnamon  
Don't let them down...
