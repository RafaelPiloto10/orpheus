All the love in the world couldn't save you  
All the innocence inside  
You know I tried so hard to make you  
To make you change your mind  
  
And it hurts too much to see you  
And how you left yourself behind  
You know I didn't want to meet you  
Now there's a hell I can't describe  
  
So now I wander through my day  
Trying to find my way  
Still these feelings that I felt  
I said to you and no one else  
  
And no it's not going to change  
I know it's gone, still I'm used  
And that's nice to hang on someone  
A change that's bittersweet  
  
That's called the blues  
  
Don't know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know it's what you planned, this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore  
  
I don't know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know it's what we planned, this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore  
  
What this means to me  
The more I know you believe  
What I thought was you now  
Has got more that it changed on you  
  
What I thought was true  
The more that I might know is you  
What I thought was you  
Is only memories, distant
