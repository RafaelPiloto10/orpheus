It's a sign of the times, standing in line  
Quietly waiting to go out of your mind  
There's nothing to say, no reason to stay  
To fight for the right that they have taken away  
Get what you get, not what you need  
Time after time  
  
(1) Rags to riches, all fallen down  
Rags to riches, tied up and bound  
There's no going under  
When you're kicked to the ground  
Rags to riches..rags to riches  
  
You're down on your knees, caught in the freeze  
Crying inside but there's no easy release  
Radical views--in yesterday news  
Giving the reason with another excuse  
Out on your own, cut to the bone  
Time after time  
  
[repeat (1)x2]
