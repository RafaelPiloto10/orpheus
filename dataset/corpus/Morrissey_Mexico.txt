In Mexico  
I went for a walk to inhale  
The tranquil, cool, lover's air  
But I could taste a trace  
Of American chemical waste  
And the small voice said  
"What can we do?"  
  
In Mexico  
I went for a walk to inhale  
The tranquil, cool, lover's air  
But I could sense the hate  
From the Lone Star state  
And a small voice said  
"What can we do?"  
  
It seems if you're rich and you're white  
You'll be alright  
I just don't see why  
This should be so  
If you're rich and you're white  
You'll be alright  
I just don't see why  
This should be so  
  
In Mexico  
I lay on the grass  
And I cried my heart out  
For want of my love  
Oh, for want of my love  
Oh, for want of my love  
  
It seems if you're rich and you're white  
You think you're so right  
I just don't see why  
This should be so  
If you're rich and you're white  
Then you'll be OK  
I just don't see why  
This should be so  
  
In Mexico  
I lay on the grass  
And I cried my heart out  
For want of my love  
For want of my love  
For want of my love  
For want of my love
