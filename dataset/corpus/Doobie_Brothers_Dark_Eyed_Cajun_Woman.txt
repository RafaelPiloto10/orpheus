I think back to the time  
When I first saw your face  
You were walkin' across the delta  
To your cold and lonely place  
You know, I took you for a small girl  
Really not quite seventeen  
Oh, Lord, but I was wrong, oh so wrong  
You're like a woman I've never seen  
  
Dark eyed Cajun woman  
Where are you comin' from  
Your soul is in the back woods  
They say you never had a home  
But I'm gonna know you better  
If it takes all night and day  
Dark eyed Cajun woman  
You'll never get away, no, no  
  
Now the evenin' breeze is blowin'  
I hear your voice most everywhere  
Your cold, black eyes  
They are dancin' in the starlight  
Warmin' the cold night air  
It's so beautiful, you know I have to say  
Dark eyed Cajun woman  
You'll never get away
