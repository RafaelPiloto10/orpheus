I find no hope within to call my own  
For I am frail of heart, my strength is gone  
But deep within my soul is rising up a song  
Here in the comfort of the faithful one  
  
I walk a narrow road through valleys deep  
In search of higher ground, on mountains steep  
And though with feet unsure, I still keep pressing on.  
For I am guided by the faithful one.  
  
Faithful, faithful to the end,  
My true and precious friend,  
You have been faithful,  
Faithful, so faithful to me  
  
I see your wounded hands, I touch your side  
With thorns upon your brow you bled and died  
But there's an empty tomb, a love for all who come  
And give their hearts to you, the faithful one.  
  
Faithful, faithful to the end,  
My true and precious friend,  
You have been faithful,  
Faithful, so faithful to me  
  
And when the day is dawned and when the race is run  
I will bow down before God's only Son  
And I will lift my hands in praise for all you've done  
And I will worship you, my faithful one.
