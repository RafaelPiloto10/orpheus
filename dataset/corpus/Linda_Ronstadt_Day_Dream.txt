Funny the way that I feel now  
Can't keep my feet on the ground  
Everything seems unreal now  
When you're not around  
Day dream  
Why do you haunt me so?  
Deep in a rosy glow  
The face of my love you show  
Day dream  
I walk along on air  
Building a castle there  
For me and my love to share  
Don't know the time  
Lordy, I'm in a daze  
Sun in the sky  
While I moon around, feeling hazy  
Day dream  
Don't break my reverie  
Until I find that he  
Is daydreaming just like me  
Don't know the time  
Lordy, I'm in a daze  
Sun in the sky  
While I moon around, feeling hazy  
Day dream  
Don't break my reverie  
Until I find that he  
Is daydreaming just like me
