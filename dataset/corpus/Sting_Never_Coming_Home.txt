Well it's five in the morning and the light's already broken  
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken  
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers  
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers  
  
There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour  
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower  
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him  
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer  
  
There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door  
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more  
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor  
And you're torn if you should leave him with a number  
  
And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away  
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say  
And you tell him that you're never coming home  
  
She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculation's
right  
And there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night  
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day  
She'll take a job she'll find a friend she'll make a life that's better  
  
The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella  
And there's nothing they can do for her, there's nothing they can tell her  
There's nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today  
She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her  
  
Now in her imagination she's a million miles away  
When too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head  
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie  
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know  
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better  
  
I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor  
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face  
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late  
I'm almost done and then I see the letter  
  
In his imagination she's a universe away  
Too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I'm gonna live my life  
And she told him she was never coming home  
I'm gonna live my life in my own way
