N-n-n-not too far but long ago  
When life was straight up and cars would move slow  
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed  
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)  
Now life is a musical  
  
I called Big Boi on the telephone  
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"  
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong  
Cause ain't nothing changed (it's simple)  
Now let's make a musical  
  
Based on big infection  
No words like such grow in some action  
And you got us well to a fraction  
Cause things have changed (it's all hood)  
The Kast go Hollywood  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let 'em don't let 'em [Repeat: x2]  
Change us change us  
Change us change us  
Don't let 'em don't let 'em [Repeat: x2]  
Change us change us  
Change us change us  
Don't let 'em don't let 'em [Repeat: x2]  
Change us change us  
Change us change us  
Don't let 'em don't let 'em [Repeat: x4]  
  
Don't
