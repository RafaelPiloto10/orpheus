Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone  
My son, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run  
No need to get bothered, I'll think about Monday  
When Monday comes, it's two for one  
Mister Hoot 'n Holler, gotta make a dollar  
Another lazy mornin', I took time to make town 'n stock a pint or two  
The most delicious brew  
Keepin' up with the joneses, I hope no one telephones us  
I'd take a place in the country, but for now the old back yard  
Looks to me like fifty acres of the roundest ground in town  
Another lazy mornin', come supper time I'm gonna light my barbecue  
Nothin' new, only that she loves me  
And nothin' I know can change me, no need to get bothered  
I do more livin' than it might seem  
Some dream, livin' like a pauper, bless my darlin' daughter  
I'd like to know what makes a man go, over land and sea  
I guess it must get kinda lonesome, that's the way I used to be  
Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone  
Such fun, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run
