It's the most wonderful time of the year  
  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
With the kids jingle-belling  
And everyone telling you be of good cheer  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings  
When friend come to call  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost story  
And tales of glories of christmas long, long ago  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time of the year
