Come with me  
  
Its all so easy for me to see  
We can be  
Close together, for always forever  
Youll never believe but it's true  
  
You will see  
The happy corners where we will be  
Its for real  
Ill sing to you all the songs that we knew  
That's not true don't be blue they're for you  
  
Can you feel  
Its spinning round like a great big wheel  
Its for real  
Ill sing to you all the songs that we knew  
That's not true don't be blue they're for you  
  
Come with me  
Come with me  
  
Come with me  
Its all so easy for me to see  
Come with me  
When I find that you're all on my mind  
That's the time I will say come with me
