He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see  
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me  
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity  
He dreamed up a god and called it Christianity  
Your god is dead and no one cares  
If there is a hell I will see you there  
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line  
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine  
His perfect kingdom of killing suffering and pain  
Demands devotion atrocities done in his name  
Your god is dead and no one cares  
Drowning in his own hypocrisy  
And if there is a hell I will see you there  
Burning with your god in humility  
Will you die for this?
