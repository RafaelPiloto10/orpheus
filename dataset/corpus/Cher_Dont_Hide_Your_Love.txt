You never give yourself completely  
It's just that you've been hurt before  
You're so afraid to let me love you  
You never leave an open door  
Don't judge me by some other lover  
Who broke your heart and walked away  
Come let's be fair with one another  
My world is yours i swear it  
Say the word and we can share it  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't hide your love  
(don't hide your love)  
Not if you care for me  
(not if you care for me)  
It isn't fair for me  
To worry and wonder and wait  
Don't hide your love  
(don't hide your love)  
Just love me here and now  
(just love me here and now)  
We'll work it out somehow  
Don't you keep us apart  
Baby unlock your heart  
Don't hide your love  
  
Well i now the past has bought you sorrow  
The clouds still hang around today  
But don't let the rain, fall on tomorrow  
Baby we can make it together  
'cause i'm gonna love you forever  
  
[Chorus]
