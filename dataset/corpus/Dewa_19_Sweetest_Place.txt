This is the sweetest place  
Baring my feeling  
I'm welcoming an eye  
Into the darkest one  
It tells me not to worry  
For the time is yet to come  
For someone to arrive  
And heal the troubled one  
Suddenly the rainfalls  
Showering a desert stone  
Wash away these tears of yesterday  
I hear the sound of  
A raising chorus  
Sung by the angels  
And the broken heroes  
I wont go back now I feel so right  
I've found a place  
Where dreams and life become one  
And finally I don' t have to run  
I've found a place  
Where dreams and life become one  
Become one
