I put all my eggs in the bacon slicer  
But now it's turned out fine.  
In fact it couldn't be nice  
A nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider  
Seven days later I was a man of the world  
...... I thought  
I'll go and get a slice of pizza from the pizzeria  
Oh, and a coke  
Has anybody got the change of five quid  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me and happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But you'd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
I played a blinder against a gaggle of nuns  
I was all mouth and trousers they were fingers  
And thumbs had a lesson from the vicar on oral hygiene  
He was stitching my trousers, and staring at  
Christine she had three tickets to see Alfie at the Odeon  
"What's it all about Christine?"  
Free you mind  
Yeah... But what the...  
I'm happy to to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But you'd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
How I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me
