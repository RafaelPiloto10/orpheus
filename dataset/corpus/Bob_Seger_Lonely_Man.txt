So lonely, I'm a lonely man from Gainesville  
(He ain't got nowhere to go), got nowhere to go  
Said I don't want doin' wrong over this land  
(Yes his blood is growin' cold), cold, gettin colder  
  
Yeah, I believe that all the people on the street  
Take the time, time to stare  
Not lonely in their eyes, for thinkin' that I'm nowhere  
Lord, I wasn't born, wasn't born to wander aimlessly  
Lord it can't be  
I don't want it to be my destiny  
Lord, woman come an help me  
  
Oh I wish that I could find me a turkey  
(all he needs is good sweet love)  
Yeah gotta go quack quack  
Oh baby I would know in my heart I would be lucky  
(That's the only way to go)  
Yeah, be fine  
  
Yeah, I wanna tell you that all the people on that street  
They take the time to stare  
I can see in their eyes, for thinkin' that I'm nowhere  
Lord, I wasn't born, wasn't born to wander 'round aimlessly  
Can't be, can't be  
Don't want it to be my destiny Lord, take ahold of me  
  
Sure don't wanna be a lonely man
