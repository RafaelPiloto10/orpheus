A race of angels bound with one another  
A dish of dollars laid out for all to see  
A tower room at Eden Rock  
His golf at noon for free  
  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
  
His lady's aching to bring a body down  
She daily preaches on where she wants to be  
An evening with a movie queen  
A face we all have seen  
  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
  
A case of aces done up loose for dealing  
A piece of island cooling in the sea  
The whole of time we gain or lose  
And power enough to choose  
  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
  
Yeah, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me  
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
