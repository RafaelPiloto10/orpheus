We haven't met, and that's okay  
'Cause you will be asking for me one day  
  
Don't want to wait in line  
The moment is mine believe me  
  
Don't close your eyes  
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'  
And I think that I can shake it  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve  
  
Electrified, I'm on a wire  
Gettin' together and we're on fire  
What I said, you heard  
Now I've got you spinning  
  
Don't close your mind  
The words I use are open  
And I think that I can show you  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I know what you like  
I know what you think  
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve  
  
You... You need to discover  
Who you can make you feel free  
And I, I need to uncover  
The part of you that's reaching out for me, hey  
  
I know where I stand  
I know who I am  
I would never run away when life gets bad  
It's everything I see  
Every part of me  
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I know what you like  
I know what you think  
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink

Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve  
I got nerve

Every part of me  
Gonna get what I deserve

You make me feel free  
And I, I need to uncover  
The part of you that's reaching out for me
