Hello, it's late  
You know I've tried to stop the rain  
Did you read about it?  
Did you think about it?  
Did you cry but nothing came?  
  
Hello it's late  
I know we tried to win the game  
Did you hear about it?  
Did you dream about it?  
I know you cried but nothing changed?  
Nothing matters again  
I didn't think it'd last that long  
But I'm just sittin' on this merry-go-round,  
And the music is too loud  
  
It's just a game  
That we used to play  
I didn't think we'd  
Take it all the way  
It kills me just because  
It can't be erased,  
We're married
