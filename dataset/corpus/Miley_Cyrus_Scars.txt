I can pretend that I don't see you,  
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around,  
(When you're around)  
I can say that nothing was right,  
But we know if I looked in your eyes, I'd break down,  
(Yeah, lets break down)  
  
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,  
And what we were, and what we are,  
Is hidden, in the scars,  
If I could, take you there,  
I won't let go, this I swear,  
You won't have to wonder what we are,  
Cause you wont have to look to far,  
Its in the scars, its hidden in the scars,  
  
If I told you that I love you,  
But I'm doing alright without you it'd be a lie,  
But I could try,  
I'd run a thousand miles we're leaving,  
You're the only one, I want you to bring me to break down,  
(Yeah let's break down!)  
  
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,  
And what we were, and what we are,  
Is hidden, in the scars  
  
If I could, take you there,  
I wont let go, this I swear,  
You won't have to wonder what we are,  
Cause you won't have to look to far,  
It's in the scars, ooh  
  
Yeah I'll tell you all my secrets,  
All the ones I've kept inside,  
And I'll give you all the reasons,  
That you faded from my life,  
I won't let go  
Baby come here close, I won't let you walk away  
And what we were, and what we are,  
Is hidden, in the scars,  
If I could, take you there,  
I won't let go, baby this I swear,  
You won't have to wonder what we are,  
Cause you wont have to look to far,  
It's in the scars, its hidden in the scars, it's hidden in the scars!  
Yeah-yeah-eh-eh-eh-yeah-eh  
  
I can pretend that I don't see you,  
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around
