You made me cry when you said goodbye  
Ain't that a shame?  
My tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
  
Oh well, goodbye, although I'm crying  
Ain't that a shame?  
My tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
You know you're the one to blame  
Baby  
  
Well, you broke my heart when you said we're gonna part  
But ain't that a shame?  
Oh my tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame, yeah  
  
Oh well, goodbye, although I'm crying  
Ain't that a shame?  
Oh, my tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
Ain't that a shame  
  
Oh well, good goodbye although I'm gonna cry  
Ain't that a shame?  
Oh my tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame
