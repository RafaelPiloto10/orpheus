You say you're always right and I'm wrong  
You tell me I am weak and you are strong  
Always tried so hard  
Now you've gone too far  
I'll give all or nothing now to play my cards.  
You pretend it's for fun  
In the end when it's done  
You might say it's a game  
But I will show no mercy.  
You talk so much but you don't have a clue  
You lie so much you even think it's true  
Now I'm in the lead  
Want to see you bleed  
Say goodbye I am forever in control.  
You must learn oh so well  
You shall burn in my hell  
You might say it's a game  
I will show no mercy.  
And now it's said and done it's all completed  
You think you've won you know you are defeated  
Now it's all so clear  
I'm your greatest fear  
You have lived a lie be prepared to die.  
You must learn oh so well  
You shall burn in my hell  
You might say it's a game  
I will show no mercy.
