In Berlin, by the wall  
You were five foot ten inches tall  
It was very nice  
Candlelight and Dubonnet on ice  
  
We were in a small cafe  
You could hear the guitars play  
It was very nice  
It was paradise  
  
You're right and I'm wrong  
Hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day  
  
Oh, you're right and I'm wrong  
You know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day  
One sweet day  
  
In a small, small cafe  
We could hear the guitars play  
It was very nice  
Candlelight and Dubonnet on ice  
  
Don't forget, hire the vet  
He hasn't had much fun yet  
It was very nice  
Hey honey, it was paradise  
  
You're right and I'm wrong  
Hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day  
You're right, oh, and I'm wrong  
You know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day, one sweet day  
  
One sweet day  
One sweet day, oh, one sweet day  
One sweet day, baby, baby, one sweet day ...
