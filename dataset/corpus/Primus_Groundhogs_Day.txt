When I woke up this mornin' I felt a pang.  
I was hungerin' for some apple pie.  
Stumble in the bathroom, hung my hog a little bit.  
Washed the sleep out of my eye.  
Oh yeah, it's gonna be a fine day.  
Scratched myself a bit.  
Poured me out a bowl-a corn chex.  
Closest thing I could find to apple pie.  
Lingerin' taste of toothpaste  
Made the milk go down a bit funny.  
But you know, them chex they do satisfy.  
Oh yeah, this'll be a fine day.  
So, after my mornin' rise-n-shine and eat-n-clean.  
Had my mind set to hit them streets.  
Drizzle from the night left cold puddles out.  
Had my black stomp-boots on my feet.  
It's my day.  
  
Since I was in kneepants my pop had tried to make me realize.  
If I set my mind down to it I could be a big man in the public eye.  
So with my big blue collar on,  
I set out to find the easy way. What an  
Ice cold bath it was when I found you had to pay to play.  
To taste the taste it's a tease that never would subside.  
The taste is strong but soured by my learned eyes.  
Well, if a woodchuck could chuck wood,  
He'd get down on his knees to pray.  
This little snappy boy might see  
The light this ground hog's day.
