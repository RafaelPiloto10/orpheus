When everybody else refrains  
My uncle Jonny did cocaine  
He's convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey, Jonny  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
I wanna go out tonight  
Come a little closer to the city lights  
Levitation ain't your only friend  
Levitation coming back again  
Feel a burning in your body's core  
It's a yearning that you can't ignore  
Now I wanna go out tonight  
  
Superman and hold on tight  
He's convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey, Jonny  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
My appetite ain't got no heart  
I said, my appetite ain't got no heart  
Shocking people when you feel that pull  
Shock 'em, drop 'em when you know it's full  
  
I feel a burning in your body's core  
It's a yearning that you can't ignore  
I gotta go out tonight  
Hey, Jonny, I got faith in you, man  
I mean it, it's gonna be all right  
He's convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
Tell us what's going on  
Feels like everything's wrong  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
If the future is real  
Jonny, you've got to heal  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
When everybody else refrains  
My uncle Jonny did cocaine
