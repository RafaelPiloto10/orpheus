We are young we can break  
Watch us fall  
We can take some train  
Down to the sea  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are real you can touch  
Just for now  
And then say  
'Hey you, which way is down'  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We are strong we run though  
We have time  
And to you I'm just  
One of those boys  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are cold  
We're not supposed to cry  
But it's all just a thought  
So here am I  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
They run fast  
Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down  
  
You are replaced you are you  
And our dreams are real  
And dreams are all we need  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We slip down  
And old eyes don't cry for me  
'Cause I doubt I'm and I doubt you  
And never never going to doubt  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
They run fast  
Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down
