I can read your degree and now give me my medicine  
Cause every drink is a poison and I think I'm Judas Christ again  
She's got a feeling its a sound I'm faking  
I got a feeling each corner's an ending  
Each minute is a dollar you can pay back your parents with  
I got a brand new vein you can tap on in and since  
Now that you've got the power of mercy  
And the chance to figure out just where I've been lately  
Now that you've got a sniff of pharmaceutic  
That can kill anything in my head that's electric  
And I'm alone with sound  
Now that you've got the power prescription  
Please make me interesting  
When I'm all done with sound  
Read my mind  
Cause I won't give sign  
She's got a feeling its a sound I'm faking  
I got a feeling each corner's an ending  
Its all sound....
