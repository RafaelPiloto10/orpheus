Early in the morning  
The sun was up and the sky was very blue,  
Without a warning,  
As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you,  
A noise in the city made the children run,  
And hide themselves away,  
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky.  
  
Looking from this window,  
A thousand rivers running past my door,  
Standing on an islane, looking for someone,  
Upon the shore,  
I can see it very clearly nothing's really changed,  
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky.  
  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears,  
  
With their brand new time transporter,  
They'll think maybe I fought to get away,  
But with all their great inventions,  
And all their good intentions, here I stay,  
Down on the corner where the sun had shone,  
The people gathered 'round,  
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground.  
  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears.
