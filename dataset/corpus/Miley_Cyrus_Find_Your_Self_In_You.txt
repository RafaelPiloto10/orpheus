She never thought that she would  
Get her second chance  
Running so far from all she's ever known  
Convinced she's lost all meaning  
Where did her dreams go  
Still she knew that there was something more  
  
Don't be scared, there's someone there  
To say these words you need to hear  
  
Chorus  
Don't let anyone tell you that your not strong enough  
Don't give up, there's nothing wrong with just being yourself  
So come on and raise your voice  
And sing hey, heyyyahh  
  
You'll find yourself in you  
  
Sometimes people tell you  
Be like me to fit in  
Do you know your identity is not in them  
  
Don't be scared, there's someone there  
To say these words you need to hear  
  
Chorus  
  
Why should I measure the world  
By someone else's design  
Oh I won't let this fly by  
Hey look over here I just found the real me  
Now it's your turn to see  
Now it's your turn to see  
  
Chorus
