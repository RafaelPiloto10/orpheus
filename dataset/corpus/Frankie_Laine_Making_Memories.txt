We're making memories each time we kiss  
Making wonderful memories when we are holding each other like this  
Green grass for a pillow, a black velvet sky above  
Tender magic moments in a wonderland of love  
  
The years may come and go but we'll recall  
Sharing love in our hideaway and how this night was the start of it all  
Darling, I'll remember my whole life through  
Making memories with you  
  
(We're making memories each time we kiss)  
(Making wonderful memories when we are holding each other like this)  
Green grass for a pillow, a black velvet sky above  
Tender magic moments in a wonderland of love  
  
And the years may come and go but we'll recall  
Sharing love in our hideaway and how this night was the start of it all  
Darling, I'll remember my whole life through  
Making memories with you  
  
Making memories with you
