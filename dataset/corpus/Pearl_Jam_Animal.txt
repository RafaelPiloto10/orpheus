Torture from you to me  
Abducted from the street  
  
I'd rather be,  
I'd rather be with,  
I'd rather be with an animal  
  
Why would you want to hurt me? Oh  
So frightened of your pain  
oh yeah, ooh  
  
I'd rather be,  
I'd rather be with,  
I'd rather be with an animal  
I'd rather be,  
I'd rather be  
I'd rather be with an animal  
  
I'd rather be,  
I'd rather be with,  
I'd rather be with an animal  
I'd rather be,  
I'd rather, rather be, oh  
rather be with an animal
