A world become one  
Of salads and sun  
Only a fool would say that  
A boy with a plan  
A natural man  
Wearing a white stetson hat  
Unhand that gun begone  
There's no one to fire upon  
If he's holding it high  
He's telling a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
I heard it was you  
Talkin' 'bout a world  
Where all is free  
It just couldn't be  
And only a fool would say that  
  
The man in the street  
Draggin' his feet  
Don't want to hear the bad news  
Imagine your face  
There is his place  
Standing inside his brown shoes  
You do his nine to five  
Drag yourself home half alive  
And there on the screen  
A man with a dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Anybody on the street  
Has murder in his eyes  
You feel no pain  
And you're younger  
Then you realize  
  
[Chorus]
