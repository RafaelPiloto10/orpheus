Oh Dambala come Dambala  
Oh Dambala come Dambala  
Think of the wings of a three toed frog  
Eat weeds from the deepest part of sea  
Oh Dambala come Dambala  
Oh Dambala come Dambala  
  
On the seventh day God will be there  
On the seventh night satan will be there  
On the seventh day God will be there  
On the seventh night satan will be there  
  
You slavers will know  
What its like to be a slave  
Slave to your heart  
Slave to your soul  
Oh Dambala come Dambala  
Oh Dambala come Dambala  
  
You slavers will know what its  
Like to be a slave  
Slave to your mind  
Slave to your race  
You won't go to heaven  
You won't go to hell  
You remain in your graves  
With the stench and the smell  
Oh Dambala come Dambala  
Oh Dambala come Dambala
