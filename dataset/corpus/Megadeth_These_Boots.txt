You keep saying you got something for me  
Something you call love, but I call sex  
You've been kissing when you ought-a-be-a  
Screwing and now someone else can  
Kiss your ass  
These boots are made for walking  
that's just what they'll do  
And one of these days these boots  
Are gonna walk all over you  
  
You keep lying and there ain't no believing  
And you keep stayin' when you ought-a-be-a leaving  
Now what's right is right but you ain't been  
  
Right yet  
These boots  
  
You keep dressin' ways you shouldn't  
Be dressing  
And you keep thinking that you'll never  
Get burned ha!  
I just found me a brand new Box Spring  
Mattress  
What you know bitch you got a lot ta learn  
These boots, are you ready boots  
  
And you think I'm kiddin', don'tchya!
