Hey, take it and run, child  
I'll ask you no questions  
We traded our fortunes  
Crossing the border  
I hope you got lucky  
You needed a change  
I--I made it without you  
Crossing the border  
We were like a couple of wetbacks running  
Standin' on the banks of some dangerous river  
Lookin' into a brave new country  
Risky business  
Crossing the border  
Ahhh, you--you doubled my chances  
I--I sure do want your freedom  
I--I'll never forget you  
Crossing the border  
Back when we were out there  
Crossing the border  
Layin' it on the line  
Crossing the border
