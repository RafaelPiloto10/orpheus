Darkness in the morning  
Shadows on the land  
Certain individuals  
Aren't sticking with the plan  
  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
Leaving in the evening  
Traveling at night  
Staying inconspicuous  
I'm staying out of sight  
  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
They tell you love requires a little standing in line  
And I've been waiting for you lover for a long, long time  
I've been pacing the floor, I've been watching the door  
Meanwhile I'll keep searching for a heart  
  
I've been searching high and low for you  
Trying to track you down  
Certain individuals  
Have finally come around  
  
And I'm searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
They tell you love requires a little standing in line  
And I've been waiting for you lover for a long, long time  
I've been pacing the floor, I've been watching that door  
Meanwhile I'll keep searching for a heart  
  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
  
They say love conquers all  
You can't start it like a car  
You can't stop it with a gun  
Searching for a heart
