Flatbush boy cruisin' sheepshead bay  
His boardwalk mama just a sniff away  
Underground dmt, ridin' thunder train  
The cone island white fish boy is on the run again  
  
Oh, runnin' with the pack  
Oh, never lookin' back  
Oh, know just where he's been  
That coney island white fish boy's  
Been there and back again  
  
Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen  
And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams  
She combs her hair, that flamin' jewel  
Streaked with clorox bleach  
Coney gettin' down and dirty  
Snortin' up the beach  
  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
Go get 'em coney  
  
(coney), bone to bone screamin'  
(coney) she be screamin' (coney)  
Get down  
Get back in town  
Get back, get down  
Get back in town  
Get back, get down  
Coney!  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
Best believe it (coney)
