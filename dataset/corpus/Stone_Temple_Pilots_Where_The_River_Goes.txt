Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of a storm and never blow away  
Well I'm a young man with a knife to my back. Some things never seem to change  
  
Nowhere to run to, Nowhere to hide Sing the song or keep it inside  
Bought to farm, but the farmer done died. Sing that song, sing that song
inside  
  
I wish I could live in the dream that I fly on tarred and feathered wings  
Well, I'm losing a game of reality dice where the dealer never ever pays  
  
Nowhere to run to...  
  
I wanna be as big as a mountain, I wanna fly as high as the sun,  
I wanna know what the rent's like in heaven I wanna know where the river goes  
  
Yeah, I could hide in the calm of the eye of a storm and never blow away  
Well I'm a young man with a knife to my back Some things never seem to change  
  
Nowhere to run to...  
  
Ii wanna be as big as a mountain...  
  
If I was stronger I could be a mountain range  
If night was longer Could I escape the day?
