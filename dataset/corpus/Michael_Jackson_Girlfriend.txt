Girlfriend  
I'm gonna tell your boyfriend (yeah)  
Tell him (woo hoo)  
Exactly what we're doin' (yeah)  
Tell him what you do to me  
Late at night when the wind is free  
  
Girlfriend  
I'm gonna show your boyfriend (yeah)  
Show him (woo hoo)  
The letters I've been savin' (yeah)  
Show him how you feel inside  
An' how love could not be denied (oh no)  
  
[Chorus]  
We're gonna have to tell him  
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine  
Do-doot-do, etc.  
  
We're gonna have to tell him  
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine  
  
Girlfriend  
You better tell your boyfriend (yeah)  
Tell him (woo hoo)  
Exactly what we're doin' (yeah)  
Tell him what he needs to know  
Or he may never let you go  
  
[Chorus: x2]
