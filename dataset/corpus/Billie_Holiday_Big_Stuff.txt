So you cry  
What's it about, baby?  
You ask why  
Blues had to go and pick you  
So you go  
Down to the shore, kid's stuff  
Don't you know  
There's honey in the store for you, big stuff  
Let's take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
  
So you stare  
Call it despair, baby  
Don't you care  
I'm on the square about you  
Let's have a try  
It maybe that you're my guy  
Let's take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
Come in from out of the rain
