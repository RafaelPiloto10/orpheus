[Chorus]  
Show me who you are  
I'll show you what you love  
I'll give you half the world if that's enough  
  
[Verse]  
Let me take you down  
Let me hear you smile  
Let me rest my head here for a while  
In the end we'll leave it all behind  
Because the life I think I'm trying to find  
Is probably all in the mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Show me who you are  
I'll show you what you love  
I'll give you half the world if that's enough
