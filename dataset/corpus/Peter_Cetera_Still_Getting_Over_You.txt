Since you went away  
Can't face the day  
Just can't face it on my own  
Try to be strong, try to carry on  
With a broken heart in an empty home  
  
Lying awake half the night without sleeping  
Hopelessly thinking of you  
Here in my heart I have to admit it's true  
I'm still getting over you  
  
I begged you not to leave  
I asked you not to run away  
Oh but you wouldn't listen  
I couldn't change your mind  
  
So you left me here behind  
Oh how I miss your touch  
And your tender kissing  
Lying awake half the night without sleeping  
  
Hopelessly thinking of you  
Deep down inside I hate to admit it's true  
But I'm still getting over you  
  
Lying awake half the night without sleeping  
Hopelessly thinking of you  
Here in my heart I have to admit it's true  
There's nothing I can do  
I'm still getting over you
