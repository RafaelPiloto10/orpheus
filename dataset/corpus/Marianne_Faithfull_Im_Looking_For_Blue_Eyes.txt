What's happened to blue eyes,  
Has anyone seen him ?  
Don't anyone tell me  
That he gave up on me.  
I'm looking for blue eyes  
I gotta find him,  
I gotta know if,  
If he's been looking for me.  
There was a time blue eyes said he'd love no other,  
His one and only love, he swore at me.  
There was a time when his blue eyes were clearer than mine did  
It isn't right, he isn't to blame, he didn't mean it this way.

I don't know if,
