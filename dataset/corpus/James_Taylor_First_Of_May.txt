And the light between us  
Which we could not quite extinguish,  
Which we see at dawn burns on.  
  
First day of May, things are beginning,  
Our side is winning, hip hip hooray.  
Made in the shade, deep in the shadow,  
Down by the meadow, lie in my arms.  
  
And the moon will rise  
Before our very eyes,  
We will rise too,  
I'll be with you.  
It's a right of spring,  
A horizontal thing,  
The sweetest sort  
Of dance hidden  
In among the plants.  
  
Ha ha ha ha, people are laughing,  
Children are singing, come join the dance.  
  
And the walls around us  
Which we kept at such a cost  
When we turned around came tumbling down.  
  
Ha ha ha ha, she can't stop laughing,  
He can't stop singing, first day of May.
