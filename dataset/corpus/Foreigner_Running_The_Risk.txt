Seeing you, watching you  
Watching me  
I hold back my emotions  
I keep them veiled in secrecy  
I can't let go of this thing we've started  
Wasn't looking for love  
No conspiracy of the broken hearted  
I don't know how far to go  
Until I'm gone, gone, gone  
  
I couldn't see the danger  
It was just a little taste of temptation  
I could not read the silence  
That was written on your face  
But here comes that feeling again  
  
And there's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
There's nothing more I can say  
I'm still running the risk of you walking away  
  
I'm lost drowning in a sea of emotion  
I've got one simple need  
I need you to feel my devotion  
I don't know how far to go  
Until I'm gone, yeah gone  
  
It's a complicated picture  
I'm all tangled up in temptation  
I couldn't read the silence  
That was written on your face  
But here comes that feeling again  
  
And there's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
There's nothing more I can say  
I'm still running the risk of you walking away  
  
I'm running the risk of losing you  
I'm walking this tightrope  
You're my only hope  
There's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Losing you  
  
And there's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
There's nothing more I can say  
I'm still running the risk of you walking away  
  
I'm running the risk of losing you  
I'm walking this tightrope  
Darling, you're my only hope  
There's nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
I'm running the risk of losing you  
  
I'm telling you honey  
This heart of mine can't run the risk  
Of losing you again  
Everything have made you do  
I'm still running the risk of losing you
