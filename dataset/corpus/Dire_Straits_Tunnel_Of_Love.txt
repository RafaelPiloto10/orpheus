Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose  
Sing about the six blade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo  
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam  
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this  
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rock away rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And I'm just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades  
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids  
Girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids
