Like the sun, like the light, like the flame  
Like the storm I burn through everything  
Like a bomb in the night, like a train  
Thunder rings through the hills, let it rain  
  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Wanna be like us tonight  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Ride the magic bus tonight  
  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
Like a mon with no light of my own  
Surf's the sky for a place to call home  
I woke up with my head in the fire  
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire  
  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Wanna be like us tonight  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Ride the magic bus tonight  
  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
Praise the lord and I like it that way  
  
Hail Mary, full of grace  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross  
Died for our sins, it's such a loss  
Saint Christopher, find my way  
I'll be coming home one day  
Saint Sebastian, don't you cry  
Let those poison arrows fly  
  
Saint Anthony, lost and found  
Thomas a cryin', just stand your ground  
All those saints and holy men  
Catch me before I sin again  
  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
You're a sinner, you're a sinner  
You're a sinner, you like it that way  
We're all sinners, we're all sinners  
We're all sinners  
  
I'm a sinner  
I'm a sinner  
I'm a sinner  
And I like it that way  
  
Hail Mary, full of grace (the lord is with me)  
Hail Mary, full of grace (your love is with me)  
Full of grace
