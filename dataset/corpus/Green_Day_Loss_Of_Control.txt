I'm taking down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless  
A bunch of shit talking drama queens and they're all filled with excuses  
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion  
I'd rather go to a funeral than to this high school reunion  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But now you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime  
But you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time 'cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control  
  
Hanging out all by myself, at least I make good company  
Hey, isn't that a whatshisface that I see walking down the street  
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say  
We never had anything in common and I never liked you anyway  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But when you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch  
And you're a stupid mother fucker serve your shit to the pigs cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But now you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime  
But you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time 'cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
We're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control
