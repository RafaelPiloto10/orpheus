I've played your game  
And I've played it well.  
I'll be another fool  
To hang upon your wall.  
I laid my heart out  
Like an open book.  
It's a simple thing and don't take much  
To crack it open and bleed.  
  
Lay me down.  
Lay me down when you're through with me.  
Lay me down.  
Let me bleed when you're through with me.  
Don't let me think you're wrong,  
Just let me fall down.  
I'll pick myself up again.  
It's the kindest thing you can do for me,  
So, woman, won't you lay me down.  
  
I lied to myself.  
Tried to believe in you.  
But it's hard to rely on the ghost of someone you hardly even knew  
You bring things out  
Just to bring me down.  
Then you twist them about and shove 'em in my face  
Til my eyes can't see any good.  
Yeah!
