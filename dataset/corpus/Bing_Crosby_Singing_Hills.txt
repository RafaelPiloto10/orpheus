The singing hills (mmmmm)  
Are singing tonight (mmmmm)  
  
And echoing a song of long ago  
The singing hills (mmmmm)  
  
Were singing that night (mmmmm)  
That lovely night you said, "I love you so"  
The wind in the valley joined in our sweet refrain  
But now the wind and I  
Each night we cry "Come back again."  
  
Though you are gone (mmmmm)  
The song lingers on (mmmmm)  
  
Still echoing among the singing hills
