Sittin' dark getting taken 'cause I said  
Something lewd in a low down accent  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Kinda love those eyes  
I wanna get down honey  
But I ain't your guy  
  
I'll rap 'n' ruck 'n' jam it up  
But count me out  
Cause all I ever wanna get is slang  
  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is slang  
  
What's affectin' my condition  
What's about to knock you down  
Said wrapped 'n' bound and a goddamn  
I'd love to get connected but it's outta my hand  
  
I'll rap 'n' ruck 'n' jam it up  
But count me out  
Cause all I ever wanna get is slang  
  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is slang  
  
It's my intention to be your obsession  
(Mi pasion, mi obsesion, queria que eastuvieras conmigo)  
It's my obsession to be your addiction  
  
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro  
  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is slang
