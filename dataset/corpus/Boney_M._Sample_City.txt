Computer on the move  
Gonna' make your body groove  
Gonna' hold you tight and lift you to the top  
If your feeling kind of low  
Press the trigger in you go  
And you better never want to' make it stop  
Sample city  
Sounds so pretty  
If they bit is feeding human touch  
Sample city  
More than pretty  
Apparently it turns you too whatever it does so much  
Your feeling like a clown  
If you enter sample town  
All the finest songs are hidden in a chip  
With the funny noise around  
Is it music is it sound  
So you travel on a psychedelic trip  
(repeat the middle verus twice)
