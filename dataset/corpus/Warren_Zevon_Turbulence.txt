Well, you can talk about your Perestroika  
And that's all right for you  
But, Comrade Shevardnadze, tell me  
What's a poor boy like me to do?

Well, we've been fightin' with the Mujahedeen  
Down in Afghanistan  
Comrade Gorbachev, can I  
Go back to Vladivostok, man?  
  
Turmoil back in Moscow brought this turbulence down on me  
Turmoil back in Moscow brought this turbulence down on me  
  
Lost city on the red desert  
I hear voices of enemies from everywhere  
I miss my mother very much  
"Village is lost in the red desert  
On all sides, silence of an enemy  
And we want to see our mothers."
