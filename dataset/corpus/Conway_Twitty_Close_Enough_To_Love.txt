Your eyes reflect the sadness  
Inside your broken heart  
You're afraid to love again so openly  
I'd gladly spend my lifetime  
Repairing every part  
Oh, that's close enough to love for me.  
  
And if you're hung up on the memory  
Of some other man  
When you close your eyes, if it's still him you see  
If I can't have you completely  
I'll cherish what I can  
Oh, that's close enough to love for me.  
  
Pickin' up the pieces  
Is hard to do alone  
And now your mind is set on stayin' free  
I just want to hold you  
Until the hurt is gone  
Oh, that's close enough to love for me.  
  
I just want to hold you  
Until the hurt is gone  
Oh, that's close enough to love for me...
