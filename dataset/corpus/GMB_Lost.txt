Waking up in the stillness I can  
Hear You calling, feel You cover me  
Breaking down my soul  
I've already been there, I've already been there  
Falling down on my knees, I cry out  
Won't You find me? Won't You cover me?  
Tearing up my soul  
I've already been there, I've already been there  
  
I've lost my self  
I'm falling inside You, I'm falling into  
I need Your grace  
I'm crashing before You, I'm falling into... You  
  
Stepping down from my throne of pride down  
Desperate for You, desperate for Your touch  
Drying up my soul  
I've already been there, I've already been there
