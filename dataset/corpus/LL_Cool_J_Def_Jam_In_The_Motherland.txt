Yeah, yeah, checkin' 'em out  
Special shout-out, keepin' on  
Check it out y'all, my man in the house  
  
Corkunrun absolute killer of all  
Take her blood, bouncin' heads like balls  
Murderer, somethin' mutilator of Amiga  
I get ill, so blood spills, every time I speak  
Drivin' Bombs that inveterate your ego  
Suckers all weird, no let the best go migo  
They talk and talk, I invade and take over  
Forget Mako, you gonna need a make-over  
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal  
On the mic, I'm a cannibal  
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms  
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm  
I'm two with the Universe and I'ma make you  
Diverse, make I kill quick, so you'll win from crew to hers  
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened  
I went to the Motherland, so now I'm enlightened  
There's a  
  
[Chorus]  
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland  
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland  
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland  
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland  
  
For bow-take to far cynical of Egypt  
Cool J I'm slay and I'm fully equipped  
To decapatate, amputate and take titles  
The legend of leather, I'ma real live idol  
Damn I take souls, condemn we men  
And make microphones men again and again  
Cause, I'm blood thirsty watch and try to curse me  
You'll lose the battle even if you out re-hearsed me  
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole  
When I'm strollin' with my neck on a goal  
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out  
Only difference, no time to feel a track out  
It's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come forward, admit you're guilty  
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me  
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L  
Now know that I handle mine, very well  
I burn buildings, eat emcee's  
Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please  
They try to jam hard, but I'ma fan God  
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd  
King Posse ruler and high roller  
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder  
It's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a Monar, the Warlord of life  
The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight  
Somethin' like Murley, but it goes much deeper  
Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper  
One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled  
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample  
My vocabulary's legendary, my rumpy your temporary  
So what your name in the bituary  
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings  
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things  
I rock the clearest, one hell of a learer  
Since I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist  
When I put a potion together it's splendid and fatal  
You can never make a move on me cause you're still premado  
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis  
And when I'm through you face baralysis  
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner  
I'm down to skinner beginner to be a winner  
It's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who gets the roughest, you know the answer  
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther  
When I pick up the mic, as my fist see mo'  
King of Rackadochio, I'm magnifigo  
When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad  
Cause I know it's makes the face-sucker-ducks mad  
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards  
Introducin' the original Todd  
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound  
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throw down  
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy  
Hold steady, get ready, your petti confetti  
Techniques and styles, they ain't ready  
Ah, ah, yeah, full of horsepower and I'ma devour  
Stay clean when I scream you're soft las cauliflower  
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse  
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee 'roundhouse  
No threat exist, no man can stand  
Say mic check and expect to take the man  
  
[Chorus]
