My momma says that I must leave him alone.  
But how can I do that  
When I want him in my home?  
He watched me change from boys to boys  
And now I am his size.  
So how can I forget him now  
When I long to share his life?  
Mommy, mommy, he loves your daughter.  
No jestering!  
No one can make me leave him.  
No jestering!  
So you cn tell me anything you want.  
I'll never let him out of my sight.  
Tell me how much he's not my type,  
But someday I'm gonna be his wife.  
Mommy, mommy, he loves your daughter.  
No, no jestering!  
No one can make me leave him.  
It's no . . .  
La la la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
You mustn't let the horse run away  
Before you're gonna close the door.  
And all my life I watched him grow.  
Each day I love him more and more.  
Oh, mommy, mommy, he loves your daughter.  
No, no jestering!  
No one can make me leave him.  
It's no . . .  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la.  
So tell me anything you want.  
I'll never let him out of my sight.  
Tell me how much I'm not his type.  
One day I'm gonna be his wife.  
Oh, mommy, mommy, he loves your daughter.  
No, no jestering!  
No one can make me leave him.  
It's no . . .  
Mommy he loves me.  
Mommy release me.  
He don't want to hurt me.  
He just wants to please me.  
Mommy forgive me.  
Don't you worry.  
My heart is on fire and I'm in a hurry.  
La la la la la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la la.  
La la la la la la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la la la.  
La la la la la la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la la la.  
La la la la la la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la la la.  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la la la.
