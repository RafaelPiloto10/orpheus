There used to be a time  
I wore my heart upon my sleeve.  
There used to be a time  
I'd show my gentle side to anyone  
Through these years of wandering  
I know I've been deceived.  
Through these years of wandering  
  
And every time you try to hurt me  
You know you'll only hurt yourself.  
And every time you try to hurt me  
I know you'll be the one to suffer  
When you think you're hurting someone.  
  
A little of you, a little of me,  
A little of you,  
Is hurting someone  
  
Don't tell me I'm the only one  
'Cause I don't need that space.  
Don't ask for love  
I'll throw it back in your face.  
All of these promises  
Were only made to break.  
All of these promises
