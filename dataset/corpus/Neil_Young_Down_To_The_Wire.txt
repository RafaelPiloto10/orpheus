Every time you touch her  
Sets your hands on fire,  
And everything you've got  
Is all that she requires.  
And you hang on, hang on, hang on  
To the words of a liar.  
You can feel it getting  
Down to the wire.  
All the hurt you thought was gone  
Has now returned,  
And every thing she's laughing at  
Is all you learned.  
And you let go, let go, let go,  
'cause you know you're getting tired.  
Can you feel it getting  
Down to the wire?  
Take the time to close your  
Eyes and look around,  
'Cause anyone who helped you out  
Can let you down.  
And look out, look out, look out,  
The voice is now the choir.  
Can you feel it getting  
Down to the wire?
