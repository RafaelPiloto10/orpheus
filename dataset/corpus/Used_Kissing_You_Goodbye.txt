Cut yourself in conversation, cut the line to make me feel alive  
Cause you know I'm not alive  
An leave me with your complications, take your life you feel like taking mine  
Leaving god we stand in line, not alone  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving, not going  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
Trust to take the right to leave me  
Waiting on the dark clouds for the rain  
Praying lightning strikes the change  
As history gets lost an as I took that final breath I felt alive  
Leading god to stand in line  
All alone  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving, not going  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
Don't let me go, don't say goodbye  
Cause know that I'm not alive  
Don't let me go, don't say goodbye  
Don't let this love die  
Don't let me go, don't say goodbye  
Cause know that I'm not alive  
Don't let me go, don't say goodbye  
Don't let this love die  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving, not going  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
I'm not kissing you goodbye
