Well I tried everything  
Just to get along with you  
And I'm gonna tell you just  
What I'm gonna do  
  
Well I'm sick of all your cryin'  
When you should be leavin' me alone  
If you don't believe me  
You pack me bags, I'm gone  
  
Won't cha please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
You almost lost your love girl  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
And you best believe I love ya baby  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Round and round
