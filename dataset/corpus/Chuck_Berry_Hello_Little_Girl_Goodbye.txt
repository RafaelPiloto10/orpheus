Hello, little girl, I got a little talk for you  
About something you led me to believe you'd do  
But I know now you had no intentions to  
It has come to me that we been together too long  
I been holding out, I believe I'll be gone  
'Cause I don't have to hang around while you do me wrong  
Your heart's full of rock and you reel like a rolling stone  
You don't really need me, you'd do better on your own  
So go find somebody else and leave me alone  
I'm leaving you now although I love you still  
I loved you then and I guess I always will  
So, goodbye, little girl, I'm gone this time for real  
Your heart's full of rock and you reel like a rolling stone  
You don't really need me, you'd do better on your own  
So go find somebody else and leave me alone  
Honey, I'm leaving you although I love you still  
You I loved you then and I guess I always will  
So, goodbye, little girl, I'm gone this time for real  
Bye. bye, little girl, bye, bye, little girl  
Bye. bye, little girl, bye, bye, little girl  
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, little girl
