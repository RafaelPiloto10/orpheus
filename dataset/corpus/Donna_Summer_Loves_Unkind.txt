Well I seem him every morning in the schoolyard  
When the school bell rings  
And when he passes in the hallway  
Well he doesn't seem to notice me  
  
He's got a crush on my best friend  
But she don't care, 'cause she loves someone else  
I'm standing on the outside, no the inside where I wanna be  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'Cause he's not mine  
  
Just the other day I was praying that he'd give me a chance  
Hoping he would choose me for his partner  
For the high school dance  
I was standing outside the class  
  
But it wasn't me, but my best friend, he asked  
I went running back inside teary-eyed  
And left the two of them behind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'cause he's not mine  
  
Oh, how I love him, but I can't even let him know  
'cause he loves my best friend  
But she don't care, she loves someone else  
And I asked my mama, and she said: love's unkind  
  
Love's so unkind  
She said: just keep it alive  
'Cause you may find love's unkind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
  
Oh, Why did I have to love him so  
Why did I have to love him so
