All you want to do is sit around and pout  
And now I got enough and so I'm getting out  
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now  
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow  
I been in the doghouse so doggone long  
That when I get a kiss I think that something's wrong  
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now  
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow  
I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right  
You go get yourself a man that wants to fight  
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now  
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow  
You start your jaws a-wagging and it never stops  
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top  
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now  
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow  
I remember back when you were nice and sweet  
Things have changed, you'd rather fight than eat  
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now  
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow  
I'm a-gonna do some riding on the midnight train  
I'm taking everything except my ball and chain  
I'm leaving now, I'm leaving now  
I'm a long gone daddy, I don't need you anyhow
