Is everybody happy now?  
Is everybody clear?  
We could drive out to the dunes tonight,  
'cause summer's almost here.  
And I've been up all night,  
I might sleep all day.  
Get your dreams just right  
Let them slip away,  
I might sleep all day.  
When the roads are clear,  
We'll head on out of here,  
If you're coming back,  
I'll see you in the morning  
I'm just staring at  
The ceiling staring back at me,  
Just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me...  
And I've been up all night,  
I might sleep all day.  
Get your dreams just right  
And let them slip away,  
I might sleep all day.  
Ohhh... It's too late to get high now.  
2X  
Fix your hair just right  
Put your jeans on tight,  
Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy.  
'Cause I've been thinking I'd  
Like to see your eyes  
Open up real wide the minute that you see me.  
If you don't come through,  
I wouldn't wait for you.  
I understand that everyone goes disappearing,  
Into the greatest grey  
That covers over everyday,  
And hovers in the distance and the distance and the distance...  
I've been up all night,  
I might sleep all day.  
Get your dreams just right  
Let them slip away,  
I might sleep all day.  
Ohh... It's too late to get high now.  
2X  
Baby I'm not alone  
Only wanna get high
