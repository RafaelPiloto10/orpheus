When you say those words, those three little words  
You're in at the deep end  
Give up the night times, give up the high times  
Give up the weekend  
Give up the chance to be your own man  
Let the feeling take over  
The only way out is to lie if you can  
But you don't have the knack  
And you'll go crawling back, saying  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to say what I said when I said I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to say what I said it was only a game  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to tell you in so many words, I didn't mean it  
I felt tied down, my pride down  
That I put that lie down  
The prize now for you is me  
Well I was like you and all I could do was  
Give up and surrender  
The people can trace what they did in my face  
But they're just pretenders  
They told me mercenary action today  
Is a line as simple and pure  
But what if you found you made a mistake  
The medicine's worse than the cure  
And you'll be back for sure, saying  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to say what I said when I said I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to say what I said it was only a game  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to tell you in so many words, I didn't mean it  
I felt tied down, my pride down  
That I put that lie down  
The prize now for you is me  
Give up the chance to be your own man  
Let the feeling take over  
The only way out is to lie if you can  
But you don't have the knack  
And you'll go crawling back, saying  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to say what I said when I said I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to say what I said it was only a game  
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it  
I didn't mean to tell you in so many words, I didn't mean it  
I felt tied down, my pride down  
That I put that lie down  
The prize now for you is me
