Stranded in this town  
My machine slows down  
To take me where the night begins  
I'm playing everywhere  
Loving here and there  
I always take the chance to win  
Drove a million miles  
Gambling rules my life  
I only stop to start again  
  
I reach out through the air  
Good luck is everywhere  
Can almost touch it with my hands  
  
Just a little luck tonight  
Will do and dreams come true  
Just a little luck tonight  
I can't stop the wheel  
That turns the ball of steel  
  
When passion rules the game  
I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames  
  
I'm a stranger in this town  
Life takes me up and down  
I'll break the score until I'm free  
Can't stop to roll the dice  
And in the morning light  
A girl like you is all I need  
  
Don't you need some love tonight  
I do, yes I do  
Don't you need some love tonight  
How can we stand the heat  
When love is all we need  
  
When passion rules the game  
I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames
