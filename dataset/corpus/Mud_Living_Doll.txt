got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, living doll.  
gotta do my best to please her just 'cos she's a living doll.  
i gotta roving eye and that is why she satisfies my soul  
got my one and only walking, talking, living doll.  
  
take look at her hair, it's real  
you don't believe what i say just feel.  
gonna lock her up in a trunk,  
so no big hunk can steal her away from me.
