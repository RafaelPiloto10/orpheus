(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
I've been around in Donkey Town  
Too long baby too long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long, so long, so long  
  
Her pretty eyes are pretty still  
But Jim's got a kind of a squint Yeah  
I dug up my last check from out of the mine  
Now I feel like I've done my stint  
Jim got an army pension  
When he walked from the military court  
No body ever mentioned  
The medical report  
  
She does little things for me  
She likes to get the both of us high. Yeah  
She says I'm a tender-hearted man  
Prince charming, yeah, sure, I'm the guy  
He likes the wrecker's dogs on chains  
And the smoke from the company fires  
Diesel oil in the trucks and cranes  
And the smell of burning tires  
  
But I've been around in Donkey Town  
Too long, baby, too long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long, so long, so long  
  
There's a purple heart in a silver tin  
And a grey. 45 in a drawer  
Most of the time you can drink with him  
But some other time he's just sore  
On days when she says she can't think straight  
Or she feels like she's getting the jumps  
She'll go shoot off her. 38  
At cans on a Donkey Town dump  
  
It was Friday late and she crossed those legs  
She told me flat out she would. Yeah  
If I could pull up my trailer pegs  
We could get away together for good  
I sure wish her the best of luck  
She's going to need it thinking of Jim  
I don't like to leave her stuck  
But she's near as bad as him  
  
But I've been around in Donkey Town  
Too long baby too long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long, so long, so long  
Checking out of Donkey Town  
So long, so long, so long
