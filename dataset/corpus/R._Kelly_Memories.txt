Girl love check 12 12  
I am talking about me and you  
Chorus  
  
Memories in my head all about you  
So baby please come back to me  
Shawty you my world and I miss you  
So baby please come back to me  
This was then this is now  
You never heard again no and that's my vibe  
No more hanging in the street  
No more late night creeps  
No more no more  
  
  
I know I hurt you  
I never meant to know  
You know I love you so  
So hard to let you go  
Since you close the door  
I can't breathe no more  
If you don't come back home  
Then girl I am dead for sure  
  
  
Chorus  
  
Memories in my head all about you  
So baby please come back to me  
Shawty you my world and I miss you  
So baby please come back to me  
This was then this is now  
You never heard again no and that's my vibe  
No more hanging in the street  
No more late night creeps  
No more no more  
  
Always up in the club flossin and drinkin  
Running in the block every night with my crew  
Girl I don't know what the hell I was thinking  
Now I realize that I was hurting you  
Whining in the club I was whining in the club  
Whining in the club with her  
Oh I was whining in the club  
I was whining in the club  
Oh whining in the club with her  
Until you busted me  
I know I hurt you  
I never meant to know  
You know I love you so  
So hard to let you go  
Since you close the door  
I can't breathe no more  
If you don't come back home  
Then girl I am dead for sure  
  
  
Chorus  
  
Memories in my head all about you  
So baby please come back to me  
Shawty you my world and I miss you  
So baby please come back to me  
This was then this is now  
You never heard again no and that's my vibe  
No more hanging in the street  
No more late night creeps  
No more no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Memories in my head all about you  
So baby please come back to me  
Shawty you my world and I miss you  
So baby please come back to me  
This was then this is now  
You never heard again no and that's my vibe  
No more hanging in the street  
No more late night creeps  
No more no more  
Memories in my head all about you  
So baby please come back to me
