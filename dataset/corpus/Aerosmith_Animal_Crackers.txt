Don't wanna close my eyes  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't wanna miss a thing  
Know what I was thinkin'  
(What?)  
I, I really don't think that the animal cracker  
Qualifies as a cracker  
(Why?)  
Well, 'cause it's sweet which is an in suggest cookie  
And when you put a cheese on something  
It's sorta the finer characteristic  
Of what makes a cracker  
Why I thought of that, I just  
(Baby, you have such sweet fill-up talk)  
Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing  
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains  
Now look, as the cheetah approaches  
Watch as he stalks his prey  
Now the gazelle is a little spooked  
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south  
The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question  
North or south way down tune in next week  
(Baby, do you think it's possible)  
That anyone else in this world  
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?  
I hope so  
Otherwise what the hell are we trying to save?  
Don't wanna close my eyes  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't wanna miss a thing
