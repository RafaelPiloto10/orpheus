If you're gonna make an omelet  
You gotta break an egg  
You want to be in showbiz  
Then you gotta break a leg  
  
Babe you're heading on a journey  
I hate to see you make  
Cause the only food they sell there  
Is called Disaster Cake  
  
You won't plan it or deserve it  
When life sneaks behind your back  
It'll grab you by the short hairs  
And gently tie you to the rack  
  
If you think you can outrun it  
That'll be your first mistake  
'Cause the recipe you're making  
Is for Disaster Cake  
  
Read my lips  
Babe the crack that you hear is thunder  
You don't know, but you're going under  
Read my lips  
Babe the flash that you see is lightinin'  
I have been up ahead, it's frightenin'  
Yeah you're young and you're cool  
Here to break evey rule - you're a fool  
  
Now you won't listen or believe me  
When I tell you what's a head  
I'm a dinosaur in your mind  
I've never even seen "The Dead"  
  
But child read my lips and tremble  
'Cause your world is about to break  
And the crumbs they're selling after  
Are from Disaster Cake  
  
Read my lips  
Girl you're heading for a disaster  
You run fast, you need to run faster  
Read my lips  
'Cause you're an accident waiting to happen  
This is death bitch, it ain't just nappin'  
Yeah you're young and you're cool  
But hell's full of young fool's  
Rest in peace  
  
Yeah I know you're tired of listenin'  
And you wish I'd just go away  
If I do you'll be alone here  
And then you'll beg my ass to stay  
  
Babe, life's a paradox for certain  
Like trying to fuck through an earthquake  
Simpler task than eating  
An ent
