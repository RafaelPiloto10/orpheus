Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone  
Motherless children have a very hard time  
All the weepin', all that cryin'  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone  
  
People say a sister will do  
When the mother is gone  
People say a sister will do  
When the mother is gone  
People say a sister will do  
She'll get married, turn her back on you  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone  
  
Father do the best he can  
When the mother is gone  
Father do the best he can  
When the mother is gone  
Father do the best he can  
But there's so many things he just don't understand  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone  
  
I was lookin' for some place to plead my case  
And I'm standing here all alone  
I was framed, the times they have change  
And I don't know where I'm goin'  
Motherless children have a hard time  
All that weepin', all that cryin'  
Motherless children have a hard time  
When their mother is gone
