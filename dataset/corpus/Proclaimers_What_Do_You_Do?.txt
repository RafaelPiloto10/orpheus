Yes I know you're right  
I see it in your fierce eyes  
But me I've never thought straight  
Since the day I had the first doubt  
  
Yes I know you're right  
And I'll back you to a point pal  
But I'll never be constrained  
By another man's ideas now  
  
I spent too long on this road  
Looking for the answers  
But Poverty and Failure  
Aren't what I'm after  
  
I painted "Fight" on factories  
But they closed the factory down pal  
I want to find out where the Heart's gone  
Find out where the nerves gone  
  
What do you do  
When democracy fails you  
What do you do  
When the rest can't see its true?  
  
Pat votes the Scots way  
Just like her mother  
But South always takes all  
Just like her brother  
  
The next time she might vote  
So might the others  
But times running out pal  
Cause they're giving up in numbers  
  
What do you do  
When Democracy's all through  
What do you do  
When minority means you?
