(feat. Paul Smith)  
  
You know that I would love to see you next year  
I hope that I am still alive next year  
You magnify the way I think about myself  
Before you came I rarely thought about myself  
  
Behind your veil I found a body underneath  
Inside your head were things I never thought about  
You know that I would love to see you next year  
I hope that I am still alive next year  
  
What's my view?  
Well how am I supposed to know  
Write a review  
Well how objective can I be  
[X2]  
  
You know that I would love to see you in that dress  
I hope that I will live to see you undressed  
The every day is part of what consumes me  
The hate I feel is part of what fuels me  
  
I testify to having guilty feelings  
I must confess I'd like to be caught stealing  
You know that I would love to see you in that dress  
I hope that I will live to see you undressed  
  
What's my view?  
Well how am I supposed to know?  
Write a review  
Well how objective can I be?

I like to wait to see how things turn out  
If you apply some pressure  
[X2]  
  
What happens when you lose everything  
You just start again  
You start all over again  
[X2]  
  
I like to wait to see how things turn out  
If you apply some pressure  
[X2]  
  
What happens when you lose everything  
You just start again  
You start all over again  
[X3]  
  
What happens when you lose some pressure  
Apply some pressure you lose some pressure  
Apply some pressure you lose some pressure  
Apply some pressure you lose some pressure  
[X2]  
  
You know that I would love to see you next year  
I hope that I am still alive next year  
You know that I would love to see you in that dress  
I hope that I will live to see you undressed
