Reflecting back on the life that I once knew  
I'm pretty sure I could have changed a thing or two  
In our restless youth, we were wild and running fast  
And everyone I knew said, "Boy, you'll never last"  
I saw an ad for a player in a band  
I took a train, guitar case in my hand  
Like a dream, sweet music in my ears  
Had a little luck on the course we were to steer  
Never found another reason  
You gave me something to believe in  
You came and you saved me  
Yes, I got what I need in  
Faith, hope and love  
Faith, hope and love  
I settled down with my family, that is true  
I kept my faith in the music to guide me through  
And life can change if you really want it to  
And you can change, too, just believe in what you do  
Never found another reason  
You gave me something to believe in  
You came and you saved me  
Yes, I got what I need in  
Faith, hope and love  
Faith, hope and love
