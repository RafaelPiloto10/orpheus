Verse  
Fall out of bed and catch a fading star  
Fancy I woke up before my alarm  
Brought my mind through my eyes  
It's the best I can do  
Before it's automatic, hand it over, turn it to you  
Though her smile when it happens, almost as if it was magic  
It means there's a god somewhere and he's laughing  
And I shuffle my slipperless toes to the kitchen  
Still low to the ground, but high on living  
Chorus  
And I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Verse  
Waking up and stretch my body  
And acknowledge the makes  
It must be something I did yesterday  
Pour a cup of liquid gold  
'Cause my engine's still cold  
And in a minute everything's gonna change  
Chorus  
'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Yes I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing

Verse  
Looking out from a... [?] watching the band of the  
Earth take the plaque of the night from the dirt  
I can see from the depths of my readjustinize of reflection  
Of yes's and that ever changing sky  
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake?  
I don't need no scenes of valid paying replayed (??)  
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray  
But my thoughts are all I've got so I try to make them brave  
Chorus  
'Cause I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
I say, hello, hello, you beautiful thing  
Oh now this is what I've been waiting for  
(this is what I've been waiting for)  
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)  
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (this is what I've been waiting for)  
Oh this is what I've been waiting for (Hello)  
I know, I know, it's gonna be a good day  
Hello, hello, you beautiful thing...
