Ha Ha Ha  
Ho Ho Ho  
Now you see it  
Now you don't  
Has no bones  
To hurt your throat  
Good and sweet  
Nice to eat  
If you like it  
Just repeat  
  
I'll set myself on fire  
I'll set myself on fire  
I'll set myself on fire  
Oh strike my hand  
On a stone Joan  
God knows this is yuk  
Do it all in unison  
Ha ha ha  
Ho ho ho  
  
We have the pool  
Ah - no that's cruel  
Why do you take me for  
A fool?  
Try the rails  
It's just not me  
No no no  
No - Siree
