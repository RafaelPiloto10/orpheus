Baby, don't you cry  
Baby, I'll sing you a lullaby  
  
We're walking down the  
Street of chance  
Where the chance is always  
Slim or none  
And the intentions unjust  
  
Baby there's nothing to see  
I've already been  
Down the street of chance  
  
Baby you're so clean  
Baby please stay clean  
Baby you're so young  
Baby please stay young  
Baby, don't you cry  
Baby, we've already cried  
We want some we want some  
All aboard for fun time  
Fun  
Baby baby we like your lips  
Fun  
Baby baby we like your pants  
All aboard for fun time
