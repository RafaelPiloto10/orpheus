A little girl trapped in her knowledge and craft  
Came tripping to my room last night  
I cooked her a steak and I tried not to fake  
And still make everything alright  
She had dreads in her hair and problems and cares  
She tried hard not to let 'em show  
She was decent and sweet and I was sizin' up the meat  
But doubts fell in my mind like snow  
And when the shove comes down to love  
The facade falls down  
And when the bricks fall from the tricks  
The facade falls down  
  
It's a sunny afternoon and I'm sitting in my robe  
I'm dirty and I'm here alone  
There's a story on my table that talks about me  
And I want to stuff it down the author's throat  
And I'm sleeping with someone new every night  
And in the morning politely saying "bye"  
  
And I'm nowhere and no one  
And I only wanna run  
And I feel like a hamburger bun  
And when you must  
Believe or bust  
The facade falls down  
When you're scared of a brand new care  
The facade falls down  
I got no reason to believe  
I got no reason but I'm New York Scumbag Tough  
And I'll keep on truckin'  
  
So night is falling  
And I'm getting' tired  
And it's time to get my slippers and books  
Got a sweater and glasses  
And something that passes  
For a way to get by in this world  
And I'm getting' tired  
Of so many different things  
I guess I'm just plain tired  
Or maybe too intelligent to believe  
In the obvious side of things  
And when voice says make a choice  
The facade falls down  
When your knees start to concede  
The facade falls down  
When the shove comes down to love  
The facade falls down  
And when the bricks fall from the tricks  
The facade falls down  
  
The facade falls down [Repeat: x5]
