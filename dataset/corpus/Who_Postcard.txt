[Chorus:]  
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here  
We're having a lovely time, wish you were here  
There's miles of frankfurters and people who hurt us in Germany  
We haven't played since yesterday  
There's just ten more shows and one week to go  
We'd all like to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Great piles of spaghetti, bad vibes like confetti in Italy  
We go by train and not by plane  
We'd come home by car if it wasn't too far  
To drive home by car  
Hope you're well at home,  
Next week I'll try to phone,  
Not very long to go,  
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's lots of French fries, disapproving eyes in the U.S.A.  
We've had no shows since I don't know  
There's just one thing wrong, we've been here too long  
The money's all gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's kangaroos and we're bad news in Australia  
Thrown off the plane for drinking beer  
So long on the plane it drove us insane  
So long on the plane  
Hope you're well at home,  
Next week I'll try to phone  
Not very long to go  
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've done very well, but we've been to hell and heaven as well
