I'm gonna wear you down  
I'm gonna make you see  
I'm gonna get to you  
You're gonna  
Give in to me  
  
I'm gonna start a fire  
You're gonna feel the heat  
I'm gonna burn for you  
You're gonna melt for me  
  
Come on, Come on in to my arms  
Come on, Come on  
Give in to me  
  
You're gonna take my hand  
Whisper the sweetest words  
And if you're ever sad  
I'll make you laugh  
I'll chase the hurt  
  
My heart is set on you  
I don't want no one else  
And if you don't want me  
I guess I'll be all by myself  
  
Come on, Come on, into my arms  
Come on, Come on  
Give in to me  
  
I'll use my eyes to draw you in  
Until I'm under your skin  
I'll use my lips  
I"ll use my arms  
Come on, Come on  
Give in to me  
  
Give in to me
