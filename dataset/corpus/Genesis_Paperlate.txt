Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
  
Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but there is no one on the line  
Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news  
  
Oh it's too easy to live like clockwork  
Tick tock watching the world go by  
Any change would take too long  
So dry your eyes  
Ooh it's too easy to live in a cold sweat  
Just sitting dripping in pools below  
You can wipe your face  
Kill the pain  
But the fever won't go, no no  
  
Paperlate  
Pull it together now  
Put your feet back on the ground  
Paperlate  
Ooh don't worry now  
You're not alone  
Look around you  
Paperlate  
Ooh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line  
Paperlate  
Ooh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news  
  
Oh it's too easy to compute your future  
Taking no risks and playing too safe  
Any change would take too long  
So dry your eyes  
Ooh it's too easy to talk about rocking the boat  
Making changes and changing track  
But you'd better not lock that door  
'Cause you'll be coming back  
  
Ah you're breathing faster  
Silence the only sound  
There's no need to be nice on the way up  
'Cause you're not coming down  
  
Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
  
Paperlate  
Ooh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line  
Paperlate  
Oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news
