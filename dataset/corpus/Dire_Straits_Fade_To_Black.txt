I wonder where your are tonight  
You're probably out on the rampage somewhere  
You have been known to take delight  
In getting in somebody's hair  
And you always had the knack  
Fade to black  
  
I bet you already made a pass  
I see a darkened room somewhere  
You run your fingers around the rim of his glasses  
You run your fingers through his hair  
They scratch across his back  
  
Well maybe its all 4 the best  
But I wish id never been lassoed  
Maybe it some kind of test  
But I wish id never been tattooed  
Or been to hell and back  
Fade to black
