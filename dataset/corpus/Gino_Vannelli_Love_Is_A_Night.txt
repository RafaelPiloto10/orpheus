Hangin' out in new orleans  
Diggin' on the bourbon scenes  
Just feelin' the vibes of the oncoming days  
There ain't no texan chaparral  
To hide away all those southern belles  
Just thinking about that georgian gal conjures a crazw  
  
Love is a night  
Who really cares if it's wrong or it's right  
And all that I care  
You've been some life and love I could share  
  
Got a thing in tennessee  
She ain't about to marry me  
There's never been a time she says yes and means no  
I had a case in carolin'  
From makin' love on rose wine  
It's strange how they come and they go  
  
Love is a night  
Who really cares if it's wrong or it's right  
And all that I know  
You've been some life and love on the road  
  
Love is a night  
I only know the moment is right  
As for the ladies I've known  
They mean so much when you're all alone
