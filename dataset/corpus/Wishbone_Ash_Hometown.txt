I have traveled the line,  
Held many hands on short holidays,  
Made a lot of noise  
In the strangest places far away.  
Only for a day or two at a time,  
I've been moving with the wind  
On my side,  
That puts me free and easy in my hometown.  
  
I said I'd stay alive  
I guess I didn't tell a lie.  
I told you I'd come back again  
And I'll say the same again next time.  
  
I've been living for a day at a time  
Movin' with the wind on my side.  
  
You don't know how good it feels  
I know I'll never want to go away.  
You don't know how good it feels  
To be with you again  
I know I'm comin' home to stay.  
  
I'm sayin', it's nice to be back home  
Among my friends.  
It means a lot to me  
And your love  
It never ends.
