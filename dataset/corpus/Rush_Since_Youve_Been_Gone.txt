I get the same old dreams same time every night  
Fall to the ground then I wake up  
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head  
Thoughts fly back to the breakup  
These four walls are closing in  
Look what a fix you put me in  
  
Since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone  
I'm out of my head, can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you've been gone  
You've got the spell so break it  
Oooh oooh oooh  
Since you've been gone  
  
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light  
I read the words that you sent to me  
I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around too soon  
You don't know what you mean to me  
Your poison letter, your telegram  
Just goes to show you don't give a damn  
  
Since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone  
I'm out of my head, can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you've been gone  
You've got the spell so break it  
Oooh oooh oooh  
Since you've been gone  
  
Everywhere you go baby you know you're never too far  
  
Since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone  
I'm out of my head, can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you've been gone  
You've got the spell so break it  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Ever since you've been gone  
  
Since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone  
I'm out of my head, can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you've been gone  
You've got the spell so break it  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Ever since you've been gone.
