If you should hear  
That someone new  
Has eased the pain  
Of losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you believe it  
Not for a moment  
Don't you believe it  
Because it isn't true  
  
Those angry words  
That made us part  
Put out the flame  
That's in my heart  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
I haven't changed  
I still love you  
And it will always be  
  
I only hope and  
I pray each night  
You'll feel the  
Same about me  
  
So if you hear  
Some false alarms  
Like you're not welcome  
In my arms  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Oh, how I still love you
