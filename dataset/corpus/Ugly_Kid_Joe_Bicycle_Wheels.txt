Life is to be lived on the positive tip  
Never lose the ground  
You never gonna slip  
If you never lose the ground  
Always draw the line  
Never wear the frown  
Should've got myself some bicycle wheels  
Should've got myself some bicycle wheels  
Should've got myself some bicycle wheels  
On the wings of steel  
There's dinosaur's in countries  
Everyone that I've seen  
There's dinosaur's in countries  
If you know what I mean  
I always keep a watch on the ever changing future  
Doing what I want  
And you could do what suits you  
I said throw your hands in the air  
I like to see your armpit hair  
Throw your hands in the air  
I like to see your armpit hair  
Life is to be lived on the positive tip  
I'll never lose the ground  
You know I'm never gonna slip  
Never gonna slip, cause I never lose the ground  
Always draw the line  
You know I never wear the frown
