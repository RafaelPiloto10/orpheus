Pick up yourself Joe  
Tell all the rest there is a way out  
If you want to get out  
Help me out  
Everybody thinks he knows the way out  
But nobody dares that's why we're stuck in the ground  
Help me out  
  
Staying alive with a trigger in your head  
Staying alive with a trigger in your head  
Welcome, welcome to the real side of life  
  
Everybody's smiling, nobody's crying  
But everybody's kniving everyone from the back  
Wake up little boy  
'Cause you're living in your dreams  
Open your eyes to the real side of life  
  
Staying alive...  
  
I try to be good (yes you are)  
But no one seems to care (oh here he goes again)  
The harder you try (you never tried)  
The more they try to break me (you never tried anything you)  
I try to be good (oh here he goes again)  
Bu no one seems to care  
The harder I try (I told you to do what they told you)  
The more they try to break me (you damn kid)  
Welcome, wlecome to the real side of life  
  
Is it dope you want or is it a gun you want  
You spell out what you want  
And then I'll get you what you want  
I want it all and I want it now  
I'm gonna go ahead and grab it all  
Just for myself  
  
Staying alive...
