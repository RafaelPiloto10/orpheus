I fought so hard for your heart, on the way down  
And I thought that I could save you from destruction  
  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
  
I was hurting, I couldn't let go, I couldn't leave you  
And I told myself, though it was hell, that we'd push through  
  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
  
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control  
Fighting another war  
  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Now I ain't boxing anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fist fighting a sandstorm  
Is a losing battle  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
Was fist fighting a sandstorm  
But I won't fight it anymore  
I'm letting go and it's beautiful
