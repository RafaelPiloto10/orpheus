Hey little pigeon where are you coming from  
You flew across the sky and know  
You're in my hometown  
Hey little pigeon here's where  
You're flying to  
Take this letter to her house  
By the riverside, riverside  
Chorus  
I feel love when I look  
I can't wait I'm really shooked  
I feel love when I look into your eyes  
You searched for my treasure  
Over the atlantic sky  
Did she get my message right  
Did she love or cry  
Hey little pigeon Oh if you only knew  
The things I'd do to fly with you  
To hear her reply, her reply  
Chorus  
When I look into your eyes  
When I look it feels so nice  
When I look into your eyes
