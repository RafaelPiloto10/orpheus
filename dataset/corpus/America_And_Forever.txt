I remember sidewalk laughter down New Orleans, LA  
A hot wet night at the fight with you  
Had to push through the crowds and talk  
Very loud it's true  
But you were on my mind that day  
You were on my mind each day  
You were on my mind that day and forever  
Had a drink, stop to think we had a few  
Afterwards we went down to the dance side of town for the view  
You went blushing inside and you pinched me to see  
If I knew  
But you were on my mind that day  
You were on my mind each day  
You were on my mind that day and forever, and forever  
We were lovers then and forever  
There was nothing that we couldn't do  
A hot wet night at the fight with you  
Times like that weekend remain in my heart crystal clear  
Walking along to the song you have helped me to hear  
Yes you were on my mind that day  
You were on my mind each day  
You were on my mind that day and forever, and forever
