Fanny is now part of the Ziegfeld Follies. She tells  
Florenz Ziegfeld she doesn't want to be in the finale  
because she finds the lyrics inappropriate but  
Ziegfeld insists.  
[Tenor:]  
For better or for worse, "Oh Promise Me,"  
Why does every bride glow ravishingly?  
Within the secret heart of every bride  
These are the words repeating, repeating,  
Repeating inside: (Bing, bong, bing, bong)  
You are the beautiful reflection  
Of his love's affection,  
A walking illustration  
Of his adoration  
His love makes you beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
You ask your looking glass,  
What is it?  
Makes you so exquisite?  
The answer to your query  
Comes back, dearie--  
His love makes you beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
And woman loved is woman glorified!  
You'll make a beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful bride!  
[Chorus:]  
Here comes the bride,  
Another beautiful bride.  
Ziegfeld presents her  
With justifiable pride.  
Fanny enters with a pillow stuffed under her bridal gown  
so that she appears pregnant.  
[Fanny:]  
I am the beautiful reflection  
Of my love's affection,  
A walking illustration  
Of his adoration.  
His love makes me beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
So beautiful,  
[Tenor:]  
And woman loved is woman glorified--  
[Fanny:]  
I'll make a beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful,  
Beautiful--  
I'm beautiful? Oy!  
[Chorus:]  
You are so beautiful,  
You are so beautiful,  
You are so beautiful,  
[Tenor:]  
Such a beautiful bride.
