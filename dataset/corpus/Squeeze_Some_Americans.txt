Some Americans are very pretty  
Some Americans are very shy  
Some Americans are Disney people  
Some Americans eat apple pie  
Some Americans scare me, the leader of the pack  
Living in this theater  
I'm waiting for the trap to drop in the show  
Some Americans gung ho  
  
Some Americans are very happy  
Some Americans will always win  
Some Americans are party people  
Some Americans go out and sing  
  
Some Americans are very lucky  
Some Americans are very poor  
Some Americans are burger people  
Some Americans say no to war
