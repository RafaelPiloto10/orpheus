All of my life, I've been searching  
For the words to say how I feel.  
I'd spend my time thinking too much  
And leave too little to say what I mean  
But I try to understand the best I can,  
All of my life.  
  
All of my life, I've been saying sorry  
For the things I know I should have done  
All the things I could have said come back to me  
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun  
Seems I'm always that little too late  
All of my life  
  
Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you  
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay  
Set 'em up, 'cause I'm going nowhere  
There's too much I need to remember, and there's too much I need to say  
  
All of my life, I've been looking  
But it's hard to find the way  
Just reaching past the goal in front of me  
While what's important just slips away  
And it doesn't come back, but I'll be looking  
All of my life  
  
Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you  
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay  
Set 'em up, 'cause I'm going nowhere  
There's too much I need to remember, and there's too much I need to say  
  
All of my life, there have been regrets  
That I didn't do all I could  
Playing records upstairs, while he watched TV  
I didn't spend the time I should  
And that's a memory I will live with  
All of my life.
