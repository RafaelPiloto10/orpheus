Huh, huh ooh I'm just a fool for you  
Huh huh huh huh  
I can't get you off my mind  
No matter what I do  
I'm wishing you were here with me  
Makes no difference (when it is)  
I only think of you  
And I'm living out my fantasy  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)  
It's still the same  
Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep thinking about you baby  
Oh so tell me what ya gonna do  
Got me thinking about you  
All I want to do  
  
Like a river of wine  
Intoxicate my mind  
I'm thinking about you  
That's what I want to do  
Pick me up, let's go down  
I'm thinking about it too (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
I'm thinking about you  
Got me thinking about you  
I'm thinking about it too  
  
Make believing is a game  
That's not for me to play  
Don't you need me just like I need you  
There's no reason  
Just my heart that makes me feel this way  
And I hope you feel the same way too  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)  
It's still the same  
Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It might be pouring rain  
Like a fool insane  
I'm just a lovesick fool  
I got this thing for you (I'm just a I'm just a lovesick fool)  
Oh just a fool for you!  
  
[Chorus]
