I'm sick and tired of hearing things,  
From uptight, short sighted, narrow minded hypocrites,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just gimme some truth,  
I've had enough of reading things,  
By neurotic, psychotic, pig headed politicians,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
  
No short haired, yellow bellied, son of George Porgy is  
Gonna mother hubbard, soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,  
Money for oil,  
Money for oil.  
  
I'm sick to death of seeing things,  
By tight lipped, condescending, mommy's little chauvinists,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just gimme some truth,  
I've had enough of watching scenes,  
Of schizophrenic, egocentric, paranoia prima donnas,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
  
No short haired, yellow bellied, son of tricky Dicky is  
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,  
Money for oil,  
Money for oil,  
  
No short haired, yellow bellied, son of George-Porgy is  
Gonna mother hubbard soft soap me with just a pocket full of oil,  
It's money for oil,  
No blood for oil,  
  
I'm sick to death of hearing things,  
From uptight, short sighted, narrow minded hypocrites,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just gimme some truth,  
I've had enough of reading things,  
By neurotic psychotic, homophobic hypocrites,  
All I want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
All we want is the truth,  
Just give us the truth,  
We can handle the truth,  
Just give us some truth,  
Share with us the truth,  
We'll give you our truth
