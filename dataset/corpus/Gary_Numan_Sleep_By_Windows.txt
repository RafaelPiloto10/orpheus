You can cry by my window  
You can crawl on the floor  
You can scream if you want to  
But I won't unlock the door  
  
You can sleep in bus shelters  
You can sleep in the park  
But I'll rip up the trees  
Until you tear yourself apart  
  
But I don't love you  
No I don't love you  
Do you dream?  
  
Back to surveillance  
Open eyes and wash out 'tear'  
A sign that says 'no exit'  
And 'no-one can save you here'  
  
I could talk about my programme  
Where everything is white  
I could specialize in pictures  
Where nothing's ever right  
  
But I don't love you  
No I don't love you  
Do you dream?  
  
We are just sound  
We are just noise  
And we are all here to lie  
Do you dream?  
  
You sleep by windows  
You sleep by windows  
  
Do you cry?  
Do you dream?  
Do you?  
Did you?
