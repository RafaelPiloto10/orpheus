Ain't no place you can hide that I can't find you.  
Ain't no place you can go where I won't be.  
Lest you forget, my dear, let me remind you, girl  
You may as well resign yourself to me.  
  
Ain't no door you can lock that I can't get through.  
Ain't no place you can undress where I can't see.  
If you're marooned in space I'll come and get you, girl.  
You may as well resign yourself to me.  
  
Don't think you fool me with that trench coat and them shades.  
I'm gonna wrap my arms around you like two gooey old band aides.  
  
Ain't no path you can take that I can't follow.  
I'm gonna buzz around your head just like a bee.  
You may elude me tonight, but come tomorrow, girl  
You may as well resign yourself to me, girl.  
You may as well resign yourself to me.
