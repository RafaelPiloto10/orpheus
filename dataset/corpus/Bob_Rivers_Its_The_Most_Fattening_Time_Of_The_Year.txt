It's the most fattening time of the year  
With that pumpkin pie filling  
And everyone swilling down eggnog and beer  
It's the most fattening time of the year  
  
It's the lip smackingest season of all  
While your shopping you're cheating  
Impulsively eating that junk at the mall  
  
It's the heav-heaviest season of all  
  
There'll be turkeys for basting  
And stuffing for tasting  
And giblets and gravy will flow  
There'll be cookies that mom baked  
And leftover fruit cake from a Christmas a long time ago  
  
It's the scale flattening time of the year  
While your diet you're blowing  
There's calories going straight down to your rear  
It's the scale flattening time of the year  
  
There'll be after meal dosing  
And arteries closing  
Cholesterol levels will grow  
It's too cold to go jogging  
To brisk for tobogganing  
So pass me a hot buttered roll  
  
It's the most fattening time of the year  
  
All those gingerbread shingles and  
Chocolate Chris Kringle's will tremble in fear  
  
It's the most fattening time,  
It's the belt loosening time,  
It's the most fattening time of the year
