You are the best, for all of times  
You beat the rest, you're in my mind  
Don't take away this dream in me  
Don't leave me here in misery  
You are the best, from coast to coast  
From east to west, love you the most  
It's hard to win, you try your best  
And we are sure, you'll beat the rest  
  
Ten seconds to countdown  
Ten seconds to know  
Who will be the hero  
Everybody loves the show  
  
Oh we're ready for the victory  
You're the hero number one for me  
Baby, baby  
We're in the pole position now  
  
(Ten seconds to countdown)  
  
You are the champ, a hurricane  
From heaven sent, you win again  
Oh tell me where the hero's gone  
But you are here, we can't go wrong  
The price is high, when dreams come true  
Oh we can fly, it's up to you  
It's hard to win, you try your best  
And we are sure you beat the rest
