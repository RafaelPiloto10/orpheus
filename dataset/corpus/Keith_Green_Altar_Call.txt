You know I can't explain to you  
Really how He does it  
But He proved Himself to me in such a Holy way  
Such a complete way  
That I'd die for that faith and I'd die for that believe  
Because it is more than a believe  
He lives in my heart  
And that's the only proof  
The only proof that I can give you  
Cause He lives in my heart  
  
Most people that knew me before  
Didn't know that I could believe something so strong  
  
The Gospel is simpy this  
Jesus will forive all your sins  
If you come to Him humbly  
Lay down at his feet and say  
'You're the Lord  
And I'll follow you the rest of my life on earth  
So that I can have the rest of eternity with You  
And the Glory of Your Father'  
  
Most people don't find out  
'Till it's too late  
That someone has to pay the price  
You can pay it your self (Ha!)  
Or let someone else  
But who would be that nice  
To pay a debt that isn't his  
Well I know someone like that  
And He's your best friend  
He really is  
He really loves you  
  
Most people don't find out  
'Till they're half dead  
That they need another life  
You say you've heard everything  
That's ever been said  
About the way the truth, the life  
You say you've heard lots of preaching  
All before  
So many times  
  
But did you ever open up your door  
Give Him a chance  
To prove Himself  
Well He's real you know  
  
I hope you find out  
Before it's too late  
That there's really nobody else  
You know its breaking his heart  
The longer you wait  
Cause You've only been lying to yourself  
Cause no one believes a thing you say  
Not even you  
You know you're gonna find out  
That He's the way  
No matter which way you choose  
But I pray you find out by His love for you
