Saturday night comes creeping  
Saturday night comes creeping cold  
Saturday night comes laughing and dancing  
Sunday leaves you cold  
  
Saturday night comes crying  
Saturday night comes weeping and sore  
Saturday night finds you looking for friends  
That you don't want to see no more  
  
Saturday night comes crazy  
Saturday night comes swinging and wild  
Saturday night comes sharp as my suit  
I want to be Sunday's child  
  
Saturday night comes creeping  
Saturday night comes creeping and cold  
Saturday night comes laughing and dancing  
Sunday leaves you old  
  
Leaves you old
