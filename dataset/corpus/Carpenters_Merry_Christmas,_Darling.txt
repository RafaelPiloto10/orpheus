Greeting cards have all been sent  
The Christmas rush is through  
But I still have one wish to make  
A special one for you  
  
Merry Christmas Darling  
We're apart that's true  
But I can dream and in my dreams  
I'm Christmasing with you  
  
Holidays are joyful  
There's always something new  
But ev'ryday's a holiday  
When I'm near to you  
  
The lights on my tree  
I wish you could see  
I wish it ev'ry day  
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you Merry Christmas  
Happy New Year too  
I've just one wish on this Christmas eve  
I wish I were with you  
  
The logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you Merry Christmas  
Happy New Year too  
I've just one wish on this Christmas eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you
