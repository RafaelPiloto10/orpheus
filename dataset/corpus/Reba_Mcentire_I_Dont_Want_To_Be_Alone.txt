My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.  
Wish that I could be so bold as to  
Walk right up to you and say what I think.  
I don't now what you think  
Of me.  
And I know everyone can see I'm crazy  
About you and always will be.  
  
Where's women's lib when you need it the most.  
Or was it mama who said  
You're not suppose to flaunt yourself like that  
As if there's no in between.  
Or maybe it's not that I'm afraid, it's just that the last move I made  
Embarrassed me to death and made me want to hide.  
  
So if you've ever been embarrassed before meet me half way  
And I'll know for sure.  
At least  
We'll still be friends if I mess up again.  
Cause it ain't easy meeting  
Someone new.  
Especially when that someone is you.  
It ain't easy by being by yourself.  
It's no fun to be alone,  
And I don't want to be alone.  
Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new.  
Especially when that someone is  
You.  
It ain't easy by being by yourself.  
It's no fun to be alone,  
And I don't want to be alone.  
  
My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.  
Wish that I could be so bold as to walk  
Right up to you and say what I think.
