Well, since she put me down  
I've been out doin' in my head  
I come in late at night  
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed  
  
Well, Rhonda, you look so fine (look so fine)  
And I know it wouldn't take much time  
For you to help me, Rhonda  
Help me get her out of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda  
Help, help me, Rhonda  
Help me, Rhonda, yeah  
Get her out of my heart  
  
She was gonna be my wife  
And I was gonna be her man  
(Oh Rhonda)  
But she let another guy come between us  
And it shattered our plans  
(Oh Rhonda)  
  
Well, Rhonda, you caught my eye (caught my eye)  
And I can give you lots of reasons why  
You gotta help me, Rhonda  
Help me get her out of my heart  
  
[Chorus x 2]
