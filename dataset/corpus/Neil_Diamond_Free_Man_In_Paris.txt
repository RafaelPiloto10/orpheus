The way I see it, I just can't win it  
Everybody's in it for their own game  
You can't please them all  
There's always somebody callin' you down  
And I do my best and I do good business  
As a lot of people asking for my time  
They're trying to get ahead  
And try and be a good friend of mine  
  
I was a free man in Paris, I was ? and alive  
There was nobody to call me up for favors  
No one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
But for the work I'm taking on  
? star makin' machinery  
Behind the popular song  
  
I deal in dreamers and telephone schemers  
Lately I wonder what I do it for  
If I had my way, I'd walk through that door and wonder  
Down the ? going cafe to cabaret  
Thinkin' how I feel when I find  
That very good friend of mine
