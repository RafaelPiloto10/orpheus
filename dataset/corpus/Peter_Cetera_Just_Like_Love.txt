See the color of roses  
Sail across America  
I couldn't wait to find you  
I'm looking for a miracle  
And somewhere out of the blue  
In the heart of getting by  
CHORUS:  
It only takes a second to learn  
It only takes a second to hurt  
And it's just like love to be the hardest thing  
It's just like love to be everything (Repeat)  
An illusion of laughter  
Lost in a desert sky  
That's how I feel without you  
I can't take another night  
Somewhere out of the blue  
From my heart and in your eyes  
CHORUS  
Oh I can feel it all  
Right or wrong I'm here  
Here for you  
CHORUS (Repeat to fade)
