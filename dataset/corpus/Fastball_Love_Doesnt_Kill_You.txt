It doesn't kill you, it's not a one-way ticket to a lonely life  
It might break your heart, but the physical risk is low  
You might feel so bad that you wanna die  
but if you died you would never know  
that it didn't kill you  
soon you would've felt better  
are you happy in heaven?  
do you win all the games that they play up there?  
do you have a new body?  
what kind of wings do you wear?  
I haven't felt so bad that I wanted to die  
but if I died I would never know  
Love doesn't kill you  
it's supposed to make you feel better  
You're never going to feel any better  
once you're dead, you don't get any deader  
and you get no lovin' but you feel no pain  
never have to lose again  
I just wish you could've been a bit bolder  
now you're never gonna get any older  
and I really do miss you, but how would you know?  
Is that the only way to go?  
Love doesn't kill you  
but you can't run away from the bare inside  
you can't just quit right right here  
you've gotta let it ride  
We've all felt so bad that we wanted to die  
but if we died we would never know  
Love doesn't kill you  
It makes you feel better  
you're not ever going to feel any better  
once you're dead you don't get any deader  
and you get no lovin', but you'll feel no pain  
never have to lose again  
I just wish you could've been a bit bolder  
now you're never going to get any older  
and I really do miss you  
but how would you know?  
It's just too bad that it's too late to let it show
