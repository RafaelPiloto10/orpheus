(Graham Russell)  
Here's on the street  
A tear in the seam  
Of pleasure and pain  
Life carries on  
A cloak of deceit  
Brings honour to shame  
But the voice I used to know  
(Where are you now?)  
Is the one I can't let go  
Chorus:  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A Distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
You are the first, You are the last  
I'help you to see  
The light in the dark  
The sun through the rain  
Until you are free  
And facing the truth  
That words can't explain  
But the truth I think you know(Tell me)  
I could never let you go  
Chorus  
you are the future from the past  
You are the spell that has been cast  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
Chorus  
You are the first  
You are the last to me  
Oom hm.....You are to me...You are
