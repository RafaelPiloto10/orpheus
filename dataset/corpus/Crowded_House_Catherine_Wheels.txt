No night to stay in  
Bad moon is rising again  
Dice rolls and you burn  
Come down I fear  
As that cold wheel turns  
I know what I know  
Sad Claude's been sleeping around  
To stroke the right nerve  
Whose needs do I serve  
As Catherine's wheel turns  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
  
Go kindly with him  
To his blind apparition  
His face creases up  
With age gone grey  
He'll back here one day  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Wheels on  
  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
  
She's gone  
Vanished in the night  
Broke off the logic of light  
He woke  
Tore the covers back  
Found he was empty inside  
  
So they were told  
When the moon would rise  
The best time to leave with your soul  
She's gone  
But towards the light  
Watching her whole life unfold  
Bruises come out dark  
  
So strong was his hold on her  
Regarded by some as his slave  
He spoke as in a stranger's tongue  
Despair us and drive you away, hey  
Bruises come out dark
