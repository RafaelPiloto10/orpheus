Well I was walking in the main land city  
And I was feeling so alone  
I was looking for someone or thing to remind me of my home  
What I wouldn't give to have somebody nod or wink at me  
Cause that's the way we say hello in my home down by the sea  
We never say "hello" or "how's it going?", "good day" or any of that  
We just look at them and nod our heads and wink say 'Whadd'ya At?'  
CHORUS:  
Whadd'ya At? How's she going buddy, Whadd'ya At today?  
Whadd'ya At? How's she going buddy, Whadd'ya At today?  
But then I walked into a shopping mall and much to my surprise  
An old friend from my hometown was a sight for my sore eyes  
And of all the people I met down in the city or in the mall  
I think I like my hometown friend the best one of them all  
Because he didn't say "hello" or "how's it going today?" or any of that  
My old friend he just looked at me and smiled said "Whadd'ya At?"  
CHORUS x 2  
Let this be a lesson to all our people who go away  
Remember if you meet someone the special words we say  
We don't ever say "hello" or "how's it going?", "good day"  
Or any of that.  
You just look at them and nod your head now wink say "Whadd'ya At?"  
CHORUS
