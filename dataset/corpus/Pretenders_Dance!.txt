Dance!  
If you will  
Dance!  
On your capitol hill  
Dance!  
If you can  
Dance!  
Like a twentieth century man  
  
Take the people by the throat  
Give 'em a reason to give you a vote  
Take your audience up on stage  
Let them think you're a sage  
  
Dance!  
If you want  
Dance!  
Like you've got a house to haunt  
Dance!  
Like a freak  
Dance!  
Like you needed it all week  
  
Take your people by the hand  
Tell 'em you'll get 'em to the promised land  
Take your woman in the heat of the night  
Make her think you're right  
See'mon!  
  
Dance!  
Like a chimpanzee  
Dance!  
In the 'land of the free'  
Dance!  
Like a russian ballet  
Dance!  
Like a funky situe  
  
Let 'em know that you're well read  
Quote the things that jesus said  
Lift your face and your whiskey neat  
To get you up on your feet  
See'mon!
