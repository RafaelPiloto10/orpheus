Chorus  
I have been born again  
I've been born again  
Been o the water and I've been baptized  
I've been born again  
  
Verse 1  
I went to a meeting one night  
My heart was full of sin  
The preacher looked me straight in the eye  
And said, " You must be born again!"  
I felt the Spirit movin' deep down in my soul  
I head the voice of Jesus say,  
"Sinner, I'll make you whole."  
  
Verse 2  
I stepped into the water  
The water was chilly sand cold  
It chilled my natural body  
But it warmed my sin-sick soul  
I came up out of the water  
Baptized in Jesus' Name  
I jumped, I shouted, and spoke in tongues  
When the Holy Ghost came in  
  
Bridge  
Born, I've Been born again  
Born, I've been born again  
Born of the water  
Born of he Spirit  
  
Vamp 1  
I've been born again (repeat)  
I've been, I've been born  
I've been, I've been born  
I've been, I've been born again  
  
Vamp 2  
Born again (repeat)  
Ooh, Yeah, I've been born again  
I've been, I've been born  
I've been, I've been born  
I've been, I've been born again
