To the carpenter said the dainty bride,  
The grass appears greener on the other side.  
So let's clarify before we unite that the grass is never greener on the other
side.  
To the carpenter said the dainty bride,  
I pledge to you my love tonight.  
But I will not hesitate to euthanize if the grass becomes greener on the other
side.  
Said the carpenter to the dainty bride,  
I would never do a thing to jeopardize this union I consider prize,  
Grass never will be greener on the other side.  
To the preacher man said the dainty wife,  
He thought the grass was greener on the other side.  
So I buried in his belly my butcher knife and ended these years of wretched
strife.  
Said the preacher man to the guilty wife,  
Though the law may give you twenty years to life pray forgiveness in the
Father's eyes  
And the grass just may be greener on the other side.
