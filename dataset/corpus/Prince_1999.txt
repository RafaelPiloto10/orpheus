I was dreamin' when I wrote this  
Forgive me if it goes astray  
But when I woke up this mornin'  
Could of sworn it was judgment day  
  
The sky was all purple  
There were people runnin' everywhere  
Tryin' to run from the destruction  
You know I didn't even care  
  
'Cause they say two thousand zero zero  
Party over, oops out of time  
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999  
  
I was dreamin' when I wrote this  
So sue me if I go to fast  
But life is just a party  
And parties weren't meant to last  
  
War is all around us  
My mind says prepare to fight  
So if I gotta die  
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight  
  
Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero  
Party over, oops out of time  
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Lemme tell ya somethin'  
If you didn't come to party  
Don't bother knockin' on my door  
I got a lion in my pocket  
And baby he's ready to roar, yeah yeah  
  
Everybody's got a bomb  
We could all die here today, uhh  
But before I'll let that happen  
I'll dance my life away  
  
They say two thousand zero zero  
Party over, oops out of time  
We're runnin' outta time  
So tonight, we gonna, we gonna (tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)  
  
Say it one more time  
Two thousand zero zero  
Party over, oops out of time  
Yeah, yeah  
So tonight we gonna, we gonna (tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999)  
  
1999 (1999)  
Don't ya want to go (1999)  
Don't ya want to go (1999)  
We could all die here today (1999)  
I don't want to die  
I'd rather dance my life away
