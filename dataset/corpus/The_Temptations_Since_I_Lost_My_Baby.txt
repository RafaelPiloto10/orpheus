Sun a-shining, there's plenty of life. . .  
a new day is dawning sunny and bright.  
But after I've been crying all night the sun is cold  
and the new day seems old.  
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.  
  
Birds are singing and the children are playing,  
there's plenty of work and the bosses are paying.  
Not a sad word should my young heart be saying,  
but fun is a bore and with money I'm poor.  
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.  
  
Next time I'll be kinder, won't you please help me find her?  
Someone just remind her 'bout this love she left behind her.  
'Til I find her I'll be tryin' now, ev'ry day I'm more inclined to find her,  
inclined to find her, inclined to find my baby.  
Been a-looking ev'rywhere, baby, I really, really care.  
  
Oh, determination is fading fast. . . Inspiration is a thing of the past. . .  
Can't see my hope's gonna last. . .  
good things are bad and what's happy is sad.  
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.  
I feel so bad, oo, I'll feel so sad, everything is a-wrong,  
I feel so bad, oo, I'll feel so sad, everything is a-wrong,
