Galileo was a sinner  
While Christopher Columbus was a saint  
Stems from moral victories at least that's what you should believe  
What a prestigious state I've made for blasphemers that never seem to...  
Just last week the pope figured out  
Said "evolution might not be a sin after all"  
But people's thoughts on evolution say "the winning church shall stay"  
But the pope's token gesture  
Trust me much to little, much to late  
When the cardinal lives in the big house with facing chimneys  
And expansive lawns right on the lake  
Well blast his house and shake my hands  
Say things that don't seem right to me.  
Somebody somewhere has made a big mistake  
Cause I seem to recall  
That Jesus was a communist  
And shared everything and yearned to give  
So whats the fucking deal with the no trespassing sign  
A sign  
Displayed for everyone to see  
For everyone to see  
For everyone to see  
Seems to me this lawn would be nice to sleep on  
Seems to me that Jesus would agree  
Well i'm just a stupid kid who never goes to church  
But Bernadine seems all fucked up to me  
And if heaven loves my brother how can a holy man close  
His door to the people most in need  
Well i don't know  
I don't know  
Well i guess its just a theme in history  
A theme in history  
A theme in history  
I choose to fucking not believe  
I choose to fucking not believe  
Jesus was a communist he thinks the same as me  
I choose to fucking not believe  
FUCK THE CHURCH and learn to be free  
FUCK THE POPE and come to hell with me  
Our father said we should "forgive those who trespass against us"  
It seems to me this lawn would be nice to sleep on  
Seems to me that Jesus would agree  
It seems to me this lawn would be nice to sleep on
