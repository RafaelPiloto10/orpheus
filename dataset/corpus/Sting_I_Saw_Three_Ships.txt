I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And what was in those ships all three?  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
And what was in those ships all three?  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
Pray, whither sailed those ships all three?  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
Pray, whither sailed those ships all three?  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
O, they sailed to Bethlehem,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
O, they sailed to Bethlehem,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the bells on earth shall ring,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
And all the bells on earth shall ring,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the angels in heaven shall sing,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
And all the angels in heaven shall sing,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the souls on earth shall sing,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
And all the souls on earth shall sing,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
Then let us all rejoice and sing,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
Then let us all rejoice and sing,  
On Christmas day in the morning
