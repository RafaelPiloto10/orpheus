One morning when I was ridin' in my old pickup truck  
A beautiful bluebird came flyin' down  
My eyes caught the color as it led me down the road  
Dippin' and bobbin' in the sun  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
  
I've never seen that blue before except in one place  
And she's not here with me right now  
And just like a lover I watched her fly away  
And that's what I remember now  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
  
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies  
Looks like she's always goin' home  
  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you  
  
If heaven had a window where the sun came shinin' through  
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flyin' back to you
