God's passion is an endless river  
White water running wild  
In a restless rushing fury  
To see souls reconciled.  
It reaches wide across forever  
It's dangerous and deep  
And while some venture to the shoreline  
Some even dare to leap  
Chorus:  
And The River rages, The River runs  
All through the ages, Long after I'm gone  
There's a truth I'm finding I can't ignore  
Whether I dive in or stand on the shore  
The River keeps rushing on.  
All of those who ride the rapids  
Have a message they must tell  
There's a joy in being lost in something  
That's bigger than yourself  
And though the current takes you places  
Where you learn to lose control  
If you think you're going under  
He'll never let you go, never let you go  
Chorus
