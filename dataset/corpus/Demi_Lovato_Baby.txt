Ohh wooaah (3x)  
You know you love me, I know you care  
You shout whenever, And I'll be there  
You want my love, You want my heart  
And we will never ever ever be apart  
  
Are we an item? Girl quit playing  
We're just friends, What are you saying  
So there's another one, Looks right in my eyes  
My first love broke my heart for the first time,  
  
And I was like  
Baby, baby, baby oooh  
Like baby, baby, baby noo  
Like baby, baby, baby oooh  
I thought you'd always be mine mine  
  
Baby, baby, baby oooh  
Like baby, baby, baby noo  
Like baby, baby, baby oooh  
I thought you'd always be mine, oh oh  
  
For you, I would have done whatever  
And now I just can't believe, We ain't together  
And wanna play it cool, But I'm losin' you  
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring  
And now I am in peaces, baby fix me  
Come and shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream  
  
I'm going down, down, dooown  
And I just can't believe, my first love  
Won't be around

Luda!  
When I was thirteen  
I had my first love  
There was nobody that compared to my baby  
And nobody came to between us,  
No-one could ever come above  
She had me going crazy  
Oh I star-struck  
She woke me up daily  
Don't need no Starbucks  
She make my heart pound  
I skip a beat when  
I see her in the street and  
At school on the playground  
But I really wanna  
See her on the weekend  
She knows she got me dazing  
Cuz she was so amazing  
And now my heart is breaking  
But I just keep on saying  
  
(Justin)  
Baby, baby, baby oooh  
Like baby, baby, baby noo  
Like baby, baby, baby oooh  
I thought you'd always be mine  
  
Baby, baby, baby oooh  
Like baby, baby, baby noo  
Like baby, baby, baby oooh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  
  
Baby, baby, baby oooh  
Like baby, baby, baby noo  
Like baby, baby, baby oooh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  
  
Yeah Yeah (5x)  
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, ooh  
I'm gone, ooohh
