In the Spotlight life is so peachy yeah, yeah, yeah  
Wouldn't you like to retire with a million?  
  
A million beating hearts  
Behind brick and cold steel piping  
Fighting for the top  
Fighting for the room to breathe  
Bench parks sleepers lie  
Cold blanket bedless babies  
Here this must stop  
I cannot stay  
  
Damn you, big city, black city  
Rising up around me, steal my soul away  
Big city, black city  
Rise and take me over, steal my soul away  
But all out in this world  
The night it crawls it falls much harder than I recall  
Out in this world  
A siren calls from every corner  
  
In the Spotlight life is so peachy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
All of us in the Spotlight for a reason, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Caught for stealing somebody's riches, no, no, no, no  
Wouldn't you like to retire with a million bucks?  
Yeah  
  
Came here from a small town  
I see my dreams here in the big city  
Sour disappointment  
I cannot stay  
  
Damn you, big city, black city  
Rising up around me, steal my soul away  
Big city, black city  
Rise and take me over, steal my soul away  
But all out in this world  
The night it crawls it falls much harder than I recall  
Out in this world  
A siren calls from every corner  
  
In the Spotlight life is so peachy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
All of us in the spotlight for a reason, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Caught for stealing somebody's riches, no, no, no, no  
Wouldn't you like to retire with a million bucks  
Yeah  
  
Yeah....  
Yeah....  
Yeah....  
Yeah....
