[Instrumental]  
  
[Verse]  
I don't know why I feed on emotion,  
There's a stomach inside my brain.  
I don't want to be heard,  
I want to be listened to.  
  
[Repeat 2x]  
Does it bother anyone else,  
That someone else has your name?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I scream, you scream, we all scream  
'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner.  
We stay in place  
'Cause we don't want to lose our lives,  
So let's think of something better.  
  
[Chorus]  
Down in the forest,  
We'll sing a chorus,  
One the ever body knows.  
  
Hands held higher,  
We'll be on fire,  
Singing songs that nobody wrote.  
  
[Verse 2]  
My brain has given up,  
White flags are hoisted.  
I took some food for thought,  
It might be poisoned.  
  
The stomach in my brain,  
Throws up on to the page.  
  
[Repeat 2x]  
Does it bother anyone else,  
That someone else has your name?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I scream, you scream, we all scream  
'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner.  
We stay in place  
'Cause we don't want to lose our lives,  
So let's think of something better.  
  
[Chorus]  
Down in the forest,  
We'll sing a chorus,  
One the ever body knows.  
  
Hands held higher,  
We'll be on fire,  
Singing songs that nobody wrote.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Quickly moving towards the storm,  
Moving forward, torn  
In to pieces over reasons.  
Of what these storms are for,  
I don't understand why everything that I adore  
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes.  
Have you done that?  
When you squint your eyes,  
And your eyelashes make it look like not right  
And then when just enough light  
Comes from just the right side  
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?  
This is not what you're supposed to see,  
Please, remember me. I am supposed to be.  
King of a kingdom. or swinging on a swing.  
Something happened to my imagination  
This situation's becoming dire.  
My tree house is on fire  
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands.  
This is not what I had planned,  
This is not what I had planned.  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Down in the forest,  
We'll sing a chorus.  
Hands held higher,  
We'll be on fire,  
Singing songs that nobody wrote.  
  
[Chorus]  
Down in the forest,  
We'll sing a chorus,  
One the ever body knows.  
  
Hands held higher,  
We'll be on fire,  
Singing songs that nobody wrote.  
  
Hands held higher,  
We'll be on fire. [2x]
