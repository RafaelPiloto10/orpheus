(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.) Why? For what do we strive that
will bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand
years we've chokedon our efforts. Only tolay down and die. Things change, and
things stay the same. Through all these trials I cannot compose myself. Till
there is a time no heaviness fills my heart. I canot compose myself. So in all
this, there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For
generation upon generation God retained a silence that shattered the hearts of
men. And for a season, all else failed. There is no other name, given among
men whereby they might be saved. In all these years when men crawled the earth
choking on his tears, no composure, nor completion reigned. No self righteous
cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man... No human effort
can bring holyness or even the strength to stand. There is  
no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is
Jesus.
