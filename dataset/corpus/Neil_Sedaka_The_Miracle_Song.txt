  
All my life  
I've been a kind of lonely man  
Searching high and low  
Looking for my way  
Then all at once  
I saw you right in front of me  
I knew right then and there  
My lonely days were through  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever, ever be  
And you're a miracle to me  
You fill my life  
With tenderness and harmony  
I never thought  
That I'd be laughing once again  
You fill the room  
With something warm and wonderful  
I can't imagine life  
Without your precious love  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That could ever, ever be  
And you're a miracle to me  
Rivers bend rivers flow  
Till the end of time  
They keep flowing  
Through eternity  
Take me there  
Sail away  
Take me to the sea  
You're a river that flows inside of me  
You're just a rose  
That shimmers in the sun  
And now I know  
My life has just begun  
You are the sweetest thing  
That I could ever, ever see  
And you're a miracle to me  
!
