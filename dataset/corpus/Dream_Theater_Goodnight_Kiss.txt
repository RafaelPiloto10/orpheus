Goodnight kiss in your nightgown  
Lavender in your bed  
So innocent as you lie down  
Sweet dreams that run through your head  
  
Are you lonely without Mommy's love?  
I want you to know I'd die for that moment  
You're just a poor girl  
Afraid of this cruel world  
Taken away from it all  
  
It's been 5 years to the day and  
My tainted blood's still the same  
I can't help acting this way and  
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay  
  
I'm so lonely without baby's love  
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment  
I'm just a poor girl  
Afraid of this cruel world  
Taken away from it all
