Words and music by Ed McCurdy  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd ever dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war  
I dreamed I saw a mighty room  
Filled with women and men  
And the paper they were signing said  
They'd never fight again  
And when the paper was all signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands and bowed their heads  
And grateful pray'rs were prayed  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing 'round and 'round  
While swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd never dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war.
