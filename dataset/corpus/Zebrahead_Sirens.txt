I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die  
You can bury my heart with your box of lies  
Cut me down to size, it's no surprise  
You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties  
  
Gimme an "F", gimme a "U"  
Gimme a "CK YOU"  
Read between the lines, I guess love is blind  
Want me to spell it out for you?  
  
I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die  
You can bury my heart with your box of lies  
Come on, pose with me in this sick machine  
It looks like I'm going down in this murder scene  
  
Try and try to bend and break me  
I won't feel anything  
Try and try to suffocate me  
No pleasure like the pain  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
I can't wait to bring you  
Down, Down, Down, Down  
  
Gimme a "U", gimme an "R"  
Gimme "A Bitch" yeah you are  
Don't pretend to cry, kiss your ass, goodbye  
I got 99 reasons why  
  
Cut me down to size, it's no surprise  
You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties  
Come on, punish me if it's what you need  
Tie me up, break me down, you can watch me bleed  
  
Try and try to bend and break me  
I won't feel anything  
Try and try to suffocate me  
No pleasure like the pain  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
I can't wait to bring you  
Down, Down, Down, Down  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down, Down  
  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
Words like bombs are falling  
Down, Down, Down  
Sirens are calling  
All's fair in love and war and  
I can't wait to bring you  
Down, Down, Down, Down
