Great is the Lord,  
He is holy and just  
By His power we trust  
In His love  
Great is the Lord  
He is faithful and true  
By His mercy He proves  
He is love  
  
[Chorus]  
Great is the Lord  
And worthy of glory  
Great is the Lord  
And worthy of praise  
Great is the Lord  
Now lift up your voice  
Now lift up your voice  
Great is the Lord  
Great is the Lord  
  
Great is the Lord,  
He is holy and just  
By His power we trust  
In His love  
Great is the Lord  
He is faithful, and true  
By His mercy He proves  
He is love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Great are you Lord  
And worthy of glory  
Great are you Lord  
And worthy of praise  
Great are you Lord  
I lift up my voice  
I lift up my voice  
Great are you Lord  
Great are you Lord
