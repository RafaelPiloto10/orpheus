And in the morning when you fill my eyes  
I knew that day I couldn't do,  
Ah, no wrong, I couldn't do.  
  
And so my mind begins to memorize  
'Cause time will never seem the same,  
Ah, no more, never again.  
  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go,  
My legs are weak my heels are low.  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll.  
Can't make no headway on this road.  
  
There's an empty space inside me now,  
A wasteland deep beneath the snow,  
So cold, nothing'll grow.  
  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go,  
My legs are weak my heels are low.  
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll.  
Can't make no headway on this road. What road?  
  
And in the morning when you fill my eyes  
I knew that day I couldn't do,  
Ah, no wrong, I couldn't do.
