Somehow the season always brings  
A picture of you, baby boom baby.  
Holding on for everything  
You figured you're due, little turtleneck girl.  
The moon on your shoulder,  
The wind in your lovely hair, oh what a night.  
We sat on the beach and watched  
As the sun rose into the Summer air.  
  
You said we couldn't miss what we never knew,  
Something about something that you had to do,  
Sitting on the sand with a hole in my shoe.  
  
I had no way of knowing where  
You might have been, time goes by.  
All on my own I imagine you  
A life in between, all own my own.  
Wrote a long letter but it never made it  
Out of my head, oh, oh,  
Somehow reading your name it wasn't the same  
As leaving the thing unsaid.  
  
How come I miss what I never knew,  
Drag out the past just to paint it blue,  
And spend my days with a dream of you?  
  
Oh, after the fall, here I'm trying  
To find our name on the wall.  
It was neither yours nor mine,  
It was something of the two combined,  
From a time spent out of time.  
  
I work hard to see that you remember my name,  
Nod your head yes,  
Do all I can to make you want to see me again,  
Oh what a night.  
Got a letter from the mail,  
Got a message from the telephone.  
Seems you're working in town,  
Moving around, living alone.  
  
Now I'm caught in the spotlight,  
Walking the wire,  
My feet are frozen and my heart's on fire,  
What do I do if my dream come true?  
La la la, la la la la la...
