A Boy is Born in Bethlehem!  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
And joy is in Jerusalem,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
And there He lay in manger poor,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
Whose rein shall last for ever-more,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
The cats and dogs and all the heard,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
Knew well that Boy to be the Lord!  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
And kings from out the East there were,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
With gold and frankincense and myrrh  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
He lived like us in form and dress,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
Without our taint of wickedness.  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
He came our souls to purify,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
And bring us safe to bliss on high  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
Therefore let us with one accord,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
On this His Birthday praise the Lord!  
Allelujah! Allelujah!
