Good times they come and they go  
Seems it's always been that way to me  
And sometimes the feelings show  
But it's not the way you want it to be  
Love is more than holding on  
And it's never too long  
Before I've gotta be free  
  
Well I know it, I do know it now  
I learned a long time ago  
  
  
CHORUS  
Love is hard to find  
Love is hard to find, yeah  
Love is hard to find  
Love is hard to find  
  
  
Now love can last forever  
And baby that's a long long time  
When it comes, tomorrow can wait  
You don't live in the past  
Ya just leave it behind  
  
  
Well I know it, I do know by now  
I learned a long time ago  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
  
Oh yeah  
Now I know it, I do know by now  
I learned a long time ago  
  
  
CHORUS
