You bought your smile on a corner  
You paint a pretty painting, you did.  
You paint yourself in a picture  
As you deny the kind of person you've been  
  
You get what you feel, what you wish to be  
You can't live sarcastic sincenerity  
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine  
You get what you feel, you get what you feel  
  
I gave you everything, you threw it away.  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
  
Come on!  
  
You pop right in to the moment,  
You paint a pretty painting, you did.  
You never noticed how broken  
As you deny the kind of person you've been  
  
You get what you feel, what you wish to be  
You can't live sarcastic sincenerity  
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine  
You get what you feel, you get what you feel  
  
I gave you everything, you threw it away.  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
  
You kneel to pray,  
Live life on your knees embrace the disease.  
Start to pull in as you start to choke, your life begins.  
  
You put me out! Like a cigarette!  
  
I gave you everything, you threw it away.  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.  
Love like a cancer, still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette.
