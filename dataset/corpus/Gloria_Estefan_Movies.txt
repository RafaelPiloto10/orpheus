Make pretend like in the movies  
And do another dig in the dark, c'mon  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Maybe you can be like Rambo  
And give me a tank o' lines  
(Squeeze baby, squeeze baby, squeeze)  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Lights, camera, action, quiet on the set, oh  
And I give you a performance you won't forget  
Make pretend like in the movies  
I'll be Scarlet and you'll be Clark, do it  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
You can be my macho, macho, so don't be afraid to start  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Lights, camera, action  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Make pretend like in the movies  
And I'll be your Hollywood star  
Direct me, do anything to me  
Come on, we'll make up some lines  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Make pretend like in the movies  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Let's do another dig in the dark  
(Squeeze baby, squeeze baby, squeeze)  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Oh, do anything to me  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
(Please baby, please baby, please)  
Don't be afraid to start  
Squeeze baby, squeeze baby, squeeze  
Squeeze baby, squeeze baby, squeeze  
Squeeze baby, squeeze baby, squeeze  
...
