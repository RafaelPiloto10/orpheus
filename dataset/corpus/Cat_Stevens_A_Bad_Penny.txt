Oh don't say those same idle lies  
I've heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Won't buy no more  
  
Oh no don't use  
Those same weeping eyes  
Ill wipe them no more  
I didn't want to have to be cruel  
But the truth must be said  
And you ain't heard enough  
  
Oh it was not so long ago  
Since you wandered out of here  
To become a silver model  
Of a city on the air  
So don't choke me with your lies  
Because this man has open eyes  
And I can see  
I can see I can tell  
  
I had it enough  
All those sneaky bars and smart parties  
Had enough  
All those sweet friends and lovers  
I've I've had enough  
All those lonely rooms  
And blank faces  
Had enough  
And I want you I want you no more  
I want you I want you no more  
  
Oh don't say those same idle lies  
I've heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Won't buy no more
