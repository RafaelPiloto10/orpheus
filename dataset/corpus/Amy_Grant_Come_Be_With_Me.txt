Baby this life can break your heart  
Everyone hurts to some degree  
But while this world is fallin' apart  
Why don't you come be with me?  
Don't you know that night can be so cold  
When you're without the one you need?  
How much longer do I have to go  
Waiting for you? Come be with me  
Love can be so simple  
When you let it flow  
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart  
Send it from your soul  
Look up at the stars burnin' bright  
Listen to the wind whisper sweet  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
Why don't you come be with me?  
(Ooh ooh ooh)  
Love can be so simple  
When you let it flow  
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart  
Send it from your soul  
Look up at the stars burnin' bright  
Listen to the wind whisper sweet  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
(Know the moment's right)  
Why don't you come be with me?  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
(Why?)  
Why don't you come be with me?
