The dead leaves of autumn  
That cling so desperately  
Must fly before the cold October winds  
Their simple lives have ended  
Must they be born to die again  
  
Oh may the light of freedom shine  
For all the world to see  
And peace and joy to all mankind  
Through all the years to be  
  
For soon the leaves will die  
And the long hard wind will blow  
May this world find a resting place  
Where the peaceful waters flow
