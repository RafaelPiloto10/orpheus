[Chorus]  
I like me,  
Yo, you like?  
Cause I like me  
Do you like me?  
See I like me  
Cause he like me  
God likes me  
You, you don't like me?  
You, you don't like me?  
  
Short, big nose, big lips  
Kinda st- st- stutter but, I never trip  
Got my daddy's swagger and I walk with a limp  
Got a hot wife, no need to be a pimp  
Never been cute, never been fly  
Since I been changed got that twinkle in my eye  
Got my grill fixed, now I smile when I speak  
Tell me who that is, that's the Jesus freak, it's ya boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just smile, I'm so content  
And I ain't even got yellow stones on my wrist  
I hear the world I'm supposed to be rich  
Bud I don't but that, man, I don't go with the trends  
Go the whole mile, lose or win  
I hope that's the impression that the Cd's give  
I'm more concerned about how they see me live  
Than trying to get a house on MTV cribs  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the light fade, I know that you see  
More than my swagger, But it's you in me  
From the storefront church to the packed out floors  
They want an autograph but I'd rather give 'em yours  
Ya ink don't fade, the crowd wants more  
The king's on stage, the final encore  
Can't believe it's, me now I'm chillin' backstage  
Big nose, big lips, gon' get ya hands raised  
  
I like me,  
Yo, you like?  
Cause I like me  
Do you like me?  
See I like me  
Cause he like me  
God likes me
