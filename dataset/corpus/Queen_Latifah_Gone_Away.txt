I try to reason and tell myself you'll return  
But you are gone and I know, I know, I know you're gone  
You were mine for only a minute  
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it  
  
You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind  
You're not gonna stay  
But I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby  
I lost you, baby, you were gone  
  
Forgive and forget it that's not what I'll ask you to do  
'Cause I want you back, yeah  
You know, you know I want you back  
And in concluding my mental discussion  
I found I lost my prized possession  
  
You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind  
You're not gonna stay  
And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby  
I lost you, baby, you were gone  
  
You were mine for only a minute  
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it  
  
You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind  
You're not gonna stay  
And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby  
I lost you, baby and you were gone  
  
Lie, lies I told you baby  
I never meant to say  
  
But a desperate mind  
Does a desperate thing baby  
I can't loose you  
I do whatever I got to do  
  
I never loved like this before  
I don't mean to be so silly  
Such a little girl sometimes  
I really want to be your woman  
I just...  
  
It gets so heavy baby...  
It gets so heavy  
And I just want you...  
I just want you to think about  
Don't let me go
