GIMME SHELTER  
WRITERS MICK JAGGER, KEITH RICHARDS  
Oh, a storm is threatening My very life today If I don't get some shelter Oh
yeah, I'm gonna fade away War, children, it's just a shot away It's just a
shot away War, children, it's just a shot away It's just a shot away Ooh, see
the fire is sweeping Our very street today Burns like a red coal carpet Mad
bull lost its way War, children, it's just a shot away It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away It's just a shot away Rape, murder! It's
just a shot away (2x) Rape, murder! It's just a shot away (2x) Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away (2x) The floods is threatening My very life today Give,
give shelter Or I'm gonna fade away War, children, it's just a shot away It's
just a shot away (4x) I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away It's just
a kiss away (4x) Kiss away, kiss away
