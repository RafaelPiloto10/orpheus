Well, I'm a jitterbug boy, by the shoe-shine  
Resting on my laurels and my hardys too  
Life of Riley on a swing shift, gears follow my drift  
Once upon a time I was in show-biz too  
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers playing at Ebbets Field  
Seen the Kentucky Derby too  
It's fast women, slow horses, unreliable sources,  
And I'm holding up the lamp-post if you want to know  
I've seen the Wabash Cannonball, buddy, I've done it all  
Cause I slept with the lions and Marilyn Monroe,  
Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane  
Fought Rocky Marciano, played Minnesota Fats,  
Burned hundred-dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew  
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong, what's that old song?  
I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows  
So you ask me what I'm doing here holding up the lamp-post,  
Flipping this quarter, trying to make up my mind  
And if it's heads I go to Tennessee, and tails I buy a drink,  
If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you  
(scat)
