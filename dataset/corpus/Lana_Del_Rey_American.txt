Play house, put my favorite record on  
Get down, get your crystal method on  
You were like dark tan driving round the city  
Flirting with the girls like you're so pretty  
Springsteen is the king don't you think  
I was like, "hell yeah that guy can sing"  
  
Like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa  
  
You make me crazy, you make me wild.  
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child.  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young, be dope be proud.  
Like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now.  
LA, I don't even have to fake it now.  
You're like so sick, everybody said it  
You're way ahead of the trend ge-get it.  
Elvis is the best, hell yes.  
Honey put on that party dress  
  
Like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa  
  
You make me crazy, you make me wild.  
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child.  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young, be dope be proud.  
Like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Everybody wants to go fast but they cant compare  
I don't really want the rest, only you can take me there  
I don't eve know what I'm saying but I'm praying for you  
  
You make me crazy, you make me wild.  
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child.  
Your skin so golden brown  
Be young, be dope be proud.  
Like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, like an American.
