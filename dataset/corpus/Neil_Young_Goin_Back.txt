In a foreign land  
There were creatures at play  
Running hand in hand  
Leading nowhere to stay  
Driven to the mountains high  
They were sunken in the cities deep  
Livin' in my sleep.  
  
I feel like goin' back  
Back where there's nowhere to stay  
When fire fills the sky  
I'll still remember that day  
These rocks I'm climbin' down  
Have already left the ground  
Careening through space.  
  
I used to build these buildings  
I used to walk next to you  
Their shadows tore us apart  
And now we do what we do  
Driven to the mountains high  
Sunken in the cities deep  
Livin' in our sleep.  
  
I feel like goin' back  
Back where there's nowhere to stay.
