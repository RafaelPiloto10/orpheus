Woke up with Cotton Mouth  
  
Couldn't speak  
My tongue was weak  
From Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley  
Oh I love them mountain thighs  
  
And a pizza pie before my eyes  
But before I taste them juices  
I make sure this Sally douches  
But she's not the only one

But yo you know that I'm most happy
