Show me the meaning of being lonely  
So many words for the broken heart  
It's hard to see in a crimson love  
So hard to breathe  
Walk with me and maybe  
Nights of light so soon become  
Wild and free, I could feel the sun  
Your every wish will be done  
They tell me  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
Life goes on as it never ends  
Eyes of stone observe the trends  
They never say, forever gaze, if only  
Guilty roads to an endless love  
There's no control, are you with me now?  
Your every wish will be done  
They tell me  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go  
Surrender my heart, body and soul  
How can it be you're asking me  
To feel the things you never show?  
Tell me why can't I be there where you are  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart
