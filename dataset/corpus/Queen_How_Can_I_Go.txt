(Freddie)  
When all the salt is taken from the sea  
I stand dethroned  
I'm naked and I plea  
The way your finger points so solidly  
Is anybody there to believe in me  
To hear my plea  
And take care of me  
[Chorus:]  
How can I go on  
From day to day  
Who can make me strong  
In every way  
Where can I be safe  
Where can I belong  
In this great big world  
Of sadness  
How can I forget  
Those beautiful dreams that we shared  
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found  
How can I go on  
(Monserrat)  
Sometimes I start to crawl  
But in my eyes  
I cannot see  
When people fly by me  
I hide myself down near the ground  
Is anybody there  
To look for me  
(Freddie)  
La-da-da-da-da precious love  
Hear my plea-yeah!  
[Chorus:]  
How can I go on  
From day to day  
Who can make me strong  
In every way  
Where can I be safe  
Where can I belong  
In this great big world  
Of sadness  
How can I forget  
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
