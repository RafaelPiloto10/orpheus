Sweet woman are you feeling right  
What was it that you did last night  
You made me crazy you made me fly  
I can't forget the hungry look in your eye  
Ooh what's the matter with me?  
I'm just a runner I was born free  
But since I met you I can't leave you alone  
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home  
  
Keep it warm rat the place by your side  
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride  
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone  
Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is coming home  
  
D'you hear the rumour that is going around  
Say I'm ruined 'cause I've settled down  
It's not true well maybe half and half  
You know I love you but I still like a laugh  
Ooh I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first time  
Sweet woman I can't stay for long but everybody will be prove wrong  
  
I'm like a gypsy I need to roam  
But don't worry I'll be coming home  
I need the danger I need the thrill  
I need to know what is over each hill  
Ooh I'm a different man I'm still running but you understand  
Since I met you I can't leave you alone  
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home
