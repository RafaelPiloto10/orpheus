Maybe one breath away  
I'll find the words to say  
I'll sit and light the bong  
I'll hold my hit in real long  
  
I don't know if I can go up inside of you tonite  
Oh Mary baby, please don't fuss and fight  
  
You've heard the line before  
Mary, baby, please don't think I'm a whore  
If you come home with me  
Turn off the lights lock up the door and start gettin' busy  
  
I don't know if I can go so far up inside you tonite  
Mary, baby, I could do it right  
  
When we got to her pad  
Mary, baby, started callin' me her dad  
As she gave me head  
We could not find the damn bed  
  
Fifteen years old plus one  
Hotter than a microwave oven  
  
Mary, baby, daddy is comin' home
