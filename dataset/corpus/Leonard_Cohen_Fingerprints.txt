I touched you once too often  
Now I don't know who I am  
My fingerprints were missing  
When I wiped away the jam  
Yes I called my fingerprints all night  
But they don't seem to care  
The last time that I saw them  
They were leafing through your hair  
  
Fingerprints, fingerprints  
Where are you now my fingerprints?  
  
Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning  
So I emptied out your drawer  
A hundred thousand fingerprints  
They floated to the floor  
  
You know you hardly stopped to pick them up  
You don't care what you lose  
Ah you don't even seem to know  
Whose fingerprints are whose  
  
Fingerprints, fingerprints  
Where are you now my fingerprints?  
  
And now you want to marry me  
You want to take me down the aisle  
You want to throw confetti fingerprints  
You know that's not my style  
  
O sure I'd like to marry you  
But I can't face the dawn  
With any girl who knew me  
When my fingerprints were on  
  
Fingerprints, fingerprints  
Where are you now my fingerprints?  
  
Fingerprints, oh fingerprints  
Where are you now my fingerprints?
