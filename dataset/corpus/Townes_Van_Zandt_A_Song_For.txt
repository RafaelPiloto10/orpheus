Ribbons of love  
Please keep me true sane  
Until I reach home on the morrow  
Never never to wander again  
I'm weak and I'm weary of sorrow  
  
London to Dublin  
Australia to Perth  
I gazed at your sky  
I tasted your earth  
Sung out my heart  
For what it was worth  
Never again shall I ramble  
  
There's nowhere left  
In this world where to go  
My arms, my legs they're a-tremblin'  
Thoughts both clouded and blue as the sky  
Not even worth the rememberin'  
  
Now as I stumble  
And reel to my bed  
All that I've done  
All that I've said  
Means nothin' to me  
I'd soon as be dead  
All of this world be forgotten  
  
No words of comfort  
No words of advice  
Nothin' to offer a stranger  
Gone the love, gone the spite  
It just doesn't matter no longer  
  
My sky's getting far  
The ground's gettin' close  
My self goin' crazy  
The way that it does  
I'll lie on my pillow  
And sleep if I must  
Too late to wish I'd been stronger  
Too late to wish I'd been stronger
