Every time I think of you  
My heart starts movin' like a freight train  
And having you is tearing me apart  
I don't really need the pain, no  
  
Sometimes I feel like leavin' for good  
But I'm a fool who wouldn't leave you  
Even if I could  
  
[Chorus]  
(Can't hold on, can't let go)  
Can't hold on, can't let go  
(Can't hold on, can't let go)  
I can't hold on, I can't let go  
  
Every time you touch me, well you know  
I feel the blood rushing through my veins  
Girl you mean so much to me, that's the reason  
Why you're driving me insane  
  
Oh, every night I'm losin' too much sleep  
I can't give up, 'cause now I'm in too deep with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't live with you, I can't live without you  
I still don't know just what I'm going to do about you  
Heart to heart, I'd never run away  
It's time to part, but I can't say good-bye  
  
I love you so much(can't hold on)  
Need you so much(can't let go)  
But you're tearing me apart(can't hold on)  
Oh(can't let go)can't let go  
(Can't hold on)can't let go  
(Can't let go)oh no no
