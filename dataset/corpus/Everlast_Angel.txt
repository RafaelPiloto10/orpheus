I'm gon' find me a woman that's real  
I'm gon' find me a woman that's strong  
I'm gon' find me a woman that's oh so true  
I got a pedestal to put her on  
I found me a girl, she's sweet as good be  
And everything in her world revolved all around me  
I had a chance to make her mine but I was too blind to see  
And now I got to let her go and pray she comes back to me  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again  
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
I'm gon' find me a woman that's young  
I'm gon' find me a woman that's pretty  
I'm gon' find me a woman that swears I'm the one  
And I'm a try not to treat her shitty  
Girl I been drinkin' ever since you've been gone  
And I been thinkin' maybe that I was wrong  
You been holdin' out for way too long  
I get this feeling you don't want to belong  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again  
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
I'm gon' find me a woman that's tough  
I'm gon' find me a woman that's loyal  
I'm gon' find me a woman that say she got enough  
And that's one I'm gonna spoilt  
Well I've been waitin' such a very long time  
My heart's gon' break girl if I don't make you mine  
What's past is past, what's done I cannot rewind  
All said and done girl, so you're one of a kind  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again  
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend  
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again  
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again  
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend
