All the boys are wearing their utility drag  
The girls slip identikits from their utility bags  
Some refugees from suburbia are laughing  
Examining each other's gags  
Vibrate on sulphate when it gets late  
And their velocity begins to sag  
Chorus:  
And it goes on all night, all night  
And it goes on and on, the artificial life  
Mary Mary got so confused  
About the fusion game, what a game  
Blunked on booze, she talks like a newsreel  
She'll take up any kind of bleak exchange  
She turned to perfection once  
But realized she'd only turned to pain  
She ran through divine light, chemicals, Warhol, scientology, her own sex  
Before she turned away  
(Chorus)  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
Stranger still  
I should have left here years ago  
But my imagination won't tell me how  
This whirlpool's got such seductive furniture  
It's so pleasant getting drowned  
So we drink and sink and talk and stalk  
With interchangeable enemies and friends  
Trying on each other's skins  
While we're dying to be born again.  
(Chorus)
