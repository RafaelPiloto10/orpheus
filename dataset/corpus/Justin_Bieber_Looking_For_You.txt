[Intro:]  
Takeoff- Guala!  
Bieber - What's up Migos?  
Quavo - What up jb, it's time to go to the club,  
Time to pull those toys out man - let's do it  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Hey where the party at? Let's go  
Where the swag? Let's roll  
Yea, everywhere I go, them girls follow  
Na, na, na, na  
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight  
As soon as I walk in the door  
[?]  
If I didn't know I need you for sure  
  
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]  
Tonight might be the night  
You might mess around and fall in love  
And I might be the guy  
I don't want to make you fall in love with me  
Girl, what's your name, I'm happy that you came  
I'm the man in this, stick with me, I can't love  
Everywhere around the world  
I'll be looking for you  
  
[Hook: Quavo]  
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?  
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker  
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it  
It ain't a problem, baby girl when you're with it  
Tell me what you wanna do, would you make a move now?  
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feeling  
(Look at her face)  
Girl ain't gotta say anymore  
(Say no more)  
Need to know I ain't playing  
(I ain't playing)  
Baby what are we waiting for?  
  
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]  
Tonight might be the night  
You might mess around and fall in love  
And I might be the guy  
I don't want to make you fall in love with me  
Girl, what's your name, I'm happy that you came  
I'm the man in this, stick with me, I can't love  
Everywhere around the world  
I'll be looking for you  
  
[Hook: Quavo]  
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?  
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker  
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop  
  
[Verse 3: Quavo]  
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me  
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 B-T  
I asked her what's her name - got the note she said Hammer  
On the way to the mattress, said she loved the Panamera  
In the trap with J-B with my phone chirpin' like beepers  
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae in the pot when I beat it  
Take her across the country, I got plugs on the Visa  
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him  
  
[Verse 4: Takeoff]  
He never seen a nigga like me  
Hoppin' out the Chevy, step up with the minks, gold chain, Mr. T  
In the summer, with the beach, with the hummer, with the leather seat  
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I bet they watching me  
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli  
Mansion out in Beverly, your bitch calling me call me your majesty  
  
[Verse 5: Offset]  
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage  
I run to the money like Forrest  
My life is historic  
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit  
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon  
I watch her like a telescope  
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil Terrio  
I got your bitch, she watching me like Tyler Perry shows  
I'm young and always riding in a Phantom Ghost  
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo  
  
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]  
Tonight might be the night  
You might mess around and fall in love  
And I might be the guy  
I don't want to make you fall in love with me  
Girl, what's your name, I'm happy that you came  
I'm the man in this, stick with me, I can't love  
Everywhere around the world  
I'll be looking for you  
  
[Hook: Quavo]  
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?  
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker  
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop
