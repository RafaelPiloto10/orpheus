Watching the time go and feeling belief grow  
Rise above the obstacles  
People beseech me but they'll never teach me  
Things that I already know (I know)  
  
Dreams that have shattered may not have mattered  
Take another point of view  
Doubts will arise though like chasing a rainbow  
I can tell a thing or two (That's true)  
  
You've got to believe in yourself or no one  
Will believe in you  
Imagination like a bird on the wing  
Flying, free for you to use (O.K. baby)  
  
I can't believe they stop and stare  
And point their fingers doubting me  
Their disbelief suppresses them  
But they're not blind it's just that they won't see  
  
I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver  
Mountains move before my eyes  
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout  
Speculation of the wise
