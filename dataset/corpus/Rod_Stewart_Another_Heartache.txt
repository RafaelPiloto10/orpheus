I told you once I'm a jealous man  
But you never want to listen to who I am  
We're divided, completely out of touch  
I guess that's why we seem to fight so much  
  
Believe me darling this ain't no game  
If you think I'll be your fool  
You better think again  
I know you love me  
It just ain't right  
I'm sick and tired of fighting  
with you every night  
  
You say you don't want to hurt me  
But you're doing things I can't explain  
Oh baby, why don't you leave me  
Because I know you'll never change  
  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
Something I'm getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
But one day soon  
And it won't be long  
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
  
I'll find a honey to take a chance  
And roll that dice into my past  
She'll cover me for a little while  
And show me love ain't out of style  
  
I don't care how long it takes  
My heart's in the hands of fate  
Oh God I ain't asking much  
Just a woman that I can trust  
  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
Something I'm getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
Oh but one day soon  
And it won't be long  
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
  
I want to love that's strong and real  
I gotta know just how it feels  
Somebody to share my life  
To hold onto through the night  
  
It's only another heartache  
Nothing to worry about  
Something I'm getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
  
It's only another heartache  
Nothing to worry about  
It's only another heartache  
Nothing to worry Heartache
