On behalf of her love  
She no longer sleeps  
Life had no longer meaning  
Nothing to make her stay  
She sold her soul away  
  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
  
After the night he died  
I wept my tears until they dried  
But the pain stayed the same  
I didn't want him to die all in vain  
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time  
I'll make them bleed down at my feed  
  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
  
Sometimes I wonder  
Could I have known  
About their true intentions  
As the pain stayed the same  
I'm going to haunt them down all the way  
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time  
One by one they were surprised  
  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed
