Street is like a jungle, so call the police  
Following the herd down to Greece on holiday  
Love in the nineties is paranoid  
On sunny beaches take your chances, looking for  
  
Girls, who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do  
Boys like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys  
Always should be someone you really love  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Avoiding all work 'cause there's none available  
Like battery thinkers count your thoughts  
On one, two, three, four, five fingers  
  
Nothing is wasted only reproduced  
You get nasty blisters, du bist sehr schoen

Girls, who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do  
Boys like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys  
Always should be someone you really love  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Girls, who are boys, who like boys to be girls, who do  
Boys like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys  
Always should be someone you really love

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Looking for  
Girls, boys, boys, girls  
Boys, girls, girls, boys  
Always should be someone you really love
