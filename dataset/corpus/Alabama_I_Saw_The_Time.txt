I saw the time  
When every baby that was born  
Was wanted and had a place to stay warm  
And when the farmers could exist  
To feed the hungry in our midst  
I saw the time  
  
When the poor could still have pride  
And hard work paid off in time  
I saw the time  
When the homeless had a home  
And the old could carry on  
I saw the time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When special kids got a chance  
And handicapped could advance  
I saw the time  
When we walked the streets without risk  
And families still prayed and hugged and kissed  
  
I saw the time  
When nature was so clean  
We could eat from the field and streams  
I saw the time  
And when the bombs would not explode  
And all the people got to vote  
I saw the time, I saw that time  
  
Oh, I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When we went to the moon  
And disaster struck too soon  
I saw that time  
When little Samantha Smith was so brave  
And made that grin and call  
  
And when the Bears' Vincent Woody  
Paced the sidelines and coached football  
When John, George and Martin walked around  
(I saw the time)  
When John, Paul, George and Ringo  
Brought the sound  
  
When everybody held hands  
And the children smiled, mama's and daddy?s smiled  
Grandma?s and Grandpa?s smiled, and God smiled  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, whoa, I saw the time
