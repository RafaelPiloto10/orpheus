You could have given me a million reasons why  
But it wouldn't change a thing  
You said it all when you said goodbye  
And you took off your wedding ring  
  
I've been tryin' to get over you  
I've been spending time alone  
I've been tryin' to get over you  
But it'll take dyin' to get it done  
  
All my friends keep tryin' to fix me up  
They say I need somebody new  
When it comes to love, I've all but given up  
'Cause life don't mean nothin' without you  
  
I've been tryin' to get over you  
I've been spending time alone  
I've been tryin' to get over you  
But it'll take dyin' to get it done
