When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind  
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind  
My head is in a spin since she left me behind  
I pass a million people I can't tell who I meet  
I pass a million people don't know tell who I meet  
Cause my eyes are full of tears where can my baby be (make it son)  
I went to see a gypsy and I had my fortune read  
I went to see a gypsy had my fortune read  
Then I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said (what she said
honey)  
Now I can tell you people the news was not so good  
Now I can you people the news was not so good  
She said your baby's done and quit you this time she's gone for good
