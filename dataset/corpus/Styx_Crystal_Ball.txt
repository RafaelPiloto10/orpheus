I used to like to walk the straight and narrow line  
I used to think that everything was fine  
Sometimes I'd like to sit and gaze for days through sleepless dreams  
All alone and trapped in time  
All alone and trapped in time  
  
I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me  
Or am I even in it's mind at all  
Perhaps I'll get a chance to look ahead and see  
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball  
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball  
  
Tell me, tell me where I'm going  
I don't know where I've been  
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me  
And then tell me again  
My heart is breaking, my body's aching  
And I don't know where to go  
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me  
I've just got to know  
  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I need to know  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I've got to know  
Crystal ball  
  
If you should see me walking  
Through your dreams at night  
Would you please direct me  
Where I ought to be  
I've been looking for a crystal ball  
To shed the light  
To find a future in me  
To find a future in me  
  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I need to know  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I've got to know  
Crystal ball
