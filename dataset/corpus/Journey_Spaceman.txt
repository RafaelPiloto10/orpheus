Don't be so wise, I was born to fly  
Not without a place in the wind  
Walked off a cliff, then I closed my eyes  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman  
  
Don't need no feathers, I don't need no twine,  
I'm all together in my body and my mind,  
Not supernatural, just a human combine,  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman!  
  
Can't see a castle, I don't need a sleigh,  
I brought my wings, no, not today  
I'm a cosmopolitan, right-handed wingless man  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman.
