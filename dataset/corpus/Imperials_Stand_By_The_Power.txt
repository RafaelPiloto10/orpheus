There is a power,  
Absolute authority that you possess  
For all who receive him,  
Those who will just say "yes"  
Wake up!  
It's time for you to realize just who you are  
You're no more a stranger,  
You are a shinning star  
  
Stand by the power,  
The power of his light  
Now is the hour  
For you to stand by the power  
  
Greater, stronger that any strength the world can find  
Greater than light  
Shinning from deep inside  
Rejoice! Lift your voice for victory already won  
Eternal champions,  
Power to overcome  
  
Stand by the power,  
The power of his light  
Now is the hour  
For you to stand by the power  
  
Stand by the power, power of his light  
Now is the hour for you to stand by,  
Stand by, stand by the power.
