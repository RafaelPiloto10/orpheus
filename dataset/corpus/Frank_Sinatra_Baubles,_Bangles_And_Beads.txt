Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing, jinga-linga  
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads  
Sparkles, spangles, your heart will sing, singa-linga  
Wearin' baubles, bangles and beads  
  
You'll glitter and gleam so  
Make somebody dream so that  
  
Some day he may buy you a ring, ringa-linga  
I've heard that's where it leads  
Wearin' baubles, bangles, and beads  
  
Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing, jinga-linga  
Baubles, bangles, all those bright, shiny beads  
Sparkles, spangles, your heart will sing, singa-linga  
Wearin' baubles, bangles, and beads  
  
You'll, you'll glitter and gleam so  
You're gonna make somebody dream so that  
  
Some day he may, he may buy you a ring, ringa-linga  
I've heard that that's where it leads  
If you're wearin' baubles bangles and them cool, cool beads
