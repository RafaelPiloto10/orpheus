Feeling alone but we are here  
Paying the toll for our little world  
Days like these seem to take some time  
When they're over, you will find  
  
Wait for you, see you through  
It's what we've known all this time  
We're taking you to break their rules  
It's what we've done all the while  
  
Put you in this place to change your mind  
Take away things that were your life  
After they've made their example of you  
Their fun is over and you are through  
  
Wait for you, see you through  
It's what we've known all this time  
We're taking you to break their rules  
It's what we've done all the while  
  
Feeling alone but we are here  
Paying the toll for our little world  
Days like these seem to take some time  
When they're over, you will be fine
