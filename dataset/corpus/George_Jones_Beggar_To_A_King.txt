I had sunk as low as a man could go  
The world had turned me down  
Then you picked me up and you kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king.  
  
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back  
And you gave me your love to keep me warm  
Yes, you picked me up and you kissed me sweet  
And changed a beggar into a king.  
  
I had walked the streets with my head bowed low  
The sun for me would never shine  
Then you came along into my life  
And changed a beggar into a king.  
  
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back  
And you placed a crown on my head  
Yes, you picked me up and kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king.  
  
You changed a beggar into a king
