Key: C  
(C)There's no room in my (C7)heart for the (F)blues  
Love is (G7)satisfied to either win or (C)lose  
Darlin', if our pathways part, (C7)let there (F)be no broken hearts  
There's no (G7)room in my heart for the (C)blues  
There's no room in my life for a sigh  
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye  
Darlin', if our romance ends, let us part the best of friends  
There's no room in my heart for the blues  
There's no room in my memory for tears  
We'll let bygones be forgotten souvenirs  
If your hungry heart forgets, let there be no sad regrets  
There's no room in my heart for the blues  
There's no room in my life for a sigh  
We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye  
Darlin' if our romance ends let us be the best of friends  
There's no room in my heart for the blues
