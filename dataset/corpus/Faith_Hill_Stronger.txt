This is the window to my heart  
I just want you to be free  
There ain't no freedom where we are  
Ain't no wishes in these stars  
  
Ain't no reason to believe  
But don't worry baby  
Don't you worry  
Maybe this is what we need  
  
A little bruising, a little bleeding  
Some space that we can breathe in  
Some silence in between  
  
[Chorus]  
So cry for me baby, and I'll cry for you  
And we'll both break down and we'll both break through  
We'll find our way and we'll face the truth  
We both will be stronger  
And we'll lie down in our loneliness  
And wake up with our sad regrets  
Even though we don't know it yet  
We both will be stronger  
We both will be stronger  
  
I can't believe you're really gone now  
But I know it's for the best  
And I know that we weren't right  
But I still reach for you each night  
And man that hurts like hell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So Baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the window to my heart  
I just want us to be free  
Baby I'm sorry for the way things are  
Goodbye is always hard  
And we both will be stronger
