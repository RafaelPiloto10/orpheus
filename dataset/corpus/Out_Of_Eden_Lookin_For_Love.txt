[Chorus:]  
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places  
Just to find someone that can erase  
The hurt you feel if you could you'd get a potion  
The love of God it flows deeper than an ocean  
Lookin' for love you know that I can show you  
Cause what I got goes on and on and on  
Your heart is broken and you're wondering  
What you can do to ease the hurt and pain you feel  
You're letting these no ones get in closer  
Than they need to cause you're looking for love  
Oh, I got a feeling no one's told you  
No one's bothered at all to give you what you need  
So you're out searchin' for something to hold on to  
But you don't know it's right there if you'd only see  
On your own now, doing your own thing  
Say you don't need nobody's help to make it through  
(But you're really wasting your time) you're still lonely  
(And you know that you're gonna find) that you're only  
Left more empty than you were before, oh but I'm telling you  
Oh you don't have to look around  
Let me tell you 'bout the love that I have found  
Everything that our heart needs, it's just right here  
Right here waiting  
Oh you don't have to look no more  
Real love is knocking on your door  
Everything that your soul needs, it's just right here,  
Right here waiting for you  
[Bridge:]  
Oh my friend I'm telling you, I've been there myself a time or two  
When I was just running round, to find a place for my heart that  
Was beaten down  
There's something you need to see, the One who made you  
Love's you please believe  
He's all you need to get by, you know you're somebody so tell me why you're...  
(repeat chorus)
