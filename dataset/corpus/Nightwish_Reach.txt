Baptized with a perfect name  
The doubting one by heart  
Alone without himself  
  
War between him and the day  
Need someone to blame  
In the end, little he can do alone  
  
You believe but what you see  
You receive but what you give  
  
Reach for the hand held heart through life  
For the dancer to arrive  
Reach and catch me before I fall  
  
Apart from the wandering pack  
In this brief flight of time  
We reach for the ones whoever dare  
  
You believe but what you see  
You receive but what you give  
  
Reach for the hand held heart through life  
For the dancer to arrive  
Reach and catch me before I fall  
  
Reach for a friend whoever cares  
For someone whoever dares  
Reach to catch me when I fall  
  
Reaching for the doubting one by heart  
Hearing voices calling  
Catch the one who's falling  
  
Reach for the hand held heart through life  
For the dancer to arrive  
Reach and catch me before I fall  
  
Reach for a friend whoever cares  
For someone whoever dares  
Reach to catch me when I fall
