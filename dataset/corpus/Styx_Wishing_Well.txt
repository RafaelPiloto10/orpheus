Take off your hat, kick off your shoes  
I know you're not goin' anywhere  
Running around town singin' your blues  
You know you're not goin' anywhere  
You've always been a good friend of mine  
But you just keep I'm saying farewell  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well  
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself  
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?  
Put up a fight, you believe to be right  
And some day the sun will shine through  
You've always got somethin' to hide  
Somethin' you just can't tell  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is in your feet in the wishing well  
But I know what you're wishing for  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
You've always been a good friend of mine  
But you just keep I'm saying farewell  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is in your feet in the wishing well  
Wishing well  
Wishing well  
Wishing well  
...
