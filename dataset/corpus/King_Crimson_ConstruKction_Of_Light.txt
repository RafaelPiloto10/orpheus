Pain, day, sky  
Beauty, die, black, joy, love  
Empty, day, life, die, pain, passion, joy, black, day, hate, beauty, die,
life, joy, ache, empty, day, pain, die, love, passion, joy, black light  
  
And if God is dead, what am I?  
A fleck of dirt on the wing of a fly  
Hurtling to earth  
Through a hole in the sky  
  
And if Warhol's a genius, what am I?  
A speck of lint on the penis of an alien  
Buried in gelatin  
Beneath the sands of Venus  
  
Time, sun, hurt, trust, peace, dark, rage  
Sad, white, rain, sun, anger, hurt, soft,  
Trust, night, rage, rain, white, hope, dark,  
Sacred, sun, time, trust, hurt, rage, anger, rain, white light  
  
And if a bird can speak  
Who once was a dinosaur  
And a dog can dream  
Should it be implausible?  
That a man might supervise  
The construction of light  
  
Pain, day, sky, beauty, black, die, joy,  
Love, empty, time, sun, hurt, trust, peace, dark, rage, sad, white, rain,
hate,  
Anger, hope, sacred, passion, life, night,  
Ache, soft light
