I don't do the things that you do  
And I don't go the places that you go  
And I don't say the bad things that you say  
  
But I love you any ole way, darling  
I love you any ole way, now  
I love you any ole way  
But I want you to say that it's true  
  
Wherever you go darling I will go  
When you get there honey I will be there  
Just to hear the sweet words that you say  
It's I love you every way, now  
I love you any ole way, now, now  
I love you every way  
And I want you to say that it's true  
  
Sitting on my hutch  
Waiting for her to come  
So I can hold her  
Here in my arms  
Watching my watch  
As the time pass  
Wandering how long my love is going to last, now  
  
Baby one more time  
You're making me feel all right, oh, oh now  
  
Wherever you go darling I will go  
Whenever you get there I bet I will be there  
Just to hear the sweet words that you'll say  
  
Is I love you every way, now, now  
I love you any ole way, now  
I love you every way, now, now  
And I love you any ole way, now  
And I love you any ole way, now  
  
I'm just wanting you just more every day, now  
I'm just wanting you more and more every day  
And I'm just needing you and needing and needing you, ooh  
And I'm just wanting and wanting and wanting you more
