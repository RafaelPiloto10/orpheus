Walk the line  
It's not easy  
I must stand alone  
It's the kind of a life I've chosen  
Right or wrong  
I can feel  
Near me always  
Something to live up to  
Someone to depend upon  
When I have fallen from grace  
When I grow weak from the pace  
I can feel the breath of gentle wings on my face  
And when the world closes in around me  
Then my angel  
Will come and roll away the stone  
Like a hand reaching down from the heavens  
And when the darkness falls all around me  
Then my angel  
Will come and draw aside the veil  
I am safe in the arms of my angel  
Anywhere  
Anytime  
In my mind I know  
That a pair of sweet eyes is watching me  
Wherever I go  
Is it real?  
Am I dreaming?  
Sometimes I don't know  
But I want to believe it's so  
Let me dream on  
Is it profane or divine  
Am I insane? I feel fine  
I can close my eyes but I still see it shine
