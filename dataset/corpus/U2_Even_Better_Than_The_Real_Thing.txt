Give me one more chance  
And you'll be satisfied  
Give me two more chances  
You won't be denied  
  
Well my heart is where it's always been  
My head is somewhere in between  
Give me one more chance  
There will be a lover tonight  
  
(Check it out)  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
Give me one last chance  
And I'm gonna make you sing  
Give me half a chance  
To ride on the waves that you bring  
  
You're honey child to a swarm of bees  
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze  
Give me one last chance  
We'll slide down the surface of things  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
We're free to fly the crimson sky  
The sun won't melt our wings tonight  
  
Oh now  
Here she comes  
  
Take me higher  
Take me higher  
Can you take me higher?  
Will you take me higher?  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
  
Even better than the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
Even better than the real thing.
