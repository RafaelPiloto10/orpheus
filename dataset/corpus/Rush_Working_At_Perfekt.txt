Draw a line  
Strong and clear  
Make it bend to your will  
All the lines  
In a face  
So hard to make stand still  
  
'Til the flaws disappear  
'Til what's wrong disappears  
'Til all that's wrong will  
Disappear  
  
Working at perfekt  
Got me down on my knees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees  
  
All the colours of the day  
Have somehow disappeared  
All the colours of the universe  
Are closer than they appear  
  
Are not as close as they appear  
Are not as close as they appear  
Not as close as they appear  
  
Nothing is perfekt  
Certainly not me  
Success to failure  
Is just a matter of degrees  
Working at perfekt  
Got me down on my knees  
  
But when it's right  
It's right as rain  
And when it's right  
There is no pain  
And when it's right  
You start again  
  
Working at perfekt  
Got you down on your knees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees
