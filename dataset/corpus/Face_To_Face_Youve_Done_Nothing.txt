you don't know what you want to be  
you don't know what you want to do  
never going to amount to much of anything  
so what's the difference if you win or lose?  
well that's something  
well isn't that something  
you've done nothing wrong and it's never your fault  
you've done nothing  
  
don't care where your friends have gone  
because you never really needed them anyway  
never going to be exactly who you are  
because you try too hard to be just like them  
well that's something  
well isn't that something  
you've done nothing wrong and it's never your fault  
you've done nothing  
  
you've got brains in your head  
feet in your shoes  
you can steer yourself  
any way you choose  
you're on your own  
and you know what you know  
and it's up to you to decide where you'll go  
well that's something  
well isn't that something  
you've done nothing wrong and it's never your fault  
you've done nothing
