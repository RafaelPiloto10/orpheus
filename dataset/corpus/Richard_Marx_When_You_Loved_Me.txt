I'm back at the corner  
Where we said goodbye  
I turn and I see you  
But don't trust my eyes  
You look at me  
And I can't breathe  
  
Had every word perfect  
For when this day would come  
But standing here now  
I can't find even one  
All I want to say  
Is written on my face  
  
[Chorus]  
I close my eyes every time I wake up  
'Cause every little thing makes me think of  
When you loved me  
When you loved me  
And I don't really want to talk about the weather  
The truth is that I was better  
When you loved me  
When you loved me  
  
I'm sure that there's somewhere that you've got to go  
But give me one more minute  
One more memory to hold  
And wherever you're goin' to  
Take this with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I try to wish you away  
You're gone today but  
You'll be back tomorrow  
This lie  
That I call goodbye  
Won't let go  
Won't let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm back at the corner  
Where we said goodbye
