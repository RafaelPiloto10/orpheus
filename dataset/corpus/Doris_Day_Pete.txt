I've got a man, his name is Pe-ete  
He's awfully good and oh so sweet  
He's not the kind that you usually meet  
He loves me so-o and I love Pete  
A gal that I know loves a boy named Ji-im  
Though he treats her mean she still loves him  
And Sally loves Joe who's the kind that'll cheat  
Some men are like that but not my Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
'Cause I've got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial, he passed every te-est  
Whatever he does, he does his best  
I've got no complaints and my life is complete  
'Cause I've got a man whose name is Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
'Cause I've got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial, he passed every te-est  
Whatever he does, he does his best  
I've got no complaints and my life is complete  
'Cause I've got a ma-an, what a ma-an  
His name is Pete...
