Dear father I want you to see me now  
Dear father I really wish you could see me now  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
You were missing in the whole wide world  
I've been dreaming in this whole wide world  
Been surrounded by the whole wide world  
I've been shaking in this whole wide world  
Been taken by this whole wide world  
Dear Mother I want you to hear me now  
Dear Mother I really wish you  
Could hear me now  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
Love was missing in the whole wide world  
Whole wide world  
You was missing in the. whole wide world  
I was frightened by this whole wide world  
I've been hiding from the whole wide world  
I was fighting with the whole wide world  
I was slipping in the whole wide world  
Lost my grip in the whole wide world  
I've been tripping in the whole wide world  
Oh Brother
