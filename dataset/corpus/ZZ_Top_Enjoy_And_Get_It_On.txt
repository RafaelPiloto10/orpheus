Oh I'm makin' my way back home  
Least that's what I told her on the phone  
Been a while since I made her smile  
And I know she gonna dig my style  
Could you enjoy baby  
Really enjoy gettin' it on  
  
Could I get some pie ala mode  
When I come in off the road  
Do she still have her fightin' gear  
Just one look is gonna make it clear  
If she would enjoy baby  
Really enjoyed gettin' it on  
  
How does it feel holdin' me again  
She's holdin' on like it gonna never end  
Well I'm home thinkin' I should stay  
While I'm here just let me hear you say  
Say you enjoyed baby  
Really enjoyed gettin' it on
