Ooooh yeah, ohhhh, uh  
  
Well it's a simple thing  
A look, a laugh, a clover ring  
And all those little scenes, dreams are made of  
And it's evident that when my hopes and prayers are spent  
Well there she came and there I went  
  
Ohhh, someone makes it mistifying  
Baby, there's just no denying that every time we touch  
Heavenly it's so divine, but you know what just blows my mind  
Is the miracle of love, just an ordinary love  
Just and ordinary love  
  
It's just another day  
I kiss goodbye and I'm on my way  
Rushin through the maze right back to your arms  
And it's difficult, just a boy and just a girl  
Out on screen and around the world  
  
Ohhh, someone makes it mistifying  
Baby, there's just no denyingevery time we touch  
Heavenly it's so divine, but you know what just blows my mind  
Is the miracle of love, just an ordinary love  
Just and ordinary love, yeah, ohhh yeah  
  
Ooooh, someone makes it mistifying  
Baby, there's just no denying every time we touch  
Heavenly it's so divine, but you know what just blows my mind  
It's the miracle of love, just an ordinary love  
Just an ordinary love
