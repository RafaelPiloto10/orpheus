Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Everybody knows  
That baby's got new clothes  
  
But lately I've seen her  
Ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls  
She takes just like a woman  
  
She makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl  
Yes she does  
  
Yeah  
Queen Mary  
She's my friend  
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again  
  
Nobody has to guess  
That baby can't be blessed  
'Til she sees finally  
That she's like all the rest  
  
With her fog  
Her amphetamine  
And her pearls  
She takes just like a woman  
  
She makes love just like a woman  
And she aches just like a woman  
But she breaks just like a little girl  
It was raining from the first  
  
And I was dying of thirst  
So I came in here  
And your long time curse hurts  
But what's worse  
  
Is the pain in here  
I can't stay in here  
Ain't it clear  
That I just can't fit  
  
Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit  
When we meet again  
Introduced as friends  
Please don't let on that you knew me when  
  
I was hungry  
And it was your world all the way  
Ah, you fake just like a woman  
You make love just like a woman  
  
Then you ache just like a woman  
But you break just like a little girl  
Let me see through you baby  
Come on now  
  
Baby, you can break down yeah  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
  
Show me  
Show me baby  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman  
  
Yeah  
Just like a woman  
Just like a woman
