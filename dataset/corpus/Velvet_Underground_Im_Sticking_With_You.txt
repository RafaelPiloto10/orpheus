I'm sticking with you  
Cause I'm made out of glue  
Anything that you might do  
I'm gonna do too  
  
You held up a stage coach in the rain  
And I'm doing the same  
Saw you're hanging from a tree  
And I made believe it was me  
  
I'm sticking with you  
Cause I'm made out of glue  
Anything that you might do  
I'm gonna do too  
  
Some people go  
Into the stratosphere  
Soldiers fighting  
With the Cong  
  
But with you by my side  
I can do anything  
When we swing  
We hang past right or wrong  
  
I'll do anything for you  
Anything you want me too  
I'll do anything for you  
Oh I'm sticking with you  
Oh I'm sticking with you  
Oh I'm sticking with you
