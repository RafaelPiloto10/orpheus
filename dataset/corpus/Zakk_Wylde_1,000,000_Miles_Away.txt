Sailing across my ocean  
Sailing across my sea  
I fill it up with hope Lord  
I drown in empty misery  
  
Sailin' across my heaven  
Sailing across my star  
Until I find the voice I've been hearing in my head  
Forever couldn't be too far...yeah  
  
Oh it couldn't be to far  
Oh it couldn't be to far  
  
The cold wind blows  
Like a leaf on a tree  
I can feel myself fallin Lord  
I need your guiding hand to catch me  
When you hear yourself this song  
I hope it brings yourself a smile  
The times we had we thought would last forever  
But forever only lasts a little while  
Forever only lasts a little while...yeah  
  
Loneliness my friend  
I'll think about you every day  
As I sail into the light, a million miles away
