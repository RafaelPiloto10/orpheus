Cold light  
Hot night  
Be my heater be my lover  
And we could do it to each other  
  
Cold light  
Hot night  
Be my heater be my lover  
And we could do it to each other  
Go go go go go!  
  
Ride daddy ride  
Ride out the tide  
I'd rather die  
Then say goodbye  
And watch you go  
Go go go  
  
Ride daddy ride  
Ride out the tide  
I'd rather die  
Then say goodbye  
And watch you go  
Go go go  
  
Cold light  
Hot night  
Be my heater be my lover  
And we could do it to each other  
Yeah we could do it to each other  
Well like a sister and a brother  
Go go go go go!  
Go go go go go!  
  
Ride momma ride  
Ride out the tide  
I'd rather die  
Then say goodbye  
And watch you go  
Go go go
