Split, split in two  
Somethin' else  
Shed precious skin  
Save yourself  
Bleed afterbirth  
What you're worth  
Yes, yes, of course  
It's gonna hurt  
  
Nature is violent  
The nature of the beast is violent  
You know that, and someone else  
Another one that wasn't me, no  
  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
I can't believe I could never remember which one you are  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
  
Thrive, just become  
Your disease  
Leave them behind  
You are free  
Hey, what you want  
You deserve  
Yes, yes, of course  
This is gonna hurt  
  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
I can't believe I could never remember which one you are  
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart  
  
I just don't know anymore  
I just don't know anymore
