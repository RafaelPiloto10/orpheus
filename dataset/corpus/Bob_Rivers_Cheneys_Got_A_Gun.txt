Cheney's Got A Gun  
(Jamie's Got A Gun-Aerosmith)  
  
Dick Cheyney's got a gun  
Dick Cheyney's got a gun  
The safety's come undone  
Squinting in the Texas sun  
  
What did our leader do?  
Who'd he put a bullet through?  
  
They say when Cheyney goes to Texas  
You'll find him hunting fish and game  
His buddy had it coming 'cause  
When Cheyney's got a gun he's just  
Not that good at taking aim  
  
Cheyney's got a gun  
Dick Cheyney shot someone  
Cindy Sheehan better run  
Gotta watch her liberal buns  
  
Tell him that the war's not through  
He'll probably put a hole in you  
  
He tracked a little bitty birdie  
Hoping to blow out it's brains  
They say the spell that he gets under  
From double-barrelled thunder makes his  
Eyes bug out like he's insane  
  
Run away, run away from the Vice President Yeah Yeah Yeah  
Run away, run away, run from dick Chey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ney  
  
Dick Cheyney's got a gun  
The safety's come undone  
Cindy Sheehan better run  
He's a weapon of mass destruction  
Dick Cheyney shot someone
