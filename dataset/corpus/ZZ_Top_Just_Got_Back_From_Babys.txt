Now I just got back from baby's,  
We been rolling all night long.  
I said I just got back from baby's,  
We been rolling all night long.  
She come on likes and loves me,  
But I feel like something wrong.  
  
Now, sometimes I go see baby,  
And sometimes she come see me.  
I said, sometimes I go see baby,  
And sometimes baby come see me.  
I got a funny, funny feeling  
I'm not the only man she sees.  
  
Now, I just got back from baby's,  
Big white house on the hill.  
I said, I just got back from baby's,  
Big white house on the hill.  
If her loving don't get me,  
I know her husband will.
