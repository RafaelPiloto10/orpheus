For years we both have lived on pride, dear  
And we agree that love is gone  
Why, oh why do we keep tryin'  
A house without love is not a home.  
  
The love light in your eyes has faded  
And I'm contented just to roam  
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure  
A house without love is not a home.  
  
No matter where our footsteps wander  
I know we'll both be all alone  
With the pride that came between us  
A house without love is not a home.  
  
The simple things have gone forever  
We wanted wealth to call our own  
And now we've reached the hour of parting  
A house without love is not a home.
