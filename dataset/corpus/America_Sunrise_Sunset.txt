Sunrise sunset  
Can't sleep can't forget  
Thought I heard your footsteps  
Coming home to me  
  
Love comes, love grows  
Sure as the wind blows  
Like the single red rose  
You will have your day  
  
Now is the moment to come to your senses  
Tear down the walls and set fire to the fences  
Run away, run away  
  
L. A. Earthquake  
Midnight ground shake  
Somewhere in the heartache  
There is hope you'll see  
  
Now is the moment and now is forever  
Now is the time it will all come together  
Run, you gotta run  
  
Once it was only a question of giving  
Now we're destroying the life that we're living  
Run, you gotta run  
  
Run away, run away  
You gotta run away, run away  
  
Sunrise sunset  
Can't sleep can't forget  
Thought I heard your footsteps  
Coming home to me
