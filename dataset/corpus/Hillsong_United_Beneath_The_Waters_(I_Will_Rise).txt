This is my revelation  
Christ Jesus crucified  
Salvation through repentance  
At the cross on which He died  
  
Now hear my absolution  
Forgiveness for my sin  
And I sink beneath the waters  
That Christ was buried in  
  
[Chorus:]  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
  
I stand a new creation  
Baptized in blood and fire  
No fear of condemnation  
By faith I'm justified  
  
[Chorus:]  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
[X2]  
  
I rise as You are risen  
Declare Your rule and reign  
My life confess Your Lordship  
And glorify Your Name  
Your Word it stands eternal  
Your Kingdom knows no end  
Your praise goes on forever  
An on and on again  
  
No power can stand against You  
No curse assault Your throne  
No one can steal Your glory  
For it is Yours alone  
I stand to sing Your praises  
I stand to testify  
For I was dead in my sin  
  
[Chorus:]  
But now I rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
[X2]
