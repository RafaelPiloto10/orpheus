Chorus  
A message of love, right to your heart  
Comes from above, to make a new start  
To spark a new flame,  
That will ring the world round  
Playing destiny's game  
And creating her sound in a message  
Of love  
Tell all your friends, our time is here  
We're on our way, the message is clear  
We're an act of creation, now  
And forever  
We're a river of nations  
We're coming together in a message  
Of love  
Chorus  
Spirits of love, spirits of life  
Help us be strong, help us to do right  
Here is our chance, to heal the old scars  
Learn a new way to dance to the song of  
The stars  
With a message of love  
Chorus  
I hear the butterflies dreaming, in the  
Shimmering air  
I feel the power of life, a flowering  
Fire everywhere  
I sing the tree, and the dove the eagle,  
Fox and the hare  
The right to exist is our right, we  
All share  
It's a message of love  
Chorus  
When evening falls, focus your mind  
When spirits call let your body unwind  
And open your heart, and do it today  
And do what is right, and do not delay  
Because a message of love  
Chorus
