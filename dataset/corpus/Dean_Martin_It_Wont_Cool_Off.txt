The flame that we kindled hasn't dwindled at all  
It just keeps burning burning burning it won't cool off  
Your smile is the gold that leads it  
Your kiss is the coal that feeds it  
  
And keeps me yearning yearning it won't cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
We'll pity those who find it hard to warm up  
We've got a lovely furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it won't cool off  
And when a cloudy day begins to storm up  
We'll pity those who find it hard to warm up  
'Cause we got a knocked out furnace going for us glowing for us  
  
Burning burning and it won't cool off  
Burning burning and it won't cool off
