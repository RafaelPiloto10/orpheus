Oh, my love has no beginning  
And my love it has no end  
Always plus and always minus  
It never breaks, it never bends  
You can shape it any way you want  
You can turn it left or right  
Cause my love it comes in circles  
And it comes in black and white  
  
And the circle remains unbroken  
And the circle remains unbroken  
  
Bridge:  
Hope my love don't fade away  
(in my soul)  
Hope my love don't fade away  
(I don't want it to)  
Hope my love don't fade away  
(In my soul)  
Hope my love don't fade away  
  
Chorus:  
Circles have ups and downs  
Don't let them turn you 'round  
Round and round  
Round and round  
Circles, circles  
Don't let them bring you down  
Round and round  
Round and round  
  
There is ice, there's fire  
Always winter, always spring  
Cause my love is like a zero  
It is nothing and everything  
Oh, you know it's like the universe  
No matter how big or small  
It goes on and on forever  
It never drops, it never falls  
  
And forever remains unbroken  
And forever remains unbroken  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
(2X)
