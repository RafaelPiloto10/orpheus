As we journey along, on a life's wicked road  
So selfish are we, for silver and gold  
You can treasure your wealth, your diamonds and gold  
But my friends it won't save, your poor wicked soul  
For when God calls, from his home up on high  
To your earthly wealth, you must say goodbye  
Then it's useless to you, if you've strayed from the fold  
For my friend it won't save, your poor wicked soul  
The rich man like all, will be judged at that time  
But all of his wealth, will be left behind  
For no matter how much earthly wealth you get hold  
My friend it won't save, your poor wicked soul  
My friend it won't save, your poor wicked soul
