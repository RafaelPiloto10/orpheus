One day, you will be cared to realize  
By the look that's in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
How much I love you  
(Love you)  
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love  
(You'll lose a precious love)  
  
Somehow,these arms of mine cant let you go  
The touch of my hand baby should let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We go together like hand and glove  
Don't destroy our precious love,  
Somehow these arms of mine cant let you go  
The touch of my hand should let you know
