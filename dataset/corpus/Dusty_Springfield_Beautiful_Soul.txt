I wonder where you are, lovable lady  
I wonder what you're thinking, beautiful woman  
It seems like fog is settling in within your eyes  
And the weight of something is pulling your shoulders down  
  
Could it be you ask too much, lovable lady?  
From a world that's out of touch, beautiful woman  
So you're hammering at a door that will not open  
And your beautiful soul is weeping  
  
Better learn the way it goes  
Oh, better share the pain that shows  
You wanna transcend it in order to end it  
But your loneliness grows  
  
Ah, ha, do you hate yourself, lovable lady?  
Can I be of help, beautiful woman?  
Your silence is a wall between the two of us  
And my beautiful soul is weeping  
Oooooooooooh
