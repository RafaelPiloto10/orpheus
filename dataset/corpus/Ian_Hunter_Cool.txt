You might be a celebrity, everybody sits up and begs  
You might be the sexiest thing since God invented legs  
You might be a dictator, a dealer or a saint  
Cool is here to tell you when you're cool and when you ain't  
If you lose your cool, if you lose your cool, if your cool don't work  
If your cool gone fishin' you ain't nothing but a cool jerk  
Now you might be a Nazi, lookin' for a friend  
You might be a beginning, looking for an end  
Some folks go for the ice and snow, some like it Florida hot  
Cool is here to tell you what is cool and what is not  
If you lose your cool, if you lose your cool, if your cool don't work  
If your cool gone fishin' you ain't nothing but a cool jerk  
Or you can write a book about the money you took  
You can pose on the cover nude  
You can only flip on an ego trip, time'll do the cover on you  
But don't you ever cross me, dude  
'cause that ain't cool, that's an attitude  
I'm so cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool  
I'm so cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool  
I'm so cool, I'm so cool, cool  
I'm so cool, cool, I'm so cool, cool  
I ain't nobody [Incomprehensible]  
You might be a macho man, 50 million sit-ups a day  
Or you might be an expert with something important to say  
You might be an evangelist, livin' on the wages of sin  
Cool is here to tell you what is out and what is in  
If you lose your cool, if you lose your cool, if your cool don't work  
If your cool gone fishin' you ain't nothing but a cool jerk  
Well, if you lose your cool, if you lose your cool  
You ain't nothing but a cool jerk  
If you lose your cool, if you lose your cool  
You ain't nothing but a cool jerk  
If you lose your cool, if you lose your cool  
You ain't nothing but a cool jerk  
If you lose your cool, if you lose your cool  
You ain't nothing but a  
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool  
I'm cool, I'm cool, cool, cool
