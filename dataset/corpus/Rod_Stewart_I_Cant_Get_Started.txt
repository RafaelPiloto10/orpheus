I've flown around the world in a plane  
I've settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But I can't get started with you  
  
And at the golf course I'm under par  
And in Hollywood they want me to star  
I've got a house as a show place  
But I can't get no place with you  
  
You're so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you, scheme  
Just for the sight of you, dream  
Both day and night of you  
But what good does it do  
  
In nineteen ninety-nine, I sold short  
In England, I'm presented at court  
Yeah you've got me so downhearted  
'Cause I'll never get started with you  
  
You're so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you, scheme  
Just for the sight of you, dream  
Both day and night of you  
But what, what good does it do  
  
I've been consulted by Hilary C.  
And Tina Turner's had me to tea  
But now I'm brokenhearted  
'Cause I can't get started with you  
Yeah I'm brokenhearted  
'Cause I can't get started with you
