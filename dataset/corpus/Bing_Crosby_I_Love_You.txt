I love you  
Hums the April breeze.  
I love you  
Echo the hills.  
I love you  
The golden dawn agrees  
As once more she sees  
Daffodils.  
It's spring again  
And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melody.  
I love you,  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me.  
  
It's spring again  
And birds on the wing again  
Start to sing again  
The old melody.  
I love you,  
That's the song of songs  
And it all belongs  
To you and me.
