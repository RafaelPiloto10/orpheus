I used to think  
I had the answers to everything  
But now I know  
That life doesn't always go my way, yeah  
  
Feels like I'm caught in the middle  
That's when I realize  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
There is no need to protect me  
It's time that I  
Learn to face up to this on my own  
  
I've seen so much more than you know now  
So don't tell me to shut my eyes  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
But if you look at me closely  
Yeah, you will see it my eyes  
This girl will always find her way  
  
I'm not a girl  
(I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe)  
Not yet a woman  
(I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah)  
  
All I need is time  
(Oh, all I need is time)  
A moment that is mine  
(That is mine)  
While I'm in between  
  
And I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman, not now  
All I need is time  
(Is all I need)  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman
