Into Your courts I run with praises  
Flowing from my heart  
Every day I wake I sing Your song  
It's the anthem of my life  
  
I want to spend my days  
In Your presence, Lord  
Bowed before Your throne  
In the house of God  
Is where I find my peace  
It's where I find my  
  
Home is heaven  
One day Lord, I will live  
In Your courts, You'll find me  
In worship at Your feet  
Hide me now  
In the shadow of Your wings  
Where I will be  
Where I will be  
  
Your love is all I need  
So desperately I have sought Your face  
I know You hear my every cry  
And petition that I make  
  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure
