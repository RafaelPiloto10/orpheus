With The Paul Weston Orchestra  
  
Don't cry  
Don't cry  
Come on back in the house  
And don't cry  
  
Come on back in the house  
And get out  
From under that old  
Cold sky  
  
Don't weep  
Don't weep  
Come on back in the house  
Little sheep  
  
Come on back in the house  
For a smile of welcome and go  
To sleep  
  
Yes I know  
How you feel  
It's the wild runaway feeling  
You're hurt  
When you had the wrong dream  
And you wake with a start  
  
Well, don't cry  
Don't cry  
Come on back in the house  
And don't cry  
  
Come on back in the house  
And get out  
From under that old  
Cold sky  
  
And don't cry...  
And don't cry
