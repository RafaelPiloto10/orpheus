You will never be no good  
No you will never be no good  
D'you know what i'd do if I could  
Chop you up into firewood  
Because you have sinned far too many times  
You have sinned far too many times  
And you will pay for all your crimes  
You will never be no good  
Not not ever no good  
You know it's hard to sympathise  
You know it's hard to sympathise  
When you never tell nothing but lies  
And it's hard to sympathise  
You say you're born in the barrel of a gun  
Some say you're born in the barrel of a gun  
You were your mother's seventh son  
And no excuse could be a good enough one  
And don't you love her madly  
You want to be her daddy  
Well that won't do you no good  
You might just slip into the priesthood  
You will never be no good  
No you will never be no good  
D'you know what i'd do if I could  
And then we'd all receive a knighthood  
You'll never be no good
