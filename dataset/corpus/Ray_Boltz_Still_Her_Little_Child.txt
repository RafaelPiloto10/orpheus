Still Her Little Child  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
When she laid him in a manger  
He was still her little child  
In a city filled with strangers  
He was still her little child  
Though the inn was full  
And the night was cold  
She held Him close and smiled  
When she laid Him in a manger  
He was still her little child  
  
When the angels called Him Savior  
He was still her little child  
When the wise men gave Him treasures  
He was still her little child  
When the shepherds bowed before Him  
A star shone all the while  
When the angels called Him Savior  
He was still her little child  
  
When He grew in strength and wisdom  
He was still her little child  
When He spoke the people listened  
He was still her little child  
When He healed the lame and dying  
They would follow Him for miles  
And when he grew  
In strength and wisdom  
He was still her little child  
  
When the people turned against Him  
He was still her little child  
When they shouted crucify Him  
He was still her little child  
And when they nailed Him  
To a wooden cross  
Then we were reconciled  
When she held His broken body  
He was still her little child  
He was still her little child
