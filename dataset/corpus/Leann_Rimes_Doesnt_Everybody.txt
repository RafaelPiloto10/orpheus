You may have a tabloid life  
Pay for all your friend  
You may be a suburban wife  
With your white picket fence  
You may be a suit and tie  
Paying off your high rise rent  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down baby  
When it all comes down to it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Doesn't everybody want the same thing  
To be loved  
Doesn't everybody want the same thing  
Why isn't that enough  
Doesn't everybody want the same thing  
  
You may be a night shift waitress  
To send your kid through school  
You may be a stubborn doctor  
Pushing for the cure  
You may be a bitter divorce  
Wandering what he saw in her  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down baby  
When it all comes down to it  
  
[Chorus]
