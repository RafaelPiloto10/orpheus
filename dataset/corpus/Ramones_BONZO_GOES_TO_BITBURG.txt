You've got to pick up the pieces see'mon, sort your trash  
You better pull yourself back together Maybe you've got too much cash  
Better call, call the law When you gonna turn yourself in? Yeah  
You're a politician Don't become one of Hitler's children  
  
Bonzo goes to bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea  
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me  
Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy  
Pick up the pieces  
  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down  
Shouldn't wish you happiness, wish her the very best Fifty thousand dollar
dress  
Shaking hands with your highness See through you like cellophane  
You watch the world complain, but you do it anyway Who am I, am I to say  
  
Bonzo goes to bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea  
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me  
Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy  
Pick up the pieces  
  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down  
If there's one thing that makes me sick It's when someone tries to hide behind
politics  
I wish that time could go by fast Somehow they manage to make it last  
  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down  
My brain is hanging upside down I need something to slow me down
