Got a message in my head  
That the papers had all gone  
Richard Manuel is dead  
And the daylight's coming on  
I've been wandering through the dark  
Now I'm standing on the lawn  
  
If I could give all my love to you  
I could justify myself  
But I'm just not coming through  
You're a pill to ease the pain  
Of all the stupid things I do  
I'm an anchor on the line  
Of a clock that tells the time  
That is running out on you  
Well it was cold when I woke  
And the day was halfway done  
Nearly spring in San Francisco  
But I cannot feel the sun  
You were sleeping next to me  
But I knew that you'd be gone  
  
If I could give all my love to you  
I could justify myself  
But I'm just not coming through  
You're a pill to ease the pain  
Of all the stupid things I do  
I'm an anchor on the line  
Of a clock that tells the time  
That is running out on you  
Take some time before you go  
Think of monday's coming down  
And the people that you knew  
The ones that aren't around  
You've been fading day to day  
I've been moving town to town  
  
If I could give all my love to you  
I could justify myself  
But I'm just not coming through  
You're a pill to ease the pain  
Of all the stupid things I do  
I'm an anchor on the line  
Of a clock that tells the time  
That is running out on you
