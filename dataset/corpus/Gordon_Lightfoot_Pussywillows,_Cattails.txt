Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees  
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses
