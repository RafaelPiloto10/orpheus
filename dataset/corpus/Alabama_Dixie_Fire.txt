I'm not a stranger to passion,  
I've seen a lot of love in my time  
Felt that physical attraction,  
From the touch in the heat of the night  
Been all over the country,  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done,  
there's only one that remains  
  
[Chorus]  
Dixie fire burning down in my soul  
Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction,  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse,  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music,  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold,  
And added a warm melody  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning (Cant you see that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning (There's a Dixie fire)  
Burn, burn, burning (Don't you know that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning
