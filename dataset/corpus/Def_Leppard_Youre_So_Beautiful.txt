You say all I do is think about you  
That's right, you're the only thing that's on my mind  
Your light, won't you let it shine on me, yeah  
All night, hold me tight and don't let go  
'Cause I can't help myself, why'know  
  
(It's OK) I know what I got  
(Alright) I know that it's hot  
(All good) And you're what I want  
(Alright) 'cause you're so beautiful  
(It's OK) One thing on my mind  
(Alright) I'm so in love  
(All good) And so alive  
(Alright) 'Cause you're so beautiful  
  
Yeah, an angel from the sky  
The sparkle in my eye  
I can't believe you're mine  
Na na na na na  
  
Sometimes you slip 'n' slide through my emotions  
So high, take me up and spin me 'round  
'Cause I don't want to come back down  
  
(It's OK) I know what I got  
(Alright) I know that it's hot  
(All good) And you're what I want  
(Alright) 'Cause you're so beautiful  
(It's OK) One thing on my mind  
(Alright) I'm so in love  
(All good) And so alive  
(Alright) 'Cause you're so beautiful  
  
Yeah, an angel from the sky  
The sparkle in my eye  
I can't believe you're mine  
Na na na na na  
  
(It's OK) You're so beautiful  
(It's alright)  
  
I can't believe you're mine  
An angel from the sky  
The sparkle in my eye  
Gets better every time  
Na na na na na
