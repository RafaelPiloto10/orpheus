Life is just too short for some folks  
For other folks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure tea's too strong  
  
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride the middle  
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north  
  
In a small suburban garden  
Not a single neighbour knows our name  
I know the woman wishes we would move some place  
Where the houses aren't all the same  
  
Jesse, I wish you would take mewhere the grass is greener  
I couldn't really say where it may be  
Oh, some place high on a montain top  
Bown by the deep blue sea  
  
And there we'll do just as we please  
It ain't nothing but a breeze  
  
One day I'll be old gray Grandpa  
All the pretty girls will call me "Sir"  
Now where they're asking me how things are  
Soon they'll ask me how things are  
  
Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa  
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma  
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies  
To the shade of the old pawpaw  
  
There we'll do just as we please  
It ain't nothing but a breeze  
  
Life is just too short for some folks  
For other foks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure tea's too strong  
  
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride in the middle  
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north
