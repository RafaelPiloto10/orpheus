Yeahhh  
  
Opposites attract, chemicals react  
But when I look at you  
Deserts need the rain, fires feed the flame  
We can't deny what's true  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
Cause you got me yeah  
All these elements are real  
They come from deep within me  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where there's nothing we can't do  
I love you, I love you  
This power is greater than the forces of nature  
  
We don't have no walls  
The beauty of it all (beauty of it all)  
Is waiting in your eyes  
Breathing on my skin  
Just let me take it in  
Under an open sky  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
Cause you got me yeah (oh you know I can't)  
All these elements are real  
They come from deep within me  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where there's nothing we can't do  
I love you (oh I love you) I love you  
This power is greater than the forces of nature  
  
Nothing is greater  
Than the energy I get from loving you  
Sooner or later  
It'll take us too forever  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (ohhh)  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where there's nothing we can't do (nothing we can't do)  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire (for this fire)  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (I'd fight for you)  
Let this emotional wind take us higher (let this emotional wind)  
Where there's nothing we can't do (nothing we can't do)  
I love you (I love you baby) I love you (I love you baby)  
This power is greater than the forces of nature
