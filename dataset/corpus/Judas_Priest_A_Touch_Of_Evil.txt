You mesmerize slowly  
Till i can't believe my eyes  
Ecstasy controls me  
What you give just serves me right  
  
Without warning you're here  
Like magic you appear  
I taste the fear  
  
I'm so afraid  
But i still feed the flame  
  
In the night  
Come to me  
You know i want your touch of evil  
In the night  
Please set me free  
I can't resist a touch of evil  
  
Aroused with desire  
You put me in a trance  
A vision of fire  
I never had a chance  
  
A dark angel of sin  
Preying deep from within  
Come take me in  
  
I'm so afraid  
But i still feed the flame  
  
In the night  
Come to me  
You know i want your touch of evil  
In the night  
Please set me free  
I can't resist a touch of evil  
  
Arousing me now with a sense of desire  
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire  
  
A dark angel of sin  
Preying deep from within  
Come take me in  
  
I'm so afraid  
But i still feed the flame  
  
You're possessing me
