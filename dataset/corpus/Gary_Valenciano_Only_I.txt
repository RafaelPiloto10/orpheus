Only I, no one else but only I  
No one else but only I  
Nobody else but I can call her mine  
Only I, no one else but only I  
Some people call her an angel  
The answer to my prayers  
She's all this heart of mine desires and knows  
They say she's deep as a river  
And gracious as the morn  
Some people say  
She's as lovely as a rose  
They call her gentle  
They call her warm and kind  
But only I, only I can call her mine...  
Some people say she's a candle  
Glowing in the dark  
They say she's the wind  
That blows the clouds away  
They say that she's like the sunshine  
Through the pouring rain  
Her smile can brighten up anybody's day  
They call her radiant  
They call her bright  
They call her a star that shiness  
But only I, only I can call her mine  
Only I have her heart  
And only she has mine  
Who'd have ever thought  
A man like me could be  
The one to say  
She's with me all the way  
The one to say  
She loves only me (only me)  
Some people says she's the best thing  
To ever come my way  
They say she's a blessing  
The best in my life  
They say she's a jewel  
So rare, so hard to find  
They call her a wonder  
They call her one of a kind  
They call her precious  
They call her dear  
They call her divine  
But only I, only I can call her...  
The one that I'll love forever  
Only I, only I can call her mine  
(Only I, no one else but only I)  
(No one else but only I)  
(Only I, No one else but only I)  
Only I, can call her mine
