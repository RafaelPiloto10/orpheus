Cause we rock  
We rock  
We rock on  
We rock  
We rock on  
  
Come as you are  
You're a super star  
World in your pocket  
And you know it  
  
We can feel that  
Beat running  
Through your feet  
Hearts racing fast  
Your rockin' rolling  
  
All that you need is  
The music to take  
You to some other place  
Where you know you belong  
  
Raise you hands up  
In the air and scream  
Were finding out  
Voice following our dreams  
We rock  
We rock  
We rock on  
Nobody in the world's gonna  
Bring us down  
The louder we go  
Well the better we sound  
We rock  
We rock  
We rock on  
  
We're finally letting go  
Losing all control  
Won't stop ourselves  
Cause we love it  
  
We're not afraid to be  
Everything you see  
No more hiding  
Now we're gonna own it  
  
All that you need is the music to take you  
To some other place where you know you belong  
  
Raise your hands up in the air and scream  
We're finding our voice  
Following our dreams  
Cause we rock!  
We rock!  
We rock!  
We rock on!  
Nobody in the world's gonna  
Bring us down  
The louder we go  
Will the better we sound  
Cause we rock!  
We rock!  
We rock!  
We rock on!  
  
We got the music in out soul  
And it's the thing we want the most  
It a sound of no other  
Down it turns are world around  
  
We rock  
Camp rock  
We rock  
We rock on  
Cause every day  
Cause every night  
We rock  
We rock  
We rock  
Don't we wanna do it loud?

In the air and scream

Voice following our dreams  
Cause we rock

Nobody in the world's gonna  
Bring us down

Raise you hands up  
In the air and scream  
Were finding out  
Voice following our dreams
