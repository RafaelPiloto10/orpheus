Now, I don't want to lose you,  
but I don't want to use you just to have somebody by my side.  
And I don't want to hate you,  
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry.  
And I don't really matter to anyone anymore.  
But like a fool I keep losing my place and  
I keep seeing you walk through that door.  
  
But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,  
and it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust.  
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are.  
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough.  
  
Now, I could never change you,  
I don't want to blame you.  
Baby, you don't have to take the fall.  
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you.  
Maybe I just want to have it all.  
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain.  
And like a fool who will never see the truth,  
I keep thinking something's gonna change.  
  
But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,  
and it's bad when you know it's your heart they can't trust.  
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are.  
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough.  
  
And there's no way home when it's late at night and you're all alone.  
Are there things that you wanted to say?  
And do you feel me beside you in your bed,  
there beside you where I used to be?  
  
But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,  
and it's bad when you know it's your heart you can't trust.  
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are.  
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough.
