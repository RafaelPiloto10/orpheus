Everything seems so tranquil  
Home movies with no subtitles  
Don't you wish you knew what they were sayin'  
When the film keeps playin', playin'  
  
Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance  
  
Some say he is just a lackey  
Changing words while the ink is still tacky  
He's absolutely indispensable  
He keeps the other boys in suspense  
  
Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance  
  
Luther is locked in a broken-down cinema  
Watches his wife with his video camera  
Sees his best boy makin' her grin  
Out of the kitchen, she's gone with the wind  
  
Oh, Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in, when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance
