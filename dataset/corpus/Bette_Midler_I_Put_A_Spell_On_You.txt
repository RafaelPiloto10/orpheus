I put a spell on you  
And now you're mine.  
You can't stop the things I do.  
I ain't lyyyyyin'.  
  
It's been 300 years  
Right down to the day,  
Now the witch is back  
And there's hell to pay.  
  
I put a spell on you  
And now you're miiiiiine!  
  
Hello, Salem! My name's Winifred, what's yours?  
  
I put a spell on you  
And now you're gone. (gone gone gone so long!)  
My whammy fell on you  
And it was strong. (so strong so strong so strong)  
  
Your wretched little lives  
Have all been cursed,  
'cause of all the witches working  
I'm the worst!  
  
I put a spell on you  
And now you're mine!  
  
[Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!]  
  
If you don't believe,  
You'd better get superstitious.  
  
Ask my sisters!  
"Ooh, she's vicious!"  
I put a spell on you....  
I put a spell on you.  
Sisters!

Ay, ay, aye, aye, say bye-byyyyyyyyyyye! Bye bye!
