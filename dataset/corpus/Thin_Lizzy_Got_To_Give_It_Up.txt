[Chorus]  
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up  
That stuff  
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up  
That stuff  
  
Tell my mama and tell my pa  
That their fine young son didn't get far  
He made it to the end of a bottle  
Sitting in a sleazy bar  
  
He tried hard but his spirit broke  
He tried until he nearly choked  
In the end he lost his  
Bottle drinking alcohol  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell my brother I tried to write and  
Put pen to paper but I was frightened  
I couldn't seem to get the words out right  
Right quite right  
  
Tell my sister I'm sinking slow  
Now and again I powder my nose  
In the end I lost my bottle  
It smashed in a casaba  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I've been messing with the heavy stuff  
For a time I couldn't get enough  
But I'm waking up and its wearing off  
Junk don't take you far  
  
Tell my mama I'm coming home  
In my youth I'm getting older  
And I think its lost control  
Mama I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]
