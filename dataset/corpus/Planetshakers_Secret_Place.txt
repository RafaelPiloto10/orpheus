In the secret place  
I find You  
In Your sweet embrace  
In the stillness Lord  
I'm waiting  
Here to hear Your voice  
Calling me  
You're drawing me  
Jesus You're all I need  
  
You are all I need my Jesus  
You're my everything  
  
You are all I ever wanted  
All I ever need my Jesus  
  
Take me to the secret place Lord  
You're all I need  
Into the secret place Lord  
  
Just one moment here with You  
Means more than anything to me
