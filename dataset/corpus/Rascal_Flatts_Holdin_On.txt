There's a Mountain Dew can with lipstick on it  
Rollin' round his truck bed.  
He just leaves it back there,  
One of the things he has left of her  
When he drives into the late day sun  
You can see a set of footprints.  
He ain't going to clean that windshield,  
He'd rather just live with the hurt.  
  
He's holdin' on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel.  
To the shifter, to the pictures.  
Every precious moment with her.  
Like the left behind colors in the sky  
When the sun is gone.  
He's holdin' on.  
Oh, he's holdin' on.  
  
There's that voice mail on his cell phone  
He don't dare erase.  
She ended with I love you,  
And he saves it just in case  
It might still be true.  
No he ain't through.  
  
He's holdin' on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel.  
To the shifter, to the pictures.  
Every precious moment with her.  
Like the left behind colors in the sky  
When the sun is gone.  
He's holdin' on.  
  
To the past  
To the last time he held her  
The breath on his neck.  
The three words she said.  
  
Oh, oh, oh,  
  
He's holdin' on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel.  
To the shifter, to the pictures.  
Every precious moment with her.  
  
He's holdin' on  
Yeah, he's holdin' on  
He's holdin' on  
He's holdin on
