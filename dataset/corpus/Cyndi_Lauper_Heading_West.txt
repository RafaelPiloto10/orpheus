I drop my hat  
To a restless wind  
This time I'm not gonna chase it again  
In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words  
  
I woke up crying and no one heard  
You're looking through me like I never was real  
You say you love me but you won't let me feel  
So I'm gonna take a chance this time  
  
I'm gonna find myself some place where I can heal  
And I'm heading west  
Without a sad goodbye  
And I'm heading west  
  
I'm like a letter with no address  
Just like a book I read  
I'm heading west  
I said my name  
  
Under my breath  
He turned down a twisted road  
I won't forget  
I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all the string  
  
Hold on to hope, let go everything  
I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said  
The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head  
And if I fall down on my knees I'm gonna get back up  
  
I'm gonna get back up again  
And I'm heading west  
Without a sad goodbye  
And I'm heading west  
  
I'm like a letter with no address  
Just like a book I read  
I'm heading west  
And I'm heading west...  
Just like a book I read...
