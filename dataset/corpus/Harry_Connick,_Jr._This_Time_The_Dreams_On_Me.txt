Somewhere, someday  
We'll be close together, wait and see  
Oh, by the way, this time the dream's on me  
  
You'll take my hand  
And you'll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand, this time the dream's on me  
  
It would be fun to be certain that I'm the one  
To know that I at least supply the shoulder you cry upon  
To see you through till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true, but this time the dream's on me
