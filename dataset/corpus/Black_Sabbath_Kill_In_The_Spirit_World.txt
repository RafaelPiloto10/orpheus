There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air  
And the blood in my vein's running colder.  
The Eastern sky is beginning to silver  
And the words that you speak start to falter.  
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,  
In the house of the dead there's a taker.  
Some say that this is the ultimate sin  
When the spirit world turns to the alter.  
  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
  
Behold the dead, clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever  
"In glory die" calls the voice from the void  
You assasin has cursed every spectre  
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,  
And the house of the dead seeks the master  
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end  
And the kiss on the wind whispers murder, (murder)  
  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
  
When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain  
Blood kill in the spirit world ah  
  
Did ya see another in black  
Is the blood in your veins running colder?  
If ya did, then there's no turing back  
As the spirit world turns to the alter.  
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed,  
And the house of the dead seeks the master  
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end  
And a kiss on the wind whispers murder  
  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
There's been a kill in the spirit world  
  
Oh here it comes, no no no-oh oh  
Your seal is broken, the Eastern sky is beginning to silver, oh oh oh.  
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air, ah.  
You feel the evil, I feel the evil.  
Oh somebody whispers murder.  
  
A kiss on the wind whispers murder
