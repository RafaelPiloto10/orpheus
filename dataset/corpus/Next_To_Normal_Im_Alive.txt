Gabe:  
I am what you want me to be,  
And I'm your worst fear  
You'll find it in me.  
Come closer...  
Come closer...  
  
I am more than memory  
I am what might be,  
I am mystery.  
You know me  
So show me.  
  
When I appear it's  
Not so clear if  
I'm a simple spirit  
Or I'm flesh and blood...  
  
But I'm alive,  
I'm alive,  
I am so alive,  
And I feed on the fear  
That's behind your eyes.  
  
And I need you  
To need me  
It's no surprise  
I'm alive...  
So alive...  
I'm alive.  
  
I am flame and I am fire,  
I am destruction,  
Decay and desire  
I'll hurt you...  
I'll heal you...  
  
I'm your wish,  
Your dream come true,  
And I am your darkest  
Nightmare too  
I've shown you...  
I own you.  
  
And though you made me,  
You can't change me  
I'm the perfect stranger  
Who knows you too well.  
  
And I'm alive,  
I'm alive,  
I am so alive,  
And I'll tell you the truth  
If you let me try.  
  
You're alive,  
I'm alive,  
And I'll show why  
I'm alive...  
So alive...  
  
I'm alive  
I'm right behind you.  
You say forget,  
But I remind you.  
You can try to hide,  
You know that I will find you.  
'Cause if you won't grieve me  
You won't leave me behind...  
  
Ah, ah, ah,  
Whoa, oh, oh,  
Whoa, oh, oh...  
No, no, no  
I'm alive,  
I'm alive,  
I am so alive,  
If you climb on my back,  
Then we both can fly.  
  
If you try to deny me  
I'll never die  
I'm alive...  
So alive...  
I'm alive...  
Yeah, yeah...  
I'm alive...  
I'm alive...  
I'm alive...  
I'm alive!
