Tears fall, times called  
Sunsets in your heart  
The games lost, the spinning world stops  
  
You say the course has been run  
Now the end has now come  
Please don't mean it's over 'cause there's  
  
No good in goodbye  
Let's dry our tears and give this love  
Just one more try  
  
There's so much history  
Don't throw it away  
'Cause tomorrow's a brand new day  
Stay with me  
  
Dreams die, the crow will fly  
A kiss can't last all night  
The moon sinks and for my last wish  
You and I share this heart  
Please don't mean it's over 'cause there's  
  
No good in goodbye  
Let's dry our tears and give this love  
Just one more try  
  
There's so much history  
Don't throw it away  
'Cause tomorrow's a brand new day  
  
Your heart [Incomprehensible]  
Please don't take all the stars from the skies and  
  
No good in goodbye  
Let's dry our tears and give this love  
Just one more try  
  
There's so much history  
Don't throw it away  
'Cause tomorrow's a brand new day  
  
And it's lived by destiny  
Don't throw it away  
Find a brand new day  
  
We'll get out if we try  
'Cause there's no good in goodbye
