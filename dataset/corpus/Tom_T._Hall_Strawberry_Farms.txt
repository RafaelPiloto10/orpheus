Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines, but an orphan can't go  
  
My mother is dead, she doesn't care where I go  
My father left a long, long time ago  
I had me a frog, he never whined or cried  
I kept him in my pocket and he died  
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines, but an orphan can't go  
  
Bobby had a brother, he got killed in the war  
I asked him but he didn't know what for  
My mother was pretty, she had long black hair  
Once, she promised me a teddy bear  
  
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines, and things don't die
