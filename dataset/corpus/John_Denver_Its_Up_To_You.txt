This song was first released on the Back Home Again album. It is the only
album it has been released on.  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go it's up to you  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Following your heart, playing your own part  
You and me out on a farm, let the sun be our alarm  
Kickin' off your shoes, doin' what we choose  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Knowing that your mine anytime you want to be  
But I don't want to own you  
I just want to hold you  
I don't want to need you  
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile  
And if the times get rough, being free might be enough  
To see us through the storm and keep our feelings warm  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Looking back and knowing that we helped each other find  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go it's up to you  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Following your heart knowing from the start  
It's up to you  
It's up to you  
It's up to you  
Words and music by Steve Weisberg
