(DiffordTilbrook)  
He raped her with his eyes the minute she walked into the office as she
stretched to hang her coat behind the door he beamed a smile so big she could
have filled it with helium and flown off across the countryside he tried very
hard to invite her out for lunch but like most women she could sense the
underlying note of danger her instincts kept him at a safe distance and then
he made her a coffee and the steam rose across her face  
It could be you it could be me  
We'll have to wait we'll have to see  
Its all for sale now that its time  
To take a short break  
  
The sensation of safety and the little boy ambition to drive around  
Mountain roads makes a woman mad for attention she hides the car keys he turns
the place upside down and then looks out the window through the french blinds
to see the car off in the distance a cloud of country dust feathers the
sunlight as she smiles into the windscreen what can he do but wait patiently
folding a coin through his fingers  
  
It could be you it could be me  
We'll have to wait we'll have to see  
It's all for sale now that it's time  
To take a short break  
  
There she is again this time with a pair of jeans being pulled slowly up over
the curves of her body he plays guitar in the rocking chair these are the
jeans of our forefathers these are the jeans of the 21st century because this
is the new world where television and eye become one as we look down the
digital telescope into the future and now its time for a short break  
It could be you it could be me  
We'll have to wait we'll have to see  
Its all for sale now that its time  
Its lighter than air  
Whiter than white draft in a can  
The price is right save as you go  
The drive of your life its good to talk
