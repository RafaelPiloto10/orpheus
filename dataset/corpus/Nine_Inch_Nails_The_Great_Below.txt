Staring at the sea  
Will she come?  
Is there hope for me  
After all is said and done  
Anything at any price  
All of this for you  
All the spoils of a wasted life  
All of this for you  
All the world has closed her eyes  
Tried faith all worn and thin  
For all we could have done  
And all that could have been  
  
Ocean pulls me close  
And whispers in my ear  
The destiny I've chose  
All becoming clear  
The currents have their say  
The time is drawing near  
Washes me away  
Makes me disappear  
  
I descend from grace  
In arms of undertow  
I will take my place  
In the great below  
  
I can still feel you  
Even so far away
