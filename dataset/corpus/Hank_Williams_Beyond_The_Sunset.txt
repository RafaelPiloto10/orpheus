Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone  
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known  
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom  
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you  
Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought  
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot  
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope  
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope  
Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning  
When with our savior, heaven is begun  
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning  
Beyond the sunset when day is done  
Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll  
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll  
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy  
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy  
I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same  
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name  
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do  
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you  
In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting  
Beyond the sunset for ever more
