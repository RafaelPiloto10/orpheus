Can't take heartache  
Can't take  
  
[Chorus]  
Another problem with a woman again  
Another problem with a woman again  
Another problem with a woman again  
Another problem with a woman again  
  
Sometimes it's hard to express yourself  
To get, get things offa your chest, my friend  
Tell you one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes it's hard to express  
You know what I mean Robbie  
To get, get things off my chest  
Gonna give you one more chance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know what I mean Robbie  
Say, you know what I mean Robbie  
I know you got them too  
A woman again
