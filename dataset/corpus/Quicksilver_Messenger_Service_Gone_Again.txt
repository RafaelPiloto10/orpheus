You ask me why my mind goes to wanderin',  
And how can I be so many people in the meantime.  
I try to tell you, but words can't find my way,  
All I can tell you is, believe me, I really understand.  
It goes round and round after round, I'm gone again.  
My mind gets lonely and my heart starts of ramblin',  
With my sweet life, my crazy heart starts to gamblin'.  
The saddest of winds blow in my mind, stealing my time, o no, there I go
again.  
I go round and round after round, I'm gone again.  
Some people tell me I think they hold on forever,  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I could ever hold on forever.  
Lettin' go, lettin' go feels so groovy now, oo feels so groovy now.  
Sweet summer falls on my mind like the dawning,  
I watch the witches casting spells in the morning.  
Sing the stranger, the brewing, the sweet of the brew,  
To know what you're doing is so hard to do.  
It goes round and round and around, I'm gone again.  
Something tells me that maybe I can maintain forever,  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if I could ever hold on forever.  
Lettin' go, lettin' go feels so groovy now, oo feels so groovy now.  
I see a lady, my crazy heart starts to question,  
Can't we lay by here a while and love this one?  
Then my sweet life comes dancing by, takes me by the hand,  
The sweetest romancing to the stranger will never never end.  
And I go with her, round and round and around, I'm gone again.
