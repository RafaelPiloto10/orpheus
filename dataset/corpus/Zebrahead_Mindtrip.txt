Take a trip in your mind  
Open up and find  
All the shit that you never knew  
Cause choices is why  
Women don't try  
To color in a black and white view!  
When reason inflicts  
Jealousy and Theft  
Reaction is all you can do  
Jumped from behind,  
Open up your mind  
See what the fuck you can do  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause it's a mindtrip it's a mindtrip comin' on  
It's a mind trip, it's a mind-trip  
Cause it's a mindtrip it's a mindtrip comin' on  
It's a mind trip, it's a mind-trip  
  
Lend out your ears  
Intelligence sears  
Ignorance is bread from the room  
Cause your fascist eye  
You thought to cry  
Everyone's here to make room!  
Sit in the back and rub on your cock  
Looking for something that's new  
Jump from behind  
Open up your mind  
See what the fuck you can do  
  
Back to the front, to the front, to the front  
Back to the front, to the front  
Back to the front, to the front, to the front  
Back to the front, to the!
