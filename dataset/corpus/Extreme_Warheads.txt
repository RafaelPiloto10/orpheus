Hey Kid,  
Wanna have some fun?  
Choose a side  
And, here's your gun  
  
Brought up  
Knowing right from wrong  
Squash the meek,  
Inherit the strong  
  
Just try and,  
Cross the line,  
Don't even bother  
To waste my time  
  
What's that  
Look in your eyes?  
It's time I cut you.  
Down to size  
  
This world ain't  
Big enough for two,  
And I've got my  
Sights on you  
  
Would you like to be,  
I'm a warhead  
You're a warhead  
A warhead just like me?  
He's a warhead  
She's a warhead  
Watch 'em scream 'm yell  
Would you like to be,  
A warhead too  
When I blow them  
Straight to hell  
  
Ramboy,  
It's us and them  
Just like your Daddy  
In Vietnam  
Monkey see,  
Monkey do,  
Your boy's grown up  
Just like you  
  
This world ain't  
Big enough for two,  
And I've got my  
Sights on you  
  
Would you like to be,  
I'm a warhead  
You're a warhead  
A warhead just like me?  
He's a warhead  
She's a warhead  
Watch 'em scream 'n yell  
Would you like to be,  
A warhead too  
When I blow them  
Straight to hell  
  
I've seen Black heads,  
White heads,  
Red heads,  
Dead heads,  
Big heads,  
Shit heads,  
But there's no heads  
Like warheads!
