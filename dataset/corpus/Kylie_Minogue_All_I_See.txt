Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Weekend has arrived  
Everybody's tryin' to find  
Something to get into  
My friends wanna go out  
But I can't cancel my plans  
Got a date with my baby  
He's taking me out  
So I'm gonna catch up with you  
Some other day  
Gotta go  
Can't make him wait  
Tonight  
  
Have to make sure I'm looking hot  
'Cause we're going to our favorite spot  
Till the morning we're gonna rock  
Boy you rock me up (yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
My baby  
Doesn't matter what's going on  
Or who's around us  
All I see is you  
Right now they're playing our song  
Dance floor is ours  
All I see is you  
The DJ's got me feelin' like I did  
When I first met you  
And there's nothing that can break us apart  
In two  
'Cause all I see is you  
  
I get lost in time  
When I'm lookin' in your eyes  
And we're body to body  
I don't want you to rush  
'Cause you're feeling like heaven to me  
Follow the rhythm  
And keep it real close  
In the dark everything goes  
Love it better when you touch (don't stop)  
Baby 'cause we've just begun  
  
Have to make sure I'm looking hot  
'Cause we're going to our favorite spot  
Till the morning we're gonna rock  
Boy you rock me up (yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Please don't let me go oh, oh  
My love for you's growing  
More and more and more  
As we move across the floor, oh, oh  
'Cause all I see is you  
'Cause all I see is you  
DJ spin my record again  
  
[Chorus x2]
