I don't care what they say about me  
It's all right, all right  
I don't care they think about me  
It's all right, they'll get it one day  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I love you, I'll follow you  
You are my, my life  
I will read my Bible and pray  
I will follow you all day  
  
I don't care what it costs anymore  
Cause you gave it all and I'm following you  
I don't care what it takes anymore  
No matter what happens I'm going your way  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
All Day  
All Day now  
All Day  
I'll follow You  
  
I don't care what they say about me  
It's all right, all right  
I don't care they think about me  
It's all right, they'll get it one day  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Anyone around can see  
just how good you've been to me  
For all my friends that don't know you  
I pray that you would save them too  
  
[Chorus]
