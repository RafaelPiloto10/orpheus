We all carry the cross and speak what we're taught  
Lies and money become the white man's god  
We've burned all our bridges one too many times  
The time has come now to draw the line  
  
[Chorus]  
You know you've got to  
Stand, stand, stand for what you believe  
You know you've got to  
Stand, stand, stand for what you believe  
Oh, you got to stand for what you believe  
  
Alright, alright  
You got to listen now  
Express yourself in the face of change  
Repress yourself, you surely seal your fate  
You got to look inside, the answer lies in wait  
Resurrect before it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody rescue me, come down and rescue me  
I know the soul of a good man has got to be free  
When you stand, stand for what you believe  
  
[Chorus]
