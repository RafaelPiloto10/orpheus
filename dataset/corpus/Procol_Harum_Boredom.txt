Some say they will and some say they won't  
Some say they do and some say they don't  
Some say they shall and some say they shan't  
And some say they can and some say they can't  
  
All in all it's all the same  
But call me if there's any change  
  
Some say there's nothing and some say there's lots  
Some say they've started while some say they've stopped  
Some say they're going and some say they've been  
Yes, some say they're looking and some say they've seen  
  
All in all it's all the same  
But call me if there's any change
