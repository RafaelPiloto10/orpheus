Blossom lipped ladies and men with a gleam in their eyes  
Fat happy babies sit on their born thin mother's thighs  
Picture a vow  
Picture well  
  
I couldn't see the cracks in this fine social scene  
I couldn't find the fault with this whole pantomime  
  
All others laughing the jokes by the host  
He's no man  
  
All others dancing in couples to these session bands  
Wearing smiles  
Hot colt 45s  
  
I couldn't see the cracks in this fine social scene  
I couldn't find the fault with this whole pantomime
