We're straining at the leash  
We smell the human meat  
The only way for us to go  
The order of the pack  
Command is kill, attack  
Obey the master's law  
Bad temper rules our minds  
The hunt is on this time  
We can't wait  
No way to stay alive  
The prey is finalized  
It's total genocide  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt  
We train our deadly pride  
No way for man to hide  
We're always aiming for your neck  
This is your final day  
Just believe and pray  
We're feasting on your eyes  
Bad temper rules our minds,  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt, this ain't no suicide  
We're on the manhunt,  
What is the victim's face, not us who's wrong  
The terror of the chase, can't be undone  
We turned the game around, not us who's wrong  
You made us go to ground, can't be undone  
We're on the manhunt,  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt, this ain't no suicide  
We're on the manhunt, we keep on pushing  
We're on the manhunt, try to hide, no way to run
