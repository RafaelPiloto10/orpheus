There may be some youngbloods  
Waitin' in the wings  
I'm puttin' on my good duds  
So you can hear me sing  
I know what you're thinkin' but  
This ain't no one night stand  
I'm savin' all the good love  
For only one man  
Pop, pop my clutch (4x)  
Don't worry 'bout the weather  
In London or Rome  
Once we get together  
You're gonna take me home  
I've had plenty boyfriends  
Now I need a man  
To love me, whatever  
And a ring on my hand  
Listen pretty baby  
I won't say it twice  
You could save me  
From my own device  
Honesty is so refreshing  
I don't get that much  
You just might be the blessing  
To make me pop my clutch  
Chorus  
I know what you're thinkin'  
But this ain't no one night stand  
I'm savin' the good stuff  
For only one man  
Listen, pretty baby  
I won't say it twice  
You know you could save me  
I you pop it right
