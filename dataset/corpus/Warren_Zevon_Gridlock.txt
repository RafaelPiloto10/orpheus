It's 5:00 P.M. on a weekday, friend  
There's one of me and two million of them  
The whistle blows, and the factories close  
There's a million more commuters on the access roads  
The brake lights flash, there's an RV - crashed  
I'm in the passing lane going nowhere fast  
The traffic crawls, and the engine stalls  
I'm stuck on the edge of the urban sprawl  
  
Gridlock  
Up ahead  
There's a line of cars as far as I can see  
Gridlock  
Goin' nowhere  
Roll down the window, let me scream  
  
Oh, yeah, ain't it a shame?  
We're all jammed up at the interchange  
The paramedics and the C.H.P.  
Wait impatiently for catastrophes  
I'm spending half my days like this  
I might as well be working on the midnight shift  
The radio's tuned to the traffic news  
And everybody's choking on monoxide fumes  
  
Gridlock  
Up ahead  
There's a line of cars as far as I can see  
Gridlock  
Goin' nowhere  
Roll down the window, let me scream  
I can close my eyes and dream  
I can close my eyes and dream  
I can close my eyes and dream  
  
It's 5:00PM on a weekday, friend  
I'm going home, but I don't know when  
I hate this traffic, and I hate this town  
Gotta honk my horn, try to get around  
I feel like going on a killing spree  
Tomorrow I'm going on the R.T.D.  
The traffic crawls, and the engine stalls  
I'm stuck on the edge of the urban sprawl  
  
Gridlock  
Up ahead  
There's a line of cars as far as I can see  
Gridlock  
Goin' nowhere  
Roll down the window, let me scream  
I can close my eyes and dream
