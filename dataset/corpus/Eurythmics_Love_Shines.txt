Disappointed, on a cold and weary day  
All the little angels have all left and gone away  
Crystal is the water thaf's running down your face  
Is pale just like the moonlight on the sad and lonely place  
Broken hearted and with reason to be  
A cruel and twisted blow from whichever way you see  
Man was make to suffer and a woman left to grieve  
It makes it hard for even the strongest to believe  
Love shines on everything  
Love shines on you  
Love shines on every little thing  
Circumstances have led us to the edge  
Broken our wings and given us minds to think instead  
With the sky above us and the black old earth below  
We're all left there stranded with but there's one thing we must know  
That is  
Love shines on everything  
Love shines on you  
Love shines on every little thing  
Broken hearted on the planet of decay  
Watching Mother Nature just choke and died away  
Man has made a prison from a place called paradise  
And you could be the jailer if you don't think twice  
And let all  
Love shine on everyone  
Let it shine on you  
Let it shine on every little thing  
Love shines on everything  
Love shines on you  
Love shines on every little thing  
Every little thing you do
