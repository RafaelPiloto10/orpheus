I need you to pin me down  
Just for one frosen moment.  
I need someone to pin me down  
So I can live in torment.  
I need you to really feel  
The twist of my back breaking  
I need someone to listen  
To the ecstacy I'm faking.  
I need you you you  
  
I need you to catch each breath  
That issues from my lips  
I need someone to crack my skull  
I need someone to kiss.  
So hold me now  
And make pretend  
That I won't ever fall  
Oh hold me down  
I'm gonna be your baby doll  
  
I need you you you  
Is it you I really need?  
I do I do I do  
I really do  
I need you
