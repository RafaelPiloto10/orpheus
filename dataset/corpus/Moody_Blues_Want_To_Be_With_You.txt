When I think of all the things that we've been through  
And all the things we've yet to do,  
I... I start to realize  
The world is such a lonely place.  
Want to be with you  
I remember all the heartaches we have known,  
The angry nights when we were lonely.  
The jealousy and pain,  
Can we remain the same?  
The world will have to hold its breath.  
Want to be with you  
  
I don't need a reason,  
I don't need to understand.  
I just want to be,  
Want to be with you  
  
Only want your love,  
Only want you by my side,  
Only want to be,  
Want to be with you.  
  
And when I look back down that road  
I see the turnings that we both made,  
The choice we had to make  
The promises we break  
Are nothing more than memories.  
Want to be with you.  
  
The jealousy and pain,  
Can we remain the same?  
The world will have to hold its breath.  
Want to be with you.  
  
I don't need a reason,  
I don't need to understand.  
I just want to be,  
Want to be with you.  
  
Only want your love,  
Only want you by my side,  
Only want to be,  
Want to be with you.
