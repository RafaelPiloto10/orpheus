Last night I heard this politician  
Talking bout his brand new mission  
Liked his plans but they came undone  
When he got around to God and guns  
  
I don't know how he grew up  
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club  
Cause if it was he'd understand  
Just a little bit more about the working man  
  
God and guns  
Keep us strong  
That's what this country  
Was founded on  
  
Well we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
Yeah out here in my neck of the woods  
Where God is great and guns are  
Good  
You really can't know that much about them  
If you think we'd be better off without them  
  
Oh there was we aint forgot  
You could rest all night with your doors unlocked  
But there aint nobody safe no more  
So you say your prayers and you thank the Lord  
  
For that peacemaker  
In your dresser drawer  
  
God and guns  
Keep us strong  
That's what this country Lord  
Was founded on  
  
Well we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
Yeah we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
Yeah  
Oh  
God and guns  
  
Don't let em take  
Don't you let em take  
Don't let em take  
Our God and guns  
  
Oh God and guns  
Yeah keep us strong  
That's what this country Lord  
Was founded on  
  
Well we might as well  
Give up and run  
If we let them take our  
God and guns  
  
God and guns
