Hey, everybody  
Won't you just look around?  
Can't anybody see  
Just what's going down?  
Can't you take the time?  
Just to feel, just to feel what is real  
If you do, then you'll see that we got a raw deal  
They're killin' everybody, they're killin' me and you  
The fightin' and killin' everybody, I wish it weren't true  
They say we got to make war  
Or the economy will fall  
But if we don't stop  
We won't be around no more  
They're ruining this world  
For you and me  
The big heads of state  
Won't let us be free  
They made the rules once  
But it didn't turn out  
Now we must try again  
Before they kill us off  
No more dying  
No more killing  
No more dying  
No more fighting  
We don't want to die  
We don't want to die  
Please, let's change it all  
Please, let's make it all  
Good for the present  
And better for the future  
Love one another  
Let's show peace for each other  
We can make it happen  
Let's just make it happen  
We can change the world  
Please, let's change this world  
Please, let's make it happen  
For our children, for our women  
Change the world  
Please make it happen  
Come on, come on  
Yeah please, come on  
It's up to me, it's up to you  
Come on, let's do it now  
Yeah, do it now
