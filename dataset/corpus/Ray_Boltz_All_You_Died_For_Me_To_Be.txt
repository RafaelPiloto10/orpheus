All You Died For Me To Be  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I've had trials and I've had doubts  
I've felt your presence  
And walked it out  
Every step of my life  
You've been here with me  
And as we walk together  
Down a road I cannot see  
Chorus:  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
I want to walk  
In all you bought on the Tree  
'Cause you suffered so much pain  
You didn't suffer that pain in vain  
'Cause I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
Now this road isn't easy  
You know it's true  
When they laugh at me, I know  
They laughed at you  
And when they say I've gone too far  
I'm not the way I used to be  
I ask myself this question  
Did you go too far for me?  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
I want to walk  
In all you bought on the Tree  
'Cause you suffered so much pain  
You didn't suffer it in vain  
'Cause I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
Help me take my eyes off my problems  
And take a look at what you faced  
When they raised that hammer high  
And they held those nails in place  
When I see Calvary it's all different  
When I see Calvary it's all changed  
And I know I can overcome  
Just because you overcame  
Chorus  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be
