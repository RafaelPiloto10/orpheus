Who thanked the Lord for the clothes  
That she wore and mended,  
Nellie with the big old fashioned eyes  
  
Who won the heart of a crowd  
Tore apart, took a bow,  
Nellie there's a different world backstage  
  
[Chorus:]  
I see the flood lights burning  
I hear the band play on  
Now Nellie takes her bow  
  
She said she really could not stay  
She had a brand new play to play  
And so she paints her face and smiles  
And she'll be someone else in a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a lonely girl who could not face a broken world,  
And so she acts out all her dreams and wishes that's how it had been  
But when the audience is near, it seems as though she doesn't even care.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nellie just sent me a line to tell me she was doing fine  
She got the lead and on Broadway, and now they're digging her today  
And as she turns the final page, living  
Someone's life upon the stage  
  
[Chorus]
