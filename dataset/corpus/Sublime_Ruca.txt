On the east side that's where I met my Ramona  
"I wanna go to a party", That's what she said  
Lonely, that's what I've been here's my telephone number, call me  
And to a party, a house party  
Whole loop a people just rally around me  
And love, she send a message of love  
She said, "I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap"  
Ramona please step back  
Now she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my Heina  
She moved from Long Beach down to LA  
Right now she's selling oranges by the freeway  
I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one? Tell me  
And she said, "You're not the only one, but your the best, Bradley"  
Now I'm waiting for my Ruca  
And I barely pulled up with my Heina  
I know tonight I'll be behind her  
And I barely pulled up with my Heina
