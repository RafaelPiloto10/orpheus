Oh no  
  
Everybody needs affection  
Looking for a deep connection  
So put a little bit of love in my life today  
Everybody needs some shelter  
Spend a little time together  
Come into my arms  
Let them tell you what I want to say  
  
Color my world  
Draw on my heart  
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination  
Write on my soul  
Everything you know  
Use every word you've ever heard  
To color my world  
  
I've had enough of not believing  
Living life without a meaning  
I want something real and I feel it when I'm next to you  
Let's put out some love and devotion  
Window to my heart's emotion  
'Til the very end  
It's the place I'm gonna keep you in, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Color my world  
Draw on my heart  
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination  
Write on my soul  
Everything you know

That were never gonna leave, yea

Draw on my heart, yeah  
Take a picture of what you think love looks like in your imagination  
Write on my soul (write on my soul)  
Everything you know

To color my world
