Ain't nothin' so good  
As a Sunday morning  
When the day is dawnin'  
Kinda makes you feel good  
  
There ain't nothing so fine  
As a lazy weekend  
Just hangin' out with your best friend  
There ain't nothing so good  
There ain't nothing so good as a good time  
  
There's nothing so right as the right time  
I said please don't count on me  
Said please don't count on me  
There's nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There ain't nothing so good  
  
Ain't nothin' so strong  
As the strength of a good love  
I can't get enough  
Can't ever get too much love  
  
There ain't nothing so right  
As the sound of your voice  
I'm gonna make it my choice  
And get into something good  
  
There ain't nothing so good as a good time  
There ain't nothing so right as the right time  
I said please don't count on me  
Said please don't you count on me  
There's nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There ain't nothing so good  
  
Sail away  
Can't drift too far  
Gotta get away  
Be where you are  
Sail away, sail away  
Sail on far  
Gotta find a way  
Into your heart  
  
Ain't nothin' so good  
As a Sunday morning  
When the day is dawning  
Kinda makes you feel good  
  
There ain't nothing so fine  
As a lazy weekend  
Just hangin' out with your best friend  
There ain't nothing so good  
There ain't nothing so good as a good time  
Ain't nothing so right as the right time  
I said please don't count on me  
Said please don't count on me  
There's nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There ain't nothing so good  
  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good
