Stutter step through another trap set by deception  
Mention rejection  
Always lies in your eyes  
Settles in your action  
Jeopardize everything that I want  
And I won't compromise anything anymore  
In any way victimize myself any more  
Liberty (yeah)  
  
Manipulations on my mind  
Expectations well defined  
Frustrate me  
Liberate me  
  
Cause everything's falling apart  
You can't control me, You can't control me  
Everything's falling apart  
Now I can't see you  
Doesn't matter what I do  
I can't see you  
  
Cause everything's falling apart  
I got exposed to a deeper form of infection  
Shout out "I need acception"  
Always lies in your eyes  
Settles in your action  
  
Criticize everything that I do  
And I will overcome anything that's in store  
Nevermore look up to you and adore  
Liberty (yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Manipulation is on my mind  
Inspect me, try to check me  
Expectations well defined  
Dissect me, want to wreck me  
Violator of my own will  
Accept me- reject me  
Separate or shoot to kill  
  
[Chorus]
