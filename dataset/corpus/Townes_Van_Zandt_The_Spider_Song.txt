There is a spider in my dreams  
long and silent is his name  
cold as lightning is his smile  
final is his sting  
  
His curse is deep as seven skies  
boys, I wouldn't tell you lies  
the legends say he never sleeps  
he's never hungry long  
  
He's got us, boys, I believe it's true  
but I'm fighting till he lays me down  
run his foul black body through  
cleave him all asunder  
  
Think your women, won't you boys,  
think your mother growing old  
think about your darling son  
spittin' the spider's eye  
  
Up (at ease) against him ride  
we'll not take him by surprise  
give a scream down in your dreams  
let him know we're comin'  
  
There is a spider in my dreams  
long and silent is his name  
cold as lightning is his smile  
final is his sting
