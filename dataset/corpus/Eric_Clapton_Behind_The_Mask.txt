[Chorus:]  
All along, had to talk about it,  
Like a two-edged sword, he touched you and it stabs me.  
All along, knew you were a phony girl,  
Sit behind the mask where you control your world.  
  
Yesterday he had you in his arms  
When I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms.  
I can't judge what you do to me.  
Camoflage the truth, indulge your fantasy.  
  
Who do you love? Is it me now, is it him babe? I don't know.  
Who do you love? Is it me babe, is it him now? I don't know.  
  
There is nothing in your eyes that's the way you cry.  
All is grand, all is bright. You're just studying my mind.  
There is nothing in your eyes that's the way you cry.  
All is grand, all is bright. You're just studying my mind.  
  
Was I invited to your masquerade?  
Well the party's over so now take off your face.  
You say you love, but it's hard to see  
When you're in his arms, throwing rocks at me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I walk around suffering in my doom.  
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room.  
The truth is news, I have longed to trace.  
So take off the mask so I can see your face.  
  
Who do you love? Is it me baby, is it him now? I don't know.  
Who do you love? Is it me babe, is it him baby? I don't know.  
Who do you love? Is it me babe, is it him now? I don't know.  
Who do you love? Is it me now, is it him baby? I don't know.  
  
Who do you love? Is it me baby, is it him now? I don't know.  
Who do you love? Is it me baby, is it him now? I don't know.  
Who do you love? Is it me baby, is it him? I want to know.  
Who do you love?
