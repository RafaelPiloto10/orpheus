Yeah, Ya, Yeah  
Yeah, Ya, Yeah Oh.  
  
Yeah... Hey, alright...  
(I) I would dig a hole all the way to China  
Unless of course I was there  
And I'd dig my way home.  
If by digging I could steal  
The wind from the sails of the greedy men who ruled the world.  
Still you're my best friend  
And after a good, good drunk  
You and me wake up and make love  
After a deep sleep where I was dreaming  
I was dreaming of a  
  
Dreamgirl  
Dreamgirl  
Dreamgirl (Yeah)  
Dreamgirl  
  
I was feeling like a creep as I watched you asleep  
Face down in the grass in the park in the middle of hot afternoon  
Your top was untied and I thought how nice it'd be to follow the sweat down
your spine.  
You're like my best friend  
Oh, after a good good drink  
You and me wake up and make love  
After a deep sleep where I was dreaming  
I was dreaming of a  
  
Dreamgirl (yeah)  
Dreamgirl  
Dreamgirl (yeah)  
Dreamgirl  
  
Caught by a wave my back to the ocean.  
It knocks me off my feet and  
Just as I find my footing  
Here you come again!  
  
Dreamgirl, oh  
Dreamgirl (mumble man)  
The deep end...
