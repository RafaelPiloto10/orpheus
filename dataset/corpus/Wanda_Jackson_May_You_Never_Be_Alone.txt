(May you never be alone like me)  
Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight  
I'm alone and oh, so blue tonight  
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea  
May you never be alone like me  
I believed the lies you told to me  
When you whispered dear I worship Thee  
Now here am I alone and blue  
All because I loved no one but you  
In the Bible, God's own words to say  
For every wrong someday you'll pay  
Now I pray the Lord to set me free  
May you never be alone like me  
May you never be alone like me
