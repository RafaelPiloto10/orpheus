Breathing is a sin, they say,  
Loneliness is the price to pay.  
Sad for you, I go once more.  
I'll dry my eyes on a distant shore.  
  
No way of freezing your rising tide  
No way of keeping you by my side.  
Like a bird, I'll fly high,  
Guarding over this love of mine.  
  
A room of trust  
A room of fears  
A room of laughter with a few sweet tears.  
There we lay that sunny dawn  
Calm and helpless as it lingers on.  
  
No way of keeping you by my side.  
No way of keeping our love alive.  
Like a bird, I'll fly high,  
Guarding over this love of mine.  
  
Many times we hurry by  
Lose our problems in a knowing smile.  
Many days were swept along  
Left unnoticed as our love grew strong.  
  
Believing each of us would always know  
Believing one of us would never go.  
Like a bird, I'll fly high  
Watching over this love of mine.
