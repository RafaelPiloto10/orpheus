It's been a year and some change  
And I've been hearin' some things  
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me  
But ain't none of these motherfuckers tryin' to see me  
So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah  
  
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go  
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow  
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O  
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'  
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces  
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me  
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we  
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee  
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed  
But if they get in the way they get stepped on  
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on  
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on  
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names  
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you  
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to  
That I won't stop, and I don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
It don't stop  
And it won't stop  
And it don't stop  
It don't stop, it won't stop  
It don't stop  
And it won't stop  
And it don't stop  
It don't stop, it won't stop  
  
I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself  
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on  
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on  
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on  
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny  
I fall back and all a man do is laugh  
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft  
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math  
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on  
So I had to come through and take the corner back  
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack  
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack  
Girls still think I'm fly  
Blow kiss and wink the eye  
And tell me they want to go somewhere and freak off  
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off  
But I won't stop, and I don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines  
And be grippin' my nine  
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game  
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names  
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame  
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered  
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown  
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned  
But it won't stop, and it don't stop  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go  
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow  
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O.  
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
