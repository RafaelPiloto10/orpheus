Rollin' my home grown, Smokin' a big bong  
Look at that Ganja covered with oil  
Using my tweezers, Got pot in the freezer  
Made a new pipe out of aluminium foil  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
Don't know the reason, Satyed here all season  
Maybe that Tye-stick was a way bit too strong  
But I got a real beauty, A columbian doobie  
And soon I'll be up on my way along  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
I blew out my bong pipe, Ran out of budlight  
But I found some stash I had hidden at home  
Put it into a blender, And soon it will render  
These little fudge brownies that help me get stoned  
  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
Yes Some people Claim  
(sing it like bob dyllon) I sound like Dyllon when I'm stoned  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope
