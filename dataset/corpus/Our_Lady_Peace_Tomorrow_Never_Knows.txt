Listen to the color of your dreams...  
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream  
Then it's not dying, then it's not dying  
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void  
And it is shining, it is shining  
Now you may see the meaning of within  
It is being, it is being  
Love is all, love is everyone  
And it is knowing, and it is knowing  
Let ignorance and hate mingle with dead  
It is believing, it is believing  
Oh play the game, existence to the end  
Of the beginning, of the beginning  
Of the beginning, beginning  
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream  
It is not dying, it is not dying  
Play the game, existence to the end  
Of the beginning, of the beginning  
Of the beginning, of the beginning,  
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void  
Of the beginning, of the beginning, of the beginning
