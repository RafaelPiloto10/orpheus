I read your letter, darlin'  
Tears filled my eyes  
All of the promises you made were nothing but lies  
So I turned your photograph over face to the wall  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
I'm gonna pray tonight, baby  
Hopin' you will hear  
And maybe you'll write all those wrongs  
And dry each tear  
I sit alone tonight  
Hopin' you will call  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
When I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall
