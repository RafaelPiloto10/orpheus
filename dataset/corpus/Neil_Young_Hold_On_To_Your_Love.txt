Hold on to your love  
Hold on to your love  
Though you may feel tired and blue.  
The things you say,  
The things you dream you might do,  
Come true if you  
Hold on to your love.  
  
How long the day?  
How dark the night spent apart?  
Is this the way to learn?  
Go your own way  
Although you may break a heart  
Don't let it start  
Hold on to your love.  
  
Hold on to your love.  
Hold on to your love.  
  
The things you say,  
The things you dream you might do,  
If only you hold on to your love.  
Hold on to your love.
