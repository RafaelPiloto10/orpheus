Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
Mary, Mary, can I go too?  
This one thing I will vow ya  
I'd rather die than to live without ya  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
  
Mary, Mary, tell me truly  
What did I do to make you leave me?  
Whatever it was I didn't mean to  
You know I never would try and hurt ya  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
  
What more, Mary, can I do  
To prove my love is truly yours?  
I've done more now than a clear-thinkin' man would do  
  
Mary, Mary, it's not over  
Where you go, I will follow  
Till I win your love again  
And walk beside you  
But until then  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
  
Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?  
Mary, where you goin' to?  
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, where you goin' to?
