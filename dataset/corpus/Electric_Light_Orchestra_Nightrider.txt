I remember somewhere in the rain,  
the faces of the passers-by, staring faces, broken blinds,  
I recall the situation clearly standing in a crowded car,  
I can feel the need in me.  
  
Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider  
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,  
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.  
  
I still see that vision of delight,  
While cruising on the black of night,  
but she keeps a step ahead  
Looking out the corner of her world, nobody ever knows a girl,  
who once lived along this way.  
  
Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider  
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,  
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.  
  
Desolation degradation row,  
Go on don't let the feeling show,  
She's a ten a penny dream,  
Faces with no name no address, keep staring in on my distress  
But she kills me with her smile.  
  
Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider  
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,  
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.
