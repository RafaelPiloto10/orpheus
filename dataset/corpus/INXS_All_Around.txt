I see the rising sun  
I feel the warming one  
We've come a circle  
To the way we once begun  
  
No one's really sure  
How to make it up  
Or give a name to the way  
We've been acting lately  
  
All around  
All around  
All around  
All around  
  
A man he buy's a gun  
He is his father's son  
But one day he takes the gun  
And the lives of one and many  
  
Looking out one day  
A message comes to me  
I saw a woman tell the truth  
And end up end up behind bars  
  
All around  
All around  
All around  
All around  
All around  
All around  
  
I walked an empty street  
Proud to spill a tear  
Then came my shame  
My fear to blame  
The one and only  
  
See the rising sun  
Feel the warming one  
We've come a circle  
To the way we once begun  
  
All around  
All around...
