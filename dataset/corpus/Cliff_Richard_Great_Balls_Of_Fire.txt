You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will, but what a thrill  
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire  
  
I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny  
You came along and moved me honey  
I've changed my mind, your love is fine  
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, woo feels good  
Hold me baby, wellllll  
I want to love you like a lover should  
Your fine, so kind  
I want to tell the world that your mine mine mine mine  
  
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs  
I'm really nervous, but it sure is fun  
Come on baby, drive my crazy  
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!!
