Heh-heh-heh. ..  
Have you heard the news?  
(News? What news?)  
Can't afford no shoes  
(Ow! Get a deal on tape)  
Have you heard the news?  
(News? Can't afford a paper)  
Can't afford no shoes  
(Hi-yo-hi)  
  
Went to buy some cheap detergent  
Some emergent nation got my load  
Got my load  
Got my toad  
That I stowed  
  
Well, well,  
Hey lawdy mama,  
Can't afford no shoes  
Maybe there's a bundle of rags that I could use  
Hey anybody,  
Can you spare a dime  
If you're really hurtin', a nickel would be fine  
Hey everybody  
Nothin' we can buy  
Chump Hare Rama, ain't no good to try  
Recession  
Depression  
  
Wah-ooh-wah-ooh wah-Wah  
Wah-ooh-wah-ooh wah-Wah
