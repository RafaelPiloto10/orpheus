The song of a little bird  
The joy in three little words  
I know it's real  
That's how it feels  
To be loved by you  
The stars from a midnight sky  
The melody from a lullaby  
There's nothing real  
That I wouldn't steal  
To be loved by you  
  
[Chorus]  
To be loved by you  
If everybody knows  
It's only 'cause it shows  
  
A smile to put you on a high  
A kiss that sets your soul alight  
Would it be all right if I spent tonight  
Being loved by you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your love is released  
And you move me with ease  
And you rescue me time after time  
Oh oh you give your all  
And you take it all in your stride  
  
Oh with all the power of a symphony  
That's how my heart beats when you're holding me  
I can't conceal, this is how it feels  
To be loved by you  
Oh yeah, to be loved by you  
If everybody knows, it's only 'cause it shows  
Because I take your love, Everywhere I go  
  
I know what it is I need, it's clear as a shallow stream  
It's as it seems, my only dreams  
To be loved by you
