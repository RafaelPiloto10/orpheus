Losing sleep, in too deep  
Fading sun, what have I done  
Came so close to what I need most  
Nothing left here  
  
Cut the ties, uncovered disguise  
Left behind all intertwined  
Lost control, moved out of the role now  
Nothing's left here  
  
Leave it be  
It was meant for me  
Soul sacrifice  
Forgot the advice  
  
Lost track of time  
In a flurry of smoke  
Waiting anxiety  
For a fair judgement deserved
