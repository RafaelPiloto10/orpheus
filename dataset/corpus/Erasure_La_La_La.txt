Don't be naive,  
Don't deny what you see.  
Where lies the truth?  
Hidden deep, in-between.  
Dance through the night,  
From sublime to extreme.  
Lift your voices high,  
From a whisper to a scream.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
Dance through the night,  
From sublime to extreme.  
Lift your voices high,  
From a whisper to a scream.  
You hang your head down low,  
Like a slave to the scene.  
But you'd be pretty and pure,  
Wrapped up, hip in your teens.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
There has to be a little passion in your life.  
You've got to put the world to rights,  
Before too long. (before too long)  
When I was young I thought that everything was good,  
But how it slowly fades away...  
  
I'll be going away soon,  
Through the warm,  
Whoa ooh (going away soon)  
To the warm.  
Whoa ooh  
Don't be naive,  
Don't deny what you see.  
Where lies the truth?  
Hidden deep, in-between.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la
