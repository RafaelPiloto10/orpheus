To see you when I wake up  
Is a gift I didn't think could be real  
  
To know that you feel the same as I do  
Is a three-fold utopian dream  
  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
So would I be out of line if I said  
I miss you?  
  
I see your picture  
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine  
  
You have only been gone ten days  
But already I'm wasting away  
  
I know I'll see you again  
Whether far or soon  
  
But I need you to know that I care  
And I miss you
