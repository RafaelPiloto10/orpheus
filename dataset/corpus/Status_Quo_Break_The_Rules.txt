Spent a long, long evening in a low down honky-tonk bar  
Pulled a low down lady with a long black honky-tonk car  
I asked no questions, I got no lies  
A one off winner, I didn't want any ties  
And I knew it wasn't right  
Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Took me down on the highway doing too many miles an hour  
And by the way she motored thought we might have made the Eiffel Tower  
She stopped the motor by her own front door  
I knew she'd done it so many times before  
But I was off of the floor  
But everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
I woke up next morning feeling kind of up and down  
'Cos I did not know if I was in or out of the town  
Then I saw the face from the night before  
My purse was empty lying there on the floor  
But like I told you before  
That, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
I spend a low down evening sitting high on a honky-tonk stool  
And I spent my money like a low down honky-tonk fool  
But everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules  
Yes, everybody has to sometimes break the rules
