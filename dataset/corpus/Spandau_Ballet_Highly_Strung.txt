This is the song of little Jo  
She's not the girl I used to know  
Forever screaming all the day and night  
She used to be a diplomat  
But now she's down the laundromat  
They washed her mind and now she finds it hard  
I know her name  
But now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me  
'Cause she can't take no sympathy  
Because she's highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
She's stepping out upon the ledge  
She's got a gun against her head  
She's wired up to blow the power line  
She's walking out upon the knife  
She'll take you to the edge of life  
Just like the song, the pressure is on again  
I know her name  
Ho, but now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me  
'Cause she can't take no sympathy  
Because she's highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
No, no, no  
I know her name  
Ho, but now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me  
'Cause she can't take no sympathy  
Because she's highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
This is the song of little Jo  
She's not the girl I used to know
