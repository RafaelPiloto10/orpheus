Manhattan - T. A,  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Where it's very violent  
A bouquet of violets  
Lies trampled to the ground  
  
Manhattan - T. A.,  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Where it's very violent  
A bouquet of violets  
Lies trampled to the ground  
  
Falling, calling, trying to survive  
Doing a quick-step  
Keeping in stride  
Falling, calling, trying to survive  
Doing a quick-step  
Keeping in stride  
With the changing tide  
  
Manhattan - T. A.,  
With a detour to the deep south side  
Where it's hot and steamy  
Don't go around too dreamy  
You'll be trampled to the ground  
  
Falling, calling...  
  
Can I find a future here?  
Everything is so unclear  
(Give it up, give it up, give it up)  
  
Can I ever find a life  
Under threat of fire and knife  
(Give it up, give it up, give it up)  
Changing tide...  
  
Manhattan - T. A.,  
With a detour to the deep south side  
It's a game we play  
And it's very scary  
With all those maniacs running around, y'know  
  
Manhattan - T. A.,  
With a detour, 18 years old  
Caught under the wheels  
It's a pretty bad deal  
But this is my hometown  
  
Falling, calling, trying to survive  
Doing a quick-step  
Keeping in stride  
Falling, calling, trying to survive  
Doing a quick-step  
Keeping in stride  
With the changing tide,  
Changing tide,  
Changing tide...
