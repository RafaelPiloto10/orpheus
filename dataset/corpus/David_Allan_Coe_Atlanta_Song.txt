I met her in Atlanta she was a dancing in a cafe  
With a price tag on her body and a tombstone in her eye  
You could tell she was not happy by the way she kept on staring  
Past the other side of nowhere at a man she'd like to try  
And the makeup she had painted could not hide the youthful motions  
Of her body fom the music or the crowd  
I started like all the others with my right hand in the pocket  
While she showed us everything the law allowed  
(Play it Pete Drake)  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Twenty bucks an hour later my one bedroom apartment  
I was feeling weak from all the seeds I'd sown  
She was sweet she was gentle as she introduced my body  
To some pleasures it had never ever known  
When I woke up in the morning she was a laying there beside me  
Like a kitten with her face turned to the sun  
And a look of satisfaction on her lips that make me wonder  
If she ever felt ashamed of what we'd done  
So I left her in Atlanta...
