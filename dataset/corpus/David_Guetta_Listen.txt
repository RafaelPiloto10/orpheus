Let's hit the road and away we go  
Take a new direction to a different post  
Maybe we should try and put it on the line  
You've gotta trust me now, turn up the radio  
Tune out the world and roll with the melody  
Baby, listen close and open up your mind  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Soundtrack in the wind, like classic violins  
I can be your rhythm in the silence  
And every time we sing, it echoes in the sky  
Let me close your eyes, help you fantasize  
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night  
Listen to the words as I let 'em fly  
  
Imagine if anywhere  
More than miles, I'll take you there  
Knew one day, from the start  
We'd be as one, now here we are  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
  
Listen, all we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen  
All we gotta do is listen
