Everything comes and goes  
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes  
Things that you held high  
And told yourself were true  
Lost or changing as the days come down to you  
Down to you  
Constant stranger  
You're a kind person  
You're a cold person too  
It's down to you  
It all comes down to you.  
You go down to the pick up station  
Craving warmth and beauty  
You settle for less than fascination  
A few drinks later you're not so choosy  
When the closing lights strip off the shadows  
On this strange new flesh you've found  
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf  
You hurry  
To the blackness  
And the blankets  
To lay down an impression  
And your loneliness  
  
In the morning there are lovers in the street  
They look so high  
You brush against a stranger  
And you both apologize  
Old friends seem indifferent  
You must have brought that on  
Old bonds have broken down  
Love is gone  
Ooh, love is gone  
Written on your spirit this sad song  
Love is gone  
  
Everything comes and goes  
Pleasure moves on too early  
And trouble leaves too slow  
Just when you're thinking  
You've finally got it made  
Bad news comes knocking  
At your garden gate  
Knocking for you  
Constant stranger  
You're a brute-you're an angel  
You can crawl-you can fly too  
It's down to you  
It all comes down to you
