I can tell by your eyes  
That you've probably been crying forever  
And the stars in the sky  
Don't mean nothing to you they're a mirror  
I don't wanna talk about it  
How you broke my heart  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here won't you listen to my heart  
My heart  
  
If I stand all alone  
Will the shadows hide the color of my heart  
Will they be blue for the tears  
Black for the nights we spent apart  
And the stars don't mean nothing to you  
They're a mirror  
I don't wanna talk about it  
How you broke my heart  
Oh if I stay, if I stay here  
Won't you listen to my heart  
  
I don't wanna talk about it  
How you broke my heart  
If I stay, if I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here won't you listen to my heart  
If I stand all alone  
Will the shadows hide the colors of my heart
