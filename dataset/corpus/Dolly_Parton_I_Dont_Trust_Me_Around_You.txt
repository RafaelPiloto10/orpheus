You're standing much too close to me again  
I'd never once touched you  
But in my mind I've already sinned  
You're making it hard for me to be true  
I don't trust me around you  
  
Seems like every place I go I see you there  
I can't keep my eyes off you  
I just stand and stare  
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew  
  
I don't trust me around you  
I don't trust me around you  
I belong to someone else  
Not once have I been untrue  
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself wanting to  
  
I don't trust me around you
