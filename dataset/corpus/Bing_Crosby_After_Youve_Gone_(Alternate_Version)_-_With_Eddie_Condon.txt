After you've gone and left me crying  
After you've gone there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time and I don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
  
After you've gone  
After you've gone  
  
After you've gone and left me crying  
After you've gone there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time and I don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
  
After you've gone  
After you've gone away, so far away  
After you've gone  
After you've gone away
