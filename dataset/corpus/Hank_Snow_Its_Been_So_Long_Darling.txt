It's been so long, darlin'  
Since I had to go away  
It's been so long, darlin'  
And I'll ne'er forget that day  
  
Although you never mentioned it  
You cried that whole day long  
It's been so long, darlin'  
But now I'm comin' home  
  
[Chorus]  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Since I gazed into your eyes  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Do you really realize  
That the thought of seein' you  
It scares me through and through  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Since I had a kiss from you.  
  
It's been so long, darlin'  
But it won't be long now  
It's been so long, darlin'  
But I've kept ev'ry vow  
  
I pray that you'll be waiting  
As you did in days gone by  
It's been so long, darlin'  
Please don't blame me if I cry.  
  
[Chorus]
