I don't know why, I don't know how,  
I thought I loved you but, I'm not sure now,  
I've seen you look at strangers,  
Too many times,  
The love you want, is of a different kind  
  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
  
Remember when we felt the sun,  
A love like paradise,  
How hot it burned,  
A threat of distant thunder,  
The sky was red,  
And where you walked you always,  
Turned ev'ry head  
  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
  
I thought that when we fought  
I was to blame,  
But now I know you play,  
A different game,  
I've seen you dance with danger,  
Still wanting more,  
Add another number, To the score  
  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
When you look around you wonder  
Do you play to win or are you just a bad loser?  
All day, all day, All day, all day,  
  
I don't know why, I don't know how,  
I thought I loved you but, I'm not sure now,  
I hear the thunder crashing, The sky is dark,  
And now a storm is breaking, Within my heart.  
  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,
