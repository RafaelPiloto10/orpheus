I don't want to look around  
And be turned to stone  
All my darkest days awoken  
I'm looking for a new way  
I can't make it on my own  
Lead me to a place wide open  
  
I need a love that takes me higher  
So high I'm never coming down  
  
I don't want to know emptiness  
Take me down to the water  
want to be baptized in your love  
Far away from the loneliness  
Take my heart and wash away the fear  
Let me be baptized in your love  
  
Everybody's going down  
They end up all alone  
Far too many words unspoken  
I know I gotta be there, I'm ready to be shown  
The path of righteousness unbroken  
  
I need a love that takes me higher  
So high I'm never coming down  
  
I don't want to know emptiness  
Take me down to the water  
want to be baptized in your love  
Far away from the loneliness  
Take my heart and wash away the fear  
Let me be baptized in your love  
  
I would be a fool to let you go  
With you I'm reborn  
I'm no longer torn  
Yeah  
I refuse to lose my heart and soul  
I have to be strong  
  
I don't want to know emptiness  
Take me down to the water  
want to be baptized in your love  
Far away from the loneliness  
Take my heart and wash away the fear  
Let me be baptized in your love
