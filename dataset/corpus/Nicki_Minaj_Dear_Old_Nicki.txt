Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at  
I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back  
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha'  
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'  
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break  
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake  
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge  
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge  
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too  
Your B.M.W. every time you came through  
You was the braveheart  
You stole Wayne heart  
You never switched it up  
You played the same part  
But I needed to grow  
And I needed to know  
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show  
So I just deaded you  
Left you in all black  
But dear old Nicki  
Please call back  
  
You told me you'd come when I needed you  
And you said it so sweetly I believed you  
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you  
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that  
  
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor  
Money, fame and power  
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour  
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards  
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess  
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood  
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good  
But you was underground, and I was mainstream  
I live the life now, that we would daydream  
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me  
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me  
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it  
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit  
But its still fuck the media  
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya  
They just deaded you  
Left you in all black  
But dear old Nicki  
Please call back  
  
You told me you'd come when I needed you  
And you said it so sweetly I believe you  
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you  
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that  
  
And yes I'm holdin you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
Oh yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
To that  
  
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
Oh yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
And yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you  
To that
