All the way from Memphis, babe  
In search of something new  
You tell me now  
That Memphis, girl  
Don't hold a thing for you  
Hypnotized by gypsy lies  
Like a moth drawn to the flame  
In the crowd  
You're just a faceless face  
Another nameless name  
Living on the handouts  
Of the Jesus of your own choosing  
The Christ you knew  
In Memphis, girl  
Could not win for losin'  
Love beeds for your rosary  
And your drugs to see you through  
You're telling me  
At seventeen  
You know more that I do  
Say farewell to L.A  
And your little coat of blue  
'Cause meanwhile  
Back in Memphis, girl  
Our mama prays for you  
All the way from Memphis, babe  
In search of something new  
You tell me now  
At seventeen  
You know more than I do
