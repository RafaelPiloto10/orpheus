Somewhere  
In heaven  
There is a place  
Waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
Gave every drop of Blood  
Died on the cross  
so we'd be free.  
  
Oh Oh Oh Oh  
  
Somewhere, Somewhere  
In Heaven  
There's a place  
Waiting, waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
Gave every drop of Blood  
And died on the cross  
So we'd be free.  
  
Somewhere, Somewhere  
In Heaven  
There is a place  
Waiting, waiting for you and me  
  
He made a promise  
When He gave every drop of His blood  
Died on the cross  
So we'd be free.
