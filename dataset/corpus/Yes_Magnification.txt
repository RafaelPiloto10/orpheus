Days that we speak  
I believe that you are right  
Shouldn't chase the demons and the phantoms of the night  
  
Some treat as lovers  
Some treat as slaves  
This fusion of insight is all that we imagine  
  
Speak to me clearly  
You're the magnet to my soul  
I get so distracted trying to reason with it all  
Like the faithful  
I'm clinging to the edge of every world  
Spinning in creation  
So afraid to let my feelings really show  
  
Teach me to teach me  
How the key unlocks the door  
As we open we surrender, holding hands with many more  
There's a feeling that's coming  
There's a feeling so real  
To justify, to magnify, to realize that  
Everything is love  
  
Now, after all the love you have  
You can always get it back  
Knowing how you really see  
Knowing it will come to you  
Knowing it can really be  
  
Magnificate, magnification  
Magnificate, magnification  
First you're smaller being alive  
Growing taller learn to survive  
Magnificate, magnification  
Magnificate, magnification  
First you're smaller being alive  
Listen to your heart  
Growing taller learn to survive  
  
Perception of living  
I realize I'm not alone  
The rings that divide  
Break again on solid stone  
I will show you a necklace  
Where the pearls would all be lost  
Without the thread between together  
This would be the golden thread of trust  
  
Speak to me, teach me  
Magnify the truth you are  
Waiting for the rebeginning birth of every star  
  
A symbol is planted  
On the brow of every child  
To justify, to magnify  
To realize that everything is love  
  
Now giving all the love you have  
You will always get it back  
Giving all the love you have  
You can always get it back  
Giving all the love you have  
Giving all the love  
  
Magnificate, magnification  
Magnificate, magnification  
First you're smaller being alive  
Growing taller learn to survive
