She looked for truth  
Inside a bottle of rain  
Posted an ad  
Then changed her name  
On a roller coaster  
That couldn't be caught  
She left one note  
At the hotel last resort  
  
And it said  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown no  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown,  
Don't let me drown  
  
Well the precious friends  
And their special needs  
They're like a cancer  
That just feeds and feeds  
Saddle up and lets get out of here  
You don't need one more  
To shed one more tear  
You couldn't make a stand now  
You couldn't get it right  
I only got this message now  
Late, late last night  
  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown no  
Don't let me drown  
  
Call me  
  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown,  
  
Don't let me drown
