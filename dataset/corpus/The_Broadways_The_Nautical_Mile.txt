A fistfull of feeling tossed into the water  
The boat has a hole we're sinking take it in stride and stand down  
The world comes much harder than one thousand hard hands  
And when it fights fight back with right minds  
Yes it is uncertain but I'm surely certain that we all must get along  
And take it in hand and pull yourself up  
This comes much harder than one thousand hard hands  
Such in that gut you're in luck  
You've got one thousand people on your side  
Take it in stride and when there's nothing left to patch the hole  
We'll swim together and let the boat sink to the bottom of the stream  
With all it's long lost friends  
(abandoned drown in loneliness not strong enough to hold our dreams)  
And if it comes down to just you and I  
Standing on the last corner of the last town  
Of the last city in the burning world  
You'll still have someone on your side  
Life is bigger, so much bigger than all of this.
