If there's a tear on my face  
It makes me shiver to the bone  
It shakes me, babe  
It's just a heartache that got caught in my eye  
And you know I never cry, I never cry  
  
Sometimes I drink more than I need  
Until the TV's dead and gone  
I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
And the night may pass me by  
But I never cry  
  
Take away, take away my eyes  
Sometimes I'd rather be blind  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
Open it up but don't you leave it alone  
  
'Cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, it ain't never been tried  
And you know I never cry  
Yeah you know I never cry  
Well you know, you know, you know, you know I never cry  
I never cry  
  
Break a heart, go ahead, break a heart of stone  
Open it up, but don't you leave it alone  
'Cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin it ain't never been tried  
And you know I never cry  
I never cry
