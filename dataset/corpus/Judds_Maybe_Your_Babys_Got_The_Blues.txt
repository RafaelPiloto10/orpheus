If you hear her cry at night  
Better turn on your light  
Maybe your baby's got the blues  
When she says there's nothing wrong  
She just wants to be alone  
You can bet your baby's got the blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Women like men to make the first move  
And touch her like he used to  
When there's achin' in her heart  
Only tenderness can find  
Women like men to make them feel alive  
And keep her apron strings untied  
Yes women like men  
To love them through the blues sometime  
  
When her days all run the same  
And she says she thinks she needs a change  
Maybe your baby's got the blues  
If she says she's just a wife  
And so far from the glamorous life  
You can bet your baby's got the blues  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, women like men to love them through the blues sometimes
