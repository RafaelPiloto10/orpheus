She's got an eye on you  
There's nowhere to hide  
She keeps her motives still  
Deep down inside  
  
She shows no mercy, no  
She plays it rough  
She don't want no money  
She just wants to love  
  
Love stealer, raw dealer  
Heart breaker, love taker  
Yeah yeah...  
She walks in the shadows  
  
As she waits for the night  
She gets what she's looking for  
She knows how to fight  
If you see her coming  
  
Then you'd better know  
If your love's for the taking  
She'll steal the show  
She just can't go round there first  
  
Facing the joint  
Then she'll move in  
And get right to the point  
So keep your love locked away  
  
Don't let it show  
Or the love stealer will rock you  
For more than you'll know
