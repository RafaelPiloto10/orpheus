Christmas is here  
Snowflakes filling the air  
People rushing past every display  
  
No time for napping  
There's buying and then wrapping  
The gifts to be given away  
  
Sparkling lights  
All the dazzling sights  
Christmas trees loaded with joy  
  
Hearts full of giving  
Children are living  
For what could be their favorite toy  
  
Christmas is here  
Christmas is here  
It's a wonderful time of the year  
Christmas is here  
Christmas is here  
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year  
  
Families together  
No matter the weather  
Feasting and fun is the goal  
  
Grandma is making  
Sugar cookies are baking  
To warm up the body and soul  
  
Full decoration  
In anticipation of times  
Marked with laughter and cheer  
And day long awaited  
And much celebrated  
Christmas is finally here  
  
Christmas is here  
It's a wonderful time of the year  
Christmas is here  
Christmas is here  
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year  
  
A festive occasion  
A welcome invasion  
Of carolers filling the air  
Song of rejoicing  
And everyone voicing  
A story of hope we all share  
  
Christmas is here  
Christmas is here  
It's wonderful time of the year  
Christmas is here  
Christmas is here  
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year  
Christmas is here  
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year  
  
Christmas is finally here
