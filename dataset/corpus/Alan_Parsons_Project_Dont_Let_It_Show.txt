If it's getting harder to face every day  
Don't let it show, don't let it show  
Though it's getting harder to take what they say  
Just let it go, just let it go  
  
And if it hurts when they mention my name  
Say you don't know me  
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame  
Say you don't own me  
  
Even if it's taking the easy way out  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in, don't tell them anything  
Don't let it,  
Don't let it show  
  
Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say  
Say you don't care, say you don't care  
Even if you want to believe there's a way  
I won't be there, I won't be there  
  
But if you smile when they mention my name  
They'll never know you  
And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame  
They'll never own you  
  
Even if you feel you've got nothing to hide  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in, don't tell them anything  
Don't let it,  
Don't let it show
