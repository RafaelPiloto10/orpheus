I got no style  
I'll take my time  
All those losers on the piss again  
I dose dose away  
  
That's just the way it is  
That's just the way it is  
  
I've got trimm trabb  
Like the flash boys have  
And I can't go back  
Let it flow, let it flow  
I sleep alone  
I sleep alone  
  
That's just the way it is  
Just the way it is  
Just the way it is  
Just the way it is  
Just the way it is  
That's just the way it is  
  
I got trimm trabb  
Like the flash boys have  
And I can't go back  
Let it flow, let it flow  
I sleep alone  
I sleep alone
