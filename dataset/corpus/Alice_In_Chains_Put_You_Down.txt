Heartbreaker, feelin' alright  
Body over, mind  
It's slower, reduction is addictive too  
  
Personality overview  
I can see what the cost will be  
You know I don't need you  
I just can't put you down  
I can see what it all means to me  
Honey I don't need you  
I just can't put you down  
I can't put you down  
  
Hard drinker, feelin' uptight  
Your maker, mine  
It's slower, reduction is addictive too  
  
Personality overview  
I can see what the cost will be  
You know I don't need you  
I just can't put you down  
I can see what it all means to me  
  
Honey I don't need you  
I just can't put you down  
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down  
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down  
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down  
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down  
  
Everything you buy is for the jingle  
Every time you lie it's all the same  
Oh, if you need a rhyme to kill the singer  
Shoot me dead before I may be through
