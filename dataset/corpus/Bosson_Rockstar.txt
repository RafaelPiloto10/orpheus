He's a kid, with a dream  
But he's different from the average teens  
Upper class, respected family, fancy house,  
They've got the money  
But his life is not as fun as it seems  
  
Daddys boy, goes to school, doing well  
He's got the best grades too, as a doctor,  
Or a lawyer professor,  
Or a teacher he has to make his parents dream come true  
  
But he wants to be a Rockstar, oh oh  
With long curly hair he is bangin' his head Rockstar, oh oh  
The girls are getting wild they try to get him into bed  
He's a Rockstar, oh oh  
The crowd is getting crazy  
They are screaming his name Rockstar, oh oh  
Leaving the show with an mtv-host called Elaine  
  
Every day, after school he found a way to earn a buck or two  
When he'd saved, just every penny in a jar, that he was hiding  
He went out and bought his first guitar  
  
Brought it home,  
Sneaked inside, locked the door to his own room to hide, picked it up,  
It was a Gibson plugged it in, and turned the amp on  
It was time to make his dream come alive  
  
He's gonna be a Rockstar oh oh  
Posing for his fans covered with chewinggum tatoos  
Like a Rockstar oh oh  
Always takes his limo to his giant swimming pool  
Rockstar oh oh  
Taking photos for the cover of  
Billboad magazine A Rockstar oh oh  
With a tightest black leatherpants  
And the biggest mouth you've seen....  
  
But when his daddy came home he took his guitar away,  
Music is out of the question and it's starting from today  
I don't care if you say you want to catch the moon  
You're gonna get an education or you're be on your own  
  
Well I don't want your money and  
I don't need your advise I will sleep on the street and  
I'll just roll the dize  
Living day by day like the real rockers do,  
Practice for my break, that is what I'm gonna do!  
So give me my guitar back...  
  
I'm gonna be a Rockstar, oh oh  
Strawberry champagne, I'm having breakfast in my bed  
Rockstar, oh oh  
I refuse to walk a carpet as long as it's not red  
I'm a Rockstar I tried to land my jetplane down on  
Sunset boulevard Rockstar oh oh  
The police wanted me arrested I said 'Put it on my card....
