Wildflowers grow everywhere  
Vibrations flow, things will have to change  
(good evening, madam. It's a recording. Yes.)  
Strange new ideas fill the air  
Some people leave, others grieve  
Some were bare but things will change  
Old concepts go, new ones grow  
All at once the world begins to love again  
(..... Hello uncle bill)  
And the wildflowers grow out of fields  
  
Fields of people  
There's no such thing as a weed  
Seeds of hatred  
Plant them and soon they will breed  
  
(going to the pub, are you? Evening madam.)

Seeds of hatred  
Plant them and soon they will feed
