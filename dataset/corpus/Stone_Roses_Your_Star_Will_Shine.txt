Your star will shine again one day  
Through deep blue velvet skies  
Shine for all the world to see  
The universe in your eyes  
  
When the storm outside is raging  
And the dogs they howl your name  
Lay down, sleep, I'll kiss you  
Your star will shine again  
  
Na na na na na na na na  
  
Hush my darling, don't you cry  
I'll stay by your side until morning  
All through the night, I'll watch the skies  
  
And your distant sun  
Will shine like the gun  
That's trained right between your daddy's eyes
