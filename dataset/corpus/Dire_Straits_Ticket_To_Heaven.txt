Ticket to heaven  
  
I can see what you're looking to find  
in the smile on my face  
in my peace of mind  
in my state of grace  
I send what I can  
to the man from the ministry  
he's a part of heaven's plan  
and he talks to me  
  
now I send what I can to the man  
with the diamond ring  
he's a part of heaven's plan  
and he sure can sing  
now it's all I can afford  
but the lord has sent me eternity  
it's to save the little children  
in a poor country  
  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
I got a ride all the way to paradise  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
all the way to paradise  
  
now there's nothing left for luxuries  
nothing left to pay my heating bill  
but the good lord will provide  
I know he will  
so send what you can  
to the man with the diamond ring  
they're tuning in across the land  
to hear him sing  
  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
I got a ride all the way to paradise  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
all the way to paradise
