Here we go around again Curve of life spiraling  
Everything we've ever known As the seed of life gets blown  
And the miracle of time When will that time just end  
Remember, you decide Take that vow  
Grab that ring It's not a whim  
Not a whim When you be cashing in  
  
Try to turn your life around And all the things you do resound  
And then you can't loose control Say your time has come and then  
Hard to pinpoint find the seam Where that one time ends  
Where that time begins Remember, you decide  
Take that vow Take a stand  
Grab that ring It's not a whim  
It's not a whim It's only time  
That you're cashing in  
  
In the white noise of desire We can't hear a single thing  
Floating round the fragile bough Afflictions of the human soul  
Its beauty immaterial  
  
You decide Stand along  
The fallen ones Take revenge  
Defeated sons Rend that coat  
From seam to seam It's only time  
It's only time That you spend  
You spend It's only time  
You spend Its only time  
You spend It's only life  
That you're cashing in
