I can read the writing on the wall  
You pretend that nothing's changed at all  
I've got just one thing to ask you if it's so  
Just take your memory with you when you go  
  
So I won't have to think about  
The lonely nights I'll be without  
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows  
Take your memory with you when you go  
  
I walk the floor and wonder what went wrong  
I'll have to find a way to carry on  
Why don't you leave before the heartache starts to show  
Take your memory with you when you go  
  
So I won't have to think about  
The lonely nights I'll be without  
Someone to hold me when the cold wind blows  
Take your memory with you  
So I won't have to miss you  
Take your memory with you when you go
