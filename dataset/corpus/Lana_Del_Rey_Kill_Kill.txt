Bound up the stairs  
I'm in the shower  
Do you know I am going to leave you?  
Do you know I am going to leave you?  
  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
All our love is flying in the sand.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I've done every thing I can.  
  
Tell me about Brian and his girl  
Do I know Brian is going to meet you?  
Love you, I do.  
Stay here, I won't.  
As stars fade from your eyes.  
  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
All our love is flying in the sand.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I've done every thing I can.  
  
One, two, make it fun.  
Don't trust anyone.  
One two, make it fun.  
Don't trust anyone.  
  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I have done every thing I can.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I'm in love with a dying man.  
I have done every thing I can.  
  
One, two, make it fun  
Don't trust anyone.  
One, two, make it fun  
Make it fun.
