Dinah-moe  
I couldn't say where she's coming from  
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe  
She stroll on over, say look here, bum  
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me cum  
  
She made a bet with her sister who's a little dumb  
She could prove it any time all men was scum  
I don't mind that she called me a bum  
But I knew right away she was really gonna cum (so I got down to it)  
  
I whipped off her bloomers and stiffened my thumb and applied rotation on her
sugar plum  
I poked and stroked till my wrist got numb  
But I still didn't hear no dinah-moe  
  
[Chorus]  
Dinah-moe humm  
Dinah-moe humm  
Dinah-moe humm  
Where this dinah-moe coming from  
  
Done spent three hours  
An' I ain't got a crumb  
From the dinah-moe,  
Dinah-moe,  
Dinah-moe  
From the dinah-moe humm  
  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you ain't been to it  
  
Cause I can't get into it  
Unless I get out of it  
And I gotta get out of it  
Before I get into it  
  
Cause I never get into it  
Unless I get out of it  
An' I gotta be out of it  
To get myself into it  
  
Just get me wasted  
And you're half-way there  
Cause if my mind's tore up  
Then my body don't care  
  
I rubbed my chinny-chin-chin  
An' said my-my-my  
What sort of thing  
Might this lady get high upon?  
  
I checked out her sister  
Who was holding the bet  
And wondered what kind of trip  
The young lady was on  
The forty dollar bill didn't matter no more  
When her sister got naked and laid on the floor  
  
She said dinah-moe might win the bet  
But she could use a little if I wasn't done yet I told her...  
Just because the sun  
Want a place in the sky  
  
No reason to assume  
I wouldn't give her a try  
So I pulled on her hair  
Got her legs in the air  
  
And asked if she had any cooties on there  
  
She was buns-up kneeling  
Buns up!  
I was wheeling an dealing  
Wheeling and dealing an  
She surrendered to the feeling  
She sweetly surrendered  
An' she started in to squealing  
  
Dinah-moe watched from the edge of the bed  
With her lips just a-twitching an' her face gone red  
Some drool rolling down  
From the edge of her chin  
While she spied the condition  
Her sister was in  
  
She quivered and quaked  
And clutched at herself  
While her sister made a joke  
About her mental health  
  
Till dinah-moe finally  
Did give in  
But I told her  
All she really needed  
Was some discipline...  
  
Kiss my aura...  
Dora...  
M-m-m...  
It's real angora  
Would y'all like some more-a?  
  
Right here on the flora?  
An' how 'bout you, fauna?  
Why want to?  
Mmm...sound like why might be choking on something did you say you want some
more?  
Well, here's some more...  
  
Mmm, sure...listen  
Do you think I could interest you  
In a pair of zircon-encrusted tweezers? mmm...tweezers!  
Here, lemme sterilize 'em...  
Gimme your lighter...  
  
I couldn't say where she's coming' from  
But I just met a lady named dinah-moe  
She stroll on over, say look here, bum  
I got a forty dollar bill say you can't make me cum  
  
I whipped off her bloomers and stiffened my thumb an' applied rotation on her
sugar plum  
I poked and stroked till my wrist got numb  
An' you know I heard some  
  
[Chorus]
