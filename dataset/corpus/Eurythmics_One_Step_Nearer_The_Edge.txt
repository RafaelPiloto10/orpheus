One step nearer the edge  
And you take me so closer.  
One step nearer the edge.  
If I should fall will you throw me down your line?  
(Throw me. Throw me. Throw me.)  
You see when I fall I really go down.  
And it's so uneasying to think you are with me all the time.  
Yes, it's so uneasying.  
Are you really, really with me all the time?  
Will you pull me through the next time?  
Will you lead me though the next time?  
Will You pull me through the next time?  
Will you lead me though the next time?  
The next time?  
The next time?  
The next time?  
The next time? ..  
And I'm one step nearer the edge.  
And you take me so much so closer  
If I should fall will you throw me down your line?  
(Throw me. Throw me. Throw me.)  
You see if I fall, I really go.  
I go down. I go down. I go down.  
Down, down, down.  
(repeat)  
I go down.  
Watch me go.  
I go down.  
(to fade)
