I am only human  
But not everything you say is true  
So then again  
Do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand.  
  
Out on the bridge  
I thought I saw you  
Somewhere between now and never  
So do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand.  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand.  
  
Take me home  
'Cause there's no other place  
I'd rather be.  
Take me back home.  
Cause there's no other place  
Take me back to where all my secrets end  
The way you were catching snakes in the sand.  
  
I am only human  
But not everything you say is true  
So then again  
Do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand.
