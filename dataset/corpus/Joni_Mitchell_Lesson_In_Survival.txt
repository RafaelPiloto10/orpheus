Lesson in Survival  
Spinning out on turns  
That gets you tough  
Guru books-the Bible  
Only a reminder  
That you're just not good enough  
You need to believe in something  
Once I could in our love  
Black road  
Double yellow line  
Friends and kin  
Campers in the kitchen  
That's fine sometimes  
But I know my needs  
My sweet tumbleweed  
I need more quiet times  
By a river flowing  
You and me  
Deep kisses  
And the sun going down  
  
Maybe it's paranoia  
Maybe it's sensitivity  
Your friends protect you  
Scrutinize me  
I get so damn timid  
Not at all the spirit  
That's inside of me  
Oh baby I can't seem to make it  
With you socially  
There's this reef around me  
I'm looking way out at the ocean  
Love to see that green water in motion  
I'm going to get a boat  
And we can row it  
If you ever get the notion  
To be needed by me  
Fresh salmon frying  
And the tide rolling in  
  
I went to see a friend tonight  
'Was very late when I walked in  
My talking as it rambled  
Revealed suspicious reasoning  
The visit seemed to darken him  
I came in as bright  
As a neon light  
And I burned out  
Right there before him  
I told him these things  
I'm telling you now  
Watched them buckle up  
In his brow  
When you dig down deep  
You lose good sleep  
And it makes you  
Heavy company  
I will always love you  
Hands alike  
Magnet and iron  
The souls
