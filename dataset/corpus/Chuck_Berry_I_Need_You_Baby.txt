Please, listen, baby, try and understand  
As sure as a woman needs a man  
I need you baby, I just wanted you then  
But I'm in love with you now  
I walk the floor sprinkled with tears since you've been gone  
Oh, it'd seem like a thousand years  
I need you baby, I just wanted you then  
But I'm in love with you now  
True love like yours is so hard to find  
If you don't come back baby, Lord knows I'll lose my mind  
I need you baby, I just wanted you then  
But I'm in love with you now  
He loved other women and I love only you  
But you fall on him, Lord, like the morning dew  
I need you baby, I just wanted you then  
But I'm in love with you now  
Do you care for me less than you did before ?  
Or don't you love me at all anymore ?  
I need you baby, I just wanted you then  
But I do love you now
