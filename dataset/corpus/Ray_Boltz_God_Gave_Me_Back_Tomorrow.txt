God Gave Me Back Tomorrow  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
There are voices on the road of life  
And I have made choices  
That I know werent right  
And they brought me to my knees  
At the end of a lonely street  
And I am standing here today  
I want to say  
CHORUS:  
God gave me back my tomorrow  
When I threw tomorrow away  
He took this life  
Full of sorrow  
And suddenly everything changed  
The moment it happened  
It was the moment I knew  
It was like walking in the darkness  
When the light comes shining through  
I said that God gave me back tomorrow  
When you're struggling  
With the guilt and shame  
You traded your tomorrows  
And all you got to show for it  
Was heartache and pain  
And it's brought you to your knees  
At the end of a lonely street  
He is standing here today  
And Hell help you say  
CHORUS (repeat)  
The moment it happened  
It was the moment I knew  
It was like walking in the darkness  
When the light comes shining through  
I said that God gave me back tomorrow
