You and me and all that wild  
Losing my collar dammit fly  
Every guy that passes by  
Look at her, look at her oh  
And you say that it's not right  
But where does he think you are tonight  
Does he know you're nasty inside  
Look at her, look at her oh  
  
If you want me take me home and let me use you  
I know we doesn't satisfy like I do  
And does she know that there's nobody quite like you  
So let me tell you all the things I never told you  
  
I got these feelings for you  
And I can't help myself no more  
Can't fight these feelings for you  
No I can't help myself no more  
I, I  
  
You and me let's go all night  
Going so high, we fuck the sky  
Come with me now, fuck that guy  
Look at her, look at her oh  
Now you flash that sexy smile  
And tell me I gotta wait a while  
And it makes me lose my mind  
Look at her, look at her oh  
  
If you want me take me home and let me use you  
I know we doesn't satisfy like I do  
And does she know that there's nobody quite like you  
So let me tell you all the things I never told you  
Yeah

And I can't help myself no more  
Can't fight these feelings for you

It needs to happen now  
Cause I can't spend the rest of my life chasing you around  
I want to get much closer  
You need to tell me how  
Baby, how, how  
Babe cause I

And I can't help myself no more  
Can't fight these feelings for you  
No I can't help myself no more
