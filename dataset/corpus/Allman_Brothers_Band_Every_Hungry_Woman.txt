Yeah sad eyed woman  
Boogie 'til the break of dawn  
Yeah long a-bout the break of day yeah  
Oh your man has up and gone  
  
You got thirteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
Yeah the doctor keep [or "kept"] calling  
Woah found you'd fall-en  
[alternate lyrics: found you bawlin']  
Yeah you backed him in the corner  
Oh you're doing what you want to  
  
You got fourteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
You got fifteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
Yeah the doctor keep [or "kept"] calling  
Woah found you'd fall-en  
[alternate lyrics: found you bawlin']  
Yeah you backed him in the corner  
Oh you're doing what you want to  
  
You got sixteen lovely children  
No proud father knocking at your door  
Yeah but every hungry woman  
Has been in your place before  
  
Oh yeah  
Sad eyed woman  
Ohhhh
