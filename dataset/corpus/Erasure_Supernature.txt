Once upon a time  
Science opened up the door  
We would feed the hungry fields  
Till they couldn't eat no more  
But the potions that were made  
Touched the creatures down below  
And they grew up in a way  
That we'd never seen before  
  
[Chorus]  
Supernature, supernature  
Supernature, supernature  
  
They were angry with the man  
Cause he'd changed their way of life  
And they take their sweet revenge  
As they trample through the night  
For a hundred miles or more  
You could hear the people cry  
But there is nothing you can do  
Even God is on their side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gods will break the ice, and throw it in the air  
The creatures will decide who goes where  
  
How can I explain?  
Things are different today  
Darkness all around, no one makes a sound  
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now  
You can't escape, it's too late  
Look what you've done  
There's no place that you can run  
The monsters made, we must pay  
  
Maybe nature has a plan  
To control the ways of man  
He must start from scratch again  
Many battles must he win  
Till he earns his place on earth  
Like the other creatures do  
Will there be a happy end?  
Now that all depends on you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
