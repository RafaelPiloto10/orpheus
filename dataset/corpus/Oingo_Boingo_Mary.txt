Oh Mary was unhappy with the life that she led  
She was a simple girl without much to say  
So one day she upped and left her dreary home  
And she left all her friends to wander all alone  
And at first she was afraid, she was so far away  
From her home but slowly she got to like it anyway  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
  
Well in time she found  
That mountain that she had been taught  
Her whole life, that she must avoid  
And though at first it hurt, and no one could comfort her  
She finally came to appreciate it  
And she liked it, she liked it--oh wasn't she surprised  
And though still alone, she grew so much inside  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
  
And after a time, she became so sublime  
She could look in people's eyes and read their minds  
Though her hands would sometimes bleed and occasionally  
She would long for her past and the memories they bring  
She decided to return to her old home town  
And her heart was burning with all the things she found  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Please come home  
  
So Mary came back and at first no one recognized her face  
And her friends were all a little bit afraid  
When they heard what she had to say  
They all slowly backed away  
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her  
They said:  
Mary, won't you please come back to us now  
There is still time to repent for all your sins  
And Mary started to cry when she realized  
That she'd never come home again in her life  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Please come home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah....
