Please believe me  
The river told me  
Very softly  
Want you to hold me, oh  
Free fall flow, river flow  
On and on it goes  
Breath under water 'til the end  
Free fall flow, river flow  
On and on it goes  
Breath under water 'til the end  
Yes, the river knows  
Please believe me  
If you don't need me  
I'm going, but I need a little time  
I promised I would drown myself in masticated wine
