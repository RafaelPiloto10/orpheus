Sometimes I think I've lost my mind  
I thought I left my past behind  
I live my life and all I know is  
Follow your dream and don't let go  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
It's my destiny  
  
There is no right, there is no wrong  
There is no place where I belong  
  
I've done my time  
I've held it strong and  
My life is all about this song  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
It's my destiny  
  
If I threw them all away would it change?  
No  
I would live my life again, rearranged  
There's a magic in my heart  
That I feel  
Don't you know that god is love  
And it's real  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
It's my destiny  
  
My destiny  
My destiny  
My destiny  
It's my destiny
