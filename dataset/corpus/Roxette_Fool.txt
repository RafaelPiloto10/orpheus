I was alone  
I told my mouth to shot up 'cause I was talking to myself  
like I always do when I'm stuck  
Well, I was crying  
You could be crying too  
I was screaming throungh the windown, I keep missing you  
And the tears came down from the sky  
And the rain feel hard on my eyes  
  
Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool  
I lose on my own, I'm going back to school  
  
And I will pray, Hallelujah, you'll be breaking every rule  
and come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool  
  
I really tried so hard to design my life  
There's a big black void in head like it's been cut by a knife  
Every time your name comes around this stupidity follows me down  
  
Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool  
I thought I could swim I'm drowning in the pool  
  
And I will pray, Hallelujah, you'll be breaking every rule  
and consider to stay, I'm feeling like a fool  
  
Please, come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool  
I'm feeling like a fool in my heart  
I'm feeling like a fool
