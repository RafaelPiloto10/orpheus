The steps on the stairs  
Aren't really there  
Feel like there's someone watching me  
Shadows on the wall  
Whispers down the hall  
When I look there's nothing to see  
You say that you let her go  
Turn the page and closed the door  
Can't get inside your head  
'Cause when I try, she's there instead  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be  
Boy you're everything I ever wanted  
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
You say that she's gone  
That you've moved on  
So why do I feel her eyes on me  
Invisible chains keep us in pain  
Won't you please tell her set you free?  
Sometimes when you look past me  
Your eyes see someone I can't see  
So I've given up this war  
'Cause I can't fight it anymore  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be  
Boy you're everything I ever wanted  
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave  
The walls are closing in it's so damn hard to breath  
There is nothing I could do about it  
  
I can't compete with a memory  
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?  
There's two of us but it feels like three  
I wish her ghost would just let us be  
Boy you're everything I ever wanted  
But I got to let you go 'cause this love is  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
Haunted  
Haunted  
  
I don't want to fight anymore  
Someone's walking out that door  
  
Haunted  
Haunted
