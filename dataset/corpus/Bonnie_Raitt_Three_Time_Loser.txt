I wonder how many teardrops gonna fall tonight?  
I wonder how many heartaches gonna a woman have in one life?  
  
I lost a lover, lost my friend  
I'm through with love, I just can't win  
  
I'm a three time loser, three time loser  
  
I wonder how many hours for true love I will have to wait  
I wonder how many heartaches for true love I will have to wait  
  
Lost love once, lost love twice  
What kind of love is worth that price  
  
Three time loser  
One two three into into three  
A three time loser  
  
I wonder how many hours for true love I will have to wait  
I wonder how many heartaches for true love I will have to wait  
  
I lost a lover, lost my friend  
I'm through with love and I just can't win  
  
Three time loser babe  
One two three into into three  
Three time loser  
  
Lost love once, lost it twice  
What kind of love is worth that price  
  
Three time loser babe, see I'm three time loser babe
