It only lasts  
Until it goes  
It only gives  
Until it leaves  
  
Oh my god  
Its only is love  
  
CHOURUS:  
Oh, i gotta love  
I gotta love  
I gotta love you  
  
We need some help  
With are love  
But it dosn't all last  
Until you lose it  
  
CHOURUS  
  
If you won't love  
I will love you  
Please baby  
Lets live and love together  
  
CHOURUS  
  
CHOURUS  
  
CHOURUS  
  
(repeat again again whille fading till no sound heard)
