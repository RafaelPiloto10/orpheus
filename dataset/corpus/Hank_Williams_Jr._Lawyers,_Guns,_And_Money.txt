I went home with the waitress  
The way I always do  
How was I to know  
She was with the  
Russians too?  
  
I was gambling in Havana  
I took a little risk  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
They'll get me out of this, hah!  
  
I'm the innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck  
Between the rock  
And a hard place  
And I'm down on my luck  
Yes I'm down on my luck  
Well I'm down on my luck  
  
I'm hiding in Honduras  
I'm a desperate man  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
All right  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Huh!  
Uhh!  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Uhh!  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Hyah!  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Ooh!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Uh!
