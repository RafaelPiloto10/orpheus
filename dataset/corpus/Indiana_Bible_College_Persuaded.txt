Verse 1  
I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels  
Can separate me from the love of God  
We are all His children and with all of our hearts we declare  
We can make it farther than ever before with the Lord  
  
Verse 2  
No condemnation to them who are in Jesus  
We have been freed from the law of sin  
We his people are walking in righteousness  
And with our hearts declare  
We can make it farther that ever before with the Lord

Endless in measure and all powerful  
Nothing can separate us from your love (x2)

Nothing can separate, nothing can separate (x4)
