Looking to the mirror  
From the other side  
Seeing her reflection  
And it blows my mind  
Trying to deny it  
But damage is done  
I'll just run as always  
But the race is run  
  
You've got to tell me it's over now  
I'm trapped inside of a dream  
The crushing weight on my shoulders now  
Is bearing down and it seems  
There's just no easy way out  
No easy way out  
  
Read the daily fiction, Superman is dead  
Crushing coins of silver, imitating lead  
Then if you will fix the children of the past  
I guess their's isn't welcome, doesn't time move fast  
  
You've got to tell me it's over now  
I'm trapped inside of a dream  
The crushing weight on my shoulders now  
Is bearing down and it seems  
There's just no easy way out  
No easy way out  
  
Night in the shadow of man  
This is the dawn of the dead  
Don't let it live in your head  
And then now as the sabbath begins  
It wakes your nightmare again  
So run away if you can  
So just run  
Run as fast as you can  
  
You've got to tell me it's over now  
I'm trapped inside of a dream  
The crushing weight on my shoulders now  
Is bearing down and it seems  
There's just no easy way out  
  
Too late too tell me it's over now  
Falling apart at the seams  
No angel sits on my shoulders now  
I hold my head and it screams  
There's just no easy way out  
No easy way out
