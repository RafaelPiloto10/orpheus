Who's goin down  
Who's goin down - who's goin down  
I ride my elevator  
Through the shafts of your heart  
When you climb aboard baby  
There's no getting off  
  
I'm a silent operator won't you please take my hand  
I am so polite - I'm the elevator man  
  
Friction and harmony - who's gonna ride with me  
I'm the elevator man  
  
Who's going down who's comin with me  
Who wants to take a chance  
On a piece of abstract reality  
It's only just a dance  
Won't you come and ride with the elevator man  
Who's goin down yeah - movin slow without a sound  
  
Who's going down - who's going down - who's going down
