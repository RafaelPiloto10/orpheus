When you are young, the thought of the day is  
Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules.  
You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that  
Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last.  
And you smile as it's going past.  
Each morning arrives, and so much is new  
You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you.  
The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night  
You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love  
  
You live every day, as fast as it comes  
And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.  
These times will change, and people must grow but  
Until you do, you live the only life that you know  
And the wild fire lets you go.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,  
Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew  
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love
