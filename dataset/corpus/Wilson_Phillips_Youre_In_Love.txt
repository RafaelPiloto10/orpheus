Open the door and come in  
I'm so glad to see you my friend  
I don't know how long it has been  
Having those feelings again  
But now I see that you're so happy  
And ooh, it just sets me free  
And I'd like to see us as good of friends  
As we used to be  
Ah....My love...Ah  
  
You're in love  
That's the way it sould be  
'Cause I want you to be happy  
You're In Love  
And I know that you're not in love with me  
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that You're In Love  
I can let you go  
'Cause I know that You're In Love...  
  
Sometimes it's hard to believe  
That you're never coming back for me  
I've had this dream that you'd always be by my side  
Oh, I could've died  
But now I see that you're so happy  
And ooh, it just sets me free  
And I'd like to see us as good of friends  
As we used to be  
Ah....My love...Ah  
  
You're in love  
That's the way it sould be  
'Cause I want you to be happy  
You're In Love  
And I know that you're not in love with me  
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that You're In Love  
I can let you go  
'Cause I know that You're In Love...  
  
I tried to find you but you were so far away  
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me  
Someday, someday, someday...  
Ooh, You're In Love  
  
Ooh, it's enough for me to know that You're In Love  
Now I'll let you go  
'Cause I know that You're In Love...No  
No, No, No, No, No, No, No.. Ooh...
