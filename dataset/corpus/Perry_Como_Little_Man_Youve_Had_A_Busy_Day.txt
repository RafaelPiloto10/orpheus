Little man you're cryin', I know why you're blue  
Someone took your kiddy-car away  
Better go to sleep now  
Little man you've had a busy day...  
  
Johnny won your marbles, tell you what we'll do  
Dad will get you new ones right away  
Better go to sleep now  
Little man you've had a busy day...  
  
You've been playin' soldier, the battle has been won  
The enemy is out of sight  
Come along there soldier, put away your gun  
The war is over for tonight...  
  
Time to stop your schemin', time your day was through  
Can't you hear the bugle softly say?  
Time you should be dreamin'  
Little man you've had a busy day...  
  
Time you should be dreamin'  
Little man you've had a busy day...
