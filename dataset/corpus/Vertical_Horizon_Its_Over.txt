I'm here  
Wide awake again  
There's fear  
There's something I call a friend  
Hello again  
It's been a while since I saw you here  
I don't remember you saying goodbye, no  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Here we go  
Jump to the stars above  
So low  
Why do I fall to love  
Hello, my love  
  
This voice never called your name  
This boy will never be the same  
  
Oh, it don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Don't let it end up this way  
Don't spend another night afraid  
Don't let it end up this way, hey  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It don't matter, it's over  
here I've been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
I'm here  
Wide awake again
