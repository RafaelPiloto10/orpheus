Lines form on my face and hands  
Lines form from the ups and downs  
I'm in the middle without any plans  
I'm a boy and I'm a man  
  
I'm eighteen  
And I don't know what I want  
Eighteen  
I just don't know what I want  
Eighteen  
I gotta get away  
I gotta get out of this place  
I'll go runnin' in outer space  
Oh yeah  
  
I got a  
Baby's brain and an old man's heart  
Took eighteen years to get this far  
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about  
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt  
Cause I'm  
  
Eighteen  
I get confused every day  
Eighteen  
I just don't know what to say  
Eighteen  
I gotta get away  
  
Lines form on my face and my hands  
Lines form on the left and right  
I'm in the middle  
The middle of life  
I'm a boy and I'm a man  
I'm eighteen and I like it  
Yes I like it  
Oh I like it  
Love it  
Like it  
Love it  
Eighteen!  
Eighteen!  
Eighteen!  
Eighteen and I like it
