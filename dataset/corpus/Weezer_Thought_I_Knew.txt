Sorry  
About my past life  
Sorry  
But we just missed  
Sorry it had to end up  
Like this  
  
Sorry  
If I caused you pain  
Sorry  
I forgot your name  
Sorry  
But you left me out  
In the rain  
  
[Chorus]  
Thought I knew  
You better than  
Thought I knew  
Your intentions  
Thought I knew  
But I didn't have  
A clue  
Not a single damn thing  
Was true  
  
Sorry  
If I caused you harm  
Sorry  
I'm no good luck charm  
Sorry  
You didn't end up  
In my arms  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that I  
World's gone down  
We've traded away  
Blew out the spark  
And now we're left  
With broken hearts  
Tryin' to find  
A new place to start  
  
[Chorus: x2]
