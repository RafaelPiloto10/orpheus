It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That feeling everywhere  
It must have been the pretty lights  
That glistened in the silent night  
It may be just the stars so bright  
That shined above you  
Our first Christmas  
More than we'd be dreaming of  
Oh, Saint Nicholas had his fingers crossed  
That we would fall in love  
It could have been the holiday  
The midnight ride upon a sleigh  
The countryside all dressed in white  
That crazy snowball fight  
It could have been the steeple bell  
That wrapped us up within its spell  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe  
Our first Christmas  
More than we'd be dreaming of  
Oh, Saint Nicholas must have known that kiss  
Would lead to all of this  
It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That made me love you  
On Christmas Eve our wish came true  
That now I've fell in love with you  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe  
It must have been the mistletoe  
It must have been the mistletoe  
One kiss to know, I love you so
