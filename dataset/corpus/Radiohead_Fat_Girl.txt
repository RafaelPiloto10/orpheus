A child of four  
She wanted more  
She wanted everything  
She wanted boys  
But they won't dare  
She ran around the playground  
Studied their faces  
They didn't want to play with her  
It never ends  
You'll have to starve yourself half to death  
You're never with them  
Your just a fat girl  
A fat girl  
  
A fat girl  
A fat girl  
(Asoona-shug?)  
She never moved  
As fast as all the rest  
She was the last  
Last in the pew  
You starve yourself half to death  
It never ends  
Your just a fat girl  
A fat girl  
A fat girl  
A fat girl
