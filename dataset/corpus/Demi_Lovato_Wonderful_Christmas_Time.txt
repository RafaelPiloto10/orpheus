La la da, ta da!  
The mood is right, the spirit's up  
We're here tonight and that's enough  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The party's on, the feeling's here  
That only comes this time of year  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The choir of children sing their song  
They practiced all year long!  
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong  
La la la la la, la la la la la  
Yeah  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
(Christmas time!)  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
The word is out about the town  
To lift a glass and don't look down!  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time  
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
