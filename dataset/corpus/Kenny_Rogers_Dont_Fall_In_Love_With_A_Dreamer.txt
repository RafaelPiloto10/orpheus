[Kenny]  
Just look at you sitting there  
You never looked better than tonight  
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'd stay  
Like I've done so many times  
  
[Kim Carnes]  
I was so sure this would be the night  
You'd close the door and want to stay with me  
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'll stay  
Like I've done so many times  
  
[Both]  
Don't fall in love with a dreamer  
'cause he'll always take you in  
Just when you think you've really changed him  
He'll leave you again  
Don't fall in love with a dreamer  
'Cause he'll break you every time  
  
Kim: oh, put out the light  
Kenny: just hold on  
Both: before we say goodbye  
  
[Kim]  
Now it's mornin' and the phone rings  
And you say you've gotta get your things together  
You just gotta leave before ya change your mind  
  
[Kenny]  
And if ya knew what I was thinkin', girl  
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time  
  
Both: don't fall in love with a dreamer  
Kim: 'cause he'll always take you in  
  
[Both]  
Just when you think you've really changed him  
He'll leave you again  
Don't fall in love with a dreamer  
  
Kenny: 'cause he'll break you every time  
Kim: oh, put out the light  
Kenny: just hold on  
Both: before we say goodbye  
Both: before we say goodbye  
Both: goodbye
