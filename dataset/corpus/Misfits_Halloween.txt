Bonfires burning bright  
Pumpkin faces in the night  
I remember Halloween  
  
Dead cats hanging from poles  
Little dead are out in droves  
I remember Halloween  
  
Brown leafed vertigo  
Where skeletal life is known  
I remember Halloween  
  
This day anything goes  
Burning bodies hanging from poles  
I remember Halloween  
  
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween  
Candy apples and razor blades  
Little dead are soon in graves  
I remember Halloween  
  
This day anything goes  
Burning bodies hanging from poles  
I remember  
  
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween  
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
