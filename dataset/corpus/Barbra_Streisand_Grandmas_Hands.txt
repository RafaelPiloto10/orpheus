Grandma's hands, clapped in church on Sunday morning  
Grandma's hands, played the tambourine so well  
Grandma's hand used to issue out a warning  
She'd say, "Baby, don't you run so fast  
Might fall on a piece of glass, might be snakes there in my grass"  
Grandma's hands, I'm talkin' 'bout my grandma's hands  
Grandma's hands, soothed the local unwed mother  
My grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell  
Grandma's hands used to lift her face  
And tell her she'd say, "Baby, grandma understands  
But you really loved that man and put herself in Jesus' hands"  
Grandma's hands, yeah, I'm talking, I'm talking 'bout my grandma, yeah  
Grandma's hands used to hand me a piece of candy  
Grandma's hands, picked me up each time I fell  
Grandma's hands, boy, they really came in handy  
She'd say, "Nettie, don't you whip that girl  
What you wanna spank her for she didn't drop no apple-core"  
But I don' have grandma anymore  
If I get to Heaven I'll look for grandma's hands  
I'm talking 'bout my grandma, talking 'bout my grandma, oh yeah  
I'm talking 'bout my grandma, I'm talking 'bout my grandma, yeah  
Grandma, grandma, I'm talking 'bout my grandma
