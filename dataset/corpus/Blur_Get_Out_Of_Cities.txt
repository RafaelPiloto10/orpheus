I got the licence  
I got dirty knees  
I've been swinging in trees  
A paid up member  
I've been eating fleas  
Running naked in the breeze  
Catatonia itch  
Catalonia stitch  
Oh, I've been running for miles  
I start to tingle from my head to my toes  
Oh, tomorrow it's a taint on the nose  
Hetty hetty hetty hetty oh it's a taint on the nose  
  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah get out of cities, return to
the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees  
  
She's in a sort of a capital freeze  
Cos the petrol's done a whole lot for me  
Catatonia itch  
Catalonia stitch  
Pray tomorrow is it-chy itchy itch  
Go to yourself on your map  
  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah get out of cities, return to
the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah  
Get out of cities, and return to the trees  
Get out of cities, return to the trees, yeah yeah

Get out of cities, and return to the trees
