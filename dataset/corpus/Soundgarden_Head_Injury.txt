Head injury, head injury, head injury  
You got a kiss for me, it hits me hard  
My hands on my head, your words are like arrows  
My hands on my head, there's permanent damage  
  
Head injury, head injury, head injury  
  
You got a kiss for me, it's sweet and frail  
You got a fist for me, sure to impale  
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows  
My hand on my head, my mind in shambles  
Head injury
