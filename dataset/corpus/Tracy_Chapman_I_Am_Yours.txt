When all my hopes and dreams  
Have been betrayed  
I stand before you  
My hands are empty  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine  
  
I fall and stumble  
Flat on my face  
And I'm shamed and humble  
In disgrace  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine  
  
When voices call me  
To question my faith  
When mis-perception  
Taints my love with hate  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine  
  
When time decides  
You won't stop for me  
When the hawks and vultures  
Are circling  
  
I am yours, if you are mine  
I am yours, if you are mine.
