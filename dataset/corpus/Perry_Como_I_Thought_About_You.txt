I thought about walkin'  
Thought about talkin'  
Thought about singin'  
Singin' the blues!  
  
Thought about cryin'  
Once, I even thought of dyin'  
But, baby, most of all  
I thought about you!  
  
Thought of just bein'  
People I'm seein'  
Thought about doin'  
The things that they do  
  
Thought about livin'  
Thought about forgivin'  
But, baby, most of all  
I thought about you!  
  
Thought about just bein'  
People I'm seein'  
Thought about doin'  
The things that they do  
  
Thought about livin'  
Thought about forgivin'  
But, baby, most of all  
I thought about you!  
  
But, baby, most of all  
Yes, I thought about you!  
Thought about you
