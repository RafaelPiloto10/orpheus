They've been out on the road so long  
Now they're working their way through all the dirty towns  
Singing their hearts out  
To the drunks who haunt the bars  
Still the ghosts will keep on calling  
Sing it out  
Sing it out for love again  
  
Guess she heard through a million tears  
"When you sing you should brush the hair out of your eyes"  
"Come and sit by me girl  
Would you like to share my beer?"  
Feel his hand slip down her shoulder  
Sing it out  
Sing it out for love again  
  
But she's lonely - thinking of home  
Thinking is sad  
And knowing she lost the life  
She could have had  
  
Watching trucks as they roll on by  
And she'll wave as they disappear around the bend  
Shrugging her shoulders  
And she'll head back to the bar  
"Cue the band" the boss is shouting  
Sing it out  
Sing it out for love again  
  
But she's lonely - thinking of home  
Thinking is sad  
She's thinking about the good times  
Never had  
And wondering why the bad times  
Get so bad
