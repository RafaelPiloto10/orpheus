Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
And I asked her, where you going to?  
Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
She said she'd found somebody new  
Found myself all alone  
Ain't no fun on your own  
Now I'm like a rolling stone  
  
So I met another lady and so many more  
Didn't really know which way to go  
So I met another lady and so many more  
But no-one did I get to know  
Found myself all alone  
Ain't no fun on your own  
Now I'm like a rolling stone  
  
Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
Now you know where she was going to  
Well I saw my little lady walking down the street  
Now you know what I've been going through  
Found myself all alone  
Ain't no fun on your own  
Living like a rolling stone  
  
I was like a rolling....  
I was like a rolling stone  
  
Walking alone, a street with no phone  
Could I be younger most of the time?  
Doing her wrong, taking so long  
Should I do all things in my own time?  
May I be wiser, yes, than most men will ever be?  
May I be younger most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
  
May I be wiser, yes, than most men will ever be?  
May I be younger most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time  
Most of the time, most of the time
