The human race started with Adam and Eve  
They lived in a world where they were free  
So listen and beware that this is Hell  
'cause they ate the fruit from the tree  
[CHORUS]  
Mighty force  
Evil's mighty force  
When Satan took a Serpent form  
The couple's destiny was then traced  
Leaving God's wrath frustrated  
They couldn't resist the Serpent Temptation  
[CHORUS]  
Mighty force  
Evil's mighty force  
Mighty force  
Evil's mighty force  
We now live in a world of civilization  
We're still affected by the Serpent Temptation  
Technology won't help you to get salvation  
The devil doomed God's creation  
So let's destroy the devil's fucking nation  
[LEAD]
