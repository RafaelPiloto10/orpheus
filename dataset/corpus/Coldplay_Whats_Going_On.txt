(Chris feat. Bono on All Star Tribute)  
  
Bono: Mother, mother  
There's too many of you crying  
  
Chris: Brother, brother, brother  
There's too many of you dying  
You know you've got to find a way  
To bring some lovin' here to stay  
  
Bono: Father, father  
We don't need to escalate  
And war is not the answer  
For only love can conquer hate  
  
Chris: You know we've got to find a way  
To bring some lovin' here to stay  
Picket lines won't block our way  
  
Bono: Don't punish me with brutality  
Talk to me, and you can see  
What's going on  
What's going on  
What's going on  
What's going on  
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong  
But who are they to judge us  
Together we can be strong  
  
Chris: You know we've got to find a way  
To bring some lovin' here to stay  
Picket lines won't block our way  
Don't punish me with brutality  
Talk to me, so you can see  
What's going on, What's going on  
What's going on, What's going on  
What's going on, What's going on  
What's going on, What's going on
