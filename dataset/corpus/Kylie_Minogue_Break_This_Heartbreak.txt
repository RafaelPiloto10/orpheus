(Verse)  
In the night alone I stay awake  
Even stars so bright, they fade away  
But we can't escape what we're made  
But it can wait, this heartbreak  
  
(Chorus)  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
  
(Verse 2)  
Every time, it's said to?  
No signs to tell us what to do  
But we can't escape what we're made  
But it can wait, this heartbreak  
  
(Chorus)  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
  
(Bridge)  
But we can't escape what we're made  
But it can wait, this heartbreak  
  
(Chorus)  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break
