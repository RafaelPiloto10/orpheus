Don't get any big ideas  
They're not gonna happen  
You paint yourself white  
And fill up with noise  
There'll be something missing  
And now that you found it  
It's gone  
Now that you feel it  
You don't  
You've gone off the rails  
  
She stands stark naked  
And she beckons you to bed  
Don't go, you'll only want  
To come back again  
  
So don't get any big ideas  
They're not gonna happen  
You'll go to Hell  
For what your  
Dirty mind is thinking  
  
And now that you found it  
It's gone  
Now that you feel it  
You don't  
It's gone forever
