I never much believed in reincarnation  
Thought it was only people's imagination  
But now I'm forced into some reconsideration  
'Cause something's happened to my cat  
That deserves some explanation  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
My kitty is the bard  
He used to be a playwright  
Now he's digging up the yard  
He's still a cat in most respects  
He likes to meow and purr  
But now I introduce him as the cat  
That wrote Richard the third  
I took him to see Phantom  
He said it was quite nice  
But he can't go see Miss Saigon  
Until he kills some mice  
(Until he kills some mice)  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
It sometimes seems so deep  
The guy who wrote Twelfth Night  
Chews on my socks while I'm asleep  
I'm really quite impressed  
I own the cat who wrote MacBeth  
But if something's rotten in this state  
It's just his fishy breath  
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someone's pet  
And gettin' neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
He rarely ever talks  
He makes his loudest statements  
Standing in the litter box  
He sleeps on all my shelves  
And throws my books about the house  
It doesn't sound like prose  
When he bats a squeaky mouse  
Sam Beckett's plays are witty,  
Same thing for Bernard Shaw,  
Oscar Wilde is pretty,  
But none of them have paws  
(None of them have paws)  
William Shakespeare's in my cat  
He chases bits of fluff  
John Milton's in my goldfish  
But I never liked his stuff  
I'm thinking that Franz Kafka  
Really came back as a bug  
And I hope Andrew Lloyd Webber  
Will stay underneath my rug  
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someone's pet  
And gettin' neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!  
Take it, Trevor!  
He wrote Romeo and Juliet  
But his greatest story yet  
Is coming back as someone's pet  
And gettin' neutered by the vet  
He got his paws caught in a net  
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!
