Break a line to a bunch of dimes then you grind up  
Money got me sure my ass can't even hold my pants up  
Twenty niggas standing on the flat all getting off  
Found a jacket, get em bro, late with his head soft  
Try me in the six, I'ma raise this forty five up  
Shave a brick, put it back together, that's a lineup  
We mix the chick, use a little cut, that's a temp fade  
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade  
  
I'm a multimillionaire, I got a couple hundred on me  
And no more mac, I told the scrap, I make you stick yourself like Tony  
I give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me  
And I'm so bossy in my altar, smoking kush and sipping coffee  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
Money is a motto, if you speak it then I'm with ya  
Any sideline nigga, they get cropped out the picture  
If you ask me, yeah I'm ready, got your hoe on a mission  
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician  
Boy I'm all about a chick  
She don't ask no questions, boy she all about the nig  
Say she want to crash so I let my partners rip  
Looking at this nigga that stay flyer than a jet  
They don't hear me yet  
  
I'ma get that check, that money  
Y'all niggas out here funny  
You know y'all nigga on the go  
Gotta have that green light gumby  
I'ma fool with it though, too clumsy  
On the clock monday through sunday  
Everyday gotta get that money  
And I learned that from the big homie  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money  
  
I'm like eleven of them back, give me that fucking walkie talkie  
Then get lost cause when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me  
And these hoes count the vapors like biz marquee  
It's since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me  
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me  
I get angry then I cut through whoever camouflaged veep  
Better workers, that's my killers, ain't gonna jeopardize me  
I know these fuck niggas with they could paralyze me  
Walk, walk, walk  
  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (pick up that money)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny (y'all niggas too funny)  
Hit your bitch then leave her with no money (she broke)  
They said I couldn't get rich, I hid that money (I did it)  
All that sideline talk don't make no money (y'all niggas out crocked)  
Bout that bread, y'all niggas out here too funny  
I hit your bitch then leave her with no money
