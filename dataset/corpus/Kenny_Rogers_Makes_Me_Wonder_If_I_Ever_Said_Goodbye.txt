Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye  
She at times still comes around  
Though she's someone else?s now  
And I can't let down, no matter how I try  
If I leave her then I find  
She's no farther than my mind  
Makes me wonder, if I ever said goodbye  
Night and day it?s all the same  
Pour some whiskey on my flame  
And burn another memory in my mind  
Through the years she's moved up town  
While I come a long way down  
Makes me wonder, if I ever said goodbye  
Yes, she always says hello  
The way she used to  
But Lord, she only said goodbye one time  
Heaven knows I live in hell  
With a barroom for myself  
Makes me wonder, if I ever said goodbye  
Makes me wonder, if I ever said goodbye
