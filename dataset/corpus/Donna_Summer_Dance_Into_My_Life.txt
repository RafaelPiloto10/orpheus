Dance into my life, only for a while  
Whirl me round and round  
Dance me like an angel child  
He's passing through my world  
He doesn't even know  
Time's not on my side  
No word or goodbye, I'll go  
  
So dance on, right now I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
Just dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes, in my eyes  
  
Dance into my life  
Hold the moment fast  
Make believe in us  
Nothing real in life can last dance within my life  
Dance me to the door  
I can't see the time, but the time has come for sure  
  
So dance on, right now I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
Just dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes, in my eyes  
  
Dance with me, dance with me  
Won't you dance with me  
Dance with me, dance with me  
Won't you dance with me  
  
So dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
So dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home
