She was a wild Indian woman and she drove me wild  
She was a wild Indian woman till she had my child  
  
You don't need your horses baby, you got me to ride  
You don't need your feathers, I'll keep you warm inside  
She's got dark brown eyes and long long black hair  
She's got a peaceful side but I just don't know where  
  
She used to sleep on the prairie with the stars above  
She used to hunt in the woods till I caught her love  
  
You don't need your horses baby, you got me to ride  
You don't need your feathers, I'll keep you warm inside  
She's got dark brown eyes and long long black hair  
She's got a peaceful side but I just don't know where
