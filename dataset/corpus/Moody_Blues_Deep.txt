Every time I hear the sound of the rain  
Beating on my roof again  
I want to taste your love  
And I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.  
Every time I lift my eyes to the sky  
Something in my heart asks why.  
I want to know the truth  
And I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.  
  
Like the footprints  
Disappearing from the sand,  
I try to catch the thought.  
It slips right through my hand  
And, as the darkness  
Throws it's cloak upon the ground,  
I start to run to you.  
I've got to take you down,  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.  
  
Every time I feel I'm losing my way  
The power of your love remains.  
I want to touch your love  
An' I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep. deep.  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.
