There ain't too much chance for opportunity  
In this town that I live in  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do with me  
And it's getting hard to contend  
With the fact that I ain't going nowhere  
If I don't get out of here  
I need a change of luck and a pick-me-up  
Something more than the bars and the beers  
  
I need something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
Cause I got a bad case of the blues  
Something to believe in  
Something to make me feel right  
Something to believe in  
Is that asking too much out of life  
  
Well I quit my job  
And I'm leaving today  
Cause two hundred a week, it don't make it  
I got a ticket going to L.A.  
And I'm hoping I can take it  
Cause I got enough money for about a month before I'll be back on the bus  
But I got faith in me and all new things I see  
I just need a little good luck  
  
Well I was getting down  
Soon I'd have to leave town  
And I was out walking the street  
When I met a girl  
By the burger world  
And I was needing her company  
By the way she was dressed  
I knew what to expect  
When we got to her motel room  
Ah, but when she found out I came from her hometown  
She starting crying and Lord I did too  
  
I need something to believe in  
Ah, baby something to look forward to  
Ah, do you feel like I do  
Something to believe in  
She said please stay with me tonight  
I want something to believe in  
Just talk to me and hold me tight  
  
She was just eighteen  
And I couldn't believe  
What had happen since she left home  
I thought I had some pains  
But it wasn't the same  
As the hell she had known  
So we packed our stuff  
And we got on the bus  
And now it's back to the same old grind  
But if you could have seen  
The way she looked at me  
When she saw the city limit sign  
  
We got something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
And I believe in me and you  
Something to believe in  
Holding each other tight  
Something to believe in  
That special something called being in love to get us by
