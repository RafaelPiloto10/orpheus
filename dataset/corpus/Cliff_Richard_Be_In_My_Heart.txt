What did I ever do for you, that you should die for me  
And what did I ever give to you, that you should live in me  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way  
As I was, I am and always will be, will be  
Be in my heart, be in my head  
Be in my soul tonight  
Live in my words, let it be said  
Live in my life tonight  
Pray that I never take in vain, the name I hold most dear  
His love in very heart of me, casts out all doubt and fear  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way  
As I was, I am and always will be, will be  
Be in my heart, be in my head  
Be in my soul tonight  
Live in my words, let it be said  
Live in my life tonight  
Tonight we shall sweetly sleep  
Tonight by still waters deep  
Tonight for my soul to keep, still waters lead me to your  
Still waters, I need to drink of your still waters  
Now that I know the kind of love that comes to fill me up  
Fill me anew with love from you and overflow my cup  
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way  
As I was, I am and always will be, will be  
Be in my heart, be in my head  
Be in my soul tonight  
Live in my words, let it be said  
Live in my life tonight  
Still waters, running deep  
Still waters, my soul to keep  
Still waters, it's your love flowing over me
