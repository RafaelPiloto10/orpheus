Trying to be misunderstood  
But it doesn't do me any good  
Love the way that they smile at me  
And that face for eternity  
Now let them all fly off  
When it comes down  
It all comes down  
And you will not be found  
When its over  
It's all over  
Even if I make a sound  
  
I'll be misunderstood  
By the beautiful and good in this city  
None of this was planned  
Take me by the hand just don't try and understand  
  
Trying to be misunderstood  
Just a product of my childhood  
Still I find myself outside  
You can't say I haven't tried  
Perhaps I tried to hard  
No excuses  
Won't apologise  
Justify your life  
Come find me  
Tell them to me  
Look me in the eyes  
  
I'll be misunderstood  
By the beautiful and good in this city  
None of this was planned  
Take me by the hand  
Just don't try and understand  
  
Can't forgive sorry to say  
You don't know your guilty anyway  
Isn't it funny how we don't speak, the language of love
