Candace: Me, myself and I  
Don't see eye to eye  
Me, myself and I  
Don't get along  
Me, myself and I  
Can finally say goodbye  
This collaboration always felt so wrong  
Busting Candace: There's two of us on the scene  
And I don't want to sound mean  
But I'll tell you that I'm happy without me  
I've been holding me back  
But now I'm on my own track  
We're done. Finito, I'm free  
  
Romance Candace: From here on out  
We can both exist peacefully  
Without all of this struggle and internal strife  
Busting Candace: (Internal strife)  
Romance Candace: Now that we're separate, we can do anything  
So don't let the door hit you  
Have a nice life  
Busting Candace: (Have a nice life)  
  
Busting Candace: I'm through with myself  
I'm better off without her  
Romance Candace: (Myself and I)  
Busting Candace: I'm through with myself  
I'm better off without her  
Me, myself and I  
Don't get along  
Romance Candace: (Without her)
