I've been watching Lucy all week  
I've been watching her at school  
I know her schedule, I know it well  
I know exactly when she's leaving  
Oh Lucy, take my hand  
How can I make you understand?  
I'm not a stranger, I am a friend  
I'm gonna take you home to daddy later  
Such beautiful eyes you have  
Oh, such beautiful hair  
You must be at least seven years of age, am I right now?  
As if I really care  
'Cause you're his daughter, his little daughter  
The one I'm supposed to have hurt  
But I could never, I could never  
I could never hurt a little girl like you  
Oh Lucy, take my hand  
How can I make you understand?  
I'm not a stranger, I am a friend  
I'm gonna take you home to daddy later  
Such beautiful eyes you have  
Such beautiful hair  
You must be at least seven years of age  
But who cares 'cause you're coming with me  
Come on little girl  
Why are you making such a fuss?  
Come on little girl  
Come on, it is time  
I got real dolls on my wall, I made them myself  
And you can play with them  
And play with them and play with them  
Until your daddy comes to get you  
Oh Lucy, take my hand  
How can I make you understand?  
I'm not a stranger, I am a friend  
I'm gonna take you home to daddy later  
I, I, I, I and you can still be home now  
I, I, I, I and you are gonna play there  
I, I, I, I, you, you, you, you, we, we, we, we  
We're gonna have some fun, yeah  
Sweet graveyard, here we come  
Sweet graveyard, here we come  
Sweet graveyard, here we come  
Sweet graveyard
