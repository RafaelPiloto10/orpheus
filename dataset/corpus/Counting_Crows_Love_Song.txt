If tonight's the night then today's my day  
And I should hang it all on display  
Yours is just a losers game  
And I decided that I should play  
  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Felt the wind's direction bringing change  
Clouds so softly it will rain  
And summer fell and the winter spring  
And now it's all a feeling I can't get back again  
  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Plotting thoughts against the clear blue sky  
And the feeling came I felt like getting high  
No sense to try to find my piece of mind  
Cause maybe baby I was born to win dissatisfied  
And you know your caring never dies so  
  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Ah no ah no ah no  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Come on yeah  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Come on come on and try  
Throw your arms around my neck  
I won't be soon to forget  
Not gonna have a rise  
Throw your arms around my neck  
Hold me hold me hold me  
I won't be soon to forget  
Gotta get out of my life  
Throw your arms around my neck  
Come on come on now shine  
I won't be soon to forget
