Everybody knows that I'm a,  
Good girl, officer.  
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that,  
That's for sure.  
  
The house was already on fire,  
I swear, I'm not a liar.  
Well, I'm a little shaken,  
But I'm fine, thanks for asking.  
  
Tell me do you always,  
Work alone so late?  
Gosh, I don't lit if I,  
Stand in here in my nightgown.  
  
Do you really have to put,  
Those tight handcuffs on?  
  
Looking at me, then suddenly.  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in hurricane.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
I've been bad, I've been wrong,  
Playing a dangerous game.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
Hurricane, hurricane.  
  
Let's get in the back of your,  
Cop car, officer.  
You can ask me anything you want,  
Anything, anything.  
  
Do you have a girl? I don't see,  
A ring on your finger.  
Well that's interesting, have you,  
Ever thought of dating a singer?  
  
The flames are getting higher,  
So's my desire.  
It's kind of exciting,  
Don't you think?  
  
Then suddenly, he's uncuffing me.  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
I've been bad, I've been wrong,  
Playing a dangerous game.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
Hurricane, hurricane.  
  
If you can't stand the heat,  
Then stay out of the fire,  
You might get what you, desire.  
Boy, love is strange,  
Sometimes it makes you crazy,  
It can burn or break you.  
  
If you can't stand the heat,  
Then stay out of the fire,  
You might get what you, desire.  
Boy, love is strange,  
Sometimes it makes you crazy,  
It can burn or break you down.  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in hurricane.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
I've been bad, I've been wrong,  
Playing a dangerous game.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
Hurricane, hurricane.
