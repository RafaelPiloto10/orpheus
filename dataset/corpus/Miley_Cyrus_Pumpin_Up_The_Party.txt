[Chorus]  
Hey  
Get up  
Get loud  
Start pumpin' up the party now  
It's the same old same old  
  
It's the same old, same grind  
But we don't feel we're wasting time  
Not so bored that we can't find a better way  
My friends, my kind  
No one's gettin' left behind  
If they did, it'd be a crime  
That's why we say  
Let the music start a revolution  
No time to play it safe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They can't  
We can  
Parents might not understand  
Having fun without a plan  
But that's what we do  
We're all here (Let's go!)  
Gotta make this party grow  
Together we can make it blow  
Right through the roof  
The music's gonna start a revolution  
Too late to play it safe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We don't have to paint by numbers  
Let our voice come out from under  
Hear it rise  
Feel the thunder  
It's time to lose control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pumpin' up the party now  
Party now, party now  
  
[Chorus x 2]
