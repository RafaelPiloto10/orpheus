The lights are slowly fading down  
There's no one else, just you and me  
Nothing ever changed  
I see your faces in the crowd  
It seems I know each one of you  
For all my life  
I wish this night could last forever  
But it's time to go  
I saw you laugh, I saw you cry  
All for one and one for all  
Nothing ever changed  
The way you sang just blew my mind  
It gave me chills from head to toe  
What a glorious night  
To me it could have lasted forever  
But it's time to go  
A moment in a million years  
Is all I've got for you  
A moment in a million years  
To make some dreams come true  
A moment that I won't forget  
Until the day I die  
A moment in a million years  
Called life  
The bus is waiting right outside  
To hit the road and once again  
I leave you all behind  
I chase another dream tonight  
And by the time you'll be home  
I'll be far away  
Nothing seems to last forever  
It's time to go  
A moment in a million years  
Is all I've got for you  
A moment in a million years  
To make some dreams come true  
A moment that I won't forget  
Until the day I die  
A moment in a million years  
Called life
