Yesterday you were on my back just to  
Get my time. I guess it's not as precious  
As it seems. because I found the time for  
Hangin' out and talking on the phone. what  
Should I expect, now that my time is free  
And you're nowhere to be found.  
  
next time I'll try, for the first time in my  
Life. it won't pass me by. procrastinate it  
Can wait, I put it off.  
Let's start today  
  
my room's a mess and I can't get  
Dressed. I gotta be out by eight o'clock.  
Deep inside I know the answer. well  
There's no time like the present and I'd  
Like to hang out but who doesn't. I've  
Made enough mistakes for this lifetime.  
Now I'm here to make amends.  
  
next time I'll try, for the first time in my  
Life. it won't pass me by. procrastinate it  
Can wait, I put it off.  
Start! stop!
