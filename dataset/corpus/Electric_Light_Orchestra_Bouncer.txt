Do you remember, you said to me  
That you would wait, wait for me eternally  
I've been wondering, and I've been hoping  
your still the same, only you can say  
I'll be so glad to be back with you  
I'll do anything you want me to  
  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy, back home  
I see your light, shine in my window  
And I know I am coming home  
And as the light grows, grows ever brighter  
I see your face, you are alone  
And when I tell you all the things I have seen  
You'll say that darling you must have been dreaming  
  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy, back home  
Electric visions have crossed, strange decisions have crossed  
I felt the stars above me, I have someone to love me  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy, back home  
  
Believe me baby when I say, I wish I never, never,  
never, never, never be away  
For the things that I see, Be meant for the eyes of a time  
And when we walk alone together  
That's how I want it to be, want it to be forever  
  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy  
That's what I want, I'll be so happy  
That's what I want, I'd be so happy, back home
