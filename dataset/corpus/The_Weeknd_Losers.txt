[Verse 1: The Weeknd]  
Only losers go to school  
I taught myself how to move  
I'm not the type to count on you  
Because stupid's next to "I love you"  
  
[Hook: The Weeknd]  
No? So what can you show me  
That my heart don't know already  
We make our own sense  
And you're qualified to me  
What can you show me  
That my heart don't know already  
We make our own sense  
And you're qualified  
And you're qualified  
  
[Verse 2: Labrinth]  
Only losers go to school  
They can't teach what they can't prove  
Come put this inside a test-tube  
Because stupid's next to "I love you"  
  
[Hook 2: Labrinth]  
So what can you show me  
That my heart don't know already?  
We make our own sense  
You're qualified to me  
What can you show me  
That my heart don't know already?  
Cause we make our own sense  
And you're qualified  
  
[The Weeknd]  
And you're qualified to-  
  
[Labrinth]  
And you're qualified  
  
[Bridge: The Weeknd]  
And now that we're all grown up  
Who do we owe it to?  
And now that we've gone this far  
Who do we owe it all to?  
We did it all alone  
Now we're coming for the throne  
We did it all alone  
Now we're coming for the throne  
And now that we all came up  
Do we lose? Do we lose?  
  
[Hook: The Weeknd]  
So what can you show me  
That my heart don't know already?  
Cause we make our own sense  
And you're qualified to me  
What can you show me  
That my heart don't know already?  
Cause we make our own sense  
And you're qualified to me  
And you're qualified to me
