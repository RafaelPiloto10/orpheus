Where I Met Jesus  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Bessie can still remember  
Like it was yesterday  
She watched her husband, Oliver  
Kneel in the church and pray  
That was what she had been hoping for  
Still she was so surprised  
Was that a glow upon his face?  
Or just the tears in her eyes?  
Hed always been a quiet man  
Everyone saw the change  
Reaching to take a strangers hand  
Asking to know their name  
Sunday mornings theyd be in church  
And after the pastor prayed  
Year after year with a voice so dear  
Bessie would hear him say  
Chorus:  
This is where I met Jesus  
I heard him calling my name  
I was so glad to meet Him  
He was so glad I came  
Oh, how she misses Oliver  
Now that she lives alone  
One night while they were sound asleep  
The angels took her love home  
Oh, how she cried  
There were no goodbyes  
It seemed he was gone so soon  
Then one night she heard his voice  
When she walked into their room  
Chorus (repeat)  
Bessie, one day youll do the same
