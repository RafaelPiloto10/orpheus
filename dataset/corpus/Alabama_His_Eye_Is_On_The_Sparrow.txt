Why should I feel discouraged?  
And why should the shadows come?  
And why should my heart be lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When Jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is He  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I am free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
Let not your heart be troubled  
His tender word I hear  
And resting on His goodness  
I lose my doubts and fears  
  
Though by the path He leads us  
But one step I may see  
His eye is on the sparrows  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
And I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me
