I guess we used to be the lucky ones  
Good fortune smiled on everyone  
Stop  
A voice said you best beware  
Stop  
Bad luck is everywhere  
And sure enough the voice was right  
My luck changed overnight  
Stop  
Please tell me what went wrong  
Stop  
I can't take these ups and downs  
  
Hard times come, hard times go  
And in between you hope and pray  
The scars don't show  
'Cause life is strange and so unsure  
The days you hardly make it through  
You swear that there's a curse on you  
'Cause nothing seems to fit  
And things won't go your way  
You know you've had enough  
You've got the right to say  
Why me, why me  
  
Rubelator  
  
Stop  
Here comes anxiety  
Stop  
Won't you please let me be, I need relief  
Hard times come, hard times go  
In between you hope and pray  
The scars don't show  
'Cause life is strange and so unsure  
The days you hardly make it through  
You're sure that there is a curse on you  
If nothing seems to fit  
And things won't go your way  
You know you've had enough  
You can't take another day  
Where to go and what to do  
You've got those bills to pay  
You're really not alone you know  
'Cause everybody says,  
Why me  
  
Why me  
"Why me? That's what I want to know. You know what I mean? Huh. I don't know."
