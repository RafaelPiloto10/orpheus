Maybe I should wander  
Through these streets a little longer  
Hey New York City  
Won't you welcome me back home?  
And darling I love you  
But I swear that I'll be gone  
By the time you figure out what you want  
  
Maybe I should wander  
Through my solitude a little longer  
Turn your head now sailor  
Well I used to be so much stronger  
How in the hell did I get here?  
In this city so alone  
Oh sometimes life seems so long  
  
[Chorus]  
You can't soothe me with your sweet voice  
If I can't be your first choice  
You can't soothe me with your deep eyes  
If I can't be your first prize  
You can't soothe me with affection  
If it's pointed in the wrong direction  
Unless you think I'm perfection  
Unless you think I'm perfection  
  
Maybe I should wander  
Through these streets a little longer  
Find my ruthless angel  
That will carry me back home  
Cause we all want to go home  
And we search for love our whole lives  
I found a man who only wants to be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe down the road who knows?  
You'll get it together  
With all your charm my hope grows  
It's wonderful  
But you're flirting only as a friend  
You touch my heart  
And promise everything  
  
It'll be a mighty cold winter  
Five million people  
Couldn't one of them be you?  
And darling I love you  
But I swear that I'll be gone  
By the time you figure out  
What you want  
  
[Chorus]
