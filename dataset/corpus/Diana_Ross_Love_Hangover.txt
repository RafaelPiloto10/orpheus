Ah  
If there's a cure for this  
I don't want it  
Don't want it  
If there's a remedy  
I'll run from it  
From it  
  
Think about it all the time  
Never let it out of my mind  
'cause I love you  
  
I've got the sweetest hangover  
I don't want to get over  
Sweetest hangover  
  
Yeah, I don't want to get over  
I don't want to get  
I don't want to get, over  
  
Ooh, I don't need no cure  
I don't need no cure  
I don't need no cure  
  
Sweet lovin'  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
  
Don't call a doctor  
Don't call her momma  
Don't call her preacher  
  
No, I don't need it  
I don't want it  
  
Sweet love, I love you  
Sweet love, need love  
  
If there's a cure for this  
I don't want it  
I don't want it no  
If there's a cure for this  
I don't need it  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
