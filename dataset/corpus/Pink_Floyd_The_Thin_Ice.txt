Momma loves her baby  
And daddy loves you too.  
And the sea may look warm to you babe  
And the sky may look blue  
Ooooh baby  
Ooooh baby blue  
Oooooh babe.  
  
If you should go skating  
On the thin ice of modern life  
Dragging behind you the silent reproach  
Of a million tear-stained eyes  
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice  
Appears under your feet.  
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind  
With your fear flowing out behind you  
As you claw the thin ice.
