I can do it, I can run, I can hunt you down.  
You can try, but you can't stop me 'cause I'm gaining ground.  
I'm light on my feet and I'm quick to the punch.  
I had a heavy breakfast, but a real light lunch.  
I'm a raging bonfire, a cherry bomb, I'm me.  
  
I'm rough-and-tumble, I'm the one to beat,  
I'm a fresh coat of blacktop burnin' at your feet.  
I've got a poisonous sting, when I rain I pour.  
I'm the best of the best, I'm the soupe du jour.  
  
I'm smooth as glass, and sharp as a tack, I'm me.  
I'm the last and best stick of the gum in the pack, I'm me.  
  
I'm a strong woman, fast-talking, big-bad-dog walking,  
High falutin', drum-beatin', foot stompin', corn-poppin',  
Speeding locomotive that just won't stop!  
I'm a hot apple pie with a cherry on top!  
  
I'm a crowd pleasin', head spinnin',  
Winnin' in the ninth inning,  
Whip-lashing, record-smashin',  
Black-tie party crashing!  
  
Cyclone of fun, I'm an army of one!  
I'm strawberry sprinkles on a hot cross bun!  
  
I'm a big haymaker in a title fight.  
I'm a cute black kitten with a nasty bite.  
I'm an action double-feature on a Friday night!  
  
I'm me!  
I'm me!  
I'm me!  
I'm me!  
I'm me!
