Me not working hard?  
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak  
Or, better yet, go to Times Square  
Take a picture of me with a Kodak  
Took my life from negative to positive  
I just want y'all know that  
And tonight, let's enjoy life  
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right  
  
Tonight I want all of you tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
For all we know we might not get tomorrow  
Let's do it tonight  
  
Don't care what they say  
All the games they play  
Nothing is enough  
'Til they handle love (let's do it tonight)  
  
I want you tonight  
I want you to stay  
I want you tonight  
  
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
  
Take advantage of tonight  
'Cause tomorrow I'm also doin' bad  
Perform for a princess  
But tonight, I can make you my queen  
And make love to you endless  
This is insane the way the name growin'  
Money keep flowin'  
Hustlers move aside  
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'  
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan  
  
Put it on my life, baby  
I make you feel right, baby  
Can't promise tomorrow  
But, I promise tonight, dale  
  
Excuse me  
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight  
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight  
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight  
'Cause we might not get tomorrow  
  
Tonight I want all of you tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
For all we know we might not get tomorrow  
Let's do it tonight  
  
Don't care what they say  
Or what games they play  
Nothing is enough  
'Til they handle love (let's do it tonight)  
  
I want you tonight  
I want you to stay  
I want you tonight  
  
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
  
Reach for the stars  
And if you don't grab 'em,  
At least you'll fall on top of the world  
Think about it 'cause if you slip  
I'm gon' fall on top yo girl (ha ha ha)  
  
What I'm involved with  
Is deeper than the mazes  
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret  
My grammy's from Cuba  
But I'm an American  
And I don't get money like Seacrest  
  
Put it on my life, baby  
I make you feel right, baby  
Can't promise tomorrow  
But, I promise tonight, dale  
  
Excuse me  
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight  
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight  
And baby I'ma make you feel so good tonight  
'Cause we might not get tomorrow  
  
Tonight I want all of you tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
For all we know, we might not get tomorrow  
Let's do it tonight  
  
Don't care what they say  
All the games they play  
Nothing is enough  
'Til they handle love (let's do it tonight)  
  
I want you tonight  
I want you to stay  
I want you tonight  
  
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
Give me everything tonight  
  
Excuse me  
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight  
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight  
And baby I'ma make you feel so good tonight  
'Cause we might not get tomorrow
