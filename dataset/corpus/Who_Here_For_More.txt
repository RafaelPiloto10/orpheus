You can pack up your bags and go looking,  
For all things that need to be done,  
Or you can spend all your life not thinking,  
Never ending what you begun.  
  
You take a step in the right direction,  
But the man knocks us down on the floor,  
And although he may think we are broken,  
We'll get up and take two steps more.  
  
It's your life to do what you want to,  
By the way you push yourself out to the fore,  
And whatever you think of the reason,  
You bet your life you're here for more.  
  
It's your life to do what you want to,  
By the way you push yourself out to the fore,  
And whatever you think of the reason,  
You bet your life you're here for more.  
  
You may think that you're pretty good people,  
And you run at an even score,  
But whatever you think you are here for,  
You bet your life you're here for more.
