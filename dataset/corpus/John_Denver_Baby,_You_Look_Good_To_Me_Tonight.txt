I've been out on this highway now  
Five days in a row  
My words all run together  
My feet are moving slow  
I've got to stop and eat  
While it's still light  
There's a local angel sitting on my right  
Do you believe in love at first sight  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
I'm ordinarily very shy  
And I'd be polite if I had time  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
Tomorrow, I'll be good and gone  
Please don't make me wait that long  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
I get off at eleven, she said  
And walked away  
She poured a cup of coffee and  
She brought it on a tray  
She said, "it would be nice if you could stay  
You're the best idea I've had all day."  
Usually I put up a fight but  
Baby, you look good to me tonight.  
  
Well I'm ordinarily very shy  
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I thought I must be in a dream  
When she asked me if I wanted cream  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
All in all you know  
It's not a bad life on the road  
If you've got wheels to roll  
And lucky stars above  
Your destiny's your own  
You go as far as you can go  
And if there's time to sleep  
There's time to make love  
  
I came, I saw, I conquered  
But I rode off in the sun  
But I know the look she left with me  
Keeps telling me she won  
Her face is the only thing I see  
Whispering those words of prophesy  
  
I may come easy, but I don't come free  
You're never gonna see the last of me  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I was born to love you now can't you see  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I'm ordinarily very shy  
But I take the time to satisfy  
Baby, you look good to me tonight
