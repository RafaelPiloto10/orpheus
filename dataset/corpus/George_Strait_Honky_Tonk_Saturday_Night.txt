Angels and devils share the same tables  
And that's not so wrong if you get it done right.  
Halos and horns lock up on the dance floor  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
It's a honkytonk Saturday night,  
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.  
With luck she'll turn on 'fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
I played the jukebox, I played some merle haggard,  
Me and the waitress think he's outta' sight.  
Then some folks got thirsty while we were dancin'  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
It's a honkytonk Saturday night,  
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.  
With luck I'll turn her on 'fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
With luck I'll take her home 'fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.
