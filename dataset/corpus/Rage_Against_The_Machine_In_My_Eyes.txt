You tell me you like the taste  
You just need an excuse  
You tell me it calms your nerves  
You just think it looks cool  
  
You tell me you want to be different  
You just change for the same  
You tell me it's only natural  
You just need the proof  
Did you fucking get it?  
  
It's in my eyes  
It's in my eyes [Repeat: x3]  
  
And it doesn't look that way to me  
In my eyes  
And it doesn't look that way to me  
In my eyes  
  
You tell me that nothing matters  
You're just fucking scared  
You tell me that I'm better  
You just hate yourself  
  
You tell me that you like her  
You just wish you did  
You tell me that I make no difference  
Well at least I'm fucking trying  
What the fuck have you done?  
  
It's in my eyes  
It's in my eyes [Repeat: x4]  
  
And it doesn't look that way to me  
In my eyes  
And it doesn't look that way to me  
In my eyes
