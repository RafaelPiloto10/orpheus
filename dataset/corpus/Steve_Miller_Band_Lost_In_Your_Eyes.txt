Here I lie, feel like crying  
It's no surprise, I just keep on trying  
If you're out there somewhere tonight  
Would you think of me, ooo-eee  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure ain't living in a perfect world  
So I'm calling out wherever you may be  
Ooo-eee  
I'm all alone  
Remember your touch  
I'm all alone  
I think I love you too much  
And I know wherever you are tonight  
You'll begin to see  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure ain't living in a perfect world  
So I'm calling out wherever you may be  
Ooo-eee  
So you're in the country  
Where the air is so pure  
You know that's me who's knocking  
Baby, knocking on your door  
And if you're flying in a plane  
High up in the sky  
You know I'm calling out your name  
You know that baby I'm your guy, yeah  
Miles between us  
And we count the days  
Miles between us  
And there's two separate ways  
I'm with you even when you're far away  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure ain't living in a perfect world  
So I'm calling out wherever you may be  
Oh, oh, oh  
Baby we live in two separate worlds  
Sure ain't living in a perfect world  
I'm with you even when you're far away  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be  
Calling out wherever you may be
