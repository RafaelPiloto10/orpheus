As I walk this land of broken dreams  
I have visions of many things  
But happiness is just an illusion  
Filled with sadness and confusion  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind, maybe  
  
If roots of love grow all around  
But for me they come tumblin' down  
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger  
I can't stand this pain much longer  
  
I walk in shadows searching for light  
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight  
Hopin' and prayin' for someone to care  
Always movin' and goin' nowhere  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind  
[Incomprehensible] help me please  
  
I'm searchin' though I don't succeed  
But someones love there's a growin' need  
All is lost there's no place for beginning  
All that's left is an unhappy ending  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I know I've got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind  
I'll be searchin' everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I'll be searchin' everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
Help, oh, help me please  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love that's now departed?  
I'll be searchin' everywhere  
Just to find someone to care
