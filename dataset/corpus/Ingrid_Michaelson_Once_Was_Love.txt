Don't delay, something tells me I gotta go away  
Maybe it's the way we always stay when our hearts have gone  
We can't hold us anymore, no we've got to fold  
Down to the floor, yes I know it's cold but baby our hearts have gone  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
I gotta see if I'm filled up when it's only me  
It's not your fault but you just can't be here  
Now that my heart has gone, now that my heart has gone  
Now that my heart has gone  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
Everyone is hurting now and everything is burning down  
But I can build back my new town today  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
  
Just because there once was love  
Don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
Just because there once was love  
  
There once was love, there once was love  
There once was love, there once was love  
There once was love, there once was love  
There once was love, there once was love
