Tear a star from out the sky  
And the sky feels blue  
Tear a petal from a rose  
And the rose weeps too  
  
Take your heart away from mine  
And mine will surely break  
My life is yours to make  
So, please, keep the spark awake  
  
Would you take the wings from birds  
So that they can't fly?  
Would you take the ocean's roar  
And leave just a sigh?  
  
All this your heart won't let you do  
This is what I beg of you  
Don't take your love from me
