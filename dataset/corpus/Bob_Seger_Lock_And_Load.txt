Well I wish I had a nickel for every time I fell  
And blamed somebody else  
I'd give a ton of money to the ones I've hurt  
And I'd still be sittin' pretty well  
I've spent years losin' touch of what's right and what's real  
Caught up in these missions of my own  
And you're tellin' me you think I've done so damn well  
While we're sittin' here a thousand miles from home  
There's a hole in your wisdom, a hole in your sky  
Two holes in your head where the light's supposed to get by  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
So many times I've seen chances disappear  
I hesitate and watch them slip away  
Like the time I fail to spend with the ones I love  
And it's gone as sure as yesterday  
All these users and fakers, big time takers  
Manipulating everyone they see  
I get caught up in their schemes and their useless dreams  
And the only one I have to blame is me  
I get turned 'round and twisted, pulled left and right  
I can see where I'm goin', but I can't see the light  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Take a different road  
And start again  
  
I can sit here, in the back half of my life  
And wonder when the other shoe will fall  
Or I can stand up, point myself home  
And see if I've learned anything at all  
Anything at all  
  
Mediocrity's easy, the good things take time  
The great need commitment, right down the line  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Pay these debts I owe  
And start again  
  
I've been down this road  
I've seen things get old  
Time to get control  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
I've been down this road  
I've seen things get old  
Stand up, get bold  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load
