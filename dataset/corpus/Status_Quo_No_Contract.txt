I don't want your lovin', baby, I won't give you mine  
I need more than ifs and maybes to help me pass the time  
Give me private lessons, teach me all you can  
Play me silent movies, but remember, babe, oh, remember, babe  
We don't got no contract  
I won't buy your lyin', baby, you won't buy my love  
Don't you think no cryin', baby, I won't take no bluff  
Give me private lessons, teach me all you can  
Play me silent movies, but remember, babe, oh, remember, babe  
We don't got no contract, oh, no  
Give me private lessons, teach me all you can  
Play me silent movies, but remember, babe, oh, remember, babe  
We don't got no contract, oh, no
