My song is love  
Love to the lovers shone  
And it goes up  
You don't have to be alone  
  
Your heavy heart  
Is made of stone  
And it's so hard to see you  
Clearly you don't have to be on your own  
You don't have to be on your own  
  
And I'm not gonna take it back  
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that  
You're the target that I'm aiming at  
And I'll get that message home  
  
My song is love  
My song is love I know  
I'm on fire for you  
Clearly you don't have to be alone  
You don't have to be on your own  
  
And I'm not gonna take it back  
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that  
You're the target that I'm aiming at  
But I'm nothing on my own  
Got to get that message home  
  
And I'm not gonna stand and wait  
Not gonna leave it until its much too late  
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say  
That I'm nothing on my own  
And I love you, please come home  
  
My song is love, is love I know  
And I've got to get that message home
