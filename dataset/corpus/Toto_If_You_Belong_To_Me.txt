I left you crying on that angry morning  
You know I lied  
I'll always run from anything that loves me to my safe side  
My world circles 'round a different sun  
That's all burned away  
I know that you're the only one  
Now I'm walking down some distant street  
And I know your touch is out of reach.  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
And it was wrong for me to ever let you go  
Girl you belong to me I know.  
  
Everybody has a lonely moment  
They can't explain  
And everybody wants to feed their hunger  
Without the pain.  
  
There's no shadows in my hiding place  
I'm so locked away  
Now I wish that I could see your face  
I know I hurt you when you say we're through  
I never really will get over you 'cause  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
And it was wrong for me to ever let you go  
Girl you belong to me I know.  
  
Girl you belong to me I know.  
  
And it was wrong of me to ever let you go.
