Pale September  
I wore the time like a dress, that year  
The autumn days swung soft around me  
Like cotton on my skin  
  
But as the embers of the summer  
Lost their breath and disappeared  
My heart went cold  
And only hollow rhythms resounded from within  
  
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full  
And sank in the burrows of my keep  
  
[Chorus]  
All my armor falling down,  
In a pile at my feet  
And my winter giving way to warm  
As I'm singing him to sleep  
  
He goes along just as a water lily  
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats  
Unweighed down by passion or intensity  
Yet unaware of the depth upon, which he coasts  
And he finds a home in me  
For what misfortune sows  
He knows my touch will reap  
  
[Chorus: x3]
