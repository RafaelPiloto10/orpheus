Be my blind.  
Be it all the time.  
Be it night or day,  
Take my sun away, away.  
Levolor, which of us is blind?  
Levolor, left me in the dark.  
Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,  
Is it morning?  
Blind me please, I am on my hands and knees.  
I can only pray  
Take my sun away, away.  
Levolor, which of us is blind?  
Levolor, left me in the dark.  
Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,  
Is it morning?  
It is time.  
It is time (oh-oh).  
Levolor, which of us is blind?  
Levolor, left me in the dark.  
Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,  
Is it morning?  
Levolor, which of us is blind?  
Levolor, left me in the dark.  
Levolor, I can't see a thing but you,  
Is it morning?  
Levolor, Levolor, Levolor, Levolor...
