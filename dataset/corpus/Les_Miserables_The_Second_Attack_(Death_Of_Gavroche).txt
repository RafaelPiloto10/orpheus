(The battle recommences)  
  
Enjolras  
How do we stand, Feuilly? Make your report.  
  
Feuilly  
We've guns enough, but ammunition's short  
  
Marius  
Let me go into the streets  
There are bodies all around  
Ammunition to be had  
Lots of bullets to be found!  
  
Enjolras  
I won't let you go, it's too much of a chance!  
  
Marius  
The same is true for any man here!  
  
Valjean  
Let me go. He's no more than a boy.  
I am old, I have nothing to fear.  
  
Gavroche  
You need somebody quicker and I volunteer!  
  
(Gavroche climbs the barricade)  
  
Lesgles  
Come back Gavroche, don't you dare!  
  
Joly  
Someone pull him down at once!  
  
Gavroche  
Look at me, I'm almost there!  
  
(Gunshot)  
  
Gavroche  
Little people know, when  
Little people fight, we  
  
(Gunshot Gavroche is wounded.)  
  
May look easy pickings  
But we've got some bite!  
  
(He is hit again.)  
  
So never kick a dog  
Because he's just a pup  
We'll fight like twenty armies  
And we won't give up  
So you'd better run for cover  
When the pup grows....  
  
(He dies)
