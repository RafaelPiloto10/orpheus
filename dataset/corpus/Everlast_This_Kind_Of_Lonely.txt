Sitting alone tonight, rain falling on my window sill  
Just want to do what's right, but I don't know if I ever will  
There's so many reasons, too many excuses  
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses  
I'm so lonely, it's kinda scary  
This kind of lonely is making me weary  
I'm so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine  
Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine  
But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say  
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway  
Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty  
This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me  
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call  
Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all  
Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure  
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before  
And I'm so lonely, I feel like crying  
This kind of lonely is worse than dying  
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die  
I'm so lonesome I could die
