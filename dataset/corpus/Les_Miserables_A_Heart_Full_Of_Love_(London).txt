The words are foolish but they're true  
Cosette! Cosette!  
Or were dreaming when we met?  
  
Cosette:  
Who can say?  
  
Marius:  
Who can tell?  
  
Cosette:  
A heart full of love  
A heart full of you.

I saw you waiting and I knew.  
  
Cosette:  
Waiting for you.  
  
Marius:  
At your feet.  
  
Cosette:  
At your call.  
  
Cosette and marius:  
And it isn't a dream  
Not a dream after all!  
  
Eponine(Interjections)  
He was never mine to lose  
  
Why regret what could not be?  
  
There are words he'll never say.  
Not to me.  
  
Not to me, not for me.  
  
His heart full of love.  
  
He will never fell this way!
