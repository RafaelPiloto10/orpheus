This is me for forever  
One of the lost ones  
The one without a name  
Without an honest heart as compass  
  
This is me for forever  
One without a name  
These lines the last endeavor  
To find the missing lifeline  
  
Oh how I wish  
For soothing rain  
All I wish is to dream again  
My loving heart  
Lost in the dark  
For hope I'd give my everything  
  
My flower, withered between  
The pages 2 and 3  
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins  
  
Walk the dark path  
Sleep with angels  
Call the past for help  
Touch me with your love  
And reveal to me my true name  
  
Oh how I wish  
For soothing rain  
All I wish is to dream again  
My loving heart  
Lost in the dark  
For hope I'd give my everything  
Oh how I wish  
For soothing rain  
Oh how I wish to dream again  
Once and for all  
And all for once  
Nemo my name forevermore  
  
Nemo sailing home  
Nemo letting go  
  
Oh, how i wish.  
  
Name for evermore
