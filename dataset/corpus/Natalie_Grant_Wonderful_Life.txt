Beautiful is in the sky  
Watch it slowly  
All our time is flying by, too fast  
Where we're heading isn't always clear  
It can feel like no end  
But everything we need is here, right now  
Cause the sun is shining  
And the world is alive  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's alright  
Cause all we've ever needed  
Is the perfect day to be alive  
So no more waiting now  
For a wonderful life  
Cause it's a wonderful life right now  
  
Beautiful is in the eyes, of a friend or a stranger  
Soul searching in the skies, for love  
We're always planning on escape  
To something higher  
But there is a better way to live  
Cause the sun is shining  
And the whole wide world is alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the sun is shining  
And it's so good to be alive  
  
Everything's alright  
Cause all we've ever needed  
Is the perfect day to be alive  
  
[Chorus]
