I woke up this morning and the sun refused to shine  
I looked everywhere to try to find that man of mine  
I just found an ice cold pillow layin' by my side  
Well, the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
I looked out the window and I could not help but cry  
He left me all alone and never said goodbye  
He even took that golden sunlight from the sky  
Well, the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
Sit here and wonder why he left me  
I just try to think what I've done wrong  
Stay in the darkness of this lonely room  
Well, the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone

The world is dark and my baby's gone  
Well the moon is down but it still ain't dawn  
The world is dark and my baby's gone  
  
Ain't no moonlight  
Ain't no starlight  
Ain't no sunlight  
My baby's gone
