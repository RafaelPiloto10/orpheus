I know you worry everytime I go away  
You wonder will these sweet sweet feelings shine or fade  
But that's a question you don't have to ask  
What heaven makes, it always makes to last  
  
Gold don't rust, Love don't lie  
I'll be true, till the day that I die  
Trust in me, you will find  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
I wish that I could give you what you need from me  
But what good is a promise or a guarantee  
Love is still a simple act of faith  
And a faithful is heart is always worth the weight  
  
Gold don't rust, Love don't lie  
I'll be true, till the day that I die  
Trust in me, you will find  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
Love is still a simple act of faith  
And a faithful is heart is always worth the weight  
  
Gold don't rust, Love don't lie  
I'll be true, till the day that I die  
Trust in me, you will find  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long long time  
  
Baby you're the gold in this heart of mine  
And that gold will shine for a long, long long time
