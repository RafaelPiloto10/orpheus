Look at me I'm a speck of sand,  
And I'm building ,dreams in a strangers land  
Tell me why do I care  
Tell me why do I care.  
  
Every time that I'm feeling down, oh they,  
Pick me up and they spin me round.  
Tell me where do we go,  
Tell me where do we go from here.  
  
What are we gonna find out (find out)  
What are we gonna find out (find out)  
Leave the wilderness, and as long as there's dreams,  
Just as long as there's two of us,  
Just as long as there's two of us, I'll carry on  
  
Won't you hold me  
  
When is man gonna find out (find out)  
When are we gonna find out (find out)  
What the universe is just waiting to here,  
Just as long as there's two of us  
Just as long as there's two of us  
Just as long as there's two of us,  
We'll carry on.
