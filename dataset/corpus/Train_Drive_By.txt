On the other side of a street I knew  
Stood a girl that looked like you  
I guess that's deja vu  
But I thought this can't be true  
'Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe  
Or where ever to get away from me  
  
Oh but that one night  
Was more than just right  
I didn't leave you cause I was all through  
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell  
Because I really fell for you  
  
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya  
This is not a drive by  
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply  
Hefty bag to hold my love  
When you move me everything is groovy  
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me  
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you  
This is not a drive by  
  
On the other side of a downward spiral  
My love for you went viral  
And I loved you every mile you drove away  
But now here you are again  
So let's skip the "how you been"  
And get down to the "more than friends" at last  
  
Oh but that one night  
Is still the highlight  
I didn't need you until I came to  
  
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell  
Because I really fell for you  
  
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you  
This is not a drive by  
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply  
Hefty bag to hold my love  
When you move me everything is groovy  
They don't like it sue me, mm way you do me  
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya  
This is not a drive by  
  
Please believe that when I leave  
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you  
And a little time to get my head together too  
  
On the other side of a street I knew

But I thought this can't be true, 'cause
