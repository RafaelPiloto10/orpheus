Oh come all ye Grateful  
Deadheads to the concert  
Oh come Grateful Deadheads  
And camp in the street  
Bring rolling papers  
Don't forget your sleeping bags  
Oh come get us some floor seats  
We followed them for four weeks  
Oh come get us some floor seats  
To see the Lord  
  
Come all ye hippies  
Throwbacks to the '60's  
Paint flowers on your van  
And don't wash your feet  
Wear your bell-bottoms  
And your tie-dyed t-shirts  
Oh come let us adore them  
We quit our day jobs for them  
Oh come let us adore them  
Garcia's the Lord
