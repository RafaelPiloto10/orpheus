Wait a minute  
This is where I draw the line  
Tell me what's got into you  
Cuz apparently you've lost your mind  
Repetitious fault just can't be overlooked  
So I'm reading you your rights in case  
You misunderstood  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, honey, dream on  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
Don't think I haven't checked out  
All your alibies  
And the evidence concludes  
That you're just telling me half the truth  
Still I keep giving you  
The benefit of doubt  
Cuz I fell so deep in love with you  
I struggle to get around  
So if you wanna be down for me  
I'm gonna be down for you  
And if twice you break the rules  
I've got to move on  
You believed your first time  
Cost you 25 years to life  
But I won't wait for a third heartbreak  
With my heart it's only two  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
I don't believe you would mistake me for a fool  
So if you're really smart, you better think twice  
Before you move  
I'll be too busy watching to hear a word you say  
Just don't make the same mistake again  
And everything's ok  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me  
  
The first time, a mistake  
Second time, a bad decision  
Third time, there won't be one  
Cuz I won't let you do that to me
