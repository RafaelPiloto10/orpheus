Take me to a dark room  
And hug me to bits  
I just wanna be kissed so badly  
Right there  
On my lips  
  
Put the blame on me  
Put the blame on me  
  
Why did you close your eyes  
When I'm the one that's blind?  
Why did you close your eyes?  
That was too unkind  
  
Where are you tonight?  
Are you sleeping on your own?  
I need to know  
Where you are tonight?  
Are you sleeping on your very own?  
Tell the one that's lying with you  
To get right up and go back home.  
  
Put the blame on me  
Put the blame on me
