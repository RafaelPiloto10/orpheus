I see the lights,  
I see the road  
I see everything in the  
Highway code  
I've been whipped  
And I've been spun cown  
There ain't no religion here  
And I'm homeward bound  
  
Wherever you go,  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
Friendships come  
And lifetimes go  
In their passing to the  
Bigger show  
The river runs,  
The tides will turn  
If there's a hell,  
Well I've yet to learn  
  
Wherever you go,  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
To dream the dream that's over  
Before it's gone  
To hold your lover here  
While your heart beats so strong  
Baby when I love you  
When everything is gone  
When I'm kissing heaven  
This love is never wrong  
  
Solo  
  
I hear the singing,  
I hear the shout  
The talk of meaning  
For those in doubt  
But amid all the wailing and  
The wringing hands  
Everybody thinks  
Does anyone understand?  
  
Wherever you go,  
Wherever you are  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
  
I am crossing over  
To the other side  
And now I am waiting for an answer,  
Some kind of sign  
Looking for a love  
To be my guide  
'cause I am crossing over  
To the other side
