I love her, today  
'Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late  
Now I need to know if you're feeling when I'm free  
  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, Thursday  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty  
Oh on Thursday, baby get ready oh on Thursday  
Whoa you hold it oh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday,  
Baby only Thursday  
  
Can I try, can I try?  
I've been here for too long  
Baby don't cry  
When are you calling again, oh again  
But it's not Thursday, baby why you calling?  
  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, Thursday  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty  
Oh on Thursday, baby get ready oh on Thursday  
Whoa you hold it oh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday,  
Baby only Thursday  
  
Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday
