Price of your love's too much to pay  
I'll save myself for another day  
You want my love but you don't want me  
You sell your goods with no guarantee  
You're taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
There's more to me than this double bed  
  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up of empty promises  
I won't let the grass grow under my feet  
I've done my best to make our song complete  
  
Your interest rate is much too low  
You think that I've no life of my own  
The days have gone for your macho values  
I won't be walking in your shadows  
You're taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
There's more to me than this double bed  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up with the empty things you said  
  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up me life make no mistake  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
  
Make no mistake  
Give and take  
  
Price of your kiss too much to pay  
I'll save myself for another day  
You want my love but you don't want me  
You say it's a gift but it's just a loan  
You thing that I've no life of my own  
The balance of love is in the red  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up with the empty things you said  
  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up my life make no mistake  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take
