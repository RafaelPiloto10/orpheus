Mmm, yeah  
When I was just a baby, mama sat me on her knee  
She told me "Boy you listen there's a lot you oughta see  
A lot of pretty women, gonna try and tie you down  
You don't know what you're missin' if you never look around"  
Move on, that's what she told me  
Move on, mmm yeah  
Move on, whoo oh, oh  
Move on, I'm leavin' on my way  
  
Told you that forever was a word I couldn't say  
I don't know 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm livin' for today  
You're every inch a lady and you'll always have my love  
You listen, you can hear, her voice is callin' from above  
  
Move on, that's what she told me  
Move on, keep on movin'  
Move on, oh oh, oh  
Move on, I'm leavin' on my way  
  
The time is at hand  
The day is upon us  
There's no need to say goodbye  
You don't understand  
But babe I don't want you to cry  
Move on  
  
The time is at hand  
The day is upon us  
There's no need to say goodbye  
You don't understand  
But babe I don't want you to cry  
Move on  
  
Move on, mmm yeah  
Move on, mmm yeah  
Move on, whoo oh, oh, oh  
Move on, (what) you got to move on, whoo oh  
You got to move on, whoo oh oh  
You got to move on, mmm, yeah  
You got to move on, play that guitar
