Both of us are holding back  
So afraid to fall in love and lose again  
We've both been hurt before  
Saw love walk out the door  
In the end  
  
Actin' as cold as ice, when we wanna be  
It's just a foolish game we play  
You couldn't hurt me bad enough  
To make me give it up and walk away  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't stop, the feeling's too strong  
We've got the will to hang on  
Can't stop, we struggle and fight to survive  
Keepin' the love alive  
  
We try to forget the past, so many times  
It's hard to make those memories leave  
With all we have at stake  
We'll bend until we break  
Cause we both believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If we stand the test of time  
Love will be the lasting kind  
  
[Chorus]
