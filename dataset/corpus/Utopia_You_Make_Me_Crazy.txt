I waited all night  
I smoked a hundred cigarettes  
I chewed my lip 'til it bled  
But the phone made not a sound  
Sometimes I wonder  
If you ever wonder what's become of little old me  
But I ain't no baby  
I ain't gonna cry but baby  
You don't know what's going on inside me  
Why know you make me crazy  
What you do to me  
It's a chemical reaction or an allergy  
Why know you make me crazy  
You're aware of that  
Why don't you come and put me away  
It was a long night  
I could barely keep my head  
I heard a knock on the door  
It was only Harry Jones  
I used to wonder  
What it is that makes me feel like I can't be free  
'Cause you don't give me nothing  
You never give me nothing  
But you don't know what's going on inside me  
Why know you make me crazy  
I'm in misery  
Are you interested enough to see what's left of me  
You scared me  
The way you move in the night  
Your face is something frightening  
You're not so nice  
I'm gonna wonder  
Who you spend your time with  
Everywhere you go and what you see  
I know I'm not your daddy  
I don't want to be your daddy  
But you know what's going on inside me
