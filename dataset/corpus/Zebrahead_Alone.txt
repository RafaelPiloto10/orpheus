I broke down on a Japanese street  
Words unsaid they scar so deep  
Bullshit, Palanuik both make me choke  
Too much JD too much coke  
  
She says speed up I want to go faster  
She holds on but I outlast her  
Build it up but what does that matter  
We can build it up but we always watch it shatter  
  
Get up the house is on fire  
Get up I want to get higher  
Get up you mother fucking liar  
You make me feel alone  
  
I burned out in Shibuya station  
Lost all my friends hazard occupation  
Manic Compression like quicksand slip  
Ate too many mushrooms I'm gonna be sick  
She says slow down you're going through the motions  
  
I start to crash like a plane in the ocean  
Build it up but what does that matter  
When the shit goes down we all fucking scatter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never said I wanted to try  
Never said I wanted to live this lie  
All you said was good-bye  
All I ever said was to get me out of here  
  
I focus on the flame  
Set it off  
Wasted what a shame  
Set it off  
Focus on the flame  
Set it off  
We were once the same  
  
[Chorus]
