I saw the harbor lights  
They only told me we were parting  
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me  
I watch'd the harbor lights  
How could I help if tears were starting?  
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea  
I longed to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whispering  
Some other harbor lights  
Will steal your love from me
