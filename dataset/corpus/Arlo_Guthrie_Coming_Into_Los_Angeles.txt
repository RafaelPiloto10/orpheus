Coming in from London from over the pole  
Flyin' in a big jet liner  
Chicks are flyin' everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer?  
  
Comin' into Los Angeles  
Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico  
No, he couldn't look much stranger  
Walkin' in the hall with his things and all  
Smilin, said he was the lone ranger  
  
Comin' into Los Angeles  
Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Hip woman walkin' on the movin' floor  
Trippin' on the escalator  
There's a man in the line and she's blowin' his mind  
Thinkin' that he's already made her  
  
Comin' into Los Angeles  
Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Comin' in from London from over the poll  
Flyin' in a big airliner  
Chicks are flyin' everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer?  
  
Comin' into Los Angeles  
Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man  
  
Yeah, alright!
