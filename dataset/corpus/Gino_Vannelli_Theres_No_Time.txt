There's no time to wallow in my cheer  
'Tis mine to make my life a better place for my song  
Near my blues will be gone  
Bracing my joy till june  
There's no time to bellow hardships done  
The devil knows I've cried but the tears turn to plans  
Drafting thoughts work at hand  
Leaving woes behind  
There's no time  
There's no time  
People I'm just a pupil  
Learning the facts from A to Z  
And maybe come tomorrow  
I'll be what I can be  
There's no time to follow friends and fools  
'Tis wine that makes a man the bitter bliss of his day  
Reminiscing foolish times when he's grey  
Lord let me save my mind  
There's no time  
There's no time
