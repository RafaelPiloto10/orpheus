All at once  
I finally took a moment  
And I'm realizing that  
You're not coming back  
And it's finally hit me all at once  
All at once I've started counting teardrops  
And at least a million fell  
My eyes began to swell  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing you'd come back to me  
And that's all that matters now  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Holding on to memories  
And it's hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows  
All at once  
  
I looked around and found that you were  
With another love  
In someone else's arms  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
All at once the smile that used to greet me  
Brightened someone else's day  
She took your smile away  
And left me with just memories all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
  
[Chorus: x2]
