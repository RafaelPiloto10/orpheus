I found a friend, someone to help me  
And a place I can be myself when I'm in trouble now  
I've lost it and I don't know how  
I come to you 'cause you can show me  
Get me back to me I know with a remedy  
Baby I need your therapy  
With your healing kiss you know how to make my mind relax  
I will listen to the words you say and just lie back  
  
Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts  
Words of love that cut straight to my heart  
Reach out and touch, so few words say so much  
I can hear you when you tell it like it is  
When you talk straight to my heart  
  
I guess it shows I need attention  
Somehow you're asking all the right questions that I've gotta say  
What's been on my mind these days  
And I know you know just how to make my mind react  
When it's coming straight from you that's my first point of contact  
  
Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts  
Words of love that cut straight to my heart  
Reach out and touch, so few words say so much  
I can hear you when you tell it like it is  
When you talk straight to my heart  
  
I'm bad at making decisions  
But being alone with you just feels so right, feels so right  
I'm losing my inhibitions  
With every minute I share with you tonight, share it with you tonight  
  
Talk, talk to me  
To my heart, to my heart, oh yeah  
Come one, come on and reach out  
'Cause the words just mean so much  
I can hear you when you talk right to my heart  
  
Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts  
Words of love that cut straight to my heart  
Reach out and touch, so few words say so much  
I can hear you when you tell it like it is  
When you talk straight to my heart  
I can hear you, I can hear you
