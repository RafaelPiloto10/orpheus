There's a story to tell about mister Jones he rides adventure into the night  
Not a man of iron but a man with goals he opens dreams to let in light  
Breaking into silent tombs to steal the only key  
Tries to find the hidden prize set the secrets free  
Watching prying waiting lying in these hollow lives they're dying  
Upon the tomb it's written here lies the ark  
Screaming praying dreaming baying there destiny we're laying  
Upon the tomb it's written here lies the ark  
To struggle long and find the mark Indiana races to the scene  
To find the map and find the ark he has to cross into the dream  
Breaking into silent tombs to steal the only key  
Tries to find the hidden prize set the secrets free  
Breaking into silent tombs to steal the only key  
Tries to find the hidden prize set the secrets free  
Watching prying waiting lying in these hollow lives they're dying  
Upon the tomb it's written here lies the ark  
Screaming praying dreaming baying there destiny we're laying  
Upon the tomb it's written here lies the ark  
Watching prying waiting lying in these hollow lives they're dying  
Upon the tomb it's written here lies the ark  
Screaming praying dreaming baying there destiny we're laying
