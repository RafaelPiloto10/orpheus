Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell  
I don't think I can live without you  
And I know that I never will  
Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death  
I can't say anymore than "I love you"  
Everything else is a waste of breath  
  
I want you  
You've had your fun you don't get well no more  
I want you  
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall  
Be careful darling you might fall  
I want you  
I woke up and one of us was crying  
I want you  
You said "Young man I do believe you're dying"  
I want you  
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days  
I want you  
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways  
  
I want you  
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget  
I want you  
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate  
I want you  
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for  
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for  
I want you  
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing  
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing  
  
I want you  
He tossed some tatty compliment your way  
I want you  
And you were fool enough to love it when he said  
"I want you"  
  
I want you  
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark  
It scares you witless  
But in time you see things clear and stark  
I want you  
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop  
I want you  
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop  
I want you  
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you  
I want you  
I want to know the things you did that we do too  
I want you  
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do  
I want you  
I might as well be useless for all it means to you  
I want you  
Did you call his name out as he held you down  
I want you  
Oh no my darling not with that clown  
I want you  
  
I want you  
You've had your fun you don't get well no more  
I want you  
No-one who wants you could want you more  
  
I want you  
  
I want you  
  
I want you  
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up  
I want you  
  
I'm going to say it again 'til I instill it  
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it  
I want you  
  
I want you  
  
I want you
