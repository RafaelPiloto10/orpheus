Gently rolling Father time  
Is calling to him now,  
And though he hears him  
He looks out to sea.  
Somewhere out there lie his dreams  
A story with no ending  
And till he finds his answers  
He won't be going nowhere  
  
For him, it's not too late  
It's not too late  
For some it's never too late  
  
Quietly knocking on her door.  
He patiently stands waiting,  
And though she hears him  
She sits steadfast in her chair.  
Somewhere out there never seen  
Her hopes and dreams lie waiting,  
And till she finds an answer  
She won't be going nowhere  
  
For her, it's not too late  
It's not too late  
For some it's never too late  
  
For everything we know that's certain  
There is much we cannot see,  
So we choose to close the curtain,  
Never knowing what could have been  
  
It's not too late, it's not too late, never too late  
  
Slowly rocking the baby's bed  
He strokes it's head and whispers  
And though it hears him,  
It keeps smiling and kicks it's feet  
Somewhere out there is a life,  
A lifetime made for living  
So it holds on fast, it ain't going nowhere  
  
For some it's not too late,  
It's not too late  
For some it's never too late  
For some it's not too late  
It's not too late  
For some its never too late
