No clock beside my bed, don't try to wake me  
No phone upon my wall, who's going to call?  
No knock upon my door, no news to shake me  
Nights like the one before, I can't take no more  
Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais puts me to shame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais and I go crazy, Beaujolais, I can't explain  
But it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
One race that I can't win with an alter ego  
One chance to sink or swim, what am I to do?  
One tail that I can't shake, wherever I go, he go  
One circuit I can't break, it's a catch twenty two  
Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais, the one to blame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais will be my ruin, Beaujolais, I can't complain  
'Cause it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais puts me to shame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais and I go crazy, Beaujolais, I can't explain  
But it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais, the one to blame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais will be my ruin, Beaujolais, I can't complain  
'Cause it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais
