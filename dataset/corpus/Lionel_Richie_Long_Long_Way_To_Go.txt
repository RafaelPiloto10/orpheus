You held my hand and then you slipped away  
And I may never see your face again  
So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside  
Without love, what is life? And anyone who knew us  
both can see We always were the better part of me  
I never wanted to be this free And all this pain, when does it go away?  
  
Then every time I turn around And you're nowhere to be found I know  
I gotta long long way to go Before I can say  
goodbye to you Oh, I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye To all I ever knew, to you To you  
  
From memory there is no hiding place Turn on the TV and I see you there  
In every crowd there's always someone with your face  
Everywhere, trying not to care  
  
Then every time I turn around And you're nowhere to be found I know  
I gotta long long way to go Before I can say  
goodbye to you Oh, I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye To all I ever knew  
  
To you I wish you everything And all the best that life can bring  
I only hope you think of me sometimes Oh, and even though I fell the pain  
I know that you will love again The time will come and you'll move on  
  
I gotta long long way to go Before I can say  
goodbye to you Oh, I gotta long long way I know  
Gotta long way to go Before I can say goodbye  
Before I can say goodbye To all I ever knew  
To all I ever knew I gotta long way to go  
Before I say Say goodbye, say goodbye  
But I wish you the best girl Oh and all of the rest to you
