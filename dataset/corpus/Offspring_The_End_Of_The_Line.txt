When the siren's flash is gone  
And we're left to carry on  
All the memories are too few  
  
When the pastor's music plays  
And that casket rolls away  
I could live again if you  
Just stay alive for me  
  
Please stay now, you left me here alone - it's the end of the line  
Please stay I can't make it on my own - it's the end of the line  
Make it on my own  
It's the end of the line  
  
Now that you are dead and gone  
And I'm left to carry on  
I could never smile cause you  
Won't stay alive for me  
  
Finally,  
Your final resting day  
Is without me  
I weep  
And think of brighter days  
What about me?  
  
You can't take back, the one mistake  
That still lives on after life it takes  
In that one day, that changed our lives  
And bitter memories are left behind
