Just a simple conversation  
But I've memorized each line  
The way you hold your head when you're smiling  
Gets me every time  
  
Though you take my breath away  
There's one thing I have to say  
I'll never love again  
  
I tore up all the letters that you wrote me  
I packed up all your things  
But I can't stop myself from hoping  
When the telephone rings  
  
It's funny how I feel this way  
And all that's left to say  
I'll never love again  
I'll never love again  
  
If I had won the world  
And angel wings unfurled  
And came down by my side  
I'd give it all away for just a single day  
That I could use to change your mind  
  
So when I see you next time  
Please don't cause a fuss  
Cause I still haven't told all my friends  
About the two of us  
  
All of this is yesterday  
And all that there is left to say  
I'll never love again  
I'll never love again  
I'll never love again  
  
I will never love again
