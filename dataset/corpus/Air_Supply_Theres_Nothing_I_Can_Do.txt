(graham russell)  
  
I met you all alone yesterday  
You knew my life was beating fast  
The words I planned all walked away  
And left us holding what we have  
  
We shouldn't stay this long together  
I came to tell you and now I know  
The only chance of a love forever  
Went so many years ago  
  
  
I've told you there's nothing I can do  
I've told you I've got to get to you  
  
  
I'm not trying to bring you down  
I know you can bring me out my darkness  
I'm just trying to find your name  
I'm just trying to find your name.
