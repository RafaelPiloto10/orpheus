The voices in the wind,  
Will take you home again,  
The journey home has just begun by friend,  
  
The magic in your eyes,  
Was more than I surmised,  
And I surrender time and time again,  
  
To the will of the wind  
The will of the wind, child  
The wind in the wind chimes,  
Takes you home again.  
  
The will of the wind  
The will of the wind, child  
The wind in the wind chimes,  
Takes you home again.  
  
The will of the wind
