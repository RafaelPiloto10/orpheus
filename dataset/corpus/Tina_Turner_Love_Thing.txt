Saw you there, so confused  
I knew that I could make my move now  
Treading softly, I walked over you  
We talked about this thing called love  
Saw your eyes open wide  
And I knew your heart was in it  
Let me take you there  
Let me take you there tonight  
  
Get on board, get on my love thing  
Gonna drive you wild  
I want to show you, I want to hear you sing  
Baby we got a love thing, right now  
  
Close your eyes, follow me  
I'll show you a world you've never been to  
Take a ride in my love machine  
And I won't do anything you can't get into  
What I've got is what you need  
And you won't do a thing about it  
Let me take you there  
Let me take you there tonight  
  
Get on board, get on my love thing  
Gonna drive you wild  
I want to show you, I want to hear you sing  
Baby we got a love thing, right now  
  
I never want you to go  
I always want you to stay  
So come on baby, come on now
