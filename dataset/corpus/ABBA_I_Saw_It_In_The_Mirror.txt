I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it ain't too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But I'm looking through your lies  
It doesn't really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey, I will miss you  
'Til the day I die  
'Til the day I die  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
This boy cries
