Don't go breaking my heart  
I couldn't if I tried  
Oh honey if I get restless  
Baby you're not that kind  
  
Don't go breaking my heart  
You take the weight off me  
Oh honey when you knock on my door  
Ooh I gave you my key  
  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
But when I was down  
I was your clown  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
Right from the start  
I gave you my heart, oh oh  
I gave you my heart  
  
So don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
  
And nobody told us  
'Cause nobody showed us  
And now it's up to us babe  
Oh I think we can make it  
  
So don't misunderstand me  
You put the light in my life  
Oh you put the spark to the flame  
I've got your heart in my sights  
  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
When I was down  
I was your clown  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
Right from the start  
I gave you my heart, oh oh  
I gave you my heart  
  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
  
Woo ooh nobody knows it  
But when I was down  
I was your clown  
Right from the start  
I gave you my heart, oh oh  
I gave you my heart  
  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart  
Don't go breaking my heart  
I won't go breaking your heart
