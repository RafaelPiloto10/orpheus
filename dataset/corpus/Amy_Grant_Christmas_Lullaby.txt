Are you far away from home  
This dark and lonely night  
Tell me what best would help  
To ease your mind  
Someone to give  
Direction for this unfamiliar road  
Or one who says, "Follow me and I  
Will lead you home. "  
  
How beautiful  
How precious  
The Savior of all  
To love so  
Completely  
The loneliest soul  
How gently  
How tenderly  
He says to one and all,  
"Child you can follow Me an  
I will lead you home  
Trust Me and follow Me  
And I will lead you home. "  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus  
I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
In Thy tender care  
And take us to Heaven  
To live with Thee there  
Take us to Heaven  
To live with Thee there
