What all wanna do (tell me)  
  
See around here  
We're just too much  
We could slow it down and ya still couldn't  
Catch us  
  
My town  
Full of heavy hitters,  
Bread getters  
Real fly unforgettable type niggas  
  
See all I do is keep hittin' em up  
Getting' em up  
Shakin' ya butt  
Nigga, what  
  
Lil Liveraci  
Can't nobody stop me  
Always's makin' moves  
So you better watch me  
  
Slide  
To the southside in my blue drop top  
355 keep' it live  
When ya wanna make em jump (jump)  
  
You know what to do  
Just call me and my crew  
To the rescue  
Dididauntdida  
  
Captain So So Def  
We rocks the party til there's no one  
Left , (4, show)  
Turn ya volume up a notch  
  
And watch the ba bump, bump, bump  
Till yo' speakers pop  
You never missed your water til your well runs  
Dry  
  
I never missed my woman til she said good - bye  
Now my heart made a change  
My whole world's rearranged  
And I'm ready  
  
To give you what you deserved  
Baby, baby, baby please  
  
Come back, Come back  
Lover this is where you belong  
In my arms, in my world  
Come back, Come back  
  
Lover this is where you belong  
In my life, as my girl  
The grass is greener  
On the other side  
  
We take people for granted til they're  
Out of sight  
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through  
I don't think that you know how much I really love you  
  
All I do  
Is think of you  
I can't eat  
Can't sleep  
  
Baby it ain't hard to see (all I do)  
All I do  
Is think of you  
And the bump, bump, bump, bump diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby  
  
Come back, Come back  
Lover this is where you belong  
In my arms, in my world  
Come back, Come back  
  
Lover this is where you belong  
In my life, as my girl  
The grass is greener  
On the other side  
  
We take people for granted til they're  
Out of sight  
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through  
I don't think that you know how much I really love you  
  
It's not what you want baby  
But what you need sugar  
Come back with me  
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
