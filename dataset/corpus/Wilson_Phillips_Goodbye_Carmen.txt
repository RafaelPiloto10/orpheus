And her eyes are like skies about to rain  
But there's work to be done, and she does not complain  
Her children are so far away  
I heard you crying, I heard you praying  
Now you must go, and it's so hard to say  
  
Goodbye, Carmen  
Thank you for staying with us for a while (With your pretty smile)  
And someday you'll get home again  
Goodbye, Carmen  
Hasta manana or who knows when (It all depends)  
Goodbye  
  
We're convinced our intentions are good  
But we live in this world often misunderstood  
Can you feel it? (Uh-huh)  
I can feel it  
And no one seems to care much, and its so hard to say  
  
Goodbye, Carmen  
Thank you for staying with us for a while (With your pretty smile)  
And someday you'll get home again  
Goodbye, Carmen  
Hasta manana or who knows when (It all depends)  
Goodbye  
  
Carmen, careful what you do, be careful what you see, Carmen  
We will always be with you  
  
Turn around but she's lost in the sun  
There was so much to say, but she's already gone, so  
Thank you Carmen, don't be afraid this is not the end,  
So rest your head, I hope someday we will meet again.  
Goodbye, Carmen  
Hasta manana or never again  
But you're my friend Carmen  
Goodbye
