I hear you on the radio  
You permeate my screen, its' unkind but  
If I met you in a scissor fight  
I'd cut off both your wings on principle alone  
On principle alone  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
You're no Jesus  
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis  
Special, as you know yourself  
Baby, just step down, step down  
  
If I were your appendages  
I'd hold open your eyes  
So you would see  
That all of us are heaven sent  
There was never meant to be only one  
To be only one  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
You're no Jesus  
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis  
Special, as you know yourself  
Baby, just step down, step down  
  
Yeah  
You're no Jesus  
You're no Elvis  
You're no answer  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
You're no Jesus  
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis  
Special, as you know yourself  
Just step down
