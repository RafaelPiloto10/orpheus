When I look into your eyes, I don't know what to say  
It's been so very long we've been waiting for this day  
When you give me that smile, I don't know what to give you back  
So I say oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
When I look into your eyes, I see your universe  
And how much better your life could be, and how much worse  
I see all that you've done to try and keep you hope intact  
And I say, oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
Oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
Oh, I guess I was blind until I realized the sun only shines  
When it shines in your eyes...  
I say, oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
Oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that
