Country music singers, have always been a real close family,  
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me.  
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction.  
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition.  
  
They get on me and want to know Hank why do you drink?  
Hank, why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?  
Over and over everybody makes my predictions.  
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition.  
  
I am very proud of my daddy's name  
All though his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same.  
Stop and think it over. Put yourself in my position.  
If I get stoned and sing all night long it's a family tradition.  
  
So don't ask me, Hank why do you drink?  
Hank, why do you roll smoke?  
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?  
If I'm down in a honky-tonk some ole slick's trying to give me friction.  
I said leave me alone I'm singing all night long it's a family tradition.  
  
Lord I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam  
And they both tried to kill me in 1973.  
When that doctor asked me, "son how did you get in this condition?"  
I said, "hey sawbones, I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition."  
  
So don't ask me, Hank why do you drink?  
Hank, why do roll smoke?  
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?  
Stop and think it over, try and put yourself in my unique position.  
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition!
