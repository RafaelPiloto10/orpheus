(Ray Park)  
For many long years I've played a lone hand  
I rode my horse in many strange lands  
Until one day I stopped for awhile  
For two blue eyes and a sunny smile  
So howl away you old coyote  
I hear your sad and lonesome song  
You're calling me back to old Montana  
Back to those hills where I belong  
One day I rode away from home  
I'm a' traveling back and it won't be long  
I'll see you again in a little while  
You're my darling sweet, my welcome smile  
So howl away you old coyote  
I hear your sad and lonesome song  
You're calling me back to old Montana  
Back to those hills where I belong  
So howl away you old coyote  
I hear your sad and lonesome song  
You're calling me back to old Montana  
Back to those hills where I belong
