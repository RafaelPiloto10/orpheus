Alright, all of you bloody bastards  
Better hold tight  
Oh yeah  
It's Saturday night  
Cockfighting rumbles  
Going all night, alright  
Tonight  
  
Oh yeah it's cockfighting saturday  
And I say Oh say Oh  
All right, I'm gonna fuck or fight  
It's my way, it's alright tonight  
  
Oh it's saturday night  
Oh I'm getting high and I say  
Alright so high  
At midnight  
I'm out for blood and I say  
Oh yeah, it's alright tonight  
  
Give me your life  
I'll give you mine  
Oh a rumbles on tonight  
It's do or die  
An eye for an eye  
Oh it's alright tonight
