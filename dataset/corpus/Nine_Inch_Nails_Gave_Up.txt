Perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most  
Forgot how it feels well almost  
No one to blame always the same  
Open my eyes wake up in flames  
It took you to make me realize  
It took you to make me realize  
It took you to make me realize?  
It took you to make me see the light  
Smashed up my sanity  
Smashed up my integrity  
Smashed up what I believed in  
Smashed up what's left of me  
Smashed up my everything  
Smashed up all that was true  
Gonna smash myself to pieces  
I don't know what else to do  
Covered in hope and Vaseline  
Still cannot fix this broken machine  
Watching the hole it used to be mine  
Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline  
Of the trust I will betray  
Give it to me I throw it away  
After everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become  
I tried  
I gave up  
Throw it away
