It's a very happy day  
We are at lots of fun fun fun  
And it's ice-cream and jelly  
And a punch in the belly  
How much can you throw over the walls?  
  
And see how his face glows  
It's a bike! What a surprise.  
It's a big bike. What a big surprise.  
It's a red bike. What a red surprise.  
Oh, what a surprise.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Was the wonderful dog chair  
Was the beautiful dog chair  
That could count right up to ten  
It could count right up to ten  
It went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,  
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  
  
And it's another happy day.  
He was born eleven years ago  
And this year it's long trousers  
And a very smart tie.  
Just think in five years he'll be shaving.  
  
And see how his face glows  
It's a bike. What a surprise!  
It's a samurai sword.  
What a metal surprise.  
He'll remember this day for the rest of his life.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Is that fabulous dog chair  
The immaculate dog chair  
That could count right up to eleven  
  
It could count right up to eleven  
It went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,  
Woof, woof, woof.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Was my darling the dog chair  
But the rampaging dog chair  
That could count right up to eleven  
It could count right up to eleven.  
  
And it went round and round the house.
