Indiscriminate I'd rather be elite  
I'll choose my own shit scene  
Unsubstantiated rumors flown are true  
I'm here for me not you  
  
Non conglomerate I mean what I say  
I'm not your fucking scape  
Goat apparently I've alienated some  
It seems my job's half done  
  
You'll never understand it  
Try to buy and brand it  
I win, you lose, cause it's my job  
To keep punk rock elite  
  
This music ain't your fuckin' industry
