Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do, nowhere to go  
Oh, Oh, I wanna be sedated  
  
Put me in a wheelchair  
And get me to the show  
Hurry hurry hurry  
Before I go loco  
I can't control my fingers  
I can't control my toes  
Oh no oh oh oh oh  
  
Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do, nowhere to go  
Oh, I wanna be sedated  
  
Put me in the airport  
Get me on a plane  
Hurry hurry hurry  
Before I go insane  
I can't control my fingers  
I can't control my brain  
Oh no oh oh oh oh  
  
Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go  
I wanna be sedated  
Nothing to do, nowhere to go  
Oh, I wanna be sedated  
  
Get me in the airport  
Put me on a plane  
Hurry hurry hurry  
Before I go insane  
I can't control my fingers  
I can't control my brain  
Oh no  
  
Ba-ba-baba baba-ba-baba  
I wanna be sedated  
Ba-ba-baba baba-ba-baba  
I wanna be sedated
