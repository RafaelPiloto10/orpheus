My girl, she breathes hellfire  
And my girl, she feeds my desire  
My girl Sadie, she's the wind in my sails  
A puss'n boots lady with a cat o' nine tails  
Comin' after you honey, feet don't fail me now  
  
My girl, she's bare back rider  
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva  
She's a full time love no mon ami  
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee  
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
  
My girl, she smokes barbed wire  
And my girl, can't get no higher  
I made it with the lady and a one track mind  
Diamonds in the rough, they're so hard find  
Day after day, the same old grind  
And grind and grind and grind  
My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl  
  
My girl, she's bare back rider  
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva  
She's a full time love no mon ami  
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee  
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Oh, my girl!
