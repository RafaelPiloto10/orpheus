Long, long ago  
In a world dark and cold  
A night so still, winter's chill  
One bright star was shining  
On a bed made of hay  
In a manger He lay  
Shepherds came, they knew His name  
King of kings, a brand new day  
They saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on love and tenderness  
Brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  
On this Christmas Day  
May that star light your way  
This Christmas Eve, I still believe  
That same star still shines on me  
I saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on love and tenderness  
Brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  
I saw the light in the darkness  
It shines on love and tenderness  
Brings out the hope that's in all of us  
May it shine its light on you this Christmas Night  
Ooh, may it shine its light on you this Christmas Night
