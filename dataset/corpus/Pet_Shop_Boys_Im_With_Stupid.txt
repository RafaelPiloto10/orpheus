[Chorus]  
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid  
Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid  
  
See you on the TV  
Call you every day  
Fly across the ocean  
Just to let you get your way  
No one understands me  
Where I'm coming from  
Why would I be with someone  
who's obviously so dumb?  
Love comes  
Love grows  
every time you rise to meet me  
take my hand to greet me  
Love comes  
Love grows  
and power can give a man  
much more than anybody knows  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Before we ever met  
I thought like everybody did  
you were just a moron  
a billion-dollar kid  
You flew up all the way  
like a hawk chasing a dove  
I never thought that I would be  
a sacrifice in love  
It comes  
It grows  
and now we're tied together  
everybody knows  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Is stupid really stupid  
or a different kind of smart?  
Do we really have a relationship  
so special in your heart?  
  
[Chorus]  
I have to ask myself  
like any lover might:  
Have you made a fool of me?  
Are you not Mr. Right?  
You grin  
I pose  
It's not about sincerity  
Everybody knows  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Is stupid really stupid  
or a different kind of smart?  
That's how you stole my heart  
I'm with Stupid
