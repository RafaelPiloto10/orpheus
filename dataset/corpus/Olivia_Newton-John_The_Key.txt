(s. Sinclair)  
  
There's a key to open every heart  
You must play your part  
To open the door  
There's a dream for each to be fulfilled  
A yearning to be stilled  
You can't ask for more  
  
Don't get down  
Don't get disheartened  
There's someone who  
Is waiting there for you  
  
On your own is the loneliest place to be  
We all need love, can't you see  
And they need you  
How they need you  
  
Oh, don't get down  
Don't get disheartened  
There's someone who  
Is waiting there for you  
  
On your own is the loneliest place you can be  
We all need love, can't you see  
And they need you  
Yes, they need you  
Oh, they need you  
Oh  
We all need love, can't you see  
And they need you  
Yes, they need you  
How they need you  
Youre the key
