I remember the Alamo, I don't recall who won  
They had swords, they had horses, I hear we had mighty guns  
Like the ones from Navarone last night on Channel 21  
It's a long way back to El Paso  
It was early Monday morning in the Central Standard Zone  
You were quiet like the TV, hung up like the telephone  
You were sleeping next to me, I might as well have been alone  
It's a long way back to El Paso  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it down and sold it off  
To the greasy man in the salvage lot  
As it is it's just a heart  
No, no, it ain't worth nothin'  
I ain't talkin' 'bout tomorrow, I'm talkin' 'bout tonight  
You told me you were drunk already, that don't make it right  
You want at me, well, have at it, 'cause I'm in the mood to fight  
And it's a long way back to El Paso  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a, and if my heart was a  
And if my heart was a car  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car  
You would have stripped it a long time ago  
And if my heart was a car
