Be still  
And go on to bed  
Nobody knows what lies ahead  
And life is short  
To say the least  
We're in the belly of the beast  
  
Be still  
Wild and young  
Long may your innocence reign  
Like shells on the shore  
And may your limits be unknown  
And may your efforts be your own  
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore  
  
Don't break character  
You've got a lot of heart  
Is this real or just a dream?  
Rise up like the sun  
Labor till the work is done  
  
Be still  
One day you'll leave  
Fearlessness on your sleeve  
When you've come back, tell me what did you see  
What did you see (what did you see)  
Was there something out there for me?  
  
Be still  
Close your eyes  
Soon enough you'll be on your own  
Steady and straight  
And if they drag you through the mud  
It doesn't change what's in your blood  
(Over chains, over chains, over ?, over ?)  
When they knock you down  
  
Don't break character  
You've got a lot of heart  
Is this real or just a dream?  
Be still  
Be still  
Be still  
Be still  
  
Over rock and chain  
Over sunset plain  
Over trap and snare  
When you're in too deep  
In your wildest dream  
In your made up scheme  
When they knock you down  
When they knock you down  
  
Don't break character  
You've got so much heart  
Is this real or just a dream?  
Oh Rise up like the sun  
And labor till the work is  
Rise up like the sun  
Labor till the work is done
