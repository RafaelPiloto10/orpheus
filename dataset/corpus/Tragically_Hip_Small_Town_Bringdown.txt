Been to Reno  
Drives an El Camino  
Can you dig that style?  
  
Hip canteen  
You always make the scene  
You're a crazy child  
  
It's a sad thing  
Bourbons all around  
To stop that feeling when you're living  
In a small town  
  
You're long and lean  
But things don't get you down  
You're a top ten kingpin in the borders  
Of you're hometown  
  
You can't get hip  
You work the jobs I've quit  
Can you dig that style?  
  
Won't admit  
You just don't give a shit  
You're a crazy child  
  
Can't live to die - too easy  
Why stick around  
Not another small town hometown bringdown  
  
This is it  
You might as well get pissed  
Can you dig that style?  
  
Make your trip  
There ain't that much to miss  
You're a crazy child
