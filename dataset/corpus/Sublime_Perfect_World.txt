Boo boo boo, take a look at you  
Hangin' on third and daisy  
Whoa bo bo, policeman after you  
Smokin' crack cocaine make you crazy  
You think everything's perfect in your world today  
I think everything's just not really  
Take out your glass pipe, take off your sunglasses  
And tell me what you can see  
And I say lies, corruption, look this way  
Girly on the corner but she's not okay  
You got lies if you got rats in the street  
You got, no shoes no shoes on your babies feet  
Whoa ho ho ho ho  
It's a perfect world, perfect world  
It's a perfect world  
It's a perfect world, yow  
Bo bo bo take a look at you on your way to Kenny's  
Whoa bo bo, why don't you stop that crap?  
Smokin' that bum makes you crazy  
But everything's crazy in the world today  
So you, you might as well smoke it anyway  
I say, you might as well  
It hit, it lit, you well like that  
Which you cannot say  
What is up? What's down?  
What is up? What's down?  
What's up, what's down?  
I don't know what's going round  
Head is spinning and it feels alright  
But the kids, the kids  
The kids are alright  
Bo bo bo bo  
It's a perfect world  
Whoa on and on it's a perfect world  
Gotta keep living in a perfect world  
Gotta keep pushing in a perfect world  
Gotta keep pushing in a perfect world  
Gotta keep pushing  
You know we could end it right there
