Small creature are you  
Small creature you are  
How quickly you are uncovered  
Naked and cold  
Mumbling and crying  
Knowing everything's been discovered  
  
Many secrets have you  
Many secrets you have  
But it's only a matter of time  
Did you finally decide  
There's nowhere to hide  
And really no reason why  
  
Hey Mr. Shame  
Have you got a name  
I don't feel like calling you Buddy  
I don't want to hear your story  
I don't want to hear why  
And I don't even care if you're sorry  
  
Many secrets have you  
Many secrets you have  
But it's only a matter of time  
Did you finally decide  
There's nowhere to hide  
And really no reason why  
  
Strong is your body  
Strong are your bones  
Strong as your bloody lie is uncovered  
  
Small creature are you  
Small creature you are  
How quickly you are uncovered  
Naked and cold  
Mumbling and crying  
Knowing everything's been discovered
