If you were a bluebird you'd be a sad one  
I'd give you a true word  
But you've already had one  
If you were a bluebird,  
  
You'd be crying  
You'd be flying home  
If you were a raindrop,  
You'd shine like a rainbow  
  
And if you were a train stop,  
The conductor would sing low  
If you were a raindrop,  
You'd be falling  
You'd be calling home  
  
If you were a hotel  
Honey, you'd be a grand one  
But, if you hit a slow spell,  
Do you think you could stand one  
  
If you were a hotel,  
Well I'd lean on your doorbell  
I'd call you my home  
If I was a highway,  
  
I'd stretch alongside you  
I'd help you pass by ways  
That had dissatisfied you  
If I was a highway,  
  
Well I'd be stretchin'  
I'd be fetchin' you home
