You lost your self respect  
You gave it all away  
for no good reason  
what were you thinking  
  
Flirt with me  
If you want me to  
I'll do it for you  
  
When you got that  
smile on your face  
that look in yourt eye  
  
So look into these eyes  
and tell me what you see  
do you see affection  
the way it should be  
  
come on  
Flirt with me  
If you want me to  
I'll do it for you  
  
When you got that  
smile on your face  
that look in your eye  
you want everything  
  
I am the first you will ever have  
I am your lover  
I'm your God  
  
When I get close to you  
  
When you got that  
smile on your face  
that look in your eye  
you want everything
