Well flesh from my soul  
What's wrong with me?  
My body's shakin' like a willow tree.  
  
Call on me baby  
When you need a hand.  
I'll give you somethin'  
That you don't understand.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I can turn back the hands of time,  
Make you mine  
Sweet and fine.  
I can call on the hands of love,  
To chase you down  
And bring you home.  
  
Every day and every night,  
I spend all my time just tryin'a'  
Treat you right.  
  
Call on me baby  
If you feel like cryin'  
I'll be there beside you,  
Ain't no denyin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Baby!  
Oh yeah!  
Over here!  
  
Well flesh from my soul,  
What's a man to do?  
I'm all shook up 'cause I'm  
Lost in you  
  
Call on me baby  
If you need my love  
I'll stay with you darlin'  
'Til you've had enough  
  
[Chorus: x2]
