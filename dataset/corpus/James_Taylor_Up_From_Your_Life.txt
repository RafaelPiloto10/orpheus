So much for your moment of prayer,  
God's not at home there is no there, there.  
Lost in the stars, that's what you are,  
Left here on your own.  
  
You can only hope to live on this earth,  
This here is it, for all it's worth.  
Nothing else awaits you, no second birth,  
No starry crown.  
  
For an unbeliever like you,  
There's not much they can do  
That would turn you away.  
Though I hate to see you surrender,  
You need to surrender,  
We must find you a way to  
Look up from your life, up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
  
There's a river running under your feet,  
Under this house, under this street.  
Straight from the heart, ancient and sweet,  
On its way back home.  
Even in the middle of your sadness,  
The everyday madness, the ongoing game.  
Even when you can't find a reason,  
Still there is a reason,  
You don't need to name it.  
Look on up, look up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
  
Oh, even for a minute to find yourself in it,  
To wait by the stream to drop out of your dream,  
Look on up, look up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
Look up from your life, up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.
