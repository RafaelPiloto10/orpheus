Many rivers to cross (Live from The Mirage)  
  
Many rivers to cross  
But I can't seem to find my way over  
Wandering I am lost  
As I travel along the white cliffs of dover.  
Yes I've got many rivers to cross  
And it's only my will that keeps me alive  
'Cause I've been licked, washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride.  
  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone  
It's such a drag to be on your own  
Cuz my man left me and he didn't say why  
So I guess I'll have to cry.  
  
I've got many rivers to cross  
But just where to begin', I'm playing for time  
Cuz there've been times I find myself  
Thinking of committing, a dreadful crime.  
  
And this lonliness won't leave me alone  
It's such a drag to be on your own  
My man left me and he didn't say why  
So I guess I'll have to cry.  
  
I've got many rivers to cross  
But just where to begin', I'm playing for time  
But I've been licked, and washed up for years  
And I merely survive because of my pride...  
(Many rivers to...) Oh cross...
