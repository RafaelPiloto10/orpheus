I heard that you're on your own now  
So am I  
I'm living alone now  
I was wrong  
So were you  
What will you do?  
Are you glad to be free?  
Are you feeling lost just like me?  
Longing for company  
  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
Come around and talk awhile  
I need your smile  
You need a shoulder  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
And the door is open wide  
Come on inside  
Longing to see you  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
  
I find the days hard to face now  
Empty rooms  
There's much too much space now  
And the nights go so slow  
I'm sure you know  
Wish I knew what to do  
It would be so nice seeing you  
And it might help you too  
  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
Come around and talk awhile  
I need your smile  
You need a shoulder  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
And the door is open wide  
Come on inside  
Longing to see you  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
  
Oh Sam, you know where I am  
Oh Sam, ooh Sam  
You know, you know  
You know where I am
