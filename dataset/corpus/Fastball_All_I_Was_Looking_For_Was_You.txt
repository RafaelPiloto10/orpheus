When I was a boy  
I could not stand the silence  
I needed the noise  
I was underage and overjoyed  
Changing my ways  
But there's so many ways to change  
I'm growing up  
I'm getting wise I'm getting strange  
  
All I was looking for was you  
All I was looking for was you  
I ran my ship into the ground  
Chasing some high and lonesome sound  
From Venice Beach to Kathmandu  
My money's gone my time it flew  
All I was looking for was you  
(All this time) [Repeat: x2]  
  
Some marry for love  
Some marry for money  
Dollars and cents  
Through open arms and barbed wire fence  
Running away  
From everything that looks like me  
I heard a voice  
I saw your face, it set me free  
  
All I was looking for was you  
All I was looking for was you  
The endless highways I road down  
The girls I kissed in every town  
Midnight on heartbreak avenue  
All twisted up on bitches brew  
All I was looking for was you  
  
Running away  
From everything that looks like me  
I heard a voice  
I saw your face, it set me free  
  
All I was looking for was you  
All I was looking for was you  
The endless highways I road down  
The girls I kissed in every town  
Midnight on heartbreak avenue  
All twisted up on bitches brew  
All I was looking for was you  
(All this time)  
I learned the words I sang the song  
Then I got lost in Babylon  
I ran my ship into the ground  
Chasing some high and lonesome sound  
The lies I told you kept them through  
Nobody knows me like you do  
All I was looking for was you
