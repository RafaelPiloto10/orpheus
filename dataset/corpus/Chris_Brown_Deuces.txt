All the bullshit's for the birds  
You ain't nothin' but a vulture  
Always hopin' for the worst  
Waiting for me to fuck up  
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah  
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean  
When I tell her keep it drama free  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I know you mad but so what?  
I wish you best of luck  
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm on some new shit  
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)  
I'm moving on to something better, better, better  
No more tryin' to make it work  
You made me wanna say bye bye,  
say bye bye, say bye bye to her  
You made me wanna say bye bye,  
say bye bye, say bye bye to her  
  
Uh, use to be valentines  
Together all the time  
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie  
It's like I sent my love with a text two times  
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply  
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind  
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some  
  
'Cause when it's all said and done,  
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to  
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'  
My heart big but it beat quiet  
how never feel like we vibin'  
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence  
  
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter  
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond  
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?  
I don't wanna have to let you go  
But baby I think it's better if I let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago  
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow  
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow  
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow  
The other chick I'm with never complainin'  
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond  
  
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will  
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles  
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me  
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me  
I got a new chick, and she ain't you  
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu  
  
And all that attitude, I don't care about it  
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it  
Breezy rep two up, two down  
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deuces
