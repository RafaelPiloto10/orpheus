I want to feel you hesitate  
I want to feel you pull away  
I want to feel you realize  
That I am not love come to play  
  
I want to feel your pink clean skin  
I want to feel your purity  
I want to feel you touch my pain  
I want to drown in your misery  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, bitch, this is what you are  
Purified, sanctified, sacrificed  
Hey, bitch, this is what you are  
Purified, sanctified, sacrificed  
This is what you are  
  
I want to feel your innocence  
I want to hear you beg for 'Him'  
I want to be your animal  
I want to be your only sin  
  
I want to tear your dreams away  
And show you hopes last sanctuary  
I want to dip your wings in blood  
And watch an angel bleed for me  
  
[Chorus]
