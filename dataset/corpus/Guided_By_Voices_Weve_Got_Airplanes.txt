We fly higher then at first we imagined,  
We came over for the spin of a globe,  
Spanning rivers as the fish eggs were hatching,  
? pulse of the ?  
Come visit our world,  
See what goes down  
Explore new horizons  
Fall to the ground  
how does it feel? X6  
How do you feel?  
  
Tired busses on an abandoned old highway  
Taking kisses??of a gun  
Broken bottles on the top of the stairway  
Monuments of those we love most  
how does it feel? X6  
How do you feel? X2  
how does it feelX3  
(Unclear about fade)
