Looks like I'm the only one here  
Even the nurse is gone  
But I guess I should wait 'cause when she left, she said  
The doctor won't be long  
So make yourself at home  
His office is down the hall  
Why do I feel uneasy?  
I know he must be good  
Got credentials all over the wall  
I hear a voice behind me say  
What seems to be the trouble, my dear?  
Won't you be kind enough to step over here  
It might be fever, it might be flu  
To isolate it, I'll have to hold you  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
In my opinion  
All we can do to isolate it  
I'll hold you overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight

Please don't think me ungrateful  
But holding me overnight  
Seems a little extreme  
Do you always serve martinis  
And turn the lights down low  
Doctor, do your colleagues know?  
Although you say it's good for me  
I really don't feel like dancing now  
Somebody's waiting and I'm double-parked anyhow  
It might be fever, it might be flu  
To isolate it, I'll have to hold you  
Overnight  
(Observation)

Now, I may look stupid  
But I'll tell you what  
I've been around a long time  
And I thought I had heard everything  
I tell you, they keep coming up with them  
I just couldn't believe my ears when he said  
Kick off your shoes, relax my dear  
Slip into something comfortable  
Two seconds flat, I'm out the door and down the hall  
It might be fever, it might be flu  
To isolate it, I'll have to hold you  
Overnight  
(Observation)
