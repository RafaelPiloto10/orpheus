My charcoal's getting red hot,  
Put your order in my hand.  
Won't you let me show you what I got  
Sizzlin' in the pan.  
  
Any way you want it baby,  
I am your burger man.  
  
If you need good hot grillin',  
Try my burger stand.  
If you need a slice of thrillin',  
I'm the baddest in the land.  
  
Any way you want it baby,  
I am your burger man.  
  
Did you want double meat?  
How 'bout some fries on the side?  
  
Once you try my burger baby,  
You'll grow a new thyroid gland.  
I said just eat my burger, baby,  
Make you smart as Charlie Chan.  
  
You see the hot sauce can't be beat.  
Sit back and open wide.
