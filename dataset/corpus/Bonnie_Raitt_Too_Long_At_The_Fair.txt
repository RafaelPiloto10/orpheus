Jesus cried, wept and died  
I guess he went up to heaven  
I've been downtown such a long, long time  
I'll never make it home by seven  
Won't you come and take me home  
I've been too long at the fair  
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore  
  
Well I went down to Jason's  
Walked 'til my feet got sore  
But I never knew what laughin' was  
'Til you walked out the door  
Won't you come and take me home  
I've been too long at the fair  
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore  
  
You can give my soul to Abraham  
Give my soul to Saul  
Give my bones to Canada  
My teeth, they don't hurt at all  
  
I don't know who made the highway  
I guess that's just my pride  
But I have heard the Prince of Darkness  
On his charger ride  
  
The silver blade is gleamin'  
The scales are in his hands  
I swear that night is fallin'  
Don't you lose another man  
Won't you come and take me home  
I've been too long at the fair  
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore
