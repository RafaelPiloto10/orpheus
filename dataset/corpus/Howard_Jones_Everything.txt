I want to be...  
The coffee in your pot  
I want to be the shower in the morning  
That's steamy and hot  
  
I want to be...  
The cherry that paints your lips  
I want to be the stick shift  
At your fingertips  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be your everything!  
  
I want to be...  
The wine that swirls around your tongue  
I want to be the Harley  
That you sit upon  
  
I want to be...  
The elvis that makes you scream and shake  
I want to be the velvet  
That hugs your pretty shape  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be your everything!  
  
The trouble is you just don't know who the hell I am  
But I'll change that little detail, if I can  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be... I want to be your everything!  
  
The trouble is you don't even know who the hell I am  
But I'll change that little detail, if I can  
  
What ever I think of its never enough  
To show you my love  
I want to be... I want to be... I want to be your everything!  
  
I want to be your everything! (that's all just everything)  
I want to be your everything! (that's all just everything)  
I want to be your... I want to be your...  
I want to be your everything! (that's all just everything)
