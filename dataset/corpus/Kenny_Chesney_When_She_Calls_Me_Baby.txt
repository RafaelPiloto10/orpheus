She'll call me honey, when she needs a helpin' hand,  
She might say darlin' if she needs someone who understands.  
She'll call me sugar, if she's feelin' kind of sweet,  
She'll say that I'm crazy over my little jealousy.  
  
But when she calls me baby, I just reach for the light,  
And I'll hold her like a lady, thank God she's all mine.  
With her arms around me, I can't leave the world behind.  
When she calls me baby, well, I know what's on her mind.  
  
When this life has brought me to my knees,  
She's got a way of bring out the man in me.  
  
When she calls me baby, I just reach for the light,  
And I'll hold her like a lady, thank God she's all mine.  
With her arms around me, I can't leave the world behind.  
When she calls me baby, well, I know what's on her mind.  
  
Oh, when she calls me baby, well, I know what's on her mind.
