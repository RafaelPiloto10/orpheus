You wake up in the morning drink a beer and take a Valium  
And you're trying to forget about the things you did last night  
Flip through the morning paper read the horoscope and the comics  
You're as well informed as anybody on the left or the right  
You make it to your job and hear Atlanta lost another  
How can you lose while making half a million bucks or near  
The old man who sweeps the floor and wears a big blue Reagan button  
Says the Russians are a coming but they've been here for years  
Trying everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels it's the all new American diet  
Trying everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels  
You get on it and you're on it for the rest of your life

There's a story in the paper about a man who killed his family  
He jumped off a bridge because he couldn't take it anymore  
Down at the local tavern a young man comes in limpin'  
And he claims that he's a veteran of the Falkland Islands war  
You head home and you're accosted by a youngster wearin' robes  
And wanting money for his God who sits upon a plastic throne  
You ignore him if you can and make it to the local tavern  
Where you order up a drink and give some money to your own  
Trying everything from Jesus...  
There's a man in Tennessee who's got it figured out completely  
I guess that he's as happy as a thinking man can be  
I asked him what he thought and he said brother let me tell you  
Try a little bit of both and leave out everything in between  
Trying everything from Jesus...
