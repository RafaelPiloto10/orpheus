As the evening comes to pass  
I prepare myself to ask  
Never knowing what may come  
Oh! Oh!  
  
Close the door and turn the key  
Breathing in uncertainty  
As my heart begins to race  
Oh! Oh!  
  
I see all things  
From my mind's innocence  
When they call me  
I hear their prophecy  
  
You say I must  
Face my own deliverance  
Did you choose me  
Have I lost sanity  
  
These eyes can see right through me  
I feel your soul inside  
What have you waiting for me  
I'll do what you decide  
  
And now this possession  
Becomes my obsession  
Adrift in illusion  
I'm sent into confusion  
  
Such torment and sadness  
That overwhelms like madness  
So fearful and intense  
It burns inside  
  
I'll spread the word  
Around the world  
My name will last  
Eternally  
  
I have the power  
I have the choice  
They'll hear my voice  
For centuries  
  
Pandora's Box is opened  
Too late no turning round  
A paradox has woken  
I serve with honor bound  
  
I take this possession  
And make it my obsession  
Alive in illusion  
To make sense from confusion  
  
Come torment come sadness  
Give me the joy of madness  
This fear and this intent  
Runs deep inside  
  
This deepest possession  
For my life  
I want this obsession  
In my life  
I claim this possession  
Take my life
