I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes  
When you take you got to give so live and let live or let go  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
  
I could promise you things like big diamond rings  
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover so you better think it
over  
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true  
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it
matter  
  
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy  
Come along and share the good times while we can  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine girl there's gotta be a little rain sometimes  
  
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon  
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go  
But there's one thing I want you to know  
You better look before you leap still water runs deep  
  
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out  
And you know what I'm talking about  
So smile for a while...
