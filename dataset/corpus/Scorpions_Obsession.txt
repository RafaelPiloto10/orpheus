Girl, I don't think of you  
At least that's what I try to do, oh  
And I just miss those days  
Our secret little place, oh well, oh  
But I'll be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
'Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
(Feels so good to be your lover)  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
(Lips are kissing you all over)  
And no matter what I do  
I can't get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
Now I don't feel the pain  
My world went upside down, insane, oh  
And I don't miss those nights  
Now maybe that's a lie as well, oh  
Still I'll be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
'Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
(Feels so good to be your lover)  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
(Lips are kissing you all over)  
And no matter what I do  
I can't get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
It's where I belong, in my life  
In my life  
And I'll be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
'Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
(Feels so good to be your lover)  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
(Lips are kissing you all over)  
And no matter what I do  
I can't get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life, in my life  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
There's nothing left to do  
But to say those words to you  
Oh yes, I do
