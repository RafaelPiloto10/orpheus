Traveling down a different road  
Trying hard to leave the load  
We take it there but you can't let go  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Back in Eden we were tried  
Found ourselves dissatisfied  
Seeking wisdom that he denied  
Trying hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Hide in me, confide in me  
Oh, don't you think it's time to be  
Everything we ever tried to be  
So you and me can lay it down  
  
Speak to me, don't be ashamed  
There's no need in playing games  
Cause after all we're all the same  
Just trying hard to lay it down  
  
Wish my words could make it well  
Wish that I could break the shell  
Take us from our self-made well  
Find a way to lay it down  
  
Burdened by the things I've learned  
I'm hurting because I'm too concerned  
Nonetheless I confess I yearn  
To find a way to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
Wish that I could lay it down  
Wish that I could lay it down
