Blue suns and grey lagoons  
Silver starfish with honeymoons  
All these and more to choose  
If you  
  
Satin teardrops on velvet lights  
Morning sickness on Friday nights  
Heaven knows what others I might bring  
To you  
  
Broken partings making strange goodbyes  
Hopeless cases with fake alibis  
Even hoping we'll be there to share  
With you  
  
Blue suns and gray lagoons  
Grey lagoons  
Grey lagoons
