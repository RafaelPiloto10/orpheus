The world around us hangs in doubt  
You face a crime that we'll hear about  
To pay the cost would never be the same  
Eternal lovers we're not to blame  
There's no mistake there's no refrain  
The same surroundings that stood  
Are here again - this time...  
  
As I look around you can't be found  
To lose you I'd rather see  
The endless time of space go passing by  
This time around...  
This time around...  
So look around we all will be found  
In love...

Fly...  
By...
