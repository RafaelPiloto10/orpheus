'Remember the time'  
I've heard those words before but now they're mine  
Every memory, all the sweet times shine  
Is living here in my heart and mind, oh  
  
Every laugh  
We shared together, yeah we still give back  
Can you believe all the fun we've had?  
Just gettin' ready for the other half  
  
You know a friend becomes a part of you  
Like this dream that's finally comin' true  
Comin' true!  
  
It's all good, all right  
'See ya later' doesn't mean 'goodbye'  
'Cause it ain't over just time to fly  
And we're just gettin' started, oh  
  
Let's celebrate  
Life is comin', yeah and I can't wait  
It's a ride that we all get to take  
We're gonna help each other find our way, oh  
  
Every friend is now a part of me  
Together we're just like a family  
Just breakin' free!  
  
It's all good, all right  
'See ya later' doesn't mean 'goodbye'  
It ain't over just time to fly  
And we're just gettin' started, just gettin' started!  
  
It's all good, all right  
Our world is changin' that ain't no surprise  
But that can't stop us just let it try  
'Cause we're just gettin' started  
  
Who knows what we'll find  
It's the great unknown, the steppin' stone  
Wherever we're goin' I know  
We're gonna get there from here, hey yeah, hoo!  
  
It's all good, all right  
'See ya later' doesn't mean 'goodbye'  
'Cause it ain't over just time to fly  
And we're just gettin' started, just gettin' started  
  
It's all good, all right  
Our world is changin' that ain't no surprise  
That can't stop us just let it try, let it try, let it try  
'Cause we're just gettin' started  
  
It's all good, all right  
'See ya later' doesn't mean 'goodbye'
