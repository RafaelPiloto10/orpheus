Building dreams has always been my way  
Making time and living for the day  
Burning bridges never made me cry  
I could walk away with no goodbye  
Easy take or easy leave them all  
'Til you scratch the writing on the wall  
  
It's on and off and on again  
Going on and then  
Taking all I got again  
Bleeding me leaving me dry  
You're hanging on for what you can  
Dragging out the pain  
Taking all I give again  
Fakin' it making me cry  
  
One day someday I may slide away  
Turn around and call it all a day  
Even though I fooled myself for years  
I can't escape this ringing in my ears  
  
It's on and off and on again  
Going on and then  
Taking all I got again  
Bleeding me leaving me dry  
You're hanging on for what you can  
Dragging out the pain  
Taking all I give again  
Fakin' it making me cry
