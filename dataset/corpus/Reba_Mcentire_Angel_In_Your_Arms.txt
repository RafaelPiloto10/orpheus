Do you think I'm such a fool  
To believe everything you say is true  
Well that just goes to show  
That you really don't know  
While you're out painting the town  
Do you think I'm home just sitting around  
Waiting on you  
Now who's really the fool  
  
When I first found out I hurt all over  
I felt so left out till I got to know her  
So I drived away as she got over  
And I became just like her  
  
So don't be surprised to find that  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
  
Why'd you slip around secretly  
If you were tired of loving me  
Why do you keep holding on  
When love was already gone  
The time you said you wasn't feeling well  
Did you think I couldn't tell  
You've been with someone else  
You were only kidding yourself  
  
When I first found out I hurt all over  
I felt so left out till I got to know her  
So I drived away as she got over  
And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
The angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight  
Yes the angel in your arms this morning  
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
