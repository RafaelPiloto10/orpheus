Here in the dawn  
As I walk through this dream  
As I have done since ages now gone  
Shall I read you the letter  
They sent postmarked from somewhere out here  
It's in Latin, I think, I don't know  
Can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Near to their bed (they never sleep)  
They sit sipping their tea, watch the sea  
Move the sand through their heads (sit in their chairs by the bay)  
Did I show you the marks on the wall  
Left by captains now dead (house out on the cove)  
They fell fighting for peace in their lives  
Or so it is said (still nobody seems to be here)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
You can't miss it  
A blue forest on a green sky  
You must risk it  
Don't ignore us if you want us to  
If we want us to survive  
Where will I be (can't you help me to find my way)  
After watching them walking the pier  
At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)  
They're in love with the news  
And don't show if they're living in fear (still nobody seems to be here)  
They eat ice cream alone  
Watch the waves at the end of the pier (ah, nobody seems to hear)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear
