Give me your gold  
  
Blue moon is walking  
These lips are smoking  
Big time disaster  
My heart gets faster  
My pot is melting  
Doctors consulting destiny  
Give it to me  
  
This is  
Your show and it's old  
And it's a wonder  
This day I give it to you  
Give it to you  
  
Give me your gold  
Give me your gold  
  
You got a nugget in your pocket  
Got a nugget in your hand  
You got a nugget in your pocket  
Got a nugget for a grand  
So forget your hesitation  
Take a dozen invitation  
Like it's for a great confusion  
Like it's for a grand illusion  
  
Clouds  
Love  
Stars  
Colors  
  
Take it into the night
