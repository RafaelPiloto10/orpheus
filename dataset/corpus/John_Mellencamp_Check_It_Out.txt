Million young poets  
Screamin' out their words  
To a world full of people  
Just livin' to be heard  
Future generations  
Ridin' on the highways that we built  
I hope, that they have better understanding  
  
Check it out  
Goin' to work on Monday  
Check it out  
Got yourself a family  
Check it out  
All utility bills have been paid  
You can't tell your best buddy  
That you love him  
So check it out  
Where does our time go  
Check it out  
Got a brand new house in escrow  
Check it out  
Sleepin' with your back  
To your loved one  
This is all, that we have learned  
About happiness  
  
Check it out,  
Forgot to say hello to my neighbours  
Check it out  
Sometimes I question my own behavior  
Check it out  
Talkin' about the girls, we've  
Seen on the sly  
Just to tell our souls  
We're still the young lions  
So check it out  
Getting' too drunk on Saturdays  
Check it out  
Playin' football with the kids  
On Sundays  
Check it out  
Soaring with the eagles all week long  
And this is all, we have learned  
About living  
This is all, we have learned  
About living  
  
A million young poets  
Screamin' out their words  
Maybe someday  
Those words will be heard  
By future generations  
Ridin' on the highways that we built  
Maybe they'll have a better understanding  
Check it out  
Maybe they'll have a better understanding  
Check it out  
Maybe they'll have a better understanding  
Check it out  
Maybe they'll have a better understanding  
Check it out  
Hope they'll have a better understanding  
Check it out
