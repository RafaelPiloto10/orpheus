When I look out over a green field of clover  
Or watch the sunset at the end of the day  
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
I see a fountain flow from a mountain  
Or see April showers bring flowers to May  
I can't help but ponder, life is such a wonder  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
Words can't describe what I feel inside  
When I see the beauty in each coming day  
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm  
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away  
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger  
The storm's even beautiful in it's own way  
  
When I see the leaves drop from off of the treetops  
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day  
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder  
God, made all things beautiful in their own way  
  
Words can't describe what I feel inside  
When I see the beauty in each coming day  
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
In it's own way  
In it's own way
