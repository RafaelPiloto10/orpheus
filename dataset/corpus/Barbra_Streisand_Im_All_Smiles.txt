I'm all smiles, darlin'  
You'd be too  
If you knew, darlin'  
All of the smiles were for you  
I'm all chills, darlin'  
Through and through  
But my cold hands, darlin'  
Warm to the touch of you  
Rain hasn't fallen for days now  
But rainbows are fillin' the skies  
My heart must have painted those rainbows  
Shinin' before my eyes  
Can't you tell that I'm in love, darlin'?  
Deep and true, with guess who, darlin'  
Someone I die for  
Beg steal or lie for  
Eat humble pie for  
Someone to fly  
To the sun, moon and sky for  
Someone to live for  
To love with and cry for  
And that someone is you
