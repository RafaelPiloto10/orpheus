(speech:)  
Ok here we go, for this  
We got a b-side to make, ladies and gentlemen,  
We haven't got much time now so we better get  
Right on with it  
  
I don't care anymore  
And Ill kick down anybodys door  
To hold you in my arms once more  
Id go anywhere  
Yknow I don't care  
  
If your man should get uptight  
cause weve been alone for most of the night  
Now realize its our right  
To get back up them stairs  
Yknow I don't care  
  
Theres a line I can draw  
That often leaves me wanting more  
But its not so often that I feel so sure  
Nothing I can do  
To stop me falling more in love with you  
  
It can't be so bad  
What you want that you do not have  
Its got you too upset now  
I don't think its unfair  
Yknow I don't care  
Anymore  
And Ill kick down anybodys door  
To hold you in my arms once more  
Id go anywhere  
Yknow I  
  
(very nice, tony)
