I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,  
Chemicals flying, oh I love this.  
What's it all for if you can't feel the ecstasy?  
What's it all for if you can't touch the power,  
The will to live in the hour ?  
Don't steal what I have got, baby,  
'Cause it's hardly enough for myself.  
Don't steal what I've got, baby,  
'Cause the balance is thin like a shell.  
I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,  
Chemicals flying, oh I love this.  
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment?  
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment,  
The moment of kiss.  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless when I'm with you.  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless through and through.  
What am I gonna wear? I don't care.  
Nobody sees the inside.  
Oh, the radio's gonna take us out  
Take us out on a ride.  
I put on perfume and I walk in the room  
The world stands still with you in the room.  
I cross the floor and I'm high and I'm rich  
When I'm under your lips and your fingertips.  
I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,  
Chemicals flying into the mist.  
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment?  
What's it all for if you can't feel the power?  
What's it all for if you can't, can't live right here  
In the hour, in the hour, in the hour?  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless when I'm with you.  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless through and through.
