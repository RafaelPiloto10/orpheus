I carry with me all the love that you give  
You brought me serenity, a reason to live  
Our life is a journey  
That we took from the start  
We made all these memories together  
  
I can remember  
The first time that we met  
The feelings you gave to me, I'll never forget  
I knew from that moment  
When our love first began  
We'd last till the end of time forever  
  
And though there were bad times  
We stood by each other  
And did what we had to get through  
  
You live in my heart, when you're far away  
I see you in dreams where I hear you say  
I'm with you forever, in true love  
By light of the day and stars above  
  
And when there were bad times  
We held on each other  
To face what we had to get through  
  
You live in my heart, when you're far away  
I see you in dreams, when I hear you say  
Look up to heaven, and I'll be there  
Still guiding my heart  
Still saying our prayer
