I heard opposites attract so you're stuck with me  
I'm like Jack Kerouac on the road for weeks  
But when I come home you'll be there for me, right?  
Without you I'll never make it  
  
I got a sick sense, I got a reason to worry  
And sometimes I'm dense but these thoughts come in a flurry  
You say they're nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry  
I don't think I'll ever make it alone  
  
Annihilate, I'm wide awake  
Don't walk away, I'm suffocating  
  
Don't change your mind 'cause you'll be killing me  
Hitting another all time low and there's no where left to go  
Make up your mind, don't be the death of me  
If you want me here I am counting down to zero  
  
I got a panic attack like you wouldn't believe  
And my breathing's out of whack like a drum machine  
I know if I pass out you'd resuscitate me, right?  
Without you I'll never make it  
  
Is it okay now or did you meet someone better  
Without a Mohawk with a real job and a sweater?  
Leaving me shell shocked, steady getting ready for a header  
I don't think I'll ever make it alone  
  
Annihilate, I'm wide awake  
Don't walk away, I'm suffocating  
  
Don't change your mind 'cause you'll be killing me  
Hitting another all time low and there's no where left to go  
Make up your mind, don't be the death of me  
If you want me here I am counting down to zero  
  
Standing on the edge of the great divide  
You're pushing all the right buttons to make worlds collide  
Would you stab me in the back like a homicide  
Or leave me buried in your bullshit like a landslide?  
  
Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along?  
As I sit and I scream this song  
  
Are you biding your time with me  
Waiting for someone better to come along?  
If you are I proved you wrong  
  
Both ends burn, I'll be waiting for you  
I won't turn, I'll be waiting for you  
Both ends burn, I'll be waiting for you  
  
Don't change your mind 'cause you'll be killing me  
Hitting at an all time low and there's no where left to go  
  
Don't change your mind 'cause you'll be killing me  
Striking at an all time low, and there's no where left to go  
Make up your mind, don't be the death of me  
If you want me here I am counting down to zero
