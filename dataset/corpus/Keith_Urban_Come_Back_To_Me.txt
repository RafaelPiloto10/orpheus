If there's sand that you ain't wrote your name in  
If you're tired of the view from the same window  
If there's lips that you wanna get drunk on  
Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on, go  
See everythin' you think you need to see  
Then come back to me  
  
If there's pavement you ain't put your shoes on  
If there's dance floors you ain't made a move on yet  
If you're feelin' too safe here beside me  
And you wanna do somethin' you might regret  
Try the whole world on if you feel the need  
Then come back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't want  
You to miss a thing  
I wouldn't wake  
You from any dream  
You ever have  
So, go on, and go, unroll every map  
But if you gotta leave  
You gotta know  
I love you enough  
To let you go  
If there's greener grass  
Hey, I wanna hold you, but I don't wanna hold you back  
  
If you fly like a bird in the Jetstream  
Hope the sky is a Hollywood set scene blue  
If you land with a tan and your shades on  
Hope the promise the postcard made comes true  
But if it ain't all that you dreamed it to be  
Come back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you find someone else who deserves you  
Hope he loves you enough not to hurt you  
But if he does, you know right where I'll be  
Come back to me
