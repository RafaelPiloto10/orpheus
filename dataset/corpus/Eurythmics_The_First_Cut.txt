The first cut  
Is a criminal thing  
The first cut  
Goes deeper in  
Each impression  
Makes a chain reaction  
Each impression  
Will never be never be never be never be broken  
I'm a white girl  
You can see my skin  
Look at this picture  
That I'm living in  
And old scores never settle down  
I'll keep on walking  
Till I'm buried in the cold ground  
Cold ground, cold cold ground  
Each impression  
Makes a chain reaction  
Each impression  
Will never be never be never be never be broken  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
...
