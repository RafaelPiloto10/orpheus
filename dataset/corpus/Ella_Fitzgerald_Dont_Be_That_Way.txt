April skies are in your eyes  
But, darling, don't be blue  
  
Don't cry  
Oh, honey, please  
Don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the sky  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears are in vain so, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
See it through  
You'll have me  
I'll have you  
  
Sweetheart  
Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
Don't cry  
Oh, honey, please  
Don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the skies  
Should never make you feel that way  
  
The rain  
Will bring the violets of May  
Tears in vain  
So, honey, please, don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
Will see it through  
You'll have me  
And I'll have you  
  
Sweetheart  
Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart  
Oh, honey, please don't be that way  
  
Don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Clouds in the sky  
Dig those crazy sky  
Should never make you feel that way  
So don't be that way  
Dig the rain  
Pitter, pitter, pitter, pitter-patter  
Bring the violets of may  
Pitter-patter of rain drops  
Tears in vain  
Tears, tears  
So, honey, please don't be that way  
Don't be that way  
  
As long as we  
Will see it through  
Oh, baby, you'll have me  
And I'll have you  
Sweetheart  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
Tomorrow is another day  
Don't break my heart  
  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Looky here, baby, don't cry  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
Clouds in the sky  
  
Should never make you feel that way  
Yeah, don't cry  
Honey, please, don't be that way  
  
Clouds in the sky  
Oh, honey, please, don't be that way  
No, I'll never be that way
