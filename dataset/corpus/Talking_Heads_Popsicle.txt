I'm hanging round the airport  
I'm waiting for the plane  
Mmm, something sweet and sticky  
Runnin'down my hand  
  
Popsicle of love  
Gimme gimme gimme one of those  
(It's summertime, boy!)  
coconut delight  
Honey honey honey don't let go  
(It's summertime, love)  
  
Mmm, a kinky little sister  
Mmm, a-wearin' rubber gloves  
A sexual health emergency  
A copulation fantasy  
You and me, ecstasy  
Hate to be reality  
  
Popsicle of love  
Gimme gimme gimme one of those (hoo!)  
(It's summertime, boy!)  
I'm taking off my clothes  
Honey honey honey don't let go  
(It's summertime, love)  
  
Ask, it shall be given  
Pay, and ye shall receive  
Cigarettes and pantyhose  
Hit me in the funny bone  
Hynie hole Tootsie roll  
Jelly roll Time to go  
  
Popsicle of love  
Gimme gimme gimme one of those  
(It's summertime, boy!)  
coconut delight  
Honey honey honey don't let go  
(It's summertime, love)  
  
I'm throwing up my hands  
Buddy buddy, what's wrong with you  
(It's summertime, boy!)  
I'm blowing up my mind  
Lemme lemme see what I can do  
(It's summertime, boy!)
