Fell asleep today  
North Ontario  
Woke up far away  
A place I didn't know  
  
A woman smiled at me  
She said, "welcome to my home"  
Life is different here she said it's not  
Camouflage with gold  
  
And hey, leave the light on for me  
And hey, leave the light on for me  
  
Might not make it home  
Can't leave here tonight  
Not afraid to live  
Not afraid to die  
  
And hey, leave a light on for me  
And hey, leave a light on for me.
