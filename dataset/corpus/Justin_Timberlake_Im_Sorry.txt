I'm Sorry  
  
Can someone tell me why I always hurt you  
'Cause honestly, I just don't understand  
You would've given me the world, if I asked  
But now I'll never have that chance again  
  
I miss the way you made me smile  
And how you looked into my eyes  
I wish I couldn take back all those things I said  
But now all I can do is apologize  
  
But that's not enough..  
  
[Chorus:]  
You loved me, I left you  
I'm crying, 'cause I need you  
I miss you, but you're gone now  
And it's my fault, and I'm alone now  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
