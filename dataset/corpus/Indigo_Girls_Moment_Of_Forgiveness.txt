Well I guess that I was lonely  
That's why I called you on the phone  
Cause in a moment of forgiveness  
I didn't want to be alone  
  
And I guess that I was willin  
More than I ever was before  
Cause in a moment of forgiveness  
I come a knockin at your door  
  
Baby I woke up crying last night  
Just to realize that you were gone  
Has it been two long years without you  
Tell me now  
When are you gonna come home  
  
Guess that I was hoping  
That you'd finally understand  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
You'd reach out and take my hand  
  
Now baby I know  
Your not one for bearing witness  
(baby I know)  
And you told me that  
One wrong move is gonna sell you out  
(one wrong move)  
And I see that you kept your word  
(see that you kept your word)  
And made it harder than it had to be  
Wish I could save you the trouble baby  
(oh oh oh)  
Give you a little piece of mind  
  
Baby I woke up crying last night  
Just to realize that you were gone  
It's been two long years without you  
When are you gonna come home  
  
Guess that I was hoping  
That you'd finally understand  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
You'd reach out and take my hand  
  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
You'd reach out and take my hand
