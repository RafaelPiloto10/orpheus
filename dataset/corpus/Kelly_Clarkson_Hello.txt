Yes I stumbled into the night  
We're touching but I feel like you're still out of reach  
But people hear a buzzing like a bug on a line  
I'm feeling like I always see them, but they can't see me  
  
Said a man of feelings  
Never get me anywhere  
My heart concern is beating  
Is there anybody, anybody?  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello, hello  
Is anybody listening?  
Let go! It's everyone that's calling me  
Oh oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone  
  
Yeah I'm coming through this desert of stone  
These faces on the statues that I used to know  
Wishing I was more than what my story is told  
Or hoping that I'm dreaming in the day and this isn't happening  
  
Gotta keep it altogether  
Longing for a hand to hold  
Keep clear of the shadows  
Is there anybody, anybody?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holding on to the memories of when I, I didn't know  
Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone  
  
[Chorus: x2]
