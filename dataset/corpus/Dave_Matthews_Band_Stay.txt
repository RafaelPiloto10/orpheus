We were walking  
Just the other day  
It was so hot outside  
You could fry an egg  
Remember you were talking  
I watched as sweat ran down your face  
Reached up and caught it at your chin  
Licked my fingertip  
Wasting time  
Let the hours roll by  
Doing nothing for the fun  
Little taste of the good life  
Whether right or wrong  
Makes us want to stay, stay, stay  
For awhile  
Later on the sun began to fade  
Then the clouds rolled over our heads  
And it began to rain  
Oh we were dancing mouths open  
Splashing tongue taste  
For a moment this good time would never end  
You and me  
You and me  
Just wasting time  
I was kissing you  
You were kissing me love  
From good day into a moonlight  
Now a night so fine  
Makes us wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile  
Wasting time  
I shall miss these things  
When it all rolls by  
What a day  
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile  
Hey love  
Oh just groping you  
Rolling in the mud  
Stay a while  
Come on love  
Wanna stay, stay, stay, stay for awhile
