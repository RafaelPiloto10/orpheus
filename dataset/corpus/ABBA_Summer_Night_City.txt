Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city
