I was doom riding on top a black horse  
Whatever prize there was  
I could only observe where the trouble starts  
Where does it end?  
  
I cannot be cured  
Before it ends  
I know life would be different if I held on (held on)  
I know I could be something if I held on  
  
Gave her love away  
Put it in my pocket when it should've been framed  
Oh, it lost its shine  
Gotta get this out of my head  
  
Out of my brain  
How could it end,  
End like this?  
How could it end?  
  
I know life would be different had I held on (held on)  
I know I could be something had I held on (held on)  
I know I could be something if I held on (held on)  
I know life would be different if I held on (held on)  
  
Held on  
Held on, if I held on  
Held on, if I held on  
Held on, if I held on  
  
Held on.
