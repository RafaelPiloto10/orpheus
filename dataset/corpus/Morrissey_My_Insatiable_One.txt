In the high life, I've got this feeling now  
I've got this horrible feeling  
On the escalator, they took it out on him  
As the ridiculous world went by  
  
Oh, he's gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh ...  
  
  
On the high wire, dressed in a leotard  
There wobbles one hell of a retard  
On the escalator, you shit paracetamol  
As the ridiculous world goes by  
  
  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh ...  
  
  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
And he was my inflatable one  
Oh ...
