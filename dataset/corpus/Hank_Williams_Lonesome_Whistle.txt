I was ridin' number nine  
Headin' south from Caroline  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
Got in trouble, had to roam  
Left my gal and left my home  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
Just a kid actin' smart  
I went and broke my darlin's heart  
I guess I was too young to know  
They took me off the Georgia Main  
Locked me to a ball and chain  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
All alone I bear the shame  
I'm a number not a name  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
All I do is sit and cry  
When the evenin' train goes by  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
And my hair turns whiter than snow  
I'll never see that gal of mine  
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
