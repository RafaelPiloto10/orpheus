Let me down slow an' easy  
'Cause there ain't nothin' I can do  
I hope and pray, my faith won't leave me  
When it comes down to me an' you  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin' next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Overflow of emotion  
And a hurt that'll never heal  
If you close the door forever  
The fate of pain is sealed  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin' next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
I more than long for your affection  
You tell me now that ain't so  
Not even gentle persuasion  
Is ever gonna let me go  
You lyin' next to me, yea  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Let me breathe  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?
