Fairytale, my life was just a fairytale  
I was letting an illusion  
Come into this heart of mine  
Fairytale, searchin' for a fairytale  
Hiding in a world  
Where life was simple all the time  
I was just like Peter Pan in Never Never Land  
Afraid of what the future might be  
Afraid to face the things I couldn't understand  
Afraid of things that I couldn't see  
But fantasy, I know  
There's more to life than a fantasy  
There's so much more  
That my life was meant to be  
So much more than make-believe  
Fairytale, it seems just like fairytale  
But there's something in my hear  
That says this time the story's real  
Fairytale, extraordinary tale  
Of a King who offers love  
So far beyond what I can feel  
There's a world out there  
That human eyes can never see  
But it's just within the reach of the heart  
Two princes wages the battle for eternity  
But the Victor has been known from the start  
Now I can see the truth  
Can seem so much like a fantasy  
But make-believe was never as real to me  
I know this time the story's true  
Just like Sleeping Beauty in a Neverland  
I was dying under a spell  
But then a Prince who comes from the Foreverland  
Awakened me from my fairytale
