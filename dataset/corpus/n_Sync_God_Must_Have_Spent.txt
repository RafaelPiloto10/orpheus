Can this be true, tell me can this be real  
How can I put into words what I feel  
My life was complete, I thought I was whole  
Why do I feel like I'm losing control  
  
I never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you changed my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, it's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river  
Peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep  
When I look into your eyes  
I know that it's true  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
Oh a little more time, yes he did baby  
  
In all of creation, all things great and small  
You are the one that surpasses them all  
More precious than and diamond or pearl  
They broke the mold when you came in this world  
  
And I'm trying hard to figure out  
Just how I ever did without  
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child  
That's deep inside and leaves me purified  
  
Your love is like a river  
Peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep  
When I look into your eyes  
I know that it's true  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
  
On you...  
Yes he did baby  
  
I never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you changed my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, it's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river  
Peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep  
When I look into your eyes  
I know that it's true  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
  
On you...  
God must have spent a little more time on you  
A little more time on you, oh
