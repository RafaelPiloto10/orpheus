"Take this man to prison," the man heard herod say,  
And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away.  
Chained up between two watchmen, peter tried to sleep,  
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep.  
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,  
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,  
And running to his people before the break of day,  
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:  
  
Angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angels watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.  
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.  
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,  
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.  
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.  
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight  
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.  
If you're asking what's protecting me then you're gonna hear me say:  
  
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angles watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me  
  
Angels watching over me  
Angels watching over me  
  
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angels watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
Angels watching over me,  
Angels watching over me,  
Angels watching over me,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home
