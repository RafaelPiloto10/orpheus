It was a lovely April shower,  
It was a most convenient door,  
I found a million dollar baby  
In a five and ten cent store.  
The rain continued for an hour  
I hung around for three or four  
Around the million dollar baby  
In the five and ten cent store.  
  
She was selling china  
And when she made those eyes,  
I kept buying china  
Until the crowd got wise.  
  
Incidentally,  
If you should run into a shower,  
Well step inside my cottage door,  
And meet the million dollar baby  
From the five and ten cent store  
  
Love comes along like a popular song  
Anytime or anywhere at all,  
Rain or sunshine,  
Spring or fall.  
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello  
In a very unexpected place,  
For example, take my case.
