You're hanging around and got nuthin' to do  
You want to get out some pills in front of you  
You fly on invisivble wings  
Be careful my friend for too many can kill  
You say that the meaning of life's in those pills  
You forget all earthly things  
  
You swallow your pill you want to feel free  
A trip to a world made of games  
You do it again yet it's never the same  
But a junkie's not somethin' to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Starlight! Fallin' in deep through your eyes!  
Starlight! Shinin' down for your soul to arise!  
  
Now there's a needle lying in front of you  
I'm frightened of those things  
But I'll know what you'll do  
You need it to escape from the night, ha ha  
You ride on through heaven you don't feel no pain  
You ride on and ride on again and again  
On the needle that brings you the light  
  
You feel the mind-blowin' stuff  
Flow through your veins  
You take off and fly to the sun  
But when you get too near your wings will be burnt  
You'll die in the flames and you'll fall
