A fool never learns  
To get away, just run away before his heart begins to break  
A fool never learns  
He'll wait around, just hang around to see how much his heart can take  
A fool never learns  
To some girls love is just a game  
And some girls treat all fool the same  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'm a gonna hang around, wait around  
Hope she'll love me again some day  
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls who'd love to be just mine  
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just can't remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'm a gonna hang around, wait around  
Hope she'll love me again some day  
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls who'd love to be just mine  
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just can't remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing
