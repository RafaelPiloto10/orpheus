You don't remember what to say  
You don't remember what to do  
You don't remember where to go  
You don't remember what to choose  
You wheel, you steal, you feel, you kneel down  
  
All the stony people  
Walking 'round in Christian licorice clothes  
I can't hesitate  
And I can't wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
The sunshine reminds you of concreted skies  
You thought you were flying but you opened your eyes  
And you found yourself falling back to yesterday's lies  
Hello, Pleasant Street, you know she's back again  
You wheel, you steal, you feel, you kneel down  
  
All the stony people  
Walking 'round in Christian licorice clothes  
I can't hesitate  
And I can't wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
At twilight your lover comes to your room  
He'll spin you, he'll weave you 'round his emerald loom  
And softly you'll whisper all around his ear  
"Sweet lover, I love Pleasant Street  
I wheel, I steal, I feel my way down to kneel"  
  
All the stony people  
Walking 'round in Christian licorice clothes  
I can't hesitate  
And I can't wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
You don't remember what to say  
You don't remember what to do  
You don't remember which way to go  
You don't remember who to choose  
You wheel, you steal, you feel, you kneel down
