She wakes up in the morning  
In the same room that she's been in her whole life  
And everything still looks the same  
But the feeling of the room has changed in spite  
  
She said  
"You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind"  
She said  
"You don't know what it's like to be stuck in my mind all the time"  
  
Bruised lips and the make-up  
Tattooed hips and pierced  
For the sake of letting everybody know  
She don't belong here  
Old tricks that she made up  
  
Attitude  
I don't give a fuck  
For the sake of letting everybody know  
She says I won't belong So long  
It's not a lost cause  
She's just a runaway  
  
Is there nothing left for you to say?  
And if she comes home  
Do you think she'll want to stay?  
Is there anything for her?  
She's a runaway  
Turn your back on yesterday  
She calls at seven thirty  
  
And wants to talk about her boyfriend one last time  
Mom and Dad are fighting in the background,  
Shattered glass cuts through red wine  
I said,  
"I don't know that I'm right but I know that you're wrong"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blacked out  
Passed out at a party  
In another town  
With the same old Bacardi  
Nothing ever changes what's inside me  
Someone find me, someone find me  
My heart showed me the way out  
  
Don't stop  
Don't give up on me now  
Two beats, two streets  
Too many repeats to blow my only other way out  
  
[Chorus]
