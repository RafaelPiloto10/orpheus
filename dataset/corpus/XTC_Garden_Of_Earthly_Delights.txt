Kid,  
Stay and snip your cord off,  
Talk and let your mind loose,  
Can't all think like Chekov,  
But you'll be o.k.  
  
Kid,  
Is this your first time here?  
Some can't stand the beauty,  
So they cut off one ear,  
But you'll be o.k.  
  
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights.  
Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
This is your life and you spend it all.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
Just don't hurt nobody,  
And the big reward's here,  
In the garden of earthly delights.  
  
Kid,  
Pick up with another,  
Some will even drop you,  
But hearts are built like rubber,  
So you'll be alright.  
  
Kid,  
Swallow but believe us,  
You won't die of boredom,  
Should you have to leave us,  
It'll be alright.  
  
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights.  
Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
This is your life and you spend it all.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
Just don't hurt nobody,  
'less of course they ask you,  
In the garden of earthly delights.
