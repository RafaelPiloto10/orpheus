Glorify the Lord  
Glorify the Lord  
Glorify the Lord  
Come on and make His praise  
Glorious  
Glorious  
  
[Verse:]  
From every mountain  
To every valley low  
Open your fountain  
And let the praises flow  
Sing Hallelujah  
Come on and make His praise  
Glorious  
  
From every nation  
To every city street  
All of creation, worship His majesty  
Sing hallelujah  
Come on and make His praise  
Glorious  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Everybody make a joyful noise  
Unto the Lord  
Glorify Him  
Everybody sing unto the Lord  
For He is good  
Glorify Him  
  
[Bridge:]  
Sing Hallelujah, sing  
Sing Hallelujah, sing  
Sing Hallelujah, sing  
Glorify Him  
Sing Hallelu  
Sing Hallelu  
Sing Hallelu  
Glorify Him
