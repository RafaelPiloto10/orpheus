I don't want your money  
It don't mean a thing  
I don't need no fancy clothes  
Or a diamond ring  
I don't have to ride in style  
In your limousine  
I don't want no trouble  
Tax or Uncle Sam  
All I want is you  
I want to be your natural man  
I don't need your prestige  
'Cause I got my pride  
I don't want your social standing  
I'd rather stand outside  
I don't have no time to worry  
'Bout your greedy jive  
I don't want your money  
I don't like that game  
All I want is you  
I want to be your natural man
