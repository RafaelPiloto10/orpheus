It's caused me a lot  
But there's one thing that I got  
It's my man  
  
Cold and wet  
Tied you bet  
All of that I'll soon forget  
With my man  
  
He's not much for looks  
And no hero out of books  
But I love him  
  
Two or three girls has he  
That he likes as well as me  
But I love him  
  
I don't no why I should  
He isn't true  
He beats me to  
What can I do?  
  
Oh my man, I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despair  
I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is right, all right  
  
What's the difference if I say  
I'll go away  
When I know  
I'll come back on my knees some day  
Whatever my man is  
I am his for ever more  
  
What's the difference if I say  
I'll go away  
When I know  
I'll come back on my knees some day  
Whatever my man is  
I am his for ever more
