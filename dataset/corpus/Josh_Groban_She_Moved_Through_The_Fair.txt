My own love said to me  
My mother won't mind  
And my father won't smite you  
For your lack of kind  
  
She went away from me  
And this she did say  
It will not be long  
Til our wedding day  
  
She went away from me  
And she moved through the fair  
And slowly I watched her  
Move here and move there  
  
She went her way home ward  
With one star away  
As the swan in the evening  
Moves over the way  
  
I dreamed last night  
That my own love came in  
She came and so sweetly  
Her feet made no din  
  
She came close beside me  
And this, this she did say  
It will not be long love  
Til our wedding day
