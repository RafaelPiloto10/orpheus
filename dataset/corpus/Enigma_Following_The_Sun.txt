Following the sun, to find the one  
Who's giving you the wings to fly  
Following the sun, the golden one  
Losing sense for space and time  
  
Can you feel the waves of life  
(Can you) hear the sigh of love  
Do you believe in it ?  
  
Following the sun, just for the one  
Till you'll find the door you thought  
Following the sun, like everyone  
Searching for a sign of hope  
  
Have a look up to the sky  
See the billion stars above  
'cause (maybe) on one of them  
You'll spend your further life
