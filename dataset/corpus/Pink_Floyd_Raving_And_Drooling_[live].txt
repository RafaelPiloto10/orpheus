Raving and drooling  
I fell on his neck with a scream  
He had a whole lotta  
Terminal shock in his eyes  
That's what you get  
For pretending the rest are not real  
  
Babbling and snapping  
At far away flies  
He will zig zag his way back  
Through memories of boredom and pain  
  
How does it feel  
To be empty and angry and spaced?  
Split up the middle  
Between the illusion of safety in numbers  
And the fist in your face
