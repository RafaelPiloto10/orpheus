Blow, ill wind, blow away  
Let me rest today  
You're blowin' me no good  
No good  
  
Go, ill wind, go away  
Skies are oh so gray  
Around my neighborhood  
And that's no good  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
You're only misleading  
The sunshine I'm needing  
Ain't that a shame  
It's so hard to keep up  
With troubles that creep up  
From out of nowhere  
When love's to blame  
  
So, ill wind, blow away  
Let me rest today  
You're blowin' me no good  
No good  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
I'll wind
