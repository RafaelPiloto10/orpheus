Well this ain't the right thing to do, so let's go  
  
Young girls they know what they're after  
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye  
Rockets shooting up into space  
Buildings they rise to the skies  
  
Bang bang I got mine  
Bang bang reach for the sky  
  
I keep a good friend on video tape  
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late  
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonigh  
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet  
  
Bang Bang I got mine  
Bang Bang sun don't shine  
Bang Bang you all angels  
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures  
  
Oh girl  
Oh girl my problems can't follow me  
Phone calls I take my machine  
I wander lonely to the sea  
Lonely ha Ha ha what does it mean  
  
Bang Bang I got mine  
Bang Bang and you are next in line  
Bang bang reach for the sky  
Bang Bang sun don't shine  
  
Rise buildings  
Rise to the sky  
Young girls they know what they're after  
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
