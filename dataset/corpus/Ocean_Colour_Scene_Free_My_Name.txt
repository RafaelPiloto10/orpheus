Come my way oh I say before you go  
Tie my laces and chain me sound below  
Hold my side God must be feeling so cold  
It's all my deepest I see them there they go  
  
Free my name just give me love  
Free my name just give me loving now  
  
I'll give my day's report and send you them intact  
It's just like yesterday but now I'm screaming tired  
And now you're really saying this house is not my home  
So if you wake me I will not sleep alone  
  
Free my name just give me love  
Free my name just give me love  
Free my name just give me loving now  
  
Come my way oh I say before you go  
Tie my laces and chain me sound below  
Hold my side God must be feeling so cold  
It's all my deepest I see them there they go
