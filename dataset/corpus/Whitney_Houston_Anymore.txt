I believe in roses  
But only from the heart  
And if it's not sincere baby then  
I don't want no part  
  
I believe in one love baby,  
True monogamy  
What I don't know can't hurt me  
That's not the way I see  
  
If you believed in me  
You won't mess around  
It's not like I don't know  
You've been with every girl in town  
  
You got a lot of nerve to think  
I just close my eyes  
While you walk around so full of it  
I give you my surprise  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I don't need your kinda love  
I don't need your kinda trust  
I don't want you, anymore  
I don't need your kinda kisses  
I don't want to be your Mrs.  
I don't want to anymore  
  
I believe that angels  
Watch everything we do  
And all the wrong you're doing  
Just might come back on you  
I believe in phone calls  
When you're not by my side  
Especially when it's lonely  
In the middle of the night  
  
If you believe that true love  
Is only made in bed  
Lord have mercy on you  
Chivalry is dead  
  
You got a lot of nerve to think,  
To think that I'm still down  
While you've taken me for granted  
Boy I'm through, I'm outta town  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So baby (so baby)  
You can kiss this girl goodbye  
I'm through with ya  
Moving on with my life  
No more pain, no more fears  
I'm moving on, I'm keeping on  
I'm through with all the tears  
  
Your kinda love  
Your kinda trust  
I don't want you, don't need you  
Can't have you  
Your kinda kisses (yeah)  
To be your Mrs.  
I don't want you (sing it for us)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't need, don't want you  
Don't need, don't want  
Don't need that kind of love  
Don't want your kind of love  
Don't need it  
Don't want it
