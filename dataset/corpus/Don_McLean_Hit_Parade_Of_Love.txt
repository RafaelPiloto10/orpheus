From what I have been hearing, dear, you've really got it made  
Got a lot of fellers on your lover's hit parade  
If I can't be your number one I don't know what I'll do  
Gotta get my love up to the top, I'm so in love with you  
  
On the hit parade of love I know I'll never stop  
I've got a long, long way to climb before I reach the top  
But if I do get there soon I'll really have it made  
Then I'll know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade  
  
Well, we get along, dear, like all good lovers should  
Yet we could make a go of it, I know it'd turn out good  
We could have so much fun, we'd really have it made  
Then I'll know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade  
  
On the hit parade of love I know I'll never stop  
I've got a long, long way to climb before I reach the top  
But if I do get there soon I'll really have it made  
Then I know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade  
  
Well, it's your heart I'm after, dear, 'cause you're so nice and fine  
And another to replace you, dear, would sure be hard to find  
So put your arms around me now and call me turtle dove  
Then I know I'm number one on your hit parade of love  
  
On the hit parade of love I know I'll never stop  
I've got a long, long way to climb before I reach the top  
But if I do get there soon I'll really have it made  
Then I know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade  
Then I know I'm number one on your lover's hit parade
