Okay first of all Lyfe Jennings sings this NOT pitbull  
  
  
  
[1st Vrs]  
Hmmmmm-Mmmmm x2(Yeah)  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands the life you live  
Must be nice  
Having someone who's slow to take and quick to give  
Must be nice  
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick  
Someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion  
Must be nice  
Having someone who loves you despite your faults  
Must be nice  
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too  
Someone who loves you for sho'  
You just remember to never let 'em go  
  
[Chorus]  
Even when your hustling days are gone  
She'll be by your side still holding on  
Even when those 20's stop spinning  
And all those gold-digging women disappear  
She'll still be here  
  
[2nd Vrs]  
Must be nice  
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work  
Must be nice  
Having someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts  
Must be nice  
Having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard  
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird  
Must be nice  
Having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone  
Must be nice  
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too  
Someone who loves you for sho'  
You just remember to never let 'em go  
  
[Chorus] x4
