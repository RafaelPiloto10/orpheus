I got the message in my mailbox  
Nobody goes to church no more  
They're closing down your little altar  
They've locked the sanctuary door  
  
Don't fight it  
Who can say that you didn't try  
Don't fight it  
Old soldiers never die  
  
Where will I go to leave my offering  
To think about how life's so queer  
And listen to the little choir  
The sermon I don't care to hear  
  
Don't fight it  
Who can say that it's not the end  
Don't fight it  
And if we don't meet again  
I know somewhere a monument  
Stands in the name of our love  
Somewhere are monuments  
Standing in the name of our love  
  
I've seen such strange times  
Seems like lifetimes  
Sometimes good and sometimes bad  
And I don't see how it could  
Have been much different  
Everybody gave the best they had
