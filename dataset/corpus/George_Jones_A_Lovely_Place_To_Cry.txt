I know this house is the finest one around  
And we are both respected in our town  
But our friends don't know the truth when they drop by  
That our house is such a lovely place to cry.  
  
I keep my yard cut as close as it can be  
There's no litter laying round for one to see  
And I know someday I'll tell this place goodbye  
But till then it's sure a lovely place to cry.  
  
You don't need lonely things around you  
When you have no love left in you  
And when you're already dead before you die  
But someday someone will buy this place and be happy if they'll try.  
  
But for us it's been a lovely place to cry.  
Yes, for us it's been a lovely place to cry...
