I want to be yours, I want to be loved  
Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?  
The rhythm divine  
Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?  
The rhythm divine  
  
When I saw you the first time  
I knew it was a fine line  
And when I saw you the last time  
You made me,  
Stop my game, forget my name  
I want to be yours  
  
I want to be yours, I want to be loved  
Stop my game, forget my name  
  
Giving, loving, rolling, revving ?  
The rhythm divine  
Stop my game, forget my name  
  
I want to be yours, I want to be loved
