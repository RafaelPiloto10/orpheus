Your face so pale  
Hasn't see the light for days  
But on the hill  
You had no place to say "The skies are all mine  
And I'm proud to be here  
But when my lover cries I feel his tears"  
I was gonna drive you home  
I was going to tell you who I wanted  
We came back to the same place  
We didn't speak just danced in our minds  
  
Oh lover I know this ain't what it should be  
But let me take you home  
I'll show you what you should see  
I was gonna drive you home  
I was gonna tell you who I wanted  
I was gonna drive you home  
  
I'll never change for anyone  
I know it's there but I just can't see it  
I know it's there but I can't see it  
A little light with you and me in it  
I know it's there but I can't see it  
  
I was thinking about the times I could have had  
And whether they turn out good if they turn out bad  
I was going to take you home  
Show you things your lover wouldn't know  
  
My angel, my lover, my angel  
My mind lover, my mind lover  
She's my mind lover
