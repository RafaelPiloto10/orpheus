We were brother, you and me  
Loyal to our hardcore scene  
Our thought, our aims,  
Our goals were true  
Then someting happened to you  
You changed  
I remember all the things you said  
Shit you said !  
I guess it was a just a buch of fucking lies  
Fucking lies!  
Stabbed us all in the back  
Right in the back !  
Don't you dare look me in the eyes !  
All we stood for, all our dreams  
You've forgotten what they mean  
I tell you this  
My thoughts are real  
And I'll never change  
The way I feel !
