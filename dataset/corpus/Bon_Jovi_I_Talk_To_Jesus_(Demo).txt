I talk to jesus  
  
It's like trying to light a match in the rain  
Trying to find a way to explain  
I came to meet the face that graced me cable tv  
I'm his biggest fan, 'like this, him and me  
  
Has he gone out, is he in a meeting  
I know that you can't tell me for security reasons  
  
But, Mister, tell me are you one of the Saints  
Hey, maybe I could take a number and wait  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
And I talk, talk, I talk to Jesus  
  
See, I've got a picture of us here in my wallet  
I'd really like to show you...  
Oh, I guess I forgot it  
But, I've got this bracelet, I've got this I'd  
That the people down at county gave me  
  
I know you think I'm special, hear it all the time  
You don't have to V. I. P. Me, I'm a regular guy  
I'd really like to sit and talk sometimes  
But, I'm taping Sally Jesse at five  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus, the king can save me  
I talk, talk, talk, I talk to Jesus  
  
Have you seen the papers today  
If I could, I'd get down and pray  
Tell me if the shepherds on the way  
  
You know Elvis Presley talks to me  
Through my school teacher  
Jon Lennon moved in down the street  
He bought the pizzeria  
  
And aliens control our lives  
And when we speak, they're in our minds  
And Heather Locklear is my wife  
And, Man ain't a lucky guy  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus, the king can save me  
I talk, talk, talk, I talk to Jesus
