She's all crazy and shit  
She shows us her tits  
She's just a corn-fed white-bred chick  
Born in the right zip code  
She comes with a gold card  
She'll never have to pay for it  
What would she do without you? [x2]  
What would she do?  
He's not afraid of the future  
He's hot off the platter  
He's been handed a blank check  
??  
He's brung an agenda  
And he's got a place to put it  
What would he do without you? [x3]  
What would he do?  
Is this the best that you can get? [x2]  
That you can get  
The best that you can get  
Is this the best that you can get  
The best that you can get  
I'm not afraid of the ocean  
Afraid of devotion  
I've got the balls to prove it  
What would I do without you? [x3]  
Is this the best (that you can get)  
What would I do?
