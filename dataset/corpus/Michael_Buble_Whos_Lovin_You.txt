When I, I had you  
I treated you bad  
And wrong my dear  
But since, since you been away  
Dontcha know I sit around  
With my head hangin' down  
And I wonder who's lovin you  
  
I, I, I, I, I should have never  
Never ever made you cry  
But girl since, since you been gone  
Dontcha know I sit around  
With my head hangin' down  
And I wonder who's lovin you  
  
'Cause a life without love  
Is oh so lonely, babe  
I don't think  
I don't think I'm gonna make it  
  
All my life  
All my life, yeah  
I belongs to you only  
Come on home baby  
Come on and take it  
  
All I can do  
Since you been gone is cry  
And you, babe  
Dontcha you wonder with your pretty head  
About all I will do  
Dontcha know I sit around  
With my head hangin' down  
And I wonder who's lovin you
