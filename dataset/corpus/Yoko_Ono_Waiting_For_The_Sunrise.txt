Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
So I can take your hand and stroll about.  
  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
So we can go on the streets and see the people smile.  
  
Give me your hand,  
So I could tell you that things will be alright.  
The room's still dark,  
But it won't be so long,  
And I can take you outside.  
  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
So we can go to the park and roll about.  
  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
So we can go to the docks and watch the boats go by.  
  
Come on, love, give me your hand,  
And things will be alright.  
The room's still cold,  
But it won't be so long,  
That we can go outside.  
  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
So I could see your hair shining in the air.  
  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
So I can see the sky reflected in your eyes.  
  
Come on, love, don't be depressed,  
Things will be alright.  
The room's too low,  
But it won't be so long,  
That we can be outside.  
  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise,  
Waiting for the sunrise.
