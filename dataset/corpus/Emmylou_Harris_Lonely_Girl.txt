It seems to me lately  
The days are growing shorter  
The years are going faster  
And time is flying by  
I wake up in the morning  
And before I even notice  
The sun is going down  
And I'm left to wonder why  
  
I'm a lonely girl in a lonely world  
I never thought my life would be like this  
To have no one to hold my hand  
And feel once more a sweet caress  
  
I'd give it my best effort  
Love is always worth it  
But even if I try  
I might still end up alone  
It may not be in me  
To take what love could give me  
Some of us are better off  
To make it on our own  
  
As a lonely girl in a lonely world  
And though my life has been so blessed  
I have no one to hold my hand  
And feel once more a sweet caress  
  
I've had my share of lovers  
And cared for many others  
I always thought there'd be  
Another one to come along  
But if love can't find me again  
I'll put it all behind me then  
I'll just go and learn to sing  
Another sad love song  
  
About a lonely girl in a lonely world  
She never dreamed her life would be like this  
To have no one to hold her hand  
And feel once more a sweet caress
