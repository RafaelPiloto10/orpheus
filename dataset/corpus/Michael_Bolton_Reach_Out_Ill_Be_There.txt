Now if you feel that you can't go on  
Because all of your hope is gone  
And your life is filled with much confusion  
Until happiness is just an illusion  
And your world around you is crumblin' down  
Darling reach out, darlin' reach out for me  
  
Chorus:  
I'll be there  
To give you all the love you need  
And I'll be there  
You can always count on me  
  
When you feel lost and about to give up  
'Cause your best just ain't good enough  
And you feel the world has grown cold  
And you're driftin' out all on your own  
And you need a hand to hold  
Darlin' reach out, darlin' reach out for me  
  
I'll be there  
With the love that will shelter you  
I'll be there  
With all the love that will see you through  
  
Chorus:  
  
I can tell the way you hang your head  
You're without love and now you're afraid  
And through your tears you look around  
But there's no peace of mind to be found  
I know what you're thinkin', you're alone now  
No love of your own  
But darlin' reach out  
Darlin' reach out for me  
  
Chorus:  
  
I'll be there  
With the love that will shelter you  
I'll be there  
With the love that will see you through
