I been a bad boy  
I been long gone  
I been out there  
I never phone home  
I never gave you not one little clue where I'd been  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I got a way of  
Fallin' in love  
With angels that don't shove  
You into thinkin' that you are committing a sin  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I must have walked 'round  
In a real fog  
I was your best friend  
Now I'm a real dog  
I never thought that now  
Would ever catch up with then  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I've been a bad boy  
I sung a wrong song  
I took a left turn  
I stayed too long  
As you were thinkin' that I wasn't  
Just like all other men  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again
