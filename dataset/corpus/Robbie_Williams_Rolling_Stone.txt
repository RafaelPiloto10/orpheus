25 and I've come alive  
21 was the time to come undone  
Doesn't everyone  
  
Very young and very ape  
I'm gonna drink and stay up very late  
And hate the sun  
  
And now my heart kicks up a fuss  
I'm a rolling stone  
They say I'm dangerous  
But I'm never alone  
  
I know that you're like me  
You want your kicks for free  
You'll be a rolling stone  
  
Got an A in attitude  
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood  
I guess I'm just like you  
  
Being young is over-rated  
One day I'll be old and understated  
But before I'm through....  
  
I'll run naked through the streets  
Be a rolling stone  
Defiance in defeat, enjoy being alone  
  
I know that you're like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
  
When we die we'll find out other ways  
For getting drunk and throwing it all away  
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday  
It's all in your head  
So get out of your head  
  
And now your heart kicks up a fuss  
You're a rolling stone  
They say you're dangerous  
But you're never alone  
  
I know you're just like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
Be a rolling stone
