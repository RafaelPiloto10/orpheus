I see the early glow, I hear you say hello  
I watch the shadows fall, I don't see you at all  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
  
I see the autumn rain, falling on my window pane  
I hear you say goodbye, I see a tear in your eye  
  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
Our love couldn't go wrong,  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone,  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
I see you slip away, into another day  
There's no-one else around,  
I watch the sun go down  
  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
Our love couldn't go wrong,  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone,  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
I take the fall  
I see you in a dream, you turn and start to go  
I call to you once more, guess that I'm takin' the fall  
  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
Our love couldn't go wrong,  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone,  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
Our love couldn't go wrong, how could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone, I will go on really believing  
I take the fall
