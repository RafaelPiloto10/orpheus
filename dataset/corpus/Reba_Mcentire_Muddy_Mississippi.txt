[Chorus]  
I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi  
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me  
The morning sun would find me  
Swinging from the rope that's hanging free  
And I drop in to the waters  
And go swimming in the muddy Mississippi  
  
A boy came to the Delta  
And we would swing together from that tree  
I could see my dreams in his eyes  
As he held on to me  
  
Swinging in the sunlight  
Loving in the shadows  
Wild and free  
And I made him promise he would take me  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Bright lights of the city made my red dress and shoes look brand new  
While he worked the night shift  
I turned on and I turned loose  
I lost my pride I lost my man  
I did things a girl like me shouldn't do  
  
Now I can't face this living  
With the swelling signs of new life  
Showing through  
  
I can hardly see my face in the waters of the muddy Mississippi  
But I can see the shadows of the cotton wood standing over me  
The morning sun would find me  
Hanging from the rope that's swinging free  
And I'll swing for the last time over the waters  
Of the muddy Mississippi  
  
Yeah the muddy Mississippi
