There'll be lots of tears plus some happy years  
And you'll add my heart to your souvenirs  
But loving you was my mistake  
But I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
I'll be on the town acting like a clown  
So they won't suspect that you turned me down  
Loving you was my mistake  
But I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
I've love for you  
That's the kind of love that never ever ceases  
Break my heart in two  
Or break it into a million little pieces  
Every piece you find has you on its mind  
If you doubt I'm the forgiving kind all you have to say is when  
And I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
Yes, I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
I've love for you  
That's the kind of love that never ever ceases  
Break my heart right in two  
Or break it into a million little pieces  
Every piece that you find has you on its mind  
If you doubt I'm the forgiving kind all you have to say is when  
And I'll gladly make the same mistake again  
Yes, yes, yes, gladly make the same mistake again
