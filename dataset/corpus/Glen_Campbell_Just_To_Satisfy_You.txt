Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through  
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do  
How many hearts will break  
How many will it take  
Just to satisfy you  
Just to satisfy-why you  
  
Another love, another fool, to play your game  
Another love, another fool, they're a-all the same  
  
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through  
Now don't be surprised if that someone is you  
You're gonna find when it's too late  
A heart that just won't break  
Just to satisfy you  
Oh-oh, just to satisfy-why you  
  
You're gonna find when it's too late  
A heart that just won't break  
Just to satisfy you  
Oh-oh, just to satisfy-why you  
What does it take, to satisfy you  
Woah, just to satisfy you  
(Just to satisfy you)
