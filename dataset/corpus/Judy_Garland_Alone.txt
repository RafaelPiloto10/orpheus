Alone,  
Alone with a sky of romance above.  
Alone,  
Alone on a night that was meant for love.  
  
There must be someone waiting  
Who feels the way I do.  
Whoever you are, are you, are you  
  
Alone,  
Alone on this night that we two could share.  
Alone,  
Alone with a kiss that could make me care.  
  
And when you come I promise  
To be your very own!  
Alone,  
Alone with a heart meant for you.  
  
And when you come I promise  
To be your very own!  
Alone,  
Alone with a heart meant for you.  
  
Alone.
