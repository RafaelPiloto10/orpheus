It's such a clever innocence  
With which you do your sorcery  
As if somehow your years  
Would bow and let that young boy go free  
Well, I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought I knew where I was going  
Until I heard your laughter flowing  
And came upon the wisdom in your eyes, surprise  
Well, I've spent my whole life running 'round  
Chasing songs from town to town  
Thinking I'd be free by just never  
Let love slow me down  
So lonely and so wild until you turned and smiled  
By now I should have long been gone  
But here I am holding on  
As if I didn't know which way to run  
Well, it's such a clever innocence  
With which you show myself to me  
As if you know how it feels  
To never be who you wanted to be  
And I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought that I'd free but I'm just one more prisoner of time  
Alone within the boundaries of my mind  
I thought I was a child
