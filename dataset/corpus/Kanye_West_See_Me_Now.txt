Charlie Wilson - Chorus)  
I know you see me now right now,  
(I know you see me now right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now)  
I know you see me now right now  
  
(Beyonce - Hook)  
I got my suit and tie and I don't know if yall know  
Well maybe yall do or maybe yall don't  
But I don't really care (yeah)  
Cus how we on it all the time (uh)  
So imma get my money lets go  
  
(Kanye - Verse 1)  
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this an aristocracy  
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolaty  
"what's up wooo" that's old news  
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes  
Ha?  
I swear my whole collection so cruise  
I might walk in nobu, with no shoes  
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods  
That nigger crazy I told you  
Immatue adult insecure asshole (What else)  
If you fall on the concrete that's your asphalt  
If you pass on that Kane beat, that's your last thought  
Get what you ask for I swear that's your ass thought  
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low  
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow  
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo  
When you getting money cuts don't matter cus a nigger past go  
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole  
Right next to lucifer, tell him I said hello  
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him I said hell no.  
  
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh?  
  
(Beyonce)  
My niggers is home, I guess I got everything  
Everything I want, but I don't  
Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before  
No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud  
Doing things not allowed  
And I swear it's going down right now  
I know one thing my momma would be proud  
And you see me looking up  
Cus I know she's looking down right now  
  
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)  
I know you see me now right now,  
  
(I know you see me now right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now)  
I know you see me now right now  
  
(Kanye - Verse 2)  
Poor the champagne let your watch show  
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal  
I admit my first watch was a fossil  
Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils  
Attention to detail is so uncanny  
And the whips on this? is so uncamrie  
Somebody needs to put us on camera  
The world of rollies and everyones family  
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes  
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys?  
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini  
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo  
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical  
This the cris year, last year was magic 32  
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye'  
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae  
I got style ask julie she heard in may  
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate  
FIrst of all we all know the beats is  
Like a mix between fergie and jeez  
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception  
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys  
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored  
All my hommies GD's but I am lord  
Rap god, Greek mythology  
And this life to crazy to think logicaly  
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy  
My life is like a childs solutions become reality  
  
(Beyonce)  
Now go get my throne cus I don't wanna stop  
I just go in my zone and imma make it hot  
Till it's time to go when it's time to go  
Where you trying to go? you better act like you can see me know  
  
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)  
I know you see me now right now,  
(I know you see me now right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now)  
I know you see me now right now
