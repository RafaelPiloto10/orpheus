Down at the Lido they welcome you  
With sausage and beer,  
Klaus and the Rooster have been there too,  
But lately he spends his time here.  
  
Hanging with the mayor and all his friends  
And nobody cares,  
Where the sailor shuts out the sunrise  
Blacked out on the stairs  
  
[Chorus]  
Knock twice, rap with your cane  
Feels nice, you're out of the rain  
We got your skinny girl  
Here at the Western World  
  
Ruthie will give you the silver key  
To open the red door:  
Lay down your Jackson and you will see  
The sweetness you've been crying for  
  
In the night you hide from the madman  
You're longing to be  
But it all comes out on the inside  
Eventually  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the night you hide from the madman  
You're longing to be  
But it all comes out on the inside  
Eventually  
  
[Chorus]
