When we were together  
We were just strangers  
I was just playing around  
So I didn't wanna work it out  
No, I didn't wanna work it out  
  
Thought something was missing  
We were too different  
Baby I'm a-looking back now  
And I really should've worked it out  
Yeah, I really should've worked it out  
  
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone  
I can't help it, I want you back 'cause I  
  
Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
  
I'm watching you with her, thinking I had you  
How was I ever so dumb?  
Boy I should've known that you're the one  
Boy I should've known that you're the one  
  
So, if it's not too late,  
I just wanna know babe  
And tell me ever we could still run  
'Cause I finally know that you're the one  
Yeah, I really know that you're the one  
  
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone  
I can't help it, I want you back 'cause I  
  
Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
  
And now that you're gone and I sleep alone  
I can't help it, I want you back 'cause I  
  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
  
Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you  
Now I understand that we're better together  
  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together  
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better,  
You know we're better together
