Twenty four and he believes for sure he's got it made  
Fame is here for good and looks will never fade  
He doesn't know  
The game is never over 'till the cards have all been played  
  
Eighty three and still he feels his best is yet to come  
He believes that youth is wasted on the young  
He's alone  
The only dream he ever has is being with someone  
  
[Chorus]  
Love you when you're standing tall  
But nobody knows when you when you're falling  
All you have to do is call  
But nobody ever hears the silent scream  
  
Christmas came and went again but still nobody came  
Staring at her wedding photo in a frame  
She's alone  
We should hope the loss of memory helps to ease the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Memories, moments you recall  
We should be remembered for the greatest of them all  
You can't begin to live someone else's life  
Or you're own will pass you by  
  
Oh, who's to know  
Maybe we can learn a thing or two from everyone  
  
[Chorus]
