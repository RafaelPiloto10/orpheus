Come lay by my side, little darlin'  
Come lay your cool hand on my brow  
Promise me that you will always  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine, love  
Be honest, be faithful, be kind  
And promise me that you will always  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine  
You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime  
You're as pure as the dew from the rose  
I'd rather be somebody's, darlin'  
And a poor boy nobody knows  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine, love  
Be honest, be faithful, be kind  
And promise me that you will always  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine  
Goodbye, little darlin', I'm leaving  
I'm leaving this cold world behind  
So promise me that you will never  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine, love  
Be honest, be faithful, be kind  
And promise me that you will always  
Be nobody's darlin' but mine
