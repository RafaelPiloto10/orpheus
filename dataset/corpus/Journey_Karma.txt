Oh baby, your face is dark, and your eyes are wild.  
Oh baby, you look to me as if you're still a child.  
  
Your innocence to me is so hard to believe,  
Just a spell in my past, tell me, how long will you last.  
  
Oh baby, you stole my lonely heart for you.  
Oh baby, I want to tell you what you can do.  
  
I no longer care about the things we shared, you always had your way.  
Won't you find a place today, won't you find a place to stay(repeat).
