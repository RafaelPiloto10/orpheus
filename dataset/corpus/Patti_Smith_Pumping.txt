Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,  
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go  
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane  
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain  
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping  
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so  
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,  
  
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,  
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go  
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,  
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring  
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping  
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.  
Total abandon, ooh wah  
  
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,  
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain  
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,  
Got no recollection of my past reflection,  
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.  
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,  
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping  
  
Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,  
Coming in the garden, got a conscious stream,  
Coming in a washroom, coming on a plane,  
Coming in a force field, coming in my brain  
And my heart, my heart,  
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,  
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,  
Total abandon  
  
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,  
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain,  
My heart oh
