You made me leave my happy home  
You took my love and now you're gone  
Since I fell for you  
  
Love brings such misery and pain  
I guess I'll never be the same  
Since I fell for you  
  
It's so bad, It's so sad  
I'm in love with you  
You love me, then you snub me  
But what can I do  
I'm still in love with you  
  
I guess I'll never see the light  
I get the blues 'bout every night  
Since I fell for you  
Since I fell for you
