Oh, the smartest packet you can find,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Is the fair "Rosalind" in the Blackwall line!  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
The fair "Rosalind" one bright summer's day,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Went sailing away far out over the bay,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
The tiller one hand firmly grasp'd,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
And Eliza's waist by the other was clasp'd,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh the day was fine, the wind was free,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
And Eliza Lee sat there on my knee,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh, Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Was as pretty a sight as any could see!  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh, I said, "My dear, will you be mine?"  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Her answer was sweeter than sweetest of wine,  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.  
  
Oh the smartest packet you can find,  
Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?  
Is the fair "Rosalind" in the Blackwall line  
So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,  
Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee,  
So clear the track, let the bulgine run.
