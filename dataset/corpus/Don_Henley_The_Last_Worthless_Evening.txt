I know you broke up with him  
And your heart's still on the shelf  
It's been over two years for me  
And I'm still not quite myself  
  
You can't be with someone new  
And you can't go back to him  
You're beginning to realize  
That it's sink or swim  
  
I see you around sometimes  
And my heart just melts  
You're lookin' like if you had your wish  
You'd be somewhere else  
  
And it just breaks my heart  
To see you here this way  
Someday I'll get the nerve  
To walk up to you and say  
  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
Just gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
'Cause I'll be there  
When your broken heart is on the mend  
  
Every night it's the same old crowd  
In smoky rooms  
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes  
But it never blooms  
  
I've been around this block a time or two  
And I've made some big mistakes  
But girl I promise you, I promise you  
That this is the worthless evening  
  
That you'll have to spend  
Just gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
  
That you'll have to spend  
'Cause it won't be long  
'Til your little heart is on the mend  
People inside their houses  
  
With the shades pulled down  
God knows, we could use some romance  
In this sleepy bedroom town  
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything  
  
But there're just so many summers  
And just so many springs  
And this is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
  
Just gimme a chance to show you how  
To love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend, baby  
  
'Cause I'll be there when your broken heart  
Is on the mend  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend  
  
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance  
To show you how to love again  
This is the last worthless evening  
That you'll have to spend 'cause it won't be long  
  
'Til your little heart is on the mend
