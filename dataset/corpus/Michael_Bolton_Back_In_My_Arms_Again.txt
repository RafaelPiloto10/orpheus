All day long I hear the telephone ring  
Friends calling, giving their advice  
From the one I love, I should break away  
Those heartaches, you'll bring me one day, oh  
  
I listened to my friends' advice  
But it's not gonna happen twice  
All advice ever brought my way  
Were many long and sleepless nights  
  
Chorus:  
Got you back in my arms again  
Right by my side  
I got you right back in my arms again  
So satisfied  
  
So easy for others to say, that I should let you go  
They don't know how strong my love is  
But I sure can't get along  
  
It's time I live my life for me  
Being happier than I ever knew I'd been  
And each time we make romance  
I'm thankful for a second chance  
  
Chorus:  
  
All day long I hear the telephone ring  
Friends calling, giving their advice  
From the one I love, I should break away  
Those heartaches you'll bring me one day  
  
I listened to my friends advice  
But it's not gonna happen twice  
All advice ever brought my way  
Were many long and sleepless nights  
  
Chorus:
