Wake up in time to see the sun going down  
Turn on the six o'clock news  
See what's happening in this town  
I take a walk down to the corner  
I meet those bad girls hanging around  
Never doing what they oughta  
  
Yeah, I get caught up in the action  
Gotta find the main attraction now  
Gotta get some satisfaction  
You better take me to the heart of that  
  
Night life, looking for some  
Night life, need a little  
Night life, living in the daylight  
Just don't agree with me  
Night life  
  
Stealing through the night like a wolf on the prowl  
Not a bird, not a plane, I'm just a mean old night owl  
Watch me, hit, run, gotta move on  
Going wild in the night  
Cause I'm hooked on the neon  
  
Yeah, I'm looking for some action  
I gotta find my main attraction now  
Cause I need some satisfaction  
Won't you take me to the heart of that  
  
Night life, a little bit of  
Night life, ooh I need some  
Night life, full of bright lights and noise  
Time to separate the men from the boys  
  
Night life
