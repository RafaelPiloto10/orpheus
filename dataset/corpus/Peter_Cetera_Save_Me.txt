Man all alone, caught in raging water  
Man overboard, caught in a terrible storm  
Throw me the rope, pull me out of trouble  
I need someone, someone to keep me warm  
Why don't you save me  
I'm burning with desire  
Why won't you save me  
Don't leave me all alone  
And it's all right  
Wrap me up, baby won't you take me home  
  
Forty below, high up a lonely mountain  
Slipping down, baby I'm sinking fast  
Throw me the rope, pull me out of this trouble  
S. O. S. Don't think I'm gonna last  
  
Why don't you save me  
I'm burning with desire  
Why won't you save me  
Come on hold me tight  
And it's all right  
Don't you know we're gonna have fun tonight
