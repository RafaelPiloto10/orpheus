I've foudn a great deal of satisfaction  
Thinking that you think of me  
I've found each day  
Bring a new sunshine  
There is no tomorrow  
For us to borrow  
Why can't you find  
What you are needing in me  
If I could only change your mind  
  
I found no effort at all  
In showing what I'm feeling you  
I find it hard each day just knowing  
There's no tomorrow for us to borrow  
Why won't you find  
What you are needing in me  
If I could only change your mind
