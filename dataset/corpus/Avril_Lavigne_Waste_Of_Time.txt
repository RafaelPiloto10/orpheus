Time is valuable  
Mine is useless  
Next to you i feel nothing  
Nothing makes me fear  
Im me and im strong  
I've a hard heart  
It naver breaks  
  
So,its waste of time attacking to me  
Ill never fall I'll never die  
I ask you if you love me  
And you always lie and lie  
  
Crime is so bad  
You are so mad  
You try to make me  
Exact like you baby  
You will naver do it  
You are fragile  
You will be broken
