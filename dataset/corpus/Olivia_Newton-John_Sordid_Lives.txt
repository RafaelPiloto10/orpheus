Now who's to judge who's a saint and who's a sinner  
Lord, it's tough enough to trudge from brunch to dinner  
We seek the light of truth between our white lies  
We sleep away our youth under tattletale skies  
  
Now who's to say who's a sinner and who's a saint  
Who's to say who you can love and who you can't  
Now it's easy for the pot to call the kettle black  
They're just jealous of the hot and lusty sordid lives they led  
  
Ain't it a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
It's a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
It's a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
  
Now we struggled comin' down the chute to take our first breath  
And we struggle for acceptance from birth to death  
But the Lord's too busy tryin' to keep the world on it's feet  
He ain't got time to give a damn about what goes on between the sheets  
  
Ain't it a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
It's a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
It's a bitch sortin' out our sorry little sordid lives
