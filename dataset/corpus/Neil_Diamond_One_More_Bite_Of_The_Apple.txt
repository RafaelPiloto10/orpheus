Been away from you for much too long  
Been away but now I'm back where I belong  
Believed while I was gone away  
But I do just fine  
But I couldn't get the music of my mind  
And I couldn't leave the needing you behind  
  
Read the word from the page  
Free the bird from the cage  
Just go out there and face  
What you did, before  
Did it once  
You can do it once more  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Coming back for one more bite of the apple  
Tastes as sweet  
It's the nectar of life  
And you know that it's right  
'Cause you know you're not out there alone  
And that one more bite of the apple is all  
You gonna need to bring it home  
  
I couldn't count the chances that I've lost  
Couldn't count the chances or the cost  
But I can't help thinking about the days  
Of way back when  
And I know I wanna taste them once again  
Yes I know I wanna taste them once again  
  
Got some things to be said  
Going round in my head  
Time to get out of bed  
'Cause I've slept too long  
And I know there's a place I belong  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Was a time that I won't ever forget  
They were times that I will never regret  
I've been thinking about those days  
Since way back when  
And thinking I could bring back again  
Just maybe I could bring them back again  
  
One more dance in the night  
One more chance to get it right  
One more grab at the brass ring that's flying by  
One more toast to the mud in your eye  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
I'll be back  
And sitting up high on the saddle  
All I want  
Is to do it once more  
Let me get through that door  
'Cause I still do believe that I can  
Want that one more bite of the apple  
And just a chance to taste it, once again  
  
Been around the world a time or two  
Everywhere I've been I thought of me and you  
I was hoping you'd remember how it used to be  
And maybe that you'd still remember me  
And that apple just as sweet as it could be  
Reach right up and pick one of that apple tree
