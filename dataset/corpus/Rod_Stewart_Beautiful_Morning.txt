[Chorus]  
Beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
Here with you  
  
Driving down the highway on a Friday evening  
Me and my lady had stopped for leaving  
Early stop leave the city behind us  
Good to be the kid that cares alot  
We got just us  
  
We going Starbucks a doner and a coffee  
That's when I notice it was all around me  
And do today and there's gotta be a winner  
Rolling out the summer we're tired of winter  
  
Still left on we're climbing all of our years  
Still had hair on a true to fear  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No hesitation and we check into our hotel  
Down about a woosh about a mile at the disco  
Up toss the bed in a room that I seen you  
I just sat here loving that person in me  
  
Don't you worry 'cause I'm back in my case  
Get down to the beach and let the sun on your face  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause we keep tryin going fast  
Let's make everything last, oh ye  
Well singing , dancing , jumping around  
We cook, get drunk we all fall down  
Go through love, no regrets  
  
[Chorus: x2]
