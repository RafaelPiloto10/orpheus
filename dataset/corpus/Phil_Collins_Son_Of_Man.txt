Oh, the power to be strong  
And the wisdom to be wise  
All these things will  
Come to you in time  
On this journey that you're making  
There'll be answers that you'll seek  
And it's you who'll climb the mountain  
It's you who'll reach the peak  
  
Son of Man, look to the sky  
Lift your spirit, set it free  
Some day you'll walk tall with pride  
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be  
  
Though there's no one there to guide you  
No one to take your hand  
But with faith and understanding  
You will journey from boy to man  
  
Son of Man, look to the sky  
Lift your spirit, set it free  
Some day you'll walk tall with pride  
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be  
  
In learning you will teach  
And in teaching you will learn  
You'll find your place beside the  
Ones you love  
Oh, and all the things you dreamed of  
The visions that you saw  
Well, the time is drawing near now  
It's yours to claim in all  
  
Son of Man, look to the sky  
Lift your spirit, set it free  
Some day you'll walk tall with pride  
Son of Man, a man in time you'll be  
  
Son of Man,  
Son of Man's a man for all to see
