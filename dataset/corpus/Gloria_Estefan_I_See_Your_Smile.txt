I get a little tongue twisted  
Every time I talk to you when I see you  
And I'm so glad that you just missed it  
The way I stared to memorize your face  
To kiss you in my mind  
Love you all the time  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
Please believe it's true  
When I tell you I love you  
I've taken too many chances  
Searching for the truth in love that's in my heart  
Tell me if I made the wrong advances  
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed  
'Cause I know I have to do this  
Would you hold my hand right through it?  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
Please believe it's true  
When I tell you I love you  
I had to let you know just what would happen  
Yes I had to let you know the truth  
I know I've got to do this  
Would you hold my hand right through it? Would you?  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
'Cause when I close my eyes  
I still can see your smile  
It's bright enough to light my life  
Out of my darkest hour  
You know now this is true  
When I tell you I love you
