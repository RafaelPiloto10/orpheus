You're not giving an inch  
You're strung like wire  
Your open arms they flinch  
Joan Crawford style  
Treated like a towel  
Inside you howl  
  
On some dark concrete  
Midnight street  
You've built an altar  
That's quite complete  
Your self control  
Is damned amazing  
You're trying hard  
And I want you  
Little miss emperor  
  
You really want to grow  
And you're alert, I know  
But babies mostly drown  
It's a company town  
Cheat gods and joke  
Attack your noble ghost  
  
I saw the best minds  
Of my generation  
Learn how to crawl  
Across our nation  
Conformity falls  
Like one wet blanket  
Look how we live  
And I want you  
Little miss emperor  
Little miss emperor  
Trying to open doors
