You are my only daughter, I guess I made you twice  
You look inside my other, he'll give you bad advice  
I will tell you I'm OK, but deep inside I'm afraid  
I don't drink holy water, I'm not a son of Christ  
I ain't no black messiah, and I don't load my dice  
You can tell me you're all right, but why you so afraid?  
You're in denial, you never will believe it's you  
Denial, you always hide behind the truth  
You'll never believe it, you never believe it's you  
I don't think I'm amazing, in fact I'm quite insane  
To live inside my bucket, with all my plastic chains  
People tell me every time, I look at the wrong all right  
You're in denial, you never will believe it's you  
Denial, you always hide behind the truth  
You'll never believe it, you never believe it's you  
You'll never believe it, you never believe it  
Secrets told you, dreamland holds you, secrets told you  
You wouldn't believe it, you couldn't conceive it  
Secrets told you  
You wanna receive it, you gotta believe it's you  
You're on a trip already, I'm tripping out alright  
I'll get there slow and steady, just sit and hold on tight  
Denial, you never will believe it's you  
Denial, you always hide behind the truth  
Denial, you never will believe it's you  
Denial, you always hide behind the truth, yeah, yeah  
Behind the truth, yeah, yeah  
It's true, yeah, yeah  
Behind the truth, yeah, yeah  
It's you, yeah, yeah  
Behind the truth, yeah, yeah  
It's gonna be alright, just hold on tight  
It's gonna be alright, just hold on tight
