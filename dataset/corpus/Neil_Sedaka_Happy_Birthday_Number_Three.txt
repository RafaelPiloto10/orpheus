Happy birthday, number three

Happy birthday number three  
Today's the day we've waited for  
Because you're not a baby anymore  
You've grown into the prettiest toddler we'll ever see  
Happy birthday number three  
What happened to that funny face  
Our little angel now wears full ups and lace  
We can't believe our eyes you're such a parent's dream  
Happy birthday number three  
When you were only one you couldn't hold a bottle  
Then at eighteen months you began to waddle  
When you were two years you could barely say a word  
But since you've grown up your future is sewn up  
From now on you're gonna be heard so  
If we should smile with sweet surprise  
It's just that you've grown up before our very eyes  
You've grown into the prettiest toddler we'll ever see

Here comes the cake everybody  
Happy birthday number three  
Make a wish and blow at those candles  
Number three  
Here comes the balloons, don't burst them  
Tra la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Happy birthday number three  
Tra la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
