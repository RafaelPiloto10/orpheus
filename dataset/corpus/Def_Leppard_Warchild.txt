Warchild, your heart is broken  
Your mind is breakin', it's such a shame  
Warchild, your body's broken  
Your woman's taken, it's not a game  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Warchild, I used to love you  
The whole world loved you, we used to care  
Warchild, your mind has been emptied  
So all you do now is just sit n' stare  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Your lady's waiting, she's hesitating  
Not knowing why  
Warchild, the pain you're showing  
The pain is knowing that you're gonna die  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams
