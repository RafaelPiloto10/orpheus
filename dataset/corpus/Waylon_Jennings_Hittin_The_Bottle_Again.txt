Well I don't know who or where I am  
I don't know who do give a damn  
It's a hell of a mess that I've got me in  
Hittin' the bottle again  
I can't walk so I can't go home  
No need to talk cause I'm alone  
If I stay here they're gonna lock me in  
Hittin' the bottle again  
Hittin' the bottle again ever than I've drunker been  
Or is it drunker than I've ever been hittin' the bottle again  
  
[ guitar ]  
  
Well I tried to quit for a wife of mine  
I tried to quit but I changed my mind  
Every once in awhile and a now and a then  
Hittin' the bottle again  
Hittin' the bottle again...
