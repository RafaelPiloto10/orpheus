Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down  
They say you only live to see the lights of town  
I wasted my time when i would try, try, try  
'cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone  
And you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone  
You'll come to me but i'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye  
When i turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone  
When everyone's forgotten and you're on your own  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry  
  
I lie awake at night and wait till you come in  
You stay a little while and then you're gone again  
Every question that i ask, i get a lie, lie, lie  
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry  
  
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you  
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true  
I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why  
When i remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there  
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
