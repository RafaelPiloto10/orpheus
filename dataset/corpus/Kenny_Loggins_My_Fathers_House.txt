In my voice, in my smile,  
In the eyes of my eldest child,  
You appear every year in my life.  
  
In a dream, I have now,  
Standing still in my father's house,  
And I try another time to walk away.  
  
I learned that music and laughter,  
From the child that you hid in your eyes,  
And it's his song that I sing,  
Now who will sing for me?  
  
All my life, no voice inside,  
Has whispered, "set me free",  
All this time, has it been, you or me.  
  
I wait for someone to save me,  
Just like you did all your life,  
And will I find my home,  
But I alone, like you.
