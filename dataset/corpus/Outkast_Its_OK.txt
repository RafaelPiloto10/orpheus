[Chorus]  
All these lonely girls wanna fuck...It's OK  
That's alright girl, that's ok  
That's alright girl, that's ok  
Keep callin me and beggin me and blowin me up...It's OK  
That's alright girl, that's ok  
That's alright girl, that's ok  
  
[Slimm]  
My game, slicker than slow tongue  
Get yo' main hoe sprung  
Chokin' on my blowgun  
She swallowed all my bubble gum  
Said it was so yum yum  
All off in her tum tum  
Playboy you think dumb dumb  
Now what? Uh huh  
Last night, I was in them guts  
Uh huh  
A young playa cut yo' what?  
Uh huh  
She was tryin' to get a nut  
Uh huh  
And we gon' meet back at the hut  
Uh huh  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Slimm]  
A-town, late nights  
I'm off in 112, posted up as usual downstairs  
With a couple of clydesdales  
Sippin zippindale  
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale  
Blaze up, hate to ball and bail  
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail  
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up  
And leave her man, make up  
And cheat again, caked her  
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in  
Next week she said she'll bring a friend  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Andre]  
Said I love my man, man man man  
We got our ups and downs and I'll get lonely and, and and and  
Wanna move move to someone who might understand, stand stand stand  
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland...wonderland...wanderin'  
Wonderin'...if she can home with guilt on her mind  
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine  
After they do better, better tell her, 'fo another fella  
Better, get, sit sit, shit shit, spit spit, hit hit  
  
[Chorus]
