Oh, with a mind that renders everything sensitive,  
What chance do I have here?  
Put an end, put an end,  
Put an end to every dream.  
When you're near, I fear you,  
And I forget myself.  
  
But not this time.  
Not this time.  
Not this time, baby,  
Not this time.  
  
I don't know why I give in, but I do every time.  
And here I am wondering why I did it again.  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay's what I say  
To keep me going,  
To keep the shit away.  
  
I don't know what it is,  
But every time you're near, I fear you,  
And I forget myself.  
  
No, not this time, baby.  
Not this time, you won't.  
Not this time, darling.  
c'mon, we all sing:  
  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o,  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o,  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o,  
  
Not this time.
