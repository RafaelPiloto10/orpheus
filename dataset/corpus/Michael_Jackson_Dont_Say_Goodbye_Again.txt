Girl, don't you say  
Girl, don't you make  
Girl, don't you make  
Make me cry  
Make me cry  
  
You had my life  
In the palm of your hand  
Why you threw it away  
I'll never ever understand  
  
You took away the best part  
The best part of me  
You took away, you  
How cruel could you be?  
  
You're just another heartache  
I've got to learn to take  
You're just another habit  
I have to learn to break  
  
Am I alone again?  
Am I alone again?  
Am I alone, alone, alone?  
  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again  
Again, again  
  
The more I try, the more you hurt me  
Why?  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
  
I can take an Aspirin  
For a bad headache  
But what pill for loneliness can I take?  
  
I can seal to you  
Just like cellophane  
But I need you, baby  
Like a star needs fame  
  
You're not another habit  
I have to learn to break  
Let's try to patch it up  
Before it's too late  
  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love, in love, in love  
  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again  
  
The more I try, the more you hurt me  
Why?  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
  
The more I try, the more you hurt me  
Why?  
Tell me why  
Tell me why
