I will sing of a place that you may have seen in the eastern half of our land
so green  
Where the sun is warm and the sky is blue and the love of a girl is true  
Kentucky in the morning trimmed in green and blue  
Kentucky in the morning I was only passing through  
  
There's a bird that sings something sweet and pure  
That tune goes on while the beat sounds sure  
Oh if I could hum that old song today I could chase my blues away  
Kentucky in the morning...  
  
Oh I can't recall how I came to go by Kentucky shores on the Ohio  
As I crossed that bridge I looked back to say I will sing you a song someday  
Kentucky in the morning...
