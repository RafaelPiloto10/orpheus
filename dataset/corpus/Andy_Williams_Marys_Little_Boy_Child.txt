Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the holy Bible say  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
While shepherds watch their flock by night  
They saw a bright new shining star  
And heard a choir from Heaven sing  
The music came from afar  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new King's born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bare her child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
By and by they find a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little Boy Child was born  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day
