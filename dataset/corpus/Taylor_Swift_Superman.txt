Tall dark and Superman  
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away  
To save the world or go to work  
It's the same thing to me  
Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition  
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him  
And I know every word that you say, yay  
You smile and say, "How are you?"  
And I'll say, "Just fine"  
I always forget to tell you,  
I love you, I love you, forever  
  
I watch superman fly away  
You've got a busy day today  
Go save the world I'll be around  
I watch superman fly away  
Come back I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down  
  
Talk dark and beautiful  
He's complicated, he's so irrational  
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah  
Something in his deep browns eyes has me singin'  
He's not as bad like this reputation  
I can't hear one single word they said, no  
You really got places to be and I'll be old then  
I always forget to tell you I love you,  
I loved you from the very first day  
  
I watch superman fly away  
You've got a busy day today  
Go save the world I'll be around  
I watch superman fly away  
Come back I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down  
  
And I watch you fly around the world  
And I hope you don't take some other girl  
I hope you don't forget about me  
I'm far away but I'll never let you go  
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window  
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be  
Right here wishing the flowers were from you  
Wishing the card was from you  
Wishing the call was from you  
  
'Cause I loved you from the very first day  
  
I watch superman fly away  
You've got a busy day today to save the world  
I'll be around forever and ever here  
I watch superman fly away  
I swear I'll be with you someday  
I'll be right here on the ground  
When you come back down  
  
La, la, la  
  
When you come back down
