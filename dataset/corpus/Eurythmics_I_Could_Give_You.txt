I could give you (a mirror)  
  
How can you be so cold  
With my arms to hold you?  
How can you be so cold  
With my arms to enfold you?  
  
I could give you - a mirror  
To show you - dissappointments  
I could give you - a history  
Could you ever listen in to me?  
  
How can you be so cold  
When there's a fire burning?  
How can you be so cold  
When all the ice is melting?  
  
I could give you - a mirror  
To show you - dissappointments  
I could give you - a history  
Could you ever listen in to me?
