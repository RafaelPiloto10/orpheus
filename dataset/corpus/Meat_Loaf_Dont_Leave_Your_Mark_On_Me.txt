Under your protective wing I walked into the night  
And a thousand angry demons up and took flight  
And I went running through the fields with the fever in my veins  
And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name  
Above my head, all in red, I could see you bearing down on me  
You said you're not running out, no you're leaving now  
I will find you, there is no way out  
I'll keep tracking you down in the still of this night  
Forever, mine forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't leave your mark on me, I have to reply  
I'm not staying, no, and I'm not just killing time  
Don't leave your mark on me, I have to reply, I'm not staying, no  
I'm not staying, no  
  
Mistress of the darkness, accomplice of the night  
A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside  
And something led the way though I could not see its face  
And a voice from deep inside me screamed to get out of this place  
Above my head, all was said as the jailor turned the key on me  
He said you're not running out, no you're not leaving now  
There ain't no way, there is no no way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This nightmare never ends, memories of absent friends  
Masked illusions stare at me, point the finger silently  
Stand accused as the jury scares, there's a ghost in here somewhere  
There's a ghost in here somewhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not staying, no  
Oh this nightmare really never ends, this is memories of absent friends  
(don't leave your mark on me)  
Oh this nightmare really never ends, there's a ghost in here somewhere  
(don't leave your mark on me)  
  
I'm not staying, no  
Oh this nightmare really never ends, this is memories of absent friends  
(don't leave your mark on me)  
Oh this nightmare really never ends, there's a ghost in here somewhere  
(don't leave your mark on me)
