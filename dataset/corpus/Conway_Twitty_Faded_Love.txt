As I look at the letters that you wrote to me it's you that I am thinking of  
As I read the lines that to me were so dear I remember our faded love  
I miss you darling more and more every day  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
  
And with every heartbeat I still think of you and remember our faded love  
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we've had  
As I watch the mating of the dove  
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye I remember our faded love  
I miss you darling
