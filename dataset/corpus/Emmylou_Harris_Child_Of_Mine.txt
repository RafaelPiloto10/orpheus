Although you see the world  
Different than me  
Sometimes I can touch upon  
The wonders that you see  
And all of new colors  
In pictures you've designed  
  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
Child of mine, child of mine  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
  
You don't need direction  
You know which way to go  
And I don't want to hold you back  
I just want to watch you grow  
And you're the one who taught me  
You don't have to look behind  
  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
Child of mine, child of mine  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
  
Nobody's gonna to kill your dreams  
Or tell you how to live your life  
There'll always be people  
To make it hard for awhile  
But you'll turn their heads  
When they see you smile  
  
The times you were born  
May not have been the best  
You can make the times to come  
Better than the rest  
I know you will be honest  
If you can't always be kind  
  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
Child of mine, child of mine  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine
