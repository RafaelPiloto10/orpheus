You can't escape what makes you tragic you know  
Vicious cause you want to be leaving time possessed to please you  
What might have been was never the way you envisioned things  
So difficult to stop pretending  
What's this to you anyway  
  
Turn down the voluptuous  
Keeping close to me again  
Hold back your virtues  
You're fearless in motion  
  
You found your way so why keep asking me  
Nothing common suits you, you live again in solitary,  
Look away for now, beautiful alone,  
Now who decides to settle down  
Maybe nobody really cares  
What's this to you anyway  
  
Turn down the voluptuous  
Keeping close to me again  
Hold back your virtues  
You're fearless in motion  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
You're better off saying nothing,  
Wish for a happy ending  
You're better off saying nothing  
Repent so all's forgiven  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you
