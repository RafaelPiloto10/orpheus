Dark clouds hangin' over me  
When will they go away?  
Rain is in my eyes and I can't see  
Life's become just cloudy days  
  
Why she done me like she done  
I guess I'll never know  
She knows I need her more than anyone  
I made a point to let it show  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days  
  
I recall a time when times were good  
Lord, it seems so long ago  
But you know they say if rain won't come  
Then love has no chance to grow  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand...  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days  
  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days
