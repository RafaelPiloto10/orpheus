Never even thougt it would happen to me  
Maybe I've been blind  
Only others can see I'm in love  
What am I to do. can I let it show  
Do I keep it to myself  
Or should I let her know I'm in love  
Do I nurse it in my heart  
Hold it back in my eyes  
Hide it all inside  
Or put on a disguise I'm in love  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt I'm in love  
I know it's all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same  
What am I to do.can I let it show  
Do I keep it to myself  
Or should I let her know I'm in love  
It isn't so easy when you've broken before  
But it isn't so hard when you're ready for more  
Could you love me  
Give me a simple clue  
Anything will do  
So long as I know  
What's in me is in you  
Could you love me  
I've got so much of care to give away  
There's only one thing I wanna hear you say  
I love you...  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt I'm in love  
I know it's all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same
