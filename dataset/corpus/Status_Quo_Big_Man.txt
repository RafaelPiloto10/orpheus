I know where I'm heading for  
I know what I wanna be  
When they asked me at school what I wanted to be  
That was all they got from me  
  
I wanna be a big man, nobody putting me down  
I wanna be a big man  
  
They say love is all you need  
But everyone needs to know  
If you look a bit tough when you talk about love  
I'm sure that love would grow  
  
I wanna be a big man, nobody putting me down  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
  
Look around, see if I'm wrong  
It's only a show for those who don't belong  
  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
  
I know what I'm living for  
But there ain't no guarantee  
If I make a wrong move you could jump in my shoes  
And that ain't no good to me  
  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah  
I wanna be a big man, yeah yeah
