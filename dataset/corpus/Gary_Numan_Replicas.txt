It was hard to avoid  
I suppose it was the shame  
But they didn't even try  
You see we'd never met  
And they didn't have names  
There was nothing I could do  
  
So I turned on the crowd  
And I screamed 'you and you'  
'It could have been you'  
And they seemed to think  
That I looked that way  
Or maybe I was wrong  
  
So I said  
Do you know Mr. wall  
And they looked the other way  
And then they smiled at me  
  
But the police came  
And I said it was me  
And I just walked away
