You're that one special woman  
I thought I'd never find  
With the strength to be gentle  
And the courage to be kind  
  
Though it hasn't all been roses  
Still I know you understand  
One of these nights  
When we're sharing a dream  
  
I'm gonna take you by the hand  
And lay you down on a bed of roses  
In that peaceful shelter  
Only love can provide  
I'll lay you down on a bed of roses  
And then I'll lay me down  
Right by your side.  
  
There's no diamond on your finger  
Just a simple wedding band  
Since your knight in shining armor  
Is just an ordinary man.  
  
Though I promised you a kingdom  
And we don't have all we planned  
One of these nights  
When we're making believe  
  
I'm gonna take you by the hand ...
