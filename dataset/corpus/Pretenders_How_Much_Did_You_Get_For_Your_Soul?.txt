Hey baby  
I want to know  
How much  
Did you get for your soul?  
You had the gospel  
When you were shackled to a tree  
Now you've got your freedom  
You sing for the money  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
How much did ya  
How much did ya  
How much did ya get?  
  
Hey babe  
Tell me please  
How much  
Did you get for that sleaze?  
You finally made it  
Right up to the top  
Millions of kids are looking at you  
You say "let them drink soda pop"  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
How much did ya  
How much did ya  
How much did ya get?  
  
Who's got soul?  
Who's got soul?  
From the African nation  
To the Pepsi generation  
Who's got soul?  
Who's got soul?  
  
It dwell from tree to sea  
Every living entity  
Share the super soul  
We got super soul  
Who's got soul?  
Who could think that you're for real -  
A puppet in a cabaret  
To increase your wealth  
Baby realize yourself  
  
Hey baby  
I want to know  
From the 'a-go-go' to the disco  
Where did you really go?  
You finally made it  
You're gonna make it rich  
As long as some poor bastard in Africa  
Is lying in a ditch  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
Soul  
How much did ya  
How much did ya  
How much did ya get?
