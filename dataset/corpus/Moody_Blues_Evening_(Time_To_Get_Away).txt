Evening has come to pass,  
The time of day doesn't last.  
Evening, has earned it's place today,  
I'm tired of working away.  
  
Working, living it brings,  
Only way to have those things.  
Toiling has bought too many tears,  
Turn 'round all those past years.  
  
Evening time to get away.  
Evening time to get away.  
Evening time to get away.  
'Til next day.  
  
Live all you people, you can't see where you're at,  
It doesn't really hurt you, so that can't be bad.  
  
Live all you people, you can't see where you're at,  
It doesn't really hurt you, so that can't be bad.  
  
Evening time to get away.  
Evening time to get away.
