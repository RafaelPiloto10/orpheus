Cowards in the grid of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honour long been sold  
For all shall come to know me  
As they fall unto their knees  
Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny  
When the cards of life were dealt  
My hand a ruthless fate  
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate  
A bloodbath I was born to bring, my birth I'm an assassin  
To cut the cord of life and death  
Ties to Earth unfasten  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall the Hades waits  
Kill...  
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield  
His body's mangled wounds  
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom  
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in directioni fall upon your bringing
death, the Gods give no protection  
Coward in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold  
For all shall come to know me, as they fall unto theirknees Zeus the
thunderer, control my destiny  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits  
Die die die die...
