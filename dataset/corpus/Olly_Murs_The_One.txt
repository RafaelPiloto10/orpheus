Try to walk  
Try to run  
Try to fool  
Everyone  
To imply that you were fine is pitiful  
  
So I give chase but you were too fast  
Try to lose track of your past  
Too far gone to notice my hands  
Walking on broken glass  
The reasons why you survived was a miracle  
  
So I made a call to your front door  
Telling you I'm never gonna go far  
  
And under us the river subsides for you  
Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you  
'Cause you're the one  
You can call on me for all of the dark you fear  
And I am here, to start a new  
Before you too comes undone  
  
I woke up I am just a man  
All I have is these two hands  
I took on the world when you ran  
I have fire water and air  
With you in mind, I'll move space and time to heal you  
  
So I sent a letter to your front door  
Telling you everything I said before  
  
And under us the river subsides for you  
Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you  
Cause you're the one  
You can call on me for all of the dark you fear  
And I am here to start a new, before you too comes undone  
'Cause you're the one.  
  
Step by step we go, far away from trouble  
How I wish you could see what you never see  
  
And under us the river subsides for you  
Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you  
'Cause you're the one  
You can call on me for all of the dark you fear  
And I am here, to start a new before you too comes undone.  
'Cause you're the one.  
  
'Cause you're the one.
