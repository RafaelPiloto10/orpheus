What a performance tonight  
Should I react or turn off the light?  
Looks like you're picking a fight  
In a blurring of wrong and right  
But how your mood changes  
You're a devil, now an angel  
Suddenly subtle and solemn and silent as a monk  
You only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
It's better than nothing  
I suppose  
Some doors have opened,  
Others closed  
But I couldn't see you exposed  
To the horrors behind some of those  
Somebody said: listen  
Don't you know what  
You're missing? You should be kissing him  
Instead of dissing him like a punk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
All of my friends keep asking me  
Why, oh why  
Do you not say goodbye?  
If you don't even try  
You'll be sunk  
?Cause you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
What's the meaning  
When you speak with so much feeling?  
Is it over when you're sober?  
Am I junk?  
You only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk
