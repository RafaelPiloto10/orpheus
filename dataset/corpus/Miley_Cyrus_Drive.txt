(Mike Will made it)  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
You can drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)  
'Cause I don't wannna leave home, without your love  
Without it  
  
You told me that you wanted this  
I told you it was all yours, if you're done with it  
Then what you say forever for?  
If forevers out the door  
I'll ignore, when you call  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
Yeah  
You can drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)  
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love  
Without it  
  
You told me you were coming back (right back)  
Promised it was real and I believed that  
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool  
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you yeah  
But I guess I got no valentine  
Send me roses I just let 'em die  
I was crazy thinking you were mine  
It was all just a lie  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
You can drop the keys off in the morning  
'Cause I don't want to leave home, (leave home) without your love  
Without it  
  
I always knew I never wanted this  
I never thought it could happen (it could happen)  
You acted like you wanted this  
But then you led me on (led me on)  
  
I thought you would be there when I go (I go)  
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)  
But all the broken promises I won't miss, I'm finished  
All I know are the facts  
That when I look you in the eyes all I see are the lies  
Been there, done that  
  
Drive my heart into the night  
You can drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)  
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love  
Without it hey hey, uh
