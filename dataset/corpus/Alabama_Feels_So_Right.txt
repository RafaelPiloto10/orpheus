Whisper to me softly, breathe words upon my skin  
No one's near and listening, so please don't say goodbye  
Just hold me close and love me, press your lips to mine  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Lying here beside you I hear the echoes of your sighs  
Promise me you'll stay with me and keep me warm tonight  
So hold me close and love me, give my heart a smile  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high  
You're loving me so easy, you're wish is my command  
Just hold me close and love me, tell me it won't end  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Feels so right.  
  
Ah, you feel so right baby...
