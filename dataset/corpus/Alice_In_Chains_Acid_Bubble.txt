You tried to kill me off  
Surprised I remain  
A scale tips impossible  
Afraid of my own name  
  
And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed  
Forgive this imperfection it shows and know  
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner  
Dies in a corner  
  
Alone inside your mind  
  
Intend obsolescence  
Built into the system  
  
I tried to shake it off  
You can't remove this stain  
A scale breaks impossible  
Afraid we are the same  
  
And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed  
Forgive this imperfection it shows and know  
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner  
Dies in a corner  
  
Alone inside your mind  
  
Hides in a corner  
Dies in a corner  
Alone inside your mind  
  
Intend obsolescence  
Built into the system
