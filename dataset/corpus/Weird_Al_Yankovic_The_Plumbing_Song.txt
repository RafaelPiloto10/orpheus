"Who fixes plumbing problems in a flash? Twenty four hours a day? Seven days a
week?"  
  
Baby, I sure wish I could lend you a hand  
But plumbing's one thing I don't understand  
It's true (Haven't got a clue)  
be be be baby, I can tell you've got a big problem  
When I flush the john, then your shower goes on  
(Baby) Now watcha gonna do?  
If Drano's a joke and your plunger is broke  
Baby, call the mensch with a monkey wrench  
(Baby) He'll be there for you  
  
Shower's backing up (up, up)?  
Water won't go down (down, down)?  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Don't forget my plumber  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Sink's been stopped up all summer  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Better call the plumber  
He'll know what to do  
  
Pipes been blowing up  
Pipes been breaking down  
And the carpet's soaked... right through  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, kitchen's flooded, too  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, girl, you know it's true  
  
be be be betcha this guy makes more than my lawyer  
If he works for one day, costs you half a year's pay  
(Baby) He can be here by 2:00  
So if you've got cash, he'll be there in a flash  
Makin' service calls in his overalls  
(Baby) He'll do his best for you

Leaky pipes are a bummer  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby

Maybe call a few  
  
Got a problem with plumbing?  
Gotta blame it on something  
Blame it on the drain it was cloggin', cloggin'  
Blame it on the faucet that drips all night  
If hairballs, grease and goo  
Won't let the water through  
Blame it on the drain, yeah, yeah  
  
When I flush the john, now when I flush the john  
It turns your shower on  
(Roto-Rooter 6-5000)  
Ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Better call my plumber  
He'll know what to do
