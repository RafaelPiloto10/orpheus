By David Jones and Steve Pitts  
"The circus is coming to town." it said on the poster.  
"Get your tickets now, before it's too late."  
A dancing bear and a circus clown it's so funny.  
I can't wait to see everything there.  
  
I feel like I'm already there.  
I must see her fly through the air.  
  
Horse running 'round and 'round in a circle.  
I can't wait to see everything there.  
I wonder if it's just like they say on the poster.  
If it is I know I will be there.  
  
I feel like I'm already there.  
I must see her fly through the air.  
I feel like I'm already there.  
I must see her fly through the air.
