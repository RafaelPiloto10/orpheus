I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
  
Honey I saw you there last night  
Another man's arms holding you tight  
Nobody knows what I feel inside  
All I know, I walked away and cried  
  
I've got dreams  
Dreams to remember (Listen to me)  
I've got dreams, rough dreams  
Dreams to remember  
  
I know you said he was just a friend  
But I saw him kiss you again and again  
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did he hold you so tenderly?  
  
I've got dreams  
Dreams to remember (Listen honey)  
I've got dreams, rough dreams  
Dreams to remember  
  
I still want you to stay  
I still love you anyway  
I don't want you to ever leave  
Girl, you just satisfy me, ooo wee  
  
I know you said he was just a friend  
But I saw you kiss him again and again  
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did he hold you so tenderly?  
  
I've got dreams  
Dreams to remember (Listen to me mama)  
I've got dreams, bad dreams, rough dreams oh  
To remember  
Don't make me suffer  
Don't let me  
I've got dreams, rough dreams  
Dreams, bad dreams  
Dreams, rough dreams  
To remember
