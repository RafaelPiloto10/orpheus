Wake up everyone  
How can you sleep at a time like this  
Unless the dreamer is the real you  
Listen to your voice  
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue  
Lip and the neck will appear  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna wake before  
The dream is over  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Yes I... I know it  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Yes I'll make it all mine  
  
I keep my life on a heavy rotation  
Requesting that it's lifting you up  
Up up and away  
And over to a table at the gratitude cafe  
  
And I am finally there  
And all the angels they'll be singing  
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And timing's everything  
And this time there's plenty  
I am balancing  
Careful and steady  
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting  
  
I don't wanna wait no more  
No I wanna celebrate the whole world  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Because I'm following your joy  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Because I I am open  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Yes I... I'm gonna show it  
Yes I'm gonna make it mine  
It's mine  
Yes I will make it all mine
