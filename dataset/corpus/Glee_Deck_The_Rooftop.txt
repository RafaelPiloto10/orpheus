Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
Tis the season to be jolly  
Fa la la la la la la la  
Don we now our gay apparel  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
Troll the ancient yuletide carol  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
  
Up on the rooftop reindeer paws  
Out jumps good ol' santa clause  
Down through the chimney with lots of toys  
All for the little ones Christmas joys  
Ho ho ho  
Who wouldn't go?  
Ho ho ho  
Who wouldn't go?  
Up on the rooftop click click click  
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick  
  
Deck the halls he's up on the rooftop  
Deck the halls he's up on the rooftop  
Deck the halls he's up on the rooftop  
  
First comes the stocking of little Nell  
Oh dear Santa fill it well  
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries  
One that will open and shut her eyes  
Don we now our gay apparel  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
Troll the ancient yuletide carol  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
  
Deck the halls he's up on the rooftop  
Deck the halls he's up on the rooftop  
Deck the halls he's up on the rooftop  
  
Up on the rooftop, oh oh oh oh  
Up on the rooftop, oh oh oh  
Up on the rooftop, oh oh oh oh  
Up on the rooftop, oh oh oh  
  
See the blazing Yule before us  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
Strike the harp and join the chorus  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
  
Follow me in merry measure  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
Sing the joyous song together  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
  
Ho ho ho  
Who wouldn't go?  
Ho ho ho  
Who wouldn't go?  
Up on the rooftop click click click  
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick  
  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Fa la la la la la la la la  
Tis the season to be jolly  
Hear the bells of Christmas calling  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Fa la la la la la la la la
