You're now aware of your situation  
You wasted time with contemplation  
Instead of trying to be so cool my friend  
Understand this way you'll never win  
  
You say it's darkest just before the dawn  
You get discouraged if it takes too long  
Common sense will tell you right from wrong  
My advice is that you carry on  
  
Don't get me wrong, there's more to life than gold  
There are fortunes here that can't be bought or sold  
Cause your diamonds lie within your soul  
You can't count your cash 6 feet under, stiff and cold  
  
Somebody's watchin', somebody's watchin' you  
Somebody's watchin', yes I know it's true  
Somebody's watchin', somebody's watchin' you  
Somebody's watchin', saw ya, saw ya, saw ya
