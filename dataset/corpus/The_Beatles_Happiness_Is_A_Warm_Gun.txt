Happiness is a warm gun (bang bang shoot shoot)  
Happiness is a warm gun, mama (bang bang shoot shoot)  
When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)  
And I feel my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)  
I know nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)  
Because, (happiness) is a warm gun, mama (bang bang shoot shoot)  
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (bang bang shoot shoot)  
  
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun  
Happiness (bang bang shoot shoot)  
  
Well don't you know that happiness (happiness) is a warm gun, (is a warm gun,
yeah).
