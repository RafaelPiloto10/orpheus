I had a dream I was moving forward  
Floating gently to the sun  
I've come to see my world rewarded  
A new day has begun  
  
A lost bird caught in mid migration  
Far away to a foreign land  
Offspring of a secret nation  
A new day has begun  
  
[Chorus]  
I can see the earth below me  
And I can  
Feel it turn  
  
Fog lifts to reveal potential  
For generations prophesied  
Our growth to be exponential  
Our promise finally realized  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel it turn  
Across the sky  
The world it learns  
So must I  
  
Cut steel wired into water  
Fixed link, circumnavigate  
Old men see your sons and daughters  
No longer, no longer hesitate  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
