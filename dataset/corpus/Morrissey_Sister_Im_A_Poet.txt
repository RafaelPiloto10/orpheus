All over this town  
Yes, a low wind may blow  
And I can see through everybody's clothes  
With no reason  
To hide these words, I feel  
And no reason  
To talk about the books I read  
But still, I do  
  
That's 'cause I'm a...  
Sister I'm a...  
All over this town  
  
Along this way  
Outside the prison gates  
I love the romance of crime  
And I wonder :  
Does anybody feel the same way I do?  
And is evil just something you are  
Or something you do?  
  
Sister I'm a...  
Sister I'm a...  
All over this town  
  
All over this town  
They pull over  
In their Citroen vans  
Not to shake your hands  
With Meths on their breaths  
And you with youth on your side  
All alone...lone...alone, waiting at the lights  
But not this time  
  
Sister I'm a...  
Sister I'm a...  
All over this town...  
All...oh  
Oh  
All over this town
