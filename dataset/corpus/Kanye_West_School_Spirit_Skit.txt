Now beat that  
And your mothers saying "go to college"  
So you finish college and its wonderful  
You feel so good  
And after all the partying and crazing  
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around
your peers  
Hey now you'll get that 25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money  
No more borrowing money from mom for my high  
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it  
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!  
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretary's secretary!  
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary  
Who never went to college  
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family  
You know what college does for you?  
It makes you really smart man  
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok  
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be,  
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes  
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied  
When a lady walks to me says "hey you know what's sexy?"  
I say "no, I don't know what it is,  
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast".
