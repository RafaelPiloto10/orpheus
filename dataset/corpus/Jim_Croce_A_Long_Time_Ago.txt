Seems like such a long time ago  
I was walking on a lonely road  
Getting tired of dreaming alone  
Like all the lonely people I have known  
Seems like such a long time ago  
There was no one who would share my song  
I was just a boy far from home  
I became a man when you came along  
We spent the whole night talking  
You said you'd like to see the sunrise  
But in the gold of morning  
T'was nothing that I had not seen in your eyes  
I was so afraid to touch you  
Thought you were to young to know  
So I just watched you sleeping  
Then you woke and said to me  
The night is cold -- it frightens me  
I could sleep so easy next to you  
Wasn't very long ago  
You said that you would like to share my road  
Then you started singing my songs  
Spent so many nights a-waiting  
Let's not spend the moments wasting  
Time for me has very far to go  
I will go if you would take me  
I have never had a lover  
I am young but I am so alone  
We spent the whole night talking...  
But in the gold of morning...
