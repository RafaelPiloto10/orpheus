Well the wall's to wet to sit on  
And there's a curtain right over my head  
Stamp my feet waiting for a bus  
But decide to walk instead  
  
And the American saxophoner follows me  
All the way from the tele to the public house  
My fingers are always in my ears  
But the reeds always in their mouth  
  
And if you've ever crossed  
your heart and hoped to die  
The voices in your head saying you must cry  
Then there's more to you than meets the eye  
But if you go about your business with capital be  
They're sure to cut you up with a capital see  
And then you will be dead with a capital D  
  
Just step outside  
Well we could stop for a conversasion  
If we could think of anything to say  
But you know you've got nothing to talk about  
When nothing happened yesterday  
  
And if I ever committed a murder  
I think I'd go about it this way  
Never mine a rope or a dagger and a cloak  
I could spend a week on this estate  
  
And if you've ever crossed  
your heart and hoped to die  
The voices in your head saying you must cry  
Then there's more to you than meets the eye  
But if you go about your business with capital be  
They're sure to cut you up with a capital see  
And then you will be dead with a capital A  
  
Just step outside  
What are you doing tomorrow  
And the day after and the day after that  
Got some money I can borrow?  
I've become the person I've admired  
  
And if you've ever crossed  
your heart and hoped to die  
The voices in your head saying you must cry  
Then there's more to you than meets the eye  
But if you go about your business with capital be  
They're sure to cut you up with a capital see  
And then you will be dead with a capital be
