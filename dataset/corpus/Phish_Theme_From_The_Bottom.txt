I feed from the bottom, you feed from the top  
I live upon morsels you happen to drop  
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup  
If nothing comes down then I'm forced to swim up  
On the way upwards, the colors come back  
But all along the bottom is blue, grey, and black  
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong  
And the night seems to go on incredibly long  
  
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,  
Don't you see anything you'd like to try?  
  
Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth  
Jumbled events that have less than no worth  
Time in the forest to dig under rocks  
Or float in the ocean asleep in a box  
  
Or sink just below all the churning and froth  
And swim to the light source or fly like a moth  
So toss away stuff you don't need in the end  
But keep what's important and know who's your friend  
  
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,  
Don't you see anything that you'd like to try?  
  
If I'm swimming by  
  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top  
From the bottom, from the top
