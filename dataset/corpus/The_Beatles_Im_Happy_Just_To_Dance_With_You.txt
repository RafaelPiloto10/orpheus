Before this dance is through  
I think I'll love you too  
I'm so happy when you dance with me  
  
I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand  
If it's funny try and understand  
There is really nothing else I'd rather do  
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you  
  
I don't need to hug or hold you tight  
I just wanna dance with you all night  
In this world there's nothing I would rather do  
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you  
  
Just to dance with you  
Is everything I need  
Before this dance is through  
I think I'll love you too  
I'm so happy when you dance with me  
  
If somebody tries to take my place  
Let's pretend we just can't see his face  
In this world there's nothing I would rather do  
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you  
  
Just to dance with you  
Is everything I need  
Before this dance is through  
I think I'll love you too  
I'm so happy when you dance with me  
  
If somebody tries to take my place  
Let's pretend we just can't see his face  
In this world there's nothing I would rather do  
I discovered I'm in love with you  
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
