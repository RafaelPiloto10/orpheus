Every time I see you looking my way,  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
In the park or walking down the high way,  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
  
And when you move up closer to me  
I get a feeling that's oo-wee.  
  
Can't you hear the pounding of my heartbeat  
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love.  
  
When I feel you put your arms around me,  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad you found me,  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
  
And when you asked me to meet your ma  
I knew that baby we'd be goin' far.  
  
Can't you hear the pounding of my heartbeat  
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love.  
  
All my friends are crying out to meet you,  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
Now's the time to go and see the preacher,  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
  
Now wedding bells are going to chime  
And baby, baby, you're gonna be mine.  
  
Can't you hear the pounding of my heartbeat  
'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love.  
  
Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
  
Ah!  
Ah...  
Oh...  
Oh...
