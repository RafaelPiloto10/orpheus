I'm gonna plant me some seed  
Grow me an ocean  
Cut me some trees  
And build me an island  
Stand on the corner  
Flag down a streetcar  
Go somewhere and phone him  
And ask him where my thoughts are  
I'm gonna say to him  
Are my thoughts with you babe  
How twisted, babe, are they  
Since you went away, babe  
I ain't been thinking too straight  
And if that don't get through  
I'm gonna build me a flower  
Sit down in the morning dew  
And kiss it every hour  
I'm gonna turn out the lights  
Turn on the night  
Give up the fight  
Go for a flight  
Catch me a kite  
Who cares what's right or wrong  
When I get to the moon  
Rent me a room  
Sit in the gloom  
All alone  
And cry are my thoughts with you babe  
How twisted, babe, are they  
You know, since you went away, babe  
I ain't been thinking too straight  
I'm gonna turn out the lights  
Turn on the night  
Give up the fight  
Go for a flight  
Catch me a kite  
Who cares what's right or wrong  
When I get to the moon  
Rent me a room  
Sit in the gloom  
All alone  
And cry are my thoughts with you babe
