Love hurts, love scars  
Love wounds and mars  
Any heart not tough  
Or strong enough  
Take a lot of pain  
Take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud  
And it holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts  
  
You're young, I know  
Baby, what's so  
I know a thing or two  
Ooo honey, I learned from you  
I really learned a lot  
I really learned a lot  
Love is like a stove  
It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts  
  
Some fools rave, of happiness  
Of blissfulness, togetherness  
Oh, some fools,  
They fool themselves, I guess  
They're not fooling me  
And I know it isn't true  
God, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts, (ooooo) love hurts  
(Ooooo), love hurts  
  
And I know it isn't true  
Oh, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie and it's  
Made to make you blue  
Cause love hurts  
Early in the morning you hurt,  
Love hurts, (ooooo), love hurts
