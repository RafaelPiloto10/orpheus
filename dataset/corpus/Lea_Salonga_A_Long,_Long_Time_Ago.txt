(odette quesada)  
  
We used to be one  
I can remember when our hearts were very young  
You said our love would be forever  
But that was such a long, long time ago  
A long, long time ago  
Time and again  
I still remember day after day  
When you'd hold me close to you  
But they are just a part of yesterday  
Such a long, long time ago  
Why did it ever have to be this way?  
You promised me the moon, the sun, the stars above  
How come you suddenly ceased to look my way?  
Tell me the truth that you are certain of  
Look at me now  
The girl you once loved  
Look at me now  
Grown up but still in love with you  
Although it's such a long, long time ago  
Such a long, long time ago  
Why did it ever have to be this way?  
You promised me the moon, the sun, the stars above  
How come you suddenly ceased to look my way?  
Tell me the truth that you are certain of  
Look at me now  
The girl you once loved  
Look at me now  
Grown up but still in love with you  
Although it's such a long, long time ago  
Such a long, long time ago
