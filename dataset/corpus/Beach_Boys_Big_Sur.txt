Do do do do do do do do do  
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens  
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea  
With the granite cliff  
(Big Sur mount)  
  
As a referee  
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns  
A mother deer with their newborn fawns  
All under Big Sur skies  
(Big Sur mount)  
That's where I belong.  
  
Big Sur I've got plans for you  
Me and mine are going to  
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers  
(Big Sur mount)  
  
And live in canyons covered in springtime green  
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen  
And with my old guitar  
I'll make up songs to sing.  
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside  
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside  
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide  
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be  
Where the rugged mountain meets the water  
  
And so while stars shine brightly from up above  
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove  
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log.  
  
From time to time I must go away  
The thoughts of Big Sur won't let me stay  
Away from Big Sur  
Oh Big Sur
