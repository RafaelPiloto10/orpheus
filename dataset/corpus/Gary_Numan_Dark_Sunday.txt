You're like poison  
You smile at me  
Talk of love.  
'He' will forgive me  
If I confess.  
Your dark Sunday  
You lied to me  
And so I  
Replaced God  
With a picture of my car.  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  
I'm on the E kick  
So heaven's in my head  
I'm in Outland  
Shame on me.  
I want pictures  
People come, people go  
D'you think God  
Will forgive me soon?  
You won't like this  
You won't like this.  
Rip it up  
Rip it into pieces  
Rip it up  
Rip it for good.  
Touch me, touch me.  
He won't like this  
He won't like this  
'He' won't touch me  
I can't dance and I can't sing  
I'm not stone shape  
But time runs out.  
I don't like this  
All I see is cold and hard  
All I can do now  
Is break 'the word'  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  
'He' will love me?  
Well thank him  
For nothing.  
I need that like  
I need a disease.  
So pray for me.  
I don't mind  
I don't care.  
I've found love  
It's an American machine.  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.
