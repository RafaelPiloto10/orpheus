Life  
It flicked like a dying flame  
Then before my very eyes you came  
And entered our world  
And you were born a king  
It's too late  
Welcome to paradise  
It's too late  
Yes you were born a king  
It's loo late  
Welcome to paradise  
It's too late  
Life  
A million things for you to learn  
But one by one those pages turn  
Like history itself  
But you were born a king  
Your pale blue eyes and velvet skin  
Fingertips and sideways grin  
No photograph or microphone  
Could capture your elusive tone  
No waterfall or running stream  
Could be so pure as your daydream  
No china doll or crystal sphere  
Comes close to you, my child so dear  
In you I have a glimpse of faith  
A love affair with outer space  
A foothold on a mountain top  
A passion there that never stops  
No magazines radio or late night  
Tv monster show  
Could entertain me more than you  
I want you to know  
That you were born a king  
Welcome to paradise  
Yes you were born a king  
Welcome to paradise
