Walk on, up to me  
Look in my eyes, i'll make you see  
I want only you  
I'd do anything just to have you  
I'm ready (ready) for romance  
Got to show you  
How you make me dance  
  
Let me be (your little) loverboy  
You can be (my little) lovergirl  
We can be (like little) lovebirds  
  
A touch of your hand can make this mind a joy a loverboy oh man [?]  
  
Other girls look at me  
But you are the only one I see  
I fantasize, day and night,  
Going crazy, can't get you out of my mind  
Are you ready (ready) for romance  
Come on girl, I gotta take a chance  
  
Let me be (your little) loverboy  
You can be (my little) lovergirl  
We can be (like little) lovebirds  
  
A touch of your hand can make this mind a joy a loverboy oh man [?]  
  
Dance. She makes you wanna  
Dance. Oooh  
Are you ready?  
Yes, I'm ready, ready for romance  
  
I guess you  
So won't you be my girl?  
  
Let me be (your little) loverboy  
You can be (my little) lovergirl  
We can be (like little) lovebirds  
  
I'm your loverboy, you're my lovergirl  
Throw us together baby we can rock each other's worlds  
You can be (my little) lovergirl  
I'm your loverboy, you're my lovergirl  
Throw us together baby we can rock each other's worlds  
(I'm in love) You can be (my little) lovergirl  
You can be (my little) lovergirl
