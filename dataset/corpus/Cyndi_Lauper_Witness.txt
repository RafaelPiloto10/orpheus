You're sorry now  
And you'll change some how  
And I am what you need to get out,  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be witness  
  
'Cause I'm crawling back  
I'm searchin' the right track  
I'm standin' at last I'm sure  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be witness  
  
Jailbird chained to walk  
You used to talk, talk, talk  
But the melody none at all my love  
And I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Witness  
Witness  
  
Please let me out this time  
'Cause I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
I don't want to be  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
I don't want to be  
No I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be  
I don't want to be a witness  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Witness
