There she stood in the street  
Smiling from her head to her feet  
I said hey what is this  
Now maybe baby  
Maybe you're in need for a kiss  
I said hey what's your name  
Maybe we can see things the same  
Now don't you wait or hesitate  
Let's move before they raise the parking rate  
  
I took her home to my place  
Watching every move on her face  
She said look what's your game  
Are you trying to put me in shame  
I said slow don't talk so fast  
Don't you think that love can last  
She said love Lord above  
Now you're trying to trick me in love  
  
All right now  
Baby it's all right now  
All right now  
Baby it's all right now  
  
Who's that girl, watch that girl  
Look at that girl  
She lives down my street  
Who's that girl, w-w-w-watch that girl  
Well look at that girl  
She lives down my street  
  
I took her home to my place  
Watching every move on her face  
She said look what's your game  
Are you trying to put me in shame  
I said slow don't talk so fast  
Don't you think that love can last  
She said love Lord above  
Now you're tryin' to trick me in love  
  
All right now  
Baby it's all right now  
  
Baby, baby, baby it's all right  
Baby, baby, baby it's all right  
  
Took me home to her place  
And I watched the smile on her face  
When she moves me  
I just watch that girl, watch that girl  
And she said, "Love, you tryin' to trick me in love"  
What's this now baby that's no good  
Tryin' to trick me in love  
Don't do that, no don't do that  
Don't do that oh baby  
All right now  
Don't do, don't do that  
You can't do that, can't do that  
All right now baby
