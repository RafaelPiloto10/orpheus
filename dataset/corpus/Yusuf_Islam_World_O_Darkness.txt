In this world o' darkness,  
Evil rules by night,  
But somewhere in the shadows, someone seeking light  
  
No one knows his neighbor here,  
No one has the time,  
No one cares for anyone else,  
In a world where the sun don't shine  
  
Shamsia [Repeat: x2]  
  
Some sons dream of leaving,  
While they're young at heart,  
But few choose the path towards the land beyond the dark,  
Who choose the path towards the land beyond the daaark
