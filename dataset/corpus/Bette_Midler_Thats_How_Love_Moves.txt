Oooooh. Oooh-hoooh.  
Ooooo-hoooh.  
It's such a mystery  
How he found something in me  
That I never knew was there.  
He uncovered it so easily.  
He turned me like a season  
And I began to change.  
He wrapped himself all around me,  
Now I'll never be the same.  
  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven.  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
That's how love moves.  
Ohh, that's how love moves.  
  
I've seen walls that could never be broken  
Come a-tumblin' down, oh yes I have.  
I've heard the voice of love calling  
Without making a sound.  
See, I was touched by an angel  
The day he took my hand.  
I know that he's the miracle  
That makes me eveything I am.  
  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven.  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
That's how love moves.  
Ohh, that's how love moves.  
Woah, love.  
  
Sometimes it's a whisper,  
Oh, sometimes it's a storm,  
Sometimes it reaches forever  
With it's everlasting arms.  
  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
High as Heaven.  
It consumes you, yeah, that's a given.  
  
Ohhhhhhh!  
That's how love works.  
That's how love moves.  
Like a river, yeah, like a river  
Running through you, running through your heart and soul.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven.  
Heaven!  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
  
That's how love works. That's how love works.  
That's how love moves. That's how love moves.  
Like a river running through you. Like a river running through your heart and
soul.  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven. Heaven!  
It consumes you, that's a given.  
That's how love moves.  
  
That's how love moves.  
That's how love moves.  
That's how love moves.  
That's how, that's how, that's how.  
That's how love moves.  
That's how love moves.
