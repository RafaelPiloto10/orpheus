Don't know when she started changing  
Don't know how it's come to this  
Seems like yesterday she was in my arms, begging for a kiss  
Now the winds of change are blowin'  
And they're taking her away  
I will do my best not to hold her back,  
But there's nothing more to say  
  
She doesn't need me  
She's gonna leave me  
She needs some time on her own  
I should have told her  
Now I can't hold her  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesn't need me anymore  
  
It's so hard to watch believe me  
It's so hard to be alone  
I just hope and prey that there'll come a day,  
She'll find the road back home  
  
She doesn't need me  
She's gonna leave me  
She needs some time on her own  
I should have told her  
Now I can't hold her  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesn't need me anymore  
  
If I pretend to be happy, I'd only be fooling myself  
'Cause here in my heart I know that I'm dying  
And it's tearing me apart, baby I'm crying  
  
I should have told her  
Now I can't hold her  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesn't need me now  
  
Wish it could be like before  
But she doesn't need me anymore
