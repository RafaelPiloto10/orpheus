Buddy, tip your bottle back  
Climb aboard the bus  
Join your brothers in the band  
If you ain't bombed in Burmingham  
Then you ain't one of us  
We don't really give a damn  
London is a hundred miles a-waitin' where we're at  
And a thousand years behind  
Splitting from a sorry gig that left us feelin' flat  
Out of sight and out of mind  
Cruisin' through the countryside we'll never see again  
Ain't it lonesome out tonight?  
We've been on that road now since I can't remember when  
Out of mind and out of sight  
Buddy tip your bottle back and climb aboard the bus  
Join your brothers in the band  
If you ain't bombed in Burmingham then you ain't one of us  
We don't really give a damn  
Yeah, I been ev'rywhere and I seen ev'rything there is  
But I never saw the light  
Scared to death of dyin' so I do my best to live  
Out of mind and out of sight  
Knowin' no one nowhere's gonna miss us when we're gone  
Let's keep drinkin' 'til we're blind  
Ev'rybody's sleepin' and I'm stuck inside a song  
Outta sight and outta line  
Someday when it's over and it's time to settle down  
And we've left it all behind  
We can sit and wonder how we ever got around  
Out of sight and out of mind  
Out of sight and out of mind
