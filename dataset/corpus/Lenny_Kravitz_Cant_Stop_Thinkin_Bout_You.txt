It get's old living in this jungle  
And I've lost my way  
I don't know what is it any longer  
It's nothing more to say  
  
But one think it's true, I'm in love with you  
And I'm gonna do what I got to do  
Every since you run away  
My whole word's been blue  
And I just can't stop think bout you  
(Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Ooh yeah  
Thinking bout you)  
  
I was never ever to the give myself  
For the things I did  
I thought I, I thought I was a man  
But I was just a kid  
  
But one think it's true  
I'm still in love with you  
And I'm gonna do what I got to do  
Every since you run away  
My whole word's been blue  
And I just can't stop think bout you  
(Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Ooh yeah  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking but you babe  
Thinking bout you)  
  
But one think it's true  
I'm still in love with you  
And I'm gonna do what I got to do  
Every since you run away  
My whole word's been blue  
And I just can't stop think bout you  
(Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
I think bout you  
Ooh yeah, come on)
