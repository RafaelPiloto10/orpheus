How many times have they lied with the truth in their eyes  
Treat you like dirt, wasting the days of our lives  
They try and deny it, ain't gonna buy it, just look around  
Before it's all over, it's gonna get rough  
  
I've had enough -  
  
Chorus:  
(Out of the cold into the fire) Nothing and no one is stopping me now  
(Out of the cold into the fire) Just hang tough and we'll make it somehow  
  
How many times have you given up more than you got  
Countin' on things turnin' out, but you know they will not  
Ain't gonna take it, kick it and break it, just look around  
Before it's all over it's gonna get rough  
  
Chorus repeats 2x  
  
Wishin' and hopin' won't get you nothin'  
Prayin' and schemin', no time for dreamin'  
I've got the power, this is the hour now  
  
Wishin' and hopin' won't get you nothin'  
Prayin' and schemin', no time for dreamin'  
I've got the power, this is the hour now  
  
Chorus repeats 2x
