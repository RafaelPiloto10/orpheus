People you love  
Will turn their backs on you.  
You'll lose your hair,  
your teeth,  
your knife will fall out of it's sheath.  
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie.  
  
People you hate  
Will get their hooks into you.  
They'll pull you down,  
you'll frown,  
they'll tar you and drag you through town.  
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie.  
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show.
