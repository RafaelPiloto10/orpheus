Love you were kind and much older  
Foolish but wiser than me  
Am I becoming an anchor  
Holding you back from the sea  
  
Restlessly you stand there, crying silently  
It must be so hard being easy on me  
  
Compassionate man, so gentle  
Trying hard to shelter me  
Compassionate man, so kind  
But the bottom line will be what it will be  
You're leaving me, leaving me  
  
Love, my whole life was a desert  
Then gently your love fell like rain  
We lived for awhile in a garden  
But now I'm a desert again  
  
Come right out and say it  
Tell me honestly  
It must be so hard being easy on me  
  
Compassionate man, so gentle  
Trying hard to shelter me  
Compassionate man, so kind  
But the bottom line will be what it will be  
  
You're leaving me, leaving me  
You're leaving me  
You're leaving me  
You're leaving me
