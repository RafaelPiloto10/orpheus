Words and music by Leah Kunkel  
Oh, last night I sat by your side  
Oh, I was feelin' so lonely  
Would have given up my pride  
All night I was so lonely  
Then you took to the streets  
You don't have much to say  
But I listened to your feet  
As they walked away  
Bye bye bye bye  
Now walking's the only thing I know  
Oh we do well together  
I ain't thinkin' 'bout where we go  
Lace up your boots of leather  
Then we take to the streets  
We don't have much to say  
But I listen to our feet  
As we walk away  
Bye bye bye...  
I wasn't lookin' for love  
I'm a little sorry you're gore  
But until we have something to say  
L'll just keep walking along  
Bye bye bye...  
Ask me if I need you now  
Oh no I'm feeling great  
If you hunt me in my dreams  
Ah there is one escape  
I'll just take to the streets  
I won't have much to say  
But I'll be listening to my feet  
As they walk away  
Bye bye bye...
