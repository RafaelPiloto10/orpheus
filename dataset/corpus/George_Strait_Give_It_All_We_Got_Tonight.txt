July moonlight shines  
Your pretty little head on my shoulder  
Pull over on the side of the road  
Oh my God, you're something  
Like nothing I've ever seen  
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream  
  
Baby fall into my kiss  
It should just happen like this  
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and  
This moment that says it's so right  
'Cause that's all we have in this life  
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight  
  
Summer honeysuckle  
Leaking through a rolled down window  
We both know when that seat lays back  
Anything can happen  
So imagine it'll never end  
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be  
  
Baby fall into my kiss  
It should just happen like this  
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and  
This moment that says it's so right  
'Cause that's all we have in this life  
Baby, drink up this love, give it all we got tonight  
Give it all we got tonight  
  
Baby fall into my kiss  
It should just happen like this  
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and  
This moment that says it's so right  
'Cause that's all we have in this life  
Drink up this love, c'mon, give it all we got tonight  
Give it all we got tonight
