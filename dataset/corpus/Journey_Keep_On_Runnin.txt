Workin' in the city  
This town's got no pity  
Bossman owns a heart of stone  
I'm on the line, it's overtime  
I'll tell you it's a crime  
They get me by the hour  
By my blue collar  
You're squeezin' me too tight  
It's Friday night  
Let's run tonight  
Till the morning light.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Keep on runnin', keep on hidin'  
Keep on runnin' away  
It's okay, it's alright  
It's okay, it's alright  
And if it makes you want to jump and shout, go ahead!  
Keep on runnin' keep on hidin'  
Keep on runnin' away, it's okay.  
  
Crusin' with my baby  
Think we just might maybe  
Find some back seat rhythm and blues  
Radio, down we go, down we go.  
  
[Chorus]
