On my way up north  
Up on the Ventura  
I pulled back the hood  
And I was talking to you  
And I knew then it would be  
A life long thing  
But I didn't know that we  
We could break a silver lining  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
Things you said that day  
Up on the one o one  
The girl had come undone  
I tried to downplay it  
With a bet about us  
You said that  
You'd take it  
As long as I could  
I could not erase it  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
And I ride along side  
And I rode along side  
You then  
And I rode along side  
Till you lost me there  
In the open road  
And I rode along side  
Till the honey spread  
Itself so thin  
For me to break your bread  
For me to take your word  
I had to steal it  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
I could pick back up  
Whenever I feel  
  
Down New Mexico way  
Something about  
The open road  
I knew that he was  
Looking for some Indian blood and  
Find a little in you find a little  
In me we may be  
On this road but  
We're just  
Impostors  
In this country you know  
So we go along and we said  
We'd fake it  
Feel better with  
Oliver Stone  
Till I  
Almost smacked him  
Seemed right that night and  
I don't know what  
Takes hold  
Out there in the  
Desert cold  
These guys think they must  
Try and just get over on us  
  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
And I was ridin' by  
Ridin' along side  
For a while till you lost me  
And I was ridin' by  
Ridin' along till you lost me  
Till you lost  
Me in  
The rear  
View  
You lost me  
I said  
Way up North I took my day  
All in all was a pretty nice  
Day and I put the hood  
Right back where  
You could taste heaven  
Perfectly  
Feel out the summer breeze  
Didn't know when we'd be back  
And I I don't  
Didn't think  
We'd end up like  
Like this
