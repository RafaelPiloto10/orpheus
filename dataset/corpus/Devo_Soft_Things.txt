Soft things  
You want soft things  
You need soft things  
You'll get soft things  
You register a motion  
You get a helpful hint  
There's a certain way it shivers when she shakes  
Her mind seemed so chaotic  
Her posture was erotic  
And her voice was exotic  
I acted so neurotic  
I thought it idiotic  
Her dance was so technotic  
She became hypnotic  
And now I'm calling out for soft things  
Something soft when times get hard  
And now I'm calling out for soft things  
When something calls you you'll know what to do  
You find a longer wavelength  
You hear a deeper note  
It's a buried treasure that she doesn't hide
