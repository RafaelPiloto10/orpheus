I got an idea of something we can do with a gun  
Sink load and fire till the empire  
Reaps what they've sown  
Shoot shoot shoot till their minds are open  
  
Shoot shoot shoot till their eyes are closed  
Push push push till we get some motion  
Push push push till the bombs explode  
  
I got an idea  
We can do it  
All on our own  
Nothing to worry  
Regret must weigh a ton  
  
Kick kick kick till the laws are broken  
Kick kick kick till the boots are worn  
Hit hit hit till the truth is spoken  
Hit hit hit till the truth is born  
  
I got an idea of something  
We can do with a gun
