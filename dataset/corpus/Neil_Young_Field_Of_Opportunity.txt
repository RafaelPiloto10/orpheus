I've been wrong before  
And I'll be there again  
I don't have any answers my friend  
Just this pile of old questions  
My memory left me here  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
  
I'm going' back to my house  
But I'm not goin' now  
It's too early to be leaving here, somehow  
Let me bore you with this story  
"How my lover let me down"  
While I borrow seeds of sadness  
From the ground.  
  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
There ain't no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
I'll just wait around 'til springtime  
And then, I'll find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
  
When I'm all done cultivatin'  
I'll be rockin' on the porch  
Tryin' to picture you and where you are  
And there'll be no hesitatin'  
When Cupid lights the torch  
With those headlights comin' down the hill  
Between the stars.  
  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.  
There ain't no way of telling  
Where these seeds will rise or when  
I'll just wait around 'til springtime  
And then, I'll find a friend  
In the field of opportunity  
It's plowin' time again.
