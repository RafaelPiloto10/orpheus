[Verse 1:]  
You got a laundry list of today?s complaints  
you think you?re a superstar who?s shit don?t stank  
You?re a nothing wrapped up in a something?s clothes  
You?re the kinda person I don?t want to know  
I don?t hear you- please shut up  
I don?t see you- cause you?re too tough  
  
[Chorus:]  
All the things I do they make you crazy  
You always say I?m useless and I?m lazy  
You moan and groan and bitch what does that prove?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You can?t sit still, you never act straight  
I get uncomfortable when I see your face  
Everybody?s talking behind your back  
You?re a three time loser into the cracks
