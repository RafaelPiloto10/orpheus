Is it worth the waiting for  
if we live till eighty-four  
all we ever get is gruel  
everyday we say a prayer  
will they change the bill of fare  
Still we get the same old gruel  
there's not a crust not a crumb can we find  
can we beg can we borrow or cadge  
but there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill  
When we all close our eyes and imagine  
  
Food glorious food  
Hot sausage and mustard  
while we're in the mood  
cold jelly and custard  
pease pudding and saveloys  
What next is the question  
Rich gentlemen have it boys  
In-di-gestion  
food glorious food we're anxious to try it  
3 banquets a day our faveourite diet  
just picture a great big steak  
Fried, roasted, or stewed oh food wonderful food  
Marvellous food glorious food...  
  
Food Glorious food what is there more handsom  
gulped, swallowed, or chewed  
Still worth a king's randsom  
what is it we dream about  
What brings on a sigh  
piled peaches and cream about  
Six feet high!!!  
  
Food Glorious food eat right through the menu  
just losen your belt  
2 inches and then you  
work up a new appetite  
In this interlude  
then food, once again food, fabulous food, glorious food....!  
  
Food Glorious food don't care what it looks like  
burned, underdone, crude don't care what the cook's like  
just thinkin' of growing fat our senses go reeling  
one moment of knowing that  
full up feeling!!!!  
  
Food glorious food what wouldn't we give for  
that extra bit more that's all that we live for  
why should we be fated to do nothing but grude  
oh food, magical food, wonderful food, marvellous food, fabulous food,  
beautiful food, glou-ri-ous fooooooooood.............!!!!
