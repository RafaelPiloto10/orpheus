We said our goodbyes long ago  
Never thinking we'd miss each other so  
All the memories we can't leave behind  
Oh, we must have been out of our minds  
I thought I loved another, not you  
How foolish I thought the same, too  
They both turned out to be the wrong kind  
Oh, we must have been out of our minds  
Let's forgive and forget the past we've known  
And reap together the wild seeds we've sown  
Surely they can forgive us and find  
That we must have been out of our minds  
I thought I loved another, not you  
How foolish I thought the same, too  
They both turned out to be the wrong kind  
Oh, we must have been out of our minds  
Yes, we must have been out of our minds
