I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well,  
Oh yes you know its true,  
You called me Cinderella,  
All you had to do was yell and I'd be there for you,  
  
Here I am, so try to forgive me,  
I don't believe in fairy tales,  
Here we are with nothin' but honesty,  
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay,  
  
I'm sorry for runnin' away like this,  
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish,  
Ahh  
But Cinderella's got to go  
  
From time to time I'd tried to tell just what was on my mind,  
You told me not today,  
Come back, do that, where's Cinderella at?,  
Was all ya had to say,  
Here I am, so try to forgive me,  
I don't believe in fairy tales,  
Here we are with nothin' but honesty,  
I've had enough, I'm not gonna stay,  
  
I'm sorry for runnin' away like this,  
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish,  
Ahh  
But Cinderella's got to go  
  
I'm sorry just tryin' to live my life,  
Don't worry your gonna be alright,  
But Cinderella's got to go,  
  
[Spoken]  
To say I want you, You cast me under your spell,  
I did everything you wanted me to,  
But now I shall, break free from all your lies,  
I won't be blind you see, my love it can't be sacrificed I won't return to
thee  
  
(I'm so sorry, I've already made up my mind)  
I won't return to thee  
  
I'm sorry to say I'm running away now,  
Don't worry you will be alright,  
I'm runnin' away I've made up my mind now,  
Your gonna have to let me go,  
  
'Cause she's gotta go  
  
I'm sorry for runnin' away like this,  
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish,  
  
But Cinderella's got to go  
  
I'm sorry just tryin' to live my life,  
Don't worry your gonna be alright,  
But Cinderella's got to go,
