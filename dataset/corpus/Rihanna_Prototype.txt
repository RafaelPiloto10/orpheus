Just a thought  
To add suspense  
To all the games  
Of discontent.  
  
Fear is real  
But not self-taught  
You let others  
Be the cause.  
  
There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
You say it draws near,  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
Tear down  
Those mighty walls.  
Reinvent  
The way you talk.  
  
Look ahead,  
Now down below,  
Or high above,  
Where angels flow.There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
Waiting to see  
Our kind disagree.  
You draw the line  
And stick to your pride.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way...  
  
It ends.  
  
(Guitar solos)  
  
You say it draws near  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You wrote the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
It ends.
