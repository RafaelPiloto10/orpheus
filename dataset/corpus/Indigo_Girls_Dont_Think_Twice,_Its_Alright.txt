Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe  
If you don't know by now  
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe  
It don't matter anyhow  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm traveling on  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
Ain't no use in turning on your light babe  
It's a light I've never known  
There ain't no use in turning on your light baby  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
I wish there was something you could do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
Ain't no use in calling out my name now  
Like you've never done before  
Ain't no use in calling out my name now  
I can't hear you anymore  
Thinking and wondering all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told  
I gave her my heart, she wanted my soul  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
I'm going down that long lonesome road babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good a word babe  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
Coulda done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
And don't think twice, it's alright
