I'm nothing special  
In fact, I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke  
You probably heard it before  
  
But I have a talent  
A wonderful thing  
'cause everyone listens  
When I start to sing  
I'm so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it loud  
  
[Chorus]  
So, I say, thank you for the music  
The songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be without a song or dance  
What are we  
So, I say, thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
Um, she says I began to sing long before I could talk  
But, I often wonder how did it all start  
To find that there's nothin' can capture a heart  
Like a memory can  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair  
I want to sing it out to everybody  
What a joy, what a life, what a chance  
  
Thank you for the music  
The songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who could live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be without a song or dance  
What are we  
So, I say, thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
So, I say, thank you for the music  
For giving it to me
