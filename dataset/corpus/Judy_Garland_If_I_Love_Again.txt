I often wonder why he came to me  
Brought such a flame to me  
  
And let it die  
And if another love should find my heart  
It will remind my heart of your goodbye  
  
With every new love you  
Will come back to me  
In others eyes, its you I see  
If I love again  
Though its someone new  
  
If I love again  
It'll still be you  
In someone else's firm embrace  
I'll close my eyes but see your face  
  
If I love again  
I'll find other charms  
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms  
And though my lips whisper  
  
"I love you"  
My heart will not be true  
I'll be loving  
Every time I love again
