An El Paso hellhole I couldn't higher  
White lightning moonshine tastes like fire  
I drank for free till I couldn't see  
I fell on the floor, what I said is  
  
I'm blind in Texas, the lone star is hot tonight  
I'm blind in Texas, the cowboys have taken my eyes  
I drank Dallas whiskey and lost my mind  
Had high-balls in Houston, three for a dime  
Everything starts to spin, loaded on gin  
I fell out the door, what I said is  
  
I'm blind in Texas, the lone star is hot tonight  
I'm blind in Texas, the cowboys have taken my eyes  
  
San Antonio and the West Texas town El Paso  
Corpus Christi and Waco, the Yellow Rose is wild  
  
Hey dude, let's party  
Raisin hell in Austin just after sundown  
When the hoosegow police decided to come round-they said  
"Boy what's the matter with you, what you trying to do?"  
I looked at the man and I said  
  
I think I'll have another one  
We aint got no more  
What do ya mean you ain't got no more liquor?  
We aint got no more  
Go home what do ya mean go home?  
What am I supposed to do... get on a horse and ride back to LA  
The hell you say... suffer!  
  
I'm blind in Texas, the lone star is hot tonight  
I'm blind in Texas, I'm blind (Texas, texas, texas)
