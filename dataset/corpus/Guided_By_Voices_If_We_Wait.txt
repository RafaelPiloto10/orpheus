There's some food upon the table, boys  
And if you have ever seen me flying  
Then you know that I am weak  
And you are free to take me downstairs  
Away from cares  
I'll be with you in the morning, boys  
Cause you know that if we wait for our time  
We'll all be dead  
  
Oh now I'll bore you, crying my life away  
Don't I know it, always the things I say  
Always too far  
If you could be anything that you want to be,  
do you think that you would be who you see in the mirror?  
If I look long enough, my face would start to change  
If I look close enough, I'll take away the pain  
Oh I don't care anymore  
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
I'll be with you in the morning, boys  
Cause you know that if we wait  
For our time  
Then we'll be there
