Go  
Raised in Hell's infernal flame  
Raised to rule on earth  
Crucify the martyrs' soul  
To give the infant birth  
Hearts of Titans, powerful  
Fighting the good fight  
Lillith puts him to her breast  
And holds him in delight  
Raised in Hell, raised in Hell  
Raised in Hell, raised in Hell  
Go  
Raised in Hell by sorcery  
Raised with pride of sin  
Legions roar as churches fall  
My reign can now begin  
Souls of Saturn enter me  
The battle has begun  
Belphegor brings Mars and war  
To please his master's son  
Raised in Hell, raised in Hell  
Raised in Hell, raised in Hell  
Come on  
Go  
Raised in Hell's black magic  
Raised of demon seed  
Dying at the witching hour  
A virgin's soul for me  
Minds of magic conjugate  
The spells of potions purge  
Hold the black horse ready  
For the lord of this world  
Raised in Hell, raised in Hell  
Raised in Hell, raised in Hell
