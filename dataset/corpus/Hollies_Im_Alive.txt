Did you ever see a man with no heart  
Baby, that was me  
Just a lonely, lonely man with no heart  
Til you set me free  
  
Now I can breathe  
I can see  
I can touch  
I can feel  
  
I can taste all the sugar sweetness in your kiss  
You give me all the things I've ever missed  
I've never felt like this  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
I used to think I was living  
Baby, I was wrong  
No I never knew a thing about living  
Til you came along  
  
Now I can breathe  
I can see  
I can touch  
I can feel  
  
I can taste all the sugar sweetness in your kiss  
You give me all the things I've ever missed  
I've never felt like this  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
Now I can breathe  
I can see  
I can touch  
I can feel  
  
I can taste all the sugar sweetness in your kiss  
You give me all the love I've ever missed  
I've never felt like this  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
