Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I have not come, yeah  
To testify  
About our bad, bad misfortune  
And I ain't here a wond'rin' why  
But I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
  
I sat down and wrote you a long letter  
It was just the other day  
Said, sure as the sunrise, baby  
Tomorrow I'll be up and on my way  
But I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
Oh no  
  
Oh, but I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
Yes now baby  
  
But in the end, baby  
Long towards the end of your road  
Don't reach out for me, babe  
'Cause I'm not gonna carry your load  
But I'll live on and I'll be strong  
'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear  
Yeah, yeah
