Sidetracked down the middle  
Never saw it coming, what a surprise  
It's been a wonder  
Electricity tells a story  
  
It's a sound getting near as fear is watching you  
It's watching you close  
You can fight it, both arms swinging  
Or try to wash it away  
  
Or pay up to the echoes of 'okay'  
No more, no more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
  
You've schemed more than you have  
You've borrowed more than you know  
Better to steal the crumbs  
It makes it easier to go  
  
Paralyzed by conscience  
Looking for an opening  
Apathy as your vocal cords cut out  
Never thought once to ask how's the temperature  
  
Too busy with the finer points  
Of each struggle we're after  
No more, no more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
  
No more will I see you  
So long since I've seen you  
Haven't we both been living the high life  
It flows to the bottom  
  
No more, no more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
No more will I see you
