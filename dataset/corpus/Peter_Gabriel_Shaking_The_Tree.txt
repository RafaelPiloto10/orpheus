Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
  
Waiting your time, dreaming of a better life  
Waiting your time, you're more than just a wife  
You don't want to do what your mother has done  
She has done  
This is your life, this new life has begun  
It's your day - a woman's day  
It's your day - a woman's day  
  
Turning the tide, you are on the incoming wave  
Turning the tide, you know you are nobody's slave  
[ 1989 version - Find your Brothers and sisters ]  
[ 1990 version - Find your sisters and brothers ]  
Who can hear all the truth in what you say  
They can support you when you're on your way  
It's your day - a woman's day  
It's your day - a woman's day  
  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
  
[ extra lyrics from 1989 12" remix ]  
  
There's nothing to gain when there's nothing to be lost  
There's nothing to gain if you stay behind and count the cost  
Make the decision that you can be who you can be  
You can be  
Tasting the fruit come to the Liberty Tree  
It's your day - a woman's day  
It's your day - a woman's day  
  
[ end of extra lyrics from 12" remix ]  
  
Changing your ways, changing those surrounding you  
Changing your ways, more than any man can do  
Open your heart, show him the anger and pain, so you heal  
Maybe he's looking for his womanly side, let him feel  
  
You had to be so strong  
And you do nothing wrong  
Nothing wrong at all  
We're gonna to break it down  
We have to shake it down  
Shake it all around  
  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree
