Moonshine  
  
Taste her feel her  
Rising the west  
Hear the slack tormentor  
She's the best  
Warm me cool me  
You can take me day or night  
Be my inventor  
I won't fight  
  
Moonshine  
Forever I'm enchained  
Moonshine  
I can't think but crave  
  
Buy her, breed her  
Seeping though your skin  
Don't call no doctor  
She'll always win  
Anxious women  
Stareing at your soul  
She saw you coming  
Young or old  
  
Moonshine  
She commands the waves  
  
Moonshine  
Forever I'm her slave  
  
Bleed her, breed her  
She's yours to take  
Cross the palm with silver  
She'll awake  
Fire, water  
Goddess of men  
Take a drink of thunder  
And she'll say when  
  
Moonshine  
Foverer I'm enchained  
  
Moonshine  
Forever I'm her slave  
  
Moonshine  
Moonshine  
Moonshine  
Moonshine
