Impeccable peccadillo  
You are off your guard  
Pussy willow calls  
There by the church  
"Don't go in if you are  
Abnormally attracted to sin"  
Abnormally attracted to sin  
  
She may be dead to you  
But her hips sway a natural  
Kind of faith that could give  
Your lost heart a warm chapel  
You'll sleep in her bell tower  
And you will simply wake  
Abnormally attracted to sin  
Abnormally attracted to sin  
  
Impeccable peccadillo  
I know who you are  
Tales of longing sway  
Lost without a verse  
Hymns of swing lay low  
There by the church  
"Don't go in if you are  
Abnormally attracted to sin"  
Abnormally attracted to sin  
  
She may be dead to you  
Kind of faith that could give  
Attracted to sin  
To sin  
To sin
