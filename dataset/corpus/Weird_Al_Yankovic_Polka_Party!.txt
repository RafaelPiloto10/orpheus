You could have a big dipper  
Going up and down all around the bends  
You could have a bumper car bumping  
This amusement never ends  
I wanna be your sledgehammer

Oh, let me be your sledgehammer  
This will be my testimony, yeah, yeah

And my girl wants to party all the time  
Party all the time, party all the time  
My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time  
She parties all the time  
Say you, say me  
Say it for always, that's the way it should be  
Say you, say me  
Say it together naturally  
We're going riding on the freeway of love  
Wind's against our back  
We're going riding on the freeway of love  
In a big Cadillac  
That's why you need, ooh  
That's why this what you need, I'll give you what you need  
Yah, yah, yah, do the Harlem polka, everybody now  
Yah, yah, yah, do the Harlem polka

Please papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep  
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep  
But I've made up my mind I'm keeping my baby  
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby

Keep my baby

Keep my baby  
Hey
