Oh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine  
Kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall  
So lay it down, lay it down  
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes  
Let me hear you say you want it all  
Say it now, say it now  
  
Look what you doing, look what you done  
But in this jungle you can't run  
'Cause what I got for you  
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest  
Bang bang, gorilla  
  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, you and me baby making love like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, you and me baby making love like gorillas  
  
Yeah I got a fistful of your hair  
But you don't look like you're scared  
You're just smiling tell me daddy it's yours  
'Cause you know how I like it use a dirty little lover  
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff  
Call the swat we don't stop  
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door  
And you're screaming give it to me baby  
Give it to me motherfucker  
  
Oh look what you doing, look what you done  
But in this jungle you can't run  
'Cause what I got for you  
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest  
Bang bang, gorilla  
  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, you and me baby making love like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, you and me baby making love like gorillas  
  
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good  
I got your body trembling like it should, it should  
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you  
  
Oh you with me baby making love like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, you and me baby we'll be fuckin' it like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah  
You and me baby making love like gorillas
