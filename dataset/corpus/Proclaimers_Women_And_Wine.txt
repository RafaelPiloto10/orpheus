A hundred years ago  
I thought happiness was ice cream and football.  
But time went by so fast  
Till I couldn't see their attractions at all.  
I looked around for other pleasures.  
The old man had shown the way then.  
Just in time I found women and wine.  
  
I marvelled at the way that they united men  
For the working and middle and upper classes.  
You didn't need any brains  
Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies.  
I'm not basking in reflected glory  
But open any book and I think you'll find that  
The greatest men of all time  
Loved women and wine  
Or men and wine.  
  
Ah, they'll be the death of you  
If something else doesn't get you first.  
  
Well I'm older now  
And have to take my pleasures in moderation.  
Least that's what it says here in this guide to  
Declining years in declining nations.  
But just 'cause I've slowed up a bit  
Doesn't mean I can't cheer from the touchline.  
I hope sons of mine  
Spend lots of time  
On women and wine,  
Women and wine.
