We're running with the shadows of the night  
So baby take my hand, you'll be all right  
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight  
They'll come true in the end  
  
You said, "Oh girl, it's a cold world  
When you keep it all to yourself"  
I said, "You can't hide on the inside  
All the pain you've ever felt"  
Ransom my heart, but baby don't look back  
'Cause we got nobody else  
  
[Chorus]  
We're running with the shadows of the night  
So baby take my hand, it'll be all right  
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight  
They'll come true in the end  
  
You know that sometimes, it feels like  
It's all moving way too fast  
Use every alibi and words you deny  
That love ain't meant to last  
You can cry tough baby, it's all right  
You can let me down easy, but not tonight  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And now the hands of time are standin' still  
Midnight angel, won't you say you will  
  
[Chorus: x3]
