Going up to Alaska  
Up to the land of the midnight sun  
Where the whale and the polar bear run  
O'er the icy blue sea  
  
Going up to Alaska  
Up to the north and the pioneer life  
Where courage and strength still survive  
And a man can be free  
  
American Child, does the call of the wild  
Ever sing through the mist of your dreams  
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again  
When it's gone do you know what it means  
  
Can you picture the time when a man had to find  
His own way through the cold  
To come back again to all that you've been  
Can't you see that it's time to come home  
  
To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees  
And the earth who's the mother of all  
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade  
Will we rise with the vision or fall  
  
Going up to Alaska  
Up to the land of the midnight sun  
Where the whale and the polar bear run  
O'er the icy blue sea  
  
Going up to Alaska  
Up to the north and the pioneer life  
Where courage and strength still survive  
And a man can be free  
  
Men can be free  
Going up to Alaska  
Going up to Alaska  
Going up to Alaska
