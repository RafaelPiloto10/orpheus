[Chorus: ]  
You take me up, and than you take me down  
I hear my heart, it's such a lonely sound  
And I know my love is serious  
Can I trust your heart, you're dangerous  
The grass is greener, girl when I see you  
The sky is bluer, girl it's true  
But I know this love is serious  
Can I trust your heart, you're dangerous  
'Cause I, I want to kiss your lips tonight  
  
Why does it feels so good  
To be with you tonight  
'Cause no matter what I do, I do it just for you, my love  
Why does it feels so good  
If you are by my side  
'Cause no matter what I do it's only me an you  
'Cause it's  
One to make me crazy  
Two to be my baby  
Three you'll never let me go  
Oh it's  
Four you play with fire  
Five higher and higher  
Six and baby time will show  
  
Why does my heart, is beating just for you  
You promised on a secret rendevous  
And I know this love is serious  
Can I trust your heart, you're dangerous  
Maybe I'm weak, and you are strong  
But babe I know where my heart belongs
