Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely  
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely  
Each year you bring to me delight, meaning in the christmas night  
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely  
  
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging  
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging  
Your boughs are green, in summers glow and do not fade in winters snow  
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging  
  
Each year you bring to me delight, meaning in the Christmas night  
Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely
