I Will  
  
When life seems hopeless  
And you're all alone (all alone)  
And no-one's there to dry  
The teardrops from your eyes  
When you can't find a single reason left to try  
Baby I will (baby I will)  
Baby I will  
  
Tell me the secrets  
That you've locked away (locked away)  
Confide your deepest fears  
That haunt you every day  
All of the little things  
Nobody else could understand  
Baby I will (baby I will)  
I will  
  
It's alright  
I'll be there  
Count on me  
Anytime, anywhere  
I'll show you love  
'Till the end of my life  
When no-one else will stand by your side  
I will  
  
When all you've counted on  
Comes tumbling down (tumbling down, tumbling down)  
And there's only emptyness  
That nothing seems to fill  
And when you can't remember  
How to be strong  
Baby I will (baby I will)  
I will  
  
It's alright  
I'll be there  
Count on me  
Anytime, anywhere  
I'll show you love  
'Till the end of my life  
When no-one else will stand by your side  
I will  
  
When no-one else will stand by your side  
I will  
  
It's alright  
I'll be there  
Count on me  
Anytime, anywhere (anytime, anywhere)  
I'll show you love (I'll show you love)  
'Till the end of my life  
When no-one else will stand by your side  
  
I'll be standing right by your side  
I will
