She always takes it with a heart of stone  
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me  
I've spend a lifetime  
Looking for someone  
Don't try to understand me  
Just simply do the  
Things I say  
  
Love is a feeling  
Give it when I want it  
'Cause I'm on fire  
Quench my desire  
Give it when I want it  
Talk to me woman  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
  
You always knew just how to make me cry  
And never did I ask you questions why  
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me  
Don't try to understand me  
Because your words just aren't enough  
  
Love is a feeling  
Quench my desire  
Give it when I want it  
Takin' me higher  
Love is a woman  
I don't want to hear it  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
  
You and your friends  
Were laughing at me in town  
But it's okay  
And it's okay  
You won't be laughing girl  
When I'm not around  
I'll be okay  
And I'll, I'll not find  
Gotta, the peace of mind no  
  
Don't try to tell me  
Because your words  
Just aren't enough  
  
Love is a feeling  
Quench my desire  
Give it when I want it  
Takin' me higher  
Talk to me woman  
Love is a feeling  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
  
Love is the feeling  
I don't want to hear it  
Quench my desire  
Takin' me higher  
Tell it to the preacher  
Satisfy the feeling  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
  
I don't want to  
I don't want to  
I don't want to  
Hear it  
Give it to the fire  
Talk to me woman  
Quench my desire  
I don't like a lady  
Talk to me baby  
Give in to me  
  
Give in to the fire  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
  
Love is a woman  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
Give in to me  
  
'Cause I'm on fire  
Talk to me woman  
Quench my desire  
Give it to the feeling
