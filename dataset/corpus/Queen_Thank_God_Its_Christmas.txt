Oh my love we've had  
Our share of tears  
Oh my friends we've had  
Our hopes and fears  
Oh my friend it's been  
A long hard year  
But now it's Christmas  
Yes it's Christmas  
Thank God it's Christmas  
  
The moon and stars  
Seem awful cold and bright  
Let's hope the snow will  
Make this Christmas right  
  
My friend the world will share  
This special night  
Because it's Christmas  
Yes it's Christmas  
Thank God it's Christmas  
For one night  
Thank God it's Christmas  
Yeah thank God it's Christmas  
Thank God it's Christmas  
Can it be Christmas  
Let it be Christmas every day  
  
Oh my love we live  
In troubled days  
Oh my friend we have  
The strangest ways  
Oh my friends on this  
One day of days  
Thank God it's Christmas  
Yes it's Christmas  
Thank God it's Christmas  
For one day  
  
Thank God it's Christmas  
Yes it's Christmas  
Thank God it's Christmas  
Wooh yeah  
Thank God it's Christmas  
Yeah yeah yeah yes it's Christmas  
Thank God it's Christmas  
For one day yeah - Christmas  
  
A very merry Christmas to you all
