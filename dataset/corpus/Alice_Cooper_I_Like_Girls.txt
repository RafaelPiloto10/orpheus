I bought a Porsche  
And I'm leavin Grand Rapids  
Quit my job, quit my school  
Quit this place  
My mother cried  
My father was fried  
Hey, I've got no time, man  
I want to say goodbye to my babes  
I like girls  
  
I dumped on Sheila on Thursday  
I'll drop Melissa today  
I'll kiss some tears off of Donna  
Ask if she'll call on Shauna  
Amanda, and Sandra and Kay  
I like girls, I love 'em to death  
  
Hey Valentino! You going somewhere?  
You wouldn't sneak out on me, would you?  
What's that a blond hair?  
He must visualize himself an Errol Flynn  
  
I see myself a suave sophisticated lover  
I'll meet a rich hot old Hollywood dame  
You see, my ultimate goal  
Will be my life bein' told  
In a penthouse letter that I can frame  
And keep it all my life  
Girls, I love 'em, oh yeah  
  
New luggage? Did you say you were going  
Somewhere? Oh, just out for some fresh air  
Does she have a nice pair?  
  
He was swallowed alive by the freeway  
Turned into an ant on parade  
He bravely drove off that beast  
Aimed his car back to the east  
Why be a snack at home?  
I'm a feast, for the girls  
I like girls, I really like 'em  
  
Well,well,well.Look who's back. Run out of gas?  
Patty, I was just gonna call you. Look...  
I left Donna and Shauna  
And Katy and Carrie  
Melissa and Dena  
I just didn't have any use for 'em  
I just want you  
Really, no really, honest!
