A house with love in it is rich indeed  
Although there are a thousand things that house may need  
  
The carpet may be old, the room so plain and bare  
And yet it's beautiful somehow when love is living there  
  
A house with love in it just seems to bloom  
As though the month of may were filling every room  
  
So darling true the years with all my heart I'll pray  
A house with love in it is where we'll stay  
  
So darling true the years with all my heart I'll pray  
A house with love in it is where we'll stay.
