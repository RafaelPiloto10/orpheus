This little girl of mine  
I wanna say that she's so fine  
And each and every day  
I make sure she has her way  
Now we don't feel tied down  
Although our hearts are bound  
I don't have to chase her all over town  
My baby she's always around  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The girl's alright with me  
You know the girl's alright  
  
Now she's so good to me  
I guess that's why I feel fancy free  
Just to see the glow in her eyes  
Makes me once again realize  
I love her with all of my heart  
And I know we'll never ever part  
I never heard about or caught her playin'  
I guess that's why you always hear me sayin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When I visit at her home  
Other fellas never, never ring her phone  
She let's them know just where they stand  
She tells them all that I'm her man  
And when we're out on a date  
All the fellas wait till I walk away  
They try to beat my time  
She tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine  
  
[Chorus]
