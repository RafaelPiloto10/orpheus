Oh the heat is on, and my back's against the wall  
You know it's tough to be strong, in a world that makes you crawl  
I'm never gonna stop, I'm never gonna give up in the fight  
Cause after the battle is done, all you've got left is your pride  
  
I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
Here in the danger zone, it's a jagged edge we climb  
But if you take it like stone, and stand on your own  
You can make the grade in time  
I'm never gonna run, I'm never gonna tell myself a lie  
Cause after it's all said and done, I won't be wonderin' why  
And I'll know that under the gun, I am the one who's got the right to decide  
  
I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
And if you don't play my game I won't play, I'm gonna do it my way  
  
I'm never gonna run, I'm never gonna tell myself a lie  
Cause after it's all said and done, I've got the right to decide  
  
I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk my way  
I'm gonna go where I go, ain't takin' no my way  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna do it my way, yeah, I'm gonna do it my way
