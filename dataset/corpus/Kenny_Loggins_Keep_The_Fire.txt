There's a river in  
Evening ember glow  
And you're wishing you could see  
How far it flows  
Rolling on to an endless sea  
You'd be well on your way  
If you could only set sail.  
  
But dreams can drift away  
And sails can fill with doubt  
Where's your vision  
If the embers flicker out?  
Don't let it slip from view  
  
The horizons are waiting  
Your river is fading  
  
[Chorus:]  
So keep the fire burning tonight  
See just what comes into sight  
Don't take forever  
Take it through the night  
  
And believe the sun  
Will rise with the dawn  
That's all you need to go on  
But for tonight  
Just keep the fire burning bright  
  
I will never need to ask  
"What have I done?"  
Comes a moment when it's clear  
There's only one.  
Oh, whatever you need of me  
I've made up my mind  
I'll give you more than you've asked for  
  
And there are those who can foresee  
Where we will go  
All the future...  
I don't really want to know  
Only that you'll be here with me.  
  
While the embers still glow  
We'll be safe till tomorrow.
