Head on down the highway  
Across the county line,  
I've had my fill of small town thrills  
Gonna leave it all behind.  
  
Free flight, free flight.  
  
I'm careless in my loving,  
Shameless in my style,  
If I get caught by the short 'n curlies  
I'll just hide out for awhile.  
  
Free flight, free flight.  
  
On an' on the road goes on  
It'll go on forever,  
An' just the same I'll live my life,  
Hell bent for leather.  
  
Free flight, free flight.  
  
Heaven knows it's driving me crazy,  
It's a feeling inside.  
Heaven knows it's in my blood  
As long as I try, I just can't deny.  
  
Free flight, come tomorrow dawn you'll find me gone.  
Free flight, make no bones about it, I'm moving on.  
  
Free flight, free flight, free flight.  
Free flight, free flight, free flight.  
  
Head on down the highway  
Suitcase in your hand,  
When you get down with your feet on the ground  
I know you'll understand.  
  
Free flight, free flight.  
  
Heaven knows it's driving me crazy,  
It's a feeling that's driving me wild.  
Heaven knows it's in my blood,  
Fool if you try, you just can't deny.  
  
Free flight, come tomorrow dawn you'll find me gone.  
Free flight, make no bones about it, I'm moving on.  
  
Free flight, free flight, free flight
