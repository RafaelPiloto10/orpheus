Oh my Lord  
You sent your son to save us  
Oh my Lord  
Your very self you gave us  
Oh my Lord  
That sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more  
  
Oh my Lord  
When in the crib they found him  
Oh my Lord  
A golden halo crowned him  
Oh my Lord  
They gathered all around him  
To see him and adore  
  
(This day will live forever)  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
They had become to doubt you  
Oh my Lord (He is the truth forever)  
What did they know about you  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
But they were lost without you  
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)  
  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
With the child's adoration  
Oh my lord (He is a personation)  
There came great jubilation  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
And full of admiration  
They realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)  
  
Oh my Lord (Oh praise the Lord)  
You sent your son to save us  
Oh my Lord (This day will live forever)  
Your very self you gave us  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
That sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more
