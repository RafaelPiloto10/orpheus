Got a surprise from my honey  
Got a message from my girl  
When she picked up a pen from beside her bed  
And wrote me a scribbled note  
  
Said she'd be coming back to see me  
That she would be visiting real soon  
Gonna get up from her long white bed  
And leave this cold white room  
  
We would once more live together  
Go out on a lovin' spree  
Just like before the accident  
My baby would look at me  
  
I saw her sweet face trembling  
As she tried to open her eyes  
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy  
The day my baby gave me a surprise

As she tried to open her eyes  
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy  
The day my baby gave me a surprise
