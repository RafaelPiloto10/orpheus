We're just goin' through the motions  
Of the parts we've learned to play  
Never quite together like before  
But somehow darlin' something good  
Got lost along the way  
And our song ain't nothing  
Special anymore  
  
Let's try it one more time  
With feeling darlin', take it from the top  
Let me feel those tears a fallin' babe  
I don't want to miss a single drop  
Darlin' make believe your makin'  
Me believe each word you say  
Try it once more with feeling  
And we'll call it a day  
  
Ah you're reachin' out to touch me  
Darlin' just the way you used to do  
An you're lookin' everywhere but  
In my eyes  
Well that's an oldy but it's a goody babe  
But them words ain't ringin' true  
And you don't seem very sure of your life  
  
So try it one more time with feeling  
Darlin' take it from the top  
This one is the big one baby so give  
It everything you got  
Darlin' make believe your makin' me  
Believe each word you say  
Let's try it once more with feeling  
And we'll call it a day
