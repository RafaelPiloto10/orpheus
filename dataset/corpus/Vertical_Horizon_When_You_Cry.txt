Heaven knows you're with me now  
Heaven knows that you're here  
I feel your breath all around me now  
And all the pain just disappears  
It goes away, it goes away  
  
And it only hurts, when you cry  
I'm alone inside, when there's tears in your eyes  
I can't hide and say I'm fine  
But it only hurts, when you cry  
  
You carry too much on your shoulders  
I can't wait till you let me down  
Cause the only thing we're getting is older  
This time never comes back around  
You just gave it, gave it away  
  
And it only hurts, when you cry  
I'm alone inside, when there's tears in your eyes  
I can't hide and say I'm fine  
But it only hurts, when you cry  
When you cry  
  
Heaven knows you're with me now  
And I'll do my best to hold on  
Cause nothing is worth all this fighting now  
And I won't give up till it's gone  
Make it go away, go away  
Make it go away, go away  
  
Cause it only hurts, when you cry  
I'm alone inside, when there's tears in your eyes  
I can't hide and say I'm fine  
But it only hurts, when you cry
