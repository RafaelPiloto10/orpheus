There may be trouble ahead,  
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,  
Let's face the music and dance.  
  
Before the fiddlers have fled,  
Before they ask us to pay the bill,  
And while we still have the chance,  
Let's face the music and dance.  
  
Soon, we'll be without the moon,  
Humming a different toon,  
And then, there may be tear drops to shed.  
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,  
Let's face the music and dance.  
Let's face the music and dance,  
  
Soon, we'll be without the moon,  
Humming a different toon,  
And then, there may be tear drops to shed.  
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,  
Let's face the music and dance,  
Let's face the music and dance.
