I thought you'd come back  
At least I prayed (so I prayed)  
The romance has been dead for years  
But I've been too afraid  
To dig the grave (so I prayed)  
Relief, support, never came  
  
Memories carry me through the days  
Of when we were kids  
And angels came to watch us play  
  
Close my eyes  
Just for tonight  
The sun still sleeps  
And when she wakes  
  
A movie that plays in my mind  
Remembering you helps me survive  
Every day a re-run of the next  
I promised to stay by your side  
That all would change  
I can't complain  
Another victim of the game  
  
Close my eyes  
Just for tonight  
The sun still sleeps  
And when she wakes  
  
Maybe love will find us again  
For there is always tomorrow  
Sincerely 'til the end  
  
Close my eyes  
Just for tonight  
The sun still sleeps  
And when she wakes  
You'll be a memory
