I spend the night in a chair thinkin' she'll be there but she never comes  
And then I wake up and wiped the sleep from my eyes  
And I rise to face another day without her  
  
It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door of an empty room  
And then you go inside and sat at the table for one  
It's no fun when you spend the day without her  
We burst the pretty baloon it took us to the Moon  
Such a beautiful thing bit it's ended now  
But it sounds like a lie if I say I'd rather die than live without her

I spend the night in a chair...
