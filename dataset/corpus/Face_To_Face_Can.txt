I think it's starting again  
The same thing that happens when  
I'm sure what I'm thinking about is right  
But I don't know anything  
The inhibitions decline  
Decided to make up my mind  
I'm sure what I'm thinking is right  
But I don't know anything  
  
So why are you loking to me for the answers?  
It's only the truth if you want to believe in it  
  
Everyone wants to live another life  
So many aspirations have been placed upon you  
Everyone wants to live another life  
So many aspirations have been placed upon you  
  
I'm not sure where to begin  
I've taken a lot on the chin  
And everyone else seems to win  
And I don't have anything  
  
Convinced that this is what you want  
Are you really sure you know it all?  
So willing to trust in anyone  
Confused by what they call the truth  
The only thing you know for sure  
Is you don't trust a single thing about yourself  
So who am I to decide?  
I've tried my best and I've tried
