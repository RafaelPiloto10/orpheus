  
Oh here I sit with my first glass of whiskey  
Wondering where I went wrong  
How I wish she was still right here with me  
I long to hear all those old country songs  
  
Like old Hank Williams when he'd sing about lonesome  
And Hag about misery and gin  
If the jukebox would play Patsy's 'Crazy'  
Then I could let this new heartache begin  
  
The band just quit and the lovers are leaving  
And the bartender said it's closing time  
Oh I wonder if she's having trouble sleeping  
And if those songs keep on runnin' through her mind  
  
Like 'Crazy Arms' and 'A-11'  
The 'Lovers Blues' we're 'Together Again'  
Why baby, why must you and 'I Fall To Pieces'  
It's time to let this new heartache begin  
Why baby, why must you and 'I Fall To Pieces'  
It's time to let this new heartache begin
