All my life-time plans,  
I got em in my hands.  
Balancing my fate upon a wire.  
Got to let it go.  
Everywhere I turn I see  
There's nowhere left to go.  
All my dreams are far,  
Too much for me to hold.  
Still I hate to drop them,  
Weren't they from you?  
What did I do?  
  
You are the one that can see,  
Into the heart of me.  
Am I really giving up tomorrow?  
Got, got, got to let it go.  
This is gonna hurt a little,  
Still its right I know.  
Got to let it --  
Even though I fear  
Too much of me might show,  
I cant wait any longer for it,  
I've had enough!  
Ill give it up!  
  
Lord, here's my heart,  
I've been keeping it from you,  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go,  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Go to let it, got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!  
  
Holding on too tight,  
Where do I lose sight?  
Wheres the lamb that seems to bring frustration,  
Go to let it go.  
The best of dreams can turn to nightmares,  
When my heart takes hold.  
How long must I learn?  
This lessons getting old,  
I've got to catch a clearer vision,  
I'm in your hands!  
You're in command!  
  
Lord, here's my heart (here's my heart, here's my heart)  
I've been keeping it (keeping it, keeping it) from you!  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go.  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Oh, I've got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!  
  
Lord, here's my heart (here's my heart, here's my heart)  
I've been keeping it (keeping it, keeping it) from you!  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go.  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Oh, I've got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!  
  
Lord, here's my heart (here's my heart, here's my heart)  
I've been keeping it (keeping it, keeping it) from you!  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go.  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Oh, I've got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!
