It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished 'em well  
You could see that pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle.  
And the young monsieur and madame  
Have rung the chapel bell,  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They furnished off an apartment  
With a two room roebuck sale  
The coolerator was filled  
With t.v. dinners and ginger ale  
But when pierre found work,  
The little money comin' worked out well  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They had a hi-fi phono  
Boy, did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records  
All rock, rhythm and jazz  
But when the sun went down  
The rapid tempo of the music fell  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They bought a souped up jitney  
'twas a cherry in fifty-three  
They drove it down to new orleans  
To celebrate their anniversary.  
It was there where pierre was wedded  
To the lovely mademoiselle,  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished 'em well  
You could see that pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle.  
And the young monsieur and madame  
Have rung the chapel bell,  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell
