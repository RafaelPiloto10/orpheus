Floating along in the middle of the sea  
That's what it feels like  
Two weeks later and you're still not talking to me  
We could be using that to make up  
But lately you don't even seem to care  
So let me try this again  
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've did  
Why can't we just get over it  
  
This ain't right  
We're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Stupid fight  
Baby girl we're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Staying made at me for eternity  
What's that gonna fix  
So baby can we try  
Cause what we've got is so much bigger than this  
  
Now baby normally we don't stay mad for too long  
We would break up just to make up cause it felt long  
Girl I miss you intensely  
So can we  
It's a love hate kinda thing  
With us baby  
Girl I'm sorry for the wrong that I've did  
Why can't we just get over it  
  
This ain't right  
We're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Stupid fight  
Baby girl we're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Staying made at me for eternity  
What's that gonna fix  
So baby can we try  
Cause what we've got is so much bigger than this
