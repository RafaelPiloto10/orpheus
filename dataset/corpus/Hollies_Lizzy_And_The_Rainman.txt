He came riding in on a sunrise  
A hot west Texas day  
A fancy man in a painted wagon  
Some fancy things to say  
Looks like you folks'll need some water  
Well water is my game  
For the small price of a hundred dollars  
I bet you I can make it rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone start a fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain  
They all just stood a staring trying to believe  
But there was one named Lizzy Cooper said he was a lying cheat  
She said you call yourself a rainman, well you oughta be ashamed  
For starting all these people dreaming thinking you can make it rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain  
Oh Lizzy, a man's gotta have a dream  
And if you can walk on the inside with me  
I'll meet you in between  
Come with me Lizzy  
And the stars'll write your name  
And if you still think I'm lying to you  
Look yonder here comes the rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain
