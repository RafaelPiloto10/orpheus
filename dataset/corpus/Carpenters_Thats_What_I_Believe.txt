There's always one of the girls that all  
  
The guys dream about  
  
And you hold her in your heart  
  
Imagining how you'll work it out  
  
So you meet her ev'ry place you can devise  
  
'Cause from the start you knew  
  
The one she wants is you  
  
  
  
I know it's right when it comes as easy  
  
As apple pie  
  
When you just can't do it wrong  
  
She's going for ev'rything you try  
  
If she chose you over all those other guys  
  
It must be luck or simply fate  
  
But it's sure worth the wait  
  
  
  
That's the way I feel about it  
And there's no one who should ever doubt it  
You can't stop a star  
When love is on the rise  
  
  
  
That's what I believe  
  
Love could be 'round the corner  
  
All you've got to do is dream  
  
And never compromise  
  
That's what I believe  
  
  
  
I found the world in my arms the moment  
  
I lost my heart  
  
And the bond is much too strong for  
  
Anyone else to put apart  
  
So I cherish ev'ry moment that she's near  
  
You see the best things in your lives  
  
If you just close your eyes  
  
  
  
That's the way I feel about it  
  
And she maybe out there  
  
Waiting just like you  
  
'Cause at the strangest time and place  
  
You'll find you're face to face  
  
That's the way I feel about it
