I wish I'd had the time to look into your eyes  
And quietly say the words  
The words that you'd expect  
I wish I'd touched your face  
And you would hold my hand  
Then tears were on our guard  
And silence was our friend  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
I dreamt I had the time to listen what you'd say  
And what you'd say was true and we could start anew  
I saw u bachstage in that chair  
Dressed up in lies but oh so fair  
And then I took you by the hand and off we went  
And we just drank to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do  
And all the poems that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memory to behold without explanations...  
And we just drink to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too without explanations..  
To be told.
