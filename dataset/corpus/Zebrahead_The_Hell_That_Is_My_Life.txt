I.  
I look but never touch  
She says I drink too much  
I only care about myself, sex, and the couch  
You.  
You light up my whole day  
Whenever you're away.  
I'd love to say I've got you figured out. No way  
  
If I get my hands on you, I would make you do all the things I want you to  
And bend your will to mine, never hear you whine  
Everybody break out, it's enough to shout, it's enough to shout, it's enough,
yeah it's enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's callin', we're brawlin'  
This is the hell that is my life  
I'm laughing, she's crying  
This is the hell that is my, hell that is my life  
  
I.  
I feel the world revolves around me  
I take my one way street.  
I only have one serious bone in my body  
You.  
You say you're not amused  
You love to hate me too  
You claim you wish you never got my name tattooed  
  
Now you got your hands on me  
And you can make me be, what you want me to be  
And slash away my will, still you're my only thrill  
Everybody break out, it's enough to shout,  
It's enough to shout, it's enough, yeah it's enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You.  
You say you're not amused  
You love to hate me too  
And now you tell your friends we're through, and never screwed  
  
I can take you so much more  
And you've got so much more in store  
So when you say your mom don't like me, I say that your mom's a whore  
Then you call me selfish pig and something small turns into something big  
The more you shovel the more I dig.  
The more you shovel and the more I dig  
  
She calls, we talk, I scream, she cries  
This is the hell that is my life  
She calls, we talk, I laugh, she tries  
This is the hell that is my.  
  
[Chorus:]
