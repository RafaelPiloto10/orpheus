When sand's close at hand  
And the sea is touching me,  
I feel much happier  
Than I've ever felt. and a long time goes by  
And I'm floating in the sky.  
And I wish you could be,  
Wish you could be here.  
  
And if you're free, follow me  
Throw a pebble in my sea.  
The sun will wrap you up  
In a pool of gold, and lights in the night  
In the night reaching neon waves of sight.  
  
But  
I wish you could be,  
Wish you could be,  
Wish you could be here.  
  
The sun, the sand, the sea are waiting  
On the corner. Take a trip out here.  
Hustle, bustle, shove and fuss  
Will greet you if you stay there.  
I'm without a care.  
  
Fresh fruit and sea fish,  
Are in abundance here.  
But they don't allow  
The natives at your door  
Selling booze  
Smuggled from another shore.  
  
And
