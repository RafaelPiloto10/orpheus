I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet  
They're gonna knock me off of my feet  
A lot of kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got 'em  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
"I hope you're feeling better"  
And close with love, the way that you do  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe that it came from you  
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet, yeah!  
  
Lotta kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got 'em  
I'm gonna smile and say  
"I hope you're feeling better"  
And close with love, the way that you do  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you...  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came  
Make believe that it came from you!
