If you believe  
Within your heart  
You'll know that no one can change  
The path that you must go  
Believe what you feel  
And know you're right because  
The time will come around  
When you'll say it's yours  
  
Believe that you can go home  
Believe you can float on air  
Then click your heels three times  
If you believe  
Then you'll be there  
That's why i want you to  
Believe in yourself  
Right from the start  
Believe in the magic  
Right there in your heart  
Go ahead believe all these things  
Not because i told you to  
But believe in yourself  
If you believe in yourself  
Just believe in yourself  
As i believe in you
