I was born in the Southland! Twenty some odd years ago.  
Now I ran away for the first time when I was about four years old.  
I'm a free born man. My home is on my back.  
Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile
from a railroad track.  
I got a gal in Cincinatti, got a woman in San Antone.  
But I always love that girl next door and any ole place is home.  
I'm a free born man. My home is on my back.  
Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile
from a railroad track.  
I've got me a worn out guitar. I carry an ole tote sack.  
I've hocked it about two-hundred times but I always get it back.  
I'm a free born man. My home is on my back.  
Now I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from
a railroad track.  
You May not like my appearance. You may not like my song,  
You might not like the way I am but you sure like the way I'm gone  
I'm a free born man. My home is on my back.  
Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile
from a railroad track.
