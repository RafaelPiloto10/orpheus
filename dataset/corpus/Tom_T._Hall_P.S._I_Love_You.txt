Dear, I thought I drop a line  
The weather is cool, the folks are fine  
I'm in bed each night at nine  
P.S. I love you  
Yesterday we had some rain  
But all in all, I can't complain  
Was it dusty on the train  
P.S. I love you  
Write to the Brown's just as soon as you're able  
They came around to call  
I burned a hole in the dining room table  
And let me see, I guess that's all.  
Nothing else for me to say  
And so I'll close, but by the way  
Everybody's thinking of you  
P.S. I love you  
Nothing else for me to say
