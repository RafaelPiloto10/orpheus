I'd say that I don't worry  
And our parting brought no pain  
I'd say that I'd be happy  
If we'd never meet again  
  
About the time I get 'em fooled  
And think I'm really smart  
I realize that I can't hide  
My cryin' baby heart  
  
Cry baby heart  
I wished you were at home  
So I could really laugh and say  
I'm better off alone  
  
But like an actor cannot play  
I fumble through my part  
I realize that I can't hide  
My cry baby heart
