Speak to the sinners  
Is it a crime for  
Stopping the innocent  
Rotting all away  
Rotting all away  
  
Have you forgotten  
All that I live for  
Hardened forever  
You will always be the same  
Always be the same  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Angels visit me and feed me lies (time)  
To the end of my life  
I'll ask you why, why why  
Tell me why  
  
You miss somebody  
Is it the same for  
Sorry for everything  
I thought I'd given you  
Thought I'd given you  
  
Trapped in the cavern  
Is it a shame for  
Endlessly searching  
For the force behind the wall  
The force behind the wall  
  
(I.. Cant)  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Angels visit me and feed me lies (time)  
To the end of my life  
I'll ask you why, why why  
Tell me why  
  
(My, Friend, This is what you...)
