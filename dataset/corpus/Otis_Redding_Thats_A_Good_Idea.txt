You make me wanna just dance and sing  
You make me feel like I'm a natural man  
You tell me when you want to come and go  
Make me say I want a little bit more, listen  
  
What you want  
How you want  
When you want  
Every time you want it  
That's a good idea  
Yes it is, babe  
It's a good idea  
  
Let me tell you somethin', now  
You make me spend my money  
That's a fact yes it is now, huh  
You little girl you show me where I'm at  
Yes you do mama now  
  
Won't you kick of your shoe little mama  
Throw 'em on the floor now baby  
Kick off your shoe little honey  
Throw 'em on your daddy's table  
  
Cause  
What you want  
How you want  
When you want  
Every time you want it  
That's a good idea  
Yes it is, babe  
Real groovy idea  
  
Let me tell you, huh, huh, huh  
You just pretty as a movie star  
So sweet as a chocolate candy bar  
Let me tell you somethin'  
  
Won't you kick of your shoe little mama  
Throw 'em on the floor now baby  
Kick off your shoe little honey  
Throw 'em on your daddy's table  
  
Cause  
What you want  
How you want  
When you want  
Every time you want it  
It's a good idea  
Yes it is, babe  
Real groovy idea  
  
If you wanna go to the movie  
It's a good idea  
Downtown, shoppin'  
It's a good idea  
If you wanna go to the drugstore  
It's a groovy idea  
If you wanna make love
