Rain (rain falling always falling)  
Pain (pain hurting never ending)  
Tear (here comes tears of sorrow)  
Fear (fear of today, tomorrow)  
Cry (cry when there's no use crying)  
Goodbye(goodbye there's no use trying)  
It all runs together when your love ones are gone  
And your head spins in circles and you're lyin' with your face down in the
rain  
Salvation army band playin' in their all night stand  
Rain pourin' from the sky blind people passin' by  
No one will help 'em now no one will even try  
It all runs together...  
This is his time at last (this is his time) his life is fading fast  
His faith is fled away (his faith is gone) he tries but cannot pray  
This is the way we live (this is the way) we take and never give  
It all runs together...  
Rain falling always falling...  
Someone could have helped him but no one would try  
Cause their pride wouldn't let them and now he's gonna die there in the rain  
Shall we gather at the rain (shall we gather at the river)
