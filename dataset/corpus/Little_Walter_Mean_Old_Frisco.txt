Well, that mean old, mean old Frisco  
And that low down Santa Fe  
Yes, that mean old Frisco  
Low down Santa Fe  
Gone took my babe away  
Yes, and blow smoke out to me  
Well, my mother, she done told me  
And my father told me too  
Yes, my mother she done told me  
Father told me too  
Son, every woman grins in your face  
Well, she ain't no friend of you  
Lord, I wonder  
Will she ever think of me  
Lord, I wonder  
Will my baby think of me  
Yes, I wonder, I wonder  
Will my baby think of me  
Lord, I ain't got no  
Special rider here  
Lord, I ain't got no  
Special rider here  
I'm gonna leave  
'Cause I don't feel welcome here
