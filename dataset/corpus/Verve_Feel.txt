This darkness cooled my light  
We move to different sides  
I poured the guilt right over my eyes  
As I rose to greet the sky  
  
I've never felt this before  
See you dead on the floor  
I can't recall a single day  
That's gonna make this pain slip away  
  
My senses have been so cold  
Didn't know how to feel or hold  
For a second I felt something in you  
For a second I believed in you  
  
And I want to know  
And I want to be  
And I want to feel  
  
And I want to know  
And I want to be  
And I want to feel  
  
And I want to know  
And I want to be  
And I want to feel  
  
And I want to know  
And I want to be  
And I want to feel  
  
We could, my friend  
We can  
We could, my friend  
We can  
We should not end  
I want to be part of...  
  
And I want to know  
And I want to be  
And I want to feel
