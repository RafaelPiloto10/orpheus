Two drifters on the morning sky,  
Two drifters sailing wide and high,  
When summer breezes blow across your mind  
With you, I will walk the line.  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  
People walking hand in hand  
Everybody's singing to the band  
I want to be where the stars shine bright  
And hear sweet music on a summer night  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  
Sundowners we'll go on and on  
We'll find the land of the midnight sun  
And when you look you'll see for miles around  
You'll see the world is in your hand.  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine
