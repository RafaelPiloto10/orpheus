London traffic (state of confusion)  
London traffic (blocking the streets)  
London traffic (going nowhere)  
London traffic (polluting the air)  
Drive round London in a car  
Don't really want to go far  
So many cars fill the streets  
Wonder why we bother at all  
London traffic is a problem  
London traffic too many cars  
One way systems look very neat  
Coloured signs direct the streets  
No one knows the answer  
No one seems to care  
Take a look at our city  
Take the traffic elsewhere  
Leave the city free from traffic  
Give the place a chance to survive  
Dirt and filth cover London  
Give it a chance to breath again
