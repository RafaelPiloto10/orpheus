Some folks like to get away,  
Take a holiday from the neighborhood.  
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood.  
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
  
I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines.  
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens.  
I know what I'm needin', and I don't want to waste more time.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
  
It was so easy livin' day by day  
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues  
But now I need a little give and take  
The New York Times, the Daily News.  
  
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide.  
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside.  
I don't have any reasons.  
I left them all behind.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
Oh yeah.  
  
It was so easy living day by day  
Out of touch with the rhythym and blues  
But now I need a little give and take  
The New York Times, the Daily News.  
Who, oh, oh whoa who.  
  
It comes down to reality, and it's fine with me cause I've let it slide.  
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside.  
I don't have any reasons.  
I left them all behind.  
I'm in a New York state of mind.  
  
I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line.  
Cause I'm in a, I'm in a New York state of mind.
