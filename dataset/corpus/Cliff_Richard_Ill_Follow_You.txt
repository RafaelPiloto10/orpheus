Why do we try so hard  
What makes us give our all  
And why do we aspire  
To reach the height  
When we're not ready  
To take the fall  
  
What makes us so unkind  
  
And why must we desire  
And take what we want  
Why must we be the  
Only ones who receive  
  
Lord won't you take me  
Take me and break me  
Burn me with your fire  
Our love that will take me  
Take me and make me  
I'll be  
I will follow you  
  
Why is it that now I'm yours  
Everything seems so bright  
And why is it now I can  
Live for each day  
Without any fear of the night  
  
Lord since I met you  
I can't get you  
Out of my head  
My life was so lonely  
Cos I was only  
Living for myself  
Our love  
I will follow you  
  
Chorus  
  
I'll follow you  
My days are right  
I'll follow you  
It seems so right  
I'll follow you  
Bad days are gone  
I'll follow you
