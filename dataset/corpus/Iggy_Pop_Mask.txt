You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
You look better that way  
You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
You look better that way  
Are you my friend?  
Are you my plumber?  
Are you my God?  
What do you do?  
Wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
Which mask are you?  
Which mask are you?  
Complicated crushed up disappointed squirming angry thrusting stabbing
regretting starving greedy human alien being, struggling down the street, up
the alley, in the elevator, through the party, to the office, in the bedroom,
on your way to the morgue. Bullshitting, lying, doing a good deed or feeling
loved barely possible. Aware of insatiable demands of not a society all around
you. Chunky frat boys in their shorts, pimps with old semite eyes, sex
hoochies of the jungle, sensitive smart alec college graduates, critics
fronting franticly in New York city, every body in L.A just plain licking ass
or having it licked, irony in place of balls, balls in place of brains, brains
in place of soul, where is the soul?, where is the love?, where am I?  
Which mask are you?  
Which mask are you?  
Which mask are you?  
You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
You're wearing a mask  
Which mask are you?
