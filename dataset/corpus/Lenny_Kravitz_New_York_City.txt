[Verse:]  
Broadway lights and taxi cabs  
Everybody's movin' fast  
Uptown, Downtown, what's ya thang?!  
She can't take what she can't bring  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
She gave me a life, came up through the inner city  
She raised me up and taught me to fight, yeah!  
She opened my mind, I got to the knitty gritty  
The greatest time that you'll eva find  
  
[Chorus:]  
She is my heart, I love New York City  
She's lived and died so many times, yeah  
Life is always tough on New York City, hold on!  
But she is fine, she always survives, yeah  
  
[Verse 2:]  
She's a queen that stands her ground  
Nobody can take her down  
Good times, bad times, she can swang  
And did anyone a thang  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
She is a rock as we pull but she is steady  
And no one can take her freedom away, yeah  
You see, I love her style whether she is clean or dirt-aey  
She's the greatest town that you'll eva find, yeah!  
  
[Chorus:]  
She is my heart, I love New York City  
She's lived and died so many times, yeah  
Life is always tough on New York City, hold on!  
But she is fine, she always survives, yeah  
  
(Bridge x2)  
She is my heart, I love New York City  
She's lived and died so many times, yeah  
Life is always tough on New York City, hold on!  
But she is fine, she always survives, yeah  
Let's have it for ny City!  
  
[Chorus:]  
She is my heart, I love New York City  
She's lived and died so many times, yeah  
Life is always tough on New York City, hold on!  
But she is fine, she always survives, yeah
