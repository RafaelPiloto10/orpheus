You know that I'm the coolest that's ever come around  
You'll notice things get hotter whenever I'm in town  
I mean, I gotta be the coolest, who else could it be?  
Everybody knows who's really cool  
Me  
  
Let's face it, I'm the greatest, I'm Mr. Number One  
My hometown built a statue to their favorite son  
I mean I gotta be the greatest  
I'm just a ball of fun  
I mean I'm definitely the greatest  
I'm also the coolest  
  
You can't leave a package like me sitting on no shelf  
Let me tell you I'm so cool sonny  
I'm gonna save a little for myself  
  
Yeah baby, come over here a minute  
Who is the coolest?  
I mean how do I look?  
Yeah  
  
You can't leave a package like me sitting on no shelf  
Let me tell you I'm so cool sonny  
I'm gonna save a little for myself  
  
You know the day I was born there were these four dudes up on a hill  
They said they saw this star hanging out over town  
And the whole world seemed to stand still  
It made the Sunday papers  
I guess it proves for sure  
I am the coolest  
I am the greatest  
I am the baddest  
I am the smoothest  
I'm just the best  
Sand dancer come on  
Ah yeah  
  
Right
