[Chorus:]  
Do you know  
How I feel  
When you change your mind?  
Make me see  
What they said  
Would come true in time?  
Too late now  
I won't wait  
Wish I'd take it back  
So far you're not the same anymore  
  
Here's a tip, I'll make it easy  
No more you or I'll go crazy  
Stop - you made it lazy  
No it doesn't phase me  
I don't want to be your running mate  
I don't want to be with you anyway  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It doesn't register as clearly  
As you thought I'd make it easy  
Pushing time and pressing feelings  
I don't know what you've been hearing.  
I don't want to be your running mate  
I don't want to be with you anyway  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Do you know  
How I feel  
When you put your hands  
On down to the small  
Of my back  
Do you know (Do you know)  
Do you know how it feels  
When you put your heart  
In the scar in the floor  
Do you know (Do you know)  
Do you know (Do you know)  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
  
[Chorus:]
