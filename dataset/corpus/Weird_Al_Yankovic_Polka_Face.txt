Mum mum mum mum  
Mum mum mum muh  
Oh whoa oh oh oh

No, he can't read-a my polka face  
(She's got to love nobody)  
Can't read my, can't read my  
No he can't read-a my polka face  
(She's got to love nobody)  
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face (Mum mum mum muh)  
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face  
  
Hey!  
  
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer  
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby  
You-yuh-You are  
You-yuh-You are  
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer  
(Womanizer)  
  
Boy don't try to front  
(I-I) I know just what you are (are-are)  
Boy don't try to front  
(I-I) I know just what you are (are-are)  
  
You say I'm crazy  
I've got your crazy  
You're nothing but a  
Womanizer  
  
You spin my head right round, right round  
When you go down, when you go down, down  
You spin my head right round, right round  
When you go down, when you go down  
  
Hey!  
  
Day and night  
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night  
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)  
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now  
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now  
  
And I was like baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
I thought you'd always be mine  
  
So, so what, I'm still a rock star  
I got my rock moves and I don't need you  
And guess what, I'm havin' more fun  
And now that we're done, I'm gonna show you tonight  
I'm alright, I'm just fine and you're a tool  
So, so what, I am a rock star  
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight  
  
I kissed a girl and I liked it, the taste of her cherry chap stick  
I kissed a girl just to try it, I hope my boyfriend don't mind it  
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I'm in love tonight  
I kissed a girl and I liked it  
I liked it  
  
And I'd like to make myself believe  
That planet Earth turns slowly  
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay  
Awake when I'm asleep  
'Cause everything is never as it seems  
  
Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose  
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in the zone  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
Blame it on the vodka, (HEY!)  
Blame it on the henny (HEY!)  
Blame it on the blue tap, (HEY!)  
Got you feeling dizzy (HEY!)  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
  
Shawty's like a melody in my head  
That I can't keep out  
Got me singin' like  
Na na na na everyday  
It's like my iPod stuck on replay,  
Stuck on replay  
Stuck on replay  
Replay  
Replay  
Replay-ay-ay-ay  
  
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?  
Baby are you down?  
  
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart  
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart  
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart  
I'm only gonna break your heart  
  
Don't stop  
Make it pop  
DJ blow my speakers up  
Tonight  
I'mma fight  
Till we see the sun light  
Tick tock  
On the clock  
But the polka dont stop, (NO!)  
Yodel-yodel-lady-hoo  
Yodel-yodel-lady-hoo  
  
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face  
(Mum mum mum mah)  
P-p-p-polka face p-p-polka face  
Oh no you can't read my  
P-p-polka face  
Talkin' 'bout my polka face  
P-p-p-polka face
