If you keep on playin' around  
You gonna lose me, oh baby  
Don't lose your good thing now  
  
Now listen, you better wake up  
You better settle down, don't lose it  
Don't lose your good thing now  
  
I tried, I tried to please you  
Oh, in everything I do  
'Cause I want you  
  
Ooh, hey love, Lord knows I need you  
Ooh, ooh honey, Lord so bad  
Ooh, so bad, ooh  
  
I'll always love you  
No matter what you do  
Ooh, I'm beggin', beggin' you  
Don't lose your good thing now  
  
Ooh, someday you just might need me  
And I won't be around  
Ooh, oh darling, oh baby  
Don't lose your good thing now  
  
Oh, I'm just, I'm just a fool now  
To keep on, to keep on lovin' you now  
Oh, but I want you  
  
Ooh Lord, ooh honey, now  
I need, I need you, ooh yeah  
Ooh honey, so bad, bad now  
Bad, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
If you keep on playin' around  
You don't miss your water till your well runs dry  
Please, please honey  
Don't lose your good thing now
