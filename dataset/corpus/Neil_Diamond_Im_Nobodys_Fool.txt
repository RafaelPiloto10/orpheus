I know your kind, you pick a girl (guy)  
Then change your mind and have a whirl  
Now the gals (guys) that you've kissed say  
I'm next on your list, uh, uh, baby....  
I'm nobody's fool  
  
You had you're fun by telling lies  
And now you've come to claim this prize  
Uh, uh baby  
I'm nobody's fool  
  
I've heard your ev'ry lie  
Dear, it's the same old tune  
Don't even waste your time here  
Baby, I'm immune  
  
Just turn around, be on your way  
Don't hang around it doesn't pay  
Cause I won't take a chance  
On a one way romance  
Uh, uh baby  
I'm nobody's fool
