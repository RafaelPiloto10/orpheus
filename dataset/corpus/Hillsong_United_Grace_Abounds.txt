[Verse:]  
You lay aside Your throne  
And to this world  
You have come  
  
You offered up Your life  
The debt You paid  
Was not Yours  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
[Verse 2:]  
A gift I could not earn  
Your open arms  
Are undeserved  
  
Enabled by Your grace  
Now to live  
Is Christ alone  
  
[Chorus (x2)]  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
[Bridge (x3)]  
All powerful  
All glorious  
There's nothing like the Name of Jesus  
  
All powerful  
All glorious  
There's nothing like Your Name  
  
[Chorus (x2)]  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
Find all I need in You
