Said that you love me  
Thought that it was true  
You said that you needed me  
And baby I believe that too  
I thought that you were shy  
But you put me straight  
With the wink of your eye  
I should have known better  
I know  
But now my hand's in my pocket  
Every time I see you cry  
  
People think that you're so sweet  
But they don't know you  
Quite like I do  
I guess they think  
I'm a lucky guy  
But you're not fooling  
Everybody  
  
You can have my credit card  
Baby  
But keep your red hot fingers  
Off my heart  
Lady  
All I know is what I see  
You're getting what you want  
Girl  
It ain't just me  
No matter how you cry  
I'm not giving any love away  
Do you think I'm crazy  
All I know is what I see  
But what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me  
Baby  
  
You tell me you love me  
'cause I know that it's not true  
Just tell me  
You need my money  
Girl  
You know I'll give it to you  
Between the ocean and sky  
There are things  
That you can't buy  
And if you look you'll see  
One of them is me  
Take your hands out of my pockets  
Dig until the day you die  
  
People think that you're so sweet  
But they don't know you  
Quite like I do  
I guess they think  
I'm a lucky guy  
But you're not fooling  
Everybody  
  
You can have my credit card  
Baby  
But keep your red hot fingers  
Off my heart  
Lady  
All I know is what I see  
You're getting what you want  
Girl  
It ain't just me  
No matter how you cry  
I'm not giving any love away  
Do you think I'm crazy  
All I know is what I see  
But what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me  
Baby  
  
They don't know you  
Quite like I do  
And you're not fooling  
Anybody  
You can have my credit card  
Baby  
But keep your red hot fingers  
Off my heart  
Lady  
All I know is what I see  
You're getting what you want  
Girl  
It ain't just me  
No matter how you cry  
I'm not giving any love away  
Do you think I'm crazy  
All I know is what I see  
But what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me  
Baby
