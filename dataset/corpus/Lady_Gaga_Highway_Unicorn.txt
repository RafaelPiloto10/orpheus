We can be strong,  
We can be strong,  
Out on this lonely road,  
It's on the road to love.  
  
We can be strong,  
We can be strong,  
Follow that unicorn,  
On the road to love.  
  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with her t-  
Run, run with, with, with,  
  
Run, run with her top down,  
Baby she flies.  
Run, run with the fury of a  
Saint in her eyes.  
  
Run, run, cha, cha, cha,  
Baby she goes.  
With blonde hair and a gun,  
Smoking under her toes.  
  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh,  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh,  
Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride.  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh,  
Ride, ride, pony, tonight.  
  
We can be strong,  
We can be strong,  
Out on this lonely road,  
On the road to love.  
  
We can be strong,  
We can be strong,  
Follow that unicorn,  
On the road to love.  
  
I'm on the road,  
Oh, oh woah oh,  
I'm on the road to love.  
  
I'm on the road,  
Oh, oh woah oh,  
I'm on the road to love.  
  
She's just an American,  
Riding a dream.  
When she's got a rainbow syrup,  
And a heart that she bleeds.  
  
They don't care if your papers,  
Or your love is the law.  
She's a, free soul, burning roads,  
With a flag in her bra.  
  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh,  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh,  
Ride, ride, pony, ride, ride.  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh  
Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh,  
Ride, ride, pony, tonight.  
  
We can be strong,  
We can be strong,  
Out on this lonely road,  
On the road to love.  
  
We can be strong,  
We can be strong,  
Follow that unicorn,  
On the road to love.  
  
I'm on the road,  
Oh, oh woah oh,  
I'm on the road to love.  
  
I'm on the road,  
Oh, oh woah oh,  
I'm on the road to love.  
  
Get your hot rods ready to rumble  
'Cause were gonna fall in love tonight.  
Get your hot rods ready to rumble,  
Cause' we're gonna drink until we die.  
  
Get your hot rods ready to rumble  
Cause' were gonna fall in love tonight.  
Get your hot rods ready to rumble,  
Cause' we're gonna drink until we die.
