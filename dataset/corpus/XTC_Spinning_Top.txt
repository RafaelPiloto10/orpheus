I'm like a spinning top  
Going round and around  
Well I don't know what's up  
And I sure don't know what's down  
Now watch me - I'm like a spinning top  
Can't tell day from night  
Well I don't know what's wrong  
And I sure don't know what's right  
Now watch me  
  
It started when I heard your song of love  
Pouring down like honey from above  
I started to spin  
I started to move  
Just like a needle  
That's sticking in the same old groove  
  
I'm like a spinning top  
  
I like it so much I'm never going to stop
