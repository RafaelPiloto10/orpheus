I've been in a rut  
Back and forth enough  
Heart like the wheel  
Without you around  
So uncomfortable is how it feels  
  
Every time you're near  
Trouble disappears  
Under the ground  
But when you go too far  
Silver clouds will start hanging around  
  
And I know why  
Try to run  
But I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
And I can't jump the track  
Can't let you go  
  
Tied to one  
So I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
Skippin' down a broken path  
How long can I last  
Please let me know  
Where's the finish line  
Cause I've got to find somewhere to go  
  
I don't want to hear  
These people interfere  
What do they know  
What I feel inside  
When I'm up all night  
Needing you home  
  
I don't know why  
Tried to run  
But I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
And I can't jump the track  
Can't let you go  
  
Tried to once  
So I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
I'll keep on runnin?  
Til we meet in the middle  
I'll push it right aside  
And I give just a little  
There's miles to go  
But wait  
Don't hold back  
We'll make it  
  
And I know why  
Tried to run  
But I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
And I can't jump the track  
Can't let you go  
  
Tried to once  
So I keep on  
Coming back  
Full circle  
Cause I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
I know you'll come around  
You'll come around  
  
Yeah I know you'll come around  
You'll come around
