Driving faster in my car  
Falling farther from just what we are  
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more  
These conversations kill  
Falling faster in my car  
  
Time to take her home,  
Her dizzy head is conscious laden.  
Time to take a ride it leaves today  
No conversation  
Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.  
  
Too much walking shoes worn thin  
Too much trippin' and my soul's worn thin  
Time to catch her ride it leaves today,  
Her name is what it means  
Too much walking shoe worn thin  
Time to take her home,  
Her dizzy head is conscious laden.  
Time to take a ride it leaves today  
No conversation  
  
Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.  
  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill  
  
Time to take her home,  
Her dizzy head is conscious laden.  
Time to take a ride it leaves today  
No conversation  
Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.  
  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill  
Conversations kill
