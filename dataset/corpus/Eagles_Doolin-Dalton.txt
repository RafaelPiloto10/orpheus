They were doolin', doolin'-dalton  
High or low, it was the same  
Easy money, and faithless women  
Red eye whiskey for the pain.  
  
Go down little dalton, it must be God's will  
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeeville.  
Two voices call to you from where they stood,  
"Lay down your law books now, they're no damn good."  
  
Better keep on movin', doolin'-dalton  
Till your shadow sets you free.  
And if you're fast, and if you're lucky,  
You will never see that hangin' tree.  
  
Well the towns lay out across the dusty plain  
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin' for the names  
And a man could use his back or use his brains  
But some just went stir-crazy Lord cause nothin' ever changed  
  
Till they're doolin' Neville Dalton  
He was workin' cheap, just buyin' time  
And then he laughed and said I'm goin'  
And so he left that peaceful life behind
