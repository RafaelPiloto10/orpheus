Correct me if you think that I'm mistaken  
I wouldn't want to overstate my case  
But while I'm the one bringing home the bacon  
I've got a right to be heard around this place  
  
You seem to think that life dealt you a bad deal  
On the day we both pronounced the words "I do"  
You yell at me for hours about what bugs you  
Well that's a waste of time 'cause I can do that too  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when you do that  
  
I'm trying my best to be your husband  
And a father to our little baby girl  
And I'd rather rely on my own judgment  
Than the vagaries and fashions of this world  
  
If you wanted a doctor or a lawyer  
You should have married one of them instead of me  
Or some other guy who would ignore you  
When he'd make a point and you would disagree  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when doing that  
  
And now I'll make my confessing  
I love to row as much as you  
But while it might be fun, in the long run  
It's not going to change a thing we do  
  
Again I make my confession  
I love to row as much a you  
But while it might be fun, in the long run  
It's not going to change a thing we do  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when you do that  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when you do that
