When I was younger  
I thought the world circled around me  
But in time I realized I was wrong  
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future  
It was a tragic case of my reality  
  
Do you think you're indestructible  
And no one can touch you?  
Well I think you're disposable  
And it's time you knew the truth  
Cause it's just one of my lies!  
  
Why does my life have to be so small?  
Yet death is forever  
And does forever have a life to call its own?  
  
Don't give me an answer cause you  
Only know as much as I know  
Unless you've been there once  
well I hardly think so  
  
I used to pray all night  
Before I lay myself down  
My mother said it was right  
Her mother said it too...  
Why?
