On the eighth day God noticed a problem  
For there below Him stood a cowboy alone  
Stubborn and proud, reckless and loud  
God knew he'd never make it on his own  
So God looked out all over creation  
And listened as that cowboy prayed  
God took passion and thunder  
Patience and wonder then He sent down  
The best thing that God ever made  
  
Cowboys and angels leather and lace  
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace  
Cowboys and angels tested and tried  
It's a long way to heaven  
And one hell of a ride  
  
Nothin's changed since the dawn of creation  
For you will find them together today  
And only heaven above them knows why she loves him  
But he must be the reason she don't fly away  
  
Cowboys and angels leather and lace  
Salt of the earth meets heavenly grace  
Cowboys and angels tested and tried  
It's a long way to heaven  
And one hell of a ride  
It's a long way to heaven  
And one hell of a ride
