Thinking back when we first met  
I remember what You said  
You said You'd never leave me,  
I let go of Your hand  
Built my castle in the sand  
But I'm reaching out again  
And I'm not letting go 'til You  
Hold me, mold me  
Sometimes I feel so all alone,  
See I gotta find my way back home  
So why don't You  
Shape me, make me,  
Wash me whiter than the snow  
I gotta find my way back home.  
  
Master, upon my knees I pray  
I just wanna be the clay  
Put Your arms around me,  
Place my life in Your hands  
Lord, I know I'm just a man  
Hope You understand  
This time I'm not letting go til You  
Anoint me, appoint me  
Sometimes I feel so all alone,  
I'm on my way back home  
So why don't You  
Chastise me, baptize me,  
Wash me whiter than the snow  
I gotta find my way.  
  
Cause I'm lost and alone  
I've been wandering long enough to know  
Humbly I search for You  
And I'm not gonna rest til You  
Choose me, use me  
Sometimes I feel so all lone  
I'm on my way back home  
So why don't You  
Direct me, bless me  
Wash me whiter than the snow  
I am on my way back home
