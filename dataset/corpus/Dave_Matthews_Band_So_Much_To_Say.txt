Say my hell is the closet  
I'm stuck inside  
Can't see the light  
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
Got central heating  
And I'm alright  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Can't see the light  
Keep it locked up inside  
Don't talk about it  
Talk about the weather  
Can't see the light  
Open up my head and let me out, little baby  
Here we have been standing for a long, long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time  
  
I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside  
Can't see the light  
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
Got central heating and I'm alright  
Here we have been standing for a long, long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time  
I find sometimes it's easy to be myself  
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else  
  
I see you young and soft oh little baby  
Little feet, little hands, little baby  
One year of cryin' and the words creep up inside  
Creep into your mind  
So much to say  
Here we have been standing for a long, long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long, long time  
I find sometimes it's easy  
To be myself  
Sometimes I find it's better  
To be somebody else  
  
So much to say  
Open up my head and let me out  
Little baby
