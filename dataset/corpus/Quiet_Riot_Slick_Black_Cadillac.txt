Ooooo, just a big black set of wheels  
Is what it takes to get me off  
I'm gonna drive all night  
Spin my wheels all night  
It feels all right  
It feels all right  
  
I don't need no drivers license  
I'm too reckless to survive  
It's like a carburetor instigator  
Feels all right  
Feels all right  
  
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac  
It's got solid gold hubcaps  
It makes me feel like a king  
I only need one thing  
And that's a slick black Cadillac (get up)  
  
You know I got a fully equipped rock 'n' roll machine  
At speeds that take me high, high, high  
At dead man's curve  
I only hear one word drive, drive, drive  
Drive, drive, drive  
  
My machine is making headlines  
It gives me love and everything  
It's like an institution of revolution  
It feels all right  
Feels all right  
  
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac  
It's got solid gold hubcaps  
It makes me feel like a king  
I only need one thing  
And that's a slick black Cadillac (pull over, woooo)  
  
I got the coppers on my tail  
Just for me an A.P.B.  
The sirens spinnin'  
Though it's me who's winnin'  
They're after me  
They're after me  
  
Before they know just what happened  
I disappeared to their surprise  
I got a Cadillac monkey on my back  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind  
  
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac  
It's got solid gold hubcaps  
It makes me feel like a king  
I only need one thing  
And that's a slick black Cadillac (hold on)  
  
Slick black Cadillac  
It's got solid gold hubcaps  
  
Slick black Cadillac  
  
I lay it down, spin wide and get laid in back, oh yeah  
  
Drivin' in a slick black Cadillac  
It makes me feel like a king, alright!
