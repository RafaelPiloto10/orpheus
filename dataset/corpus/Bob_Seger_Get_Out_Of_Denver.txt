I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'  
Our 60 Cadillac was roarin' through Nebraska whinin'  
Doin' 120 man the fields was bendin' over  
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was traveling further  
All the fires were blazing and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'  
Had my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'  
  
Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher  
She had a line on somethin' heavy but we couldn't reach her  
We told her that we needed somethin' that would get us goin'  
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'  
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up  
The cops came bustin' in and then we lit out in our pickup truck go  
  
Get out of Denver baby go go  
Get out of Denver better go  
Get out of Denver better go go  
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better  
Get out of Denver  
  
Well red lights were flashin' and the sirens were a-screamin'  
We had to pinch each other just to see if we was dreamin'  
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour  
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thundershower  
  
The rain kept drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber  
We kept on drivin' till we ran into some fog cover  
We couldn't see a thing somehow we just kept on goin'  
We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'  
'Fore it finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at  
We're starin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat go  
  
Get out of Denver he said go go  
Get out of Denver better go  
Get out of Denver better go go  
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better  
Get out of Denver better go  
  
Oh better better better go  
Hey go  
Ah better better go go go go  
Cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better go!
