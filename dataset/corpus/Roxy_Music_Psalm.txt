Try on your love  
Like a new dress  
The fit and the cut  
Your friends to impress  
Try on your smile,  
Square on your face  
Showing affection  
Should be no disgrace  
Try out your God  
Hope He will send  
Kindness from strangers  
  
On whom you depend  
Try on His coat  
A mantle most fine  
Myriad colors  
His harmony-thine  
Believe in me  
Once seemed a good line  
Now belief in Jesus  
Is faith more sublime  
Head in the clouds  
But I can't see the Lord  
Short of perfection  
I'll try to be good  
I'll stand at His gate  
I'll wait for His sign  
Then I'll walk in His garden  
  
When it's my time  
Drink from His cup  
Hush now don't you cry  
His quiet waters  
Will never, never run dry  
Nearing death's vale  
He's here by my side  
He leads me to paradise  
A mountain so high  
Don't be afraid  
Just treasure His word  
Singing His praises  
I know that I'll be heard  
He's gonna take you by the hand  
He's gonna make you feel so good  
Open up your eyes  
  
And then you'll see all that you should  
Forget all your troubles  
You will feel no pain  
He's all that you need  
He's your everything  
When I'm feeling all at sea  
Deliverance is that distant shore  
I will not be worried  
Someday His house will be my home  
For ever more
