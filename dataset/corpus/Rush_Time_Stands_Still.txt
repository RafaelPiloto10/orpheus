I turn my back to the wind  
To catch my breath  
Before I start off again  
Driven on without a moment to spend  
To pass an evening  
With a drink and a friend.  
  
I let my skin get too thin  
I'd like to pause  
No matter what I pretend  
Like some pilgrim who learns to transcend  
Learns to live as if each step was the end.  
  
Time stand still  
I'm not looking back  
But I want to look around me now  
See more of the people  
And the places that surround me now.  
  
Freeze this moment  
A little bit longer  
Make each sensation  
A little bit stronger  
Experience slips away.  
  
I turn my face to the sun  
Close my eyes  
Let my defenses down  
All those wounds  
That I can't get unwound.  
  
I let my past go too fast  
No time to pause  
If I could slow it all down  
Like some captain  
Whose ship runs aground  
I can wait until the tide  
Comes around.  
  
Make each impression  
A little bit stronger  
Freeze this motion  
A little bit longer  
The innocence slips away.  
  
Summer's going fast  
Nights growing colder  
Children growing up  
Old friends growing older  
Experience slips away.
