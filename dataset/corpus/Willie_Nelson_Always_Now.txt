It's always now  
And nothing ever goes away  
Everything is here to stay  
And it's always now  
  
It's always now  
There never was a used to be  
Everything is still with me  
And it's always now  
  
So brace your heart  
Save yourself some sanity  
It's more than just a memory  
And it's always now  
And here's your part  
  
Sing it like a melody  
There's really only you and me  
And it's always now  
  
So brace your heart  
Save yourself some sanity  
It's more than just a memory  
And it's always now  
And here's your part  
Sing it like a melody  
There's really only you and me  
And it's always now  
There's really only you and me  
And it's always now
