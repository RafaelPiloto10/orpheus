This is Christmas  
This is Christmas  
This is Christmas time  
(It's Christmas time)  
  
Christmas is children who just can't go to sleep  
Christmas is memories, the kind you always keep  
Deck the halls and give a cheer  
For all the things that Christmas is each year  
  
Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true  
  
Christmas is carols to warm you in the snow  
Christmas is bedtime when no one wants to go  
All the world is tinsel bright  
So glad to know that Christmas is tonight  
  
Ah, Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true  
  
Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true  
  
Christmas is sleigh bells  
Christmas is holly  
  
Christmas is children who just can't go to sleep  
Christmas is memories, the kind you always keep  
Deck the halls and give a cheer  
For all the things that Christmas is each year  
  
Oh, Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
When all your wishes come true  
  
Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Merry Christmas  
(Merry Christmas)  
May all your wishes come true  
  
(Christmas is sleigh bells)  
Christmas is sharing  
(Christmas is holly)  
Christmas is caring
