Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,sio what are you waiting for?)-  
Celebrity and superstition  
Whatever it takes to get some recognition  
Selling antiques like they are new ideas  
Making you pay to feed the thoughts they steal  
Call me foolish call me crazy  
But all this drama doesn't faze me  
Tell me not to run and I will run much faster  
Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout it from a mountain  
Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,sio what are you waiting for?)-  
It doesn't take a mathematician  
To calculate our rising addicition  
To romance,youth and perfected beauty  
Packaged preservered for their mass apeal  
You're not the first to buy their lines  
They're not the last to waste your time  
Tell me to give up and I will fight much harder  
Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout it even louder  
Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,so what are you waiting for?)-  
It's a new day  
Different then yesterday  
All the concepts fighting for a place in my mind  
Well you'll find It's occupied with the divine  
The sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more  
The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar  
Time will be flying and freedom is at the door  
You feel alright,yeah,so get up...  
Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright, yeah (You feel alright, yeah, so what are you waiting for?) -
