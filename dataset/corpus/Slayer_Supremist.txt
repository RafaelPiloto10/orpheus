Crushing all your worthless goals  
I define control  
Your pain's my fucking ecstasy  
So putrid is my world of tyranny  
Accentuate your desperation  
Flesh from bone, I'll rip and tear  
I hate the fact  
That we breathe the same air  
Helpless, as I dominate  
I won't celebrate  
Until you've all been crucified  
I can not rest 'til everyone has died  
I can't stand the victim in you  
Infecting everything that I do  
I will eradicate  
Obliterate, depopulate  
Divine, atrocious suffering  
Cleansation of the weak, supremacy  
Pissing on your faith  
Incinerate God's whore  
Perpetual is my reign  
I will eat your soul  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must contain the minds of the free  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must contain the minds of the free  
Must maintain control of the weak
