Spinnin' to the sound  
Like a record going round  
Let's hear the music  
We could be making out  
But all I really want right now  
Is just the music  
I'm only here to dance  
I'm not looking for romance  
So watch me work it  
I gotta get a fix  
Of my daily megamix  
So keep it groovin'  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I'm diggin' on your scene  
But music gets the best of me  
I'm so addictive  
No need to save my seat  
'Cause I'm not gonna miss a beat  
I wanna freak it  
Your conversation's fine  
But save it for some other time  
Right now I'm dancing (like a dancin' machine)  
Get with my bangin' beat  
If you know what I mean  
I wanna do it  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I really didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I'm just here for the music  
Music  
Music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on  
Music (music)  
Music  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home
