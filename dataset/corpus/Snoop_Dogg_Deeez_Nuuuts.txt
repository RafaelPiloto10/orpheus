Chiggie check, microphone check two,  
Chiggie check, microphone check three  
  
Check game from the notorious Compton G  
Back with some shit that gots to bump  
As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk  
Just to floss you like a motherfucker, clownin' their shit  
Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch  
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe  
If she proper, I'ma pop her the hole hopper  
It's back on the track  
With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack  
So Daz, step up on the ass  
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past  
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote  
With my nigga D-are-E, so you know I must be dope  
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass  
Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK  
That I bring as I slang like cavy  
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy  
Had he not known about the city I'm from  
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back  
Here I come, stompin' in my khaki suit  
BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood  
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up  
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling  
But did you raise up all this nuts?  
Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up  
  
Chiggie check, microphone check one,  
Chiggie check, microphone check two,  
Chiggie check, microphone check three  
  
You tuned to the sounds of the D-are-E,  
Now check me out, it's back to the old school  
Where the niggas get their strap on, don't nobody cap on  
Slap on some D-are-E  
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double G-Y-D-O-double G  
Real G's who drop K's, protect these N-you-T, so nigga please  
Peep out my manuscript  
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit  
Bitch!  
So recognize game from the gangsta  
Things will remain the same until I change 'em  
  
It's real easy to see,  
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double G,  
I can't be faded  
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street,  
I can't be faded  
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street,  
I can't be faded  
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street,  
I can't be faded  
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking street,  
I heard you want to fuck with Dre,  
You picked the wrong, motherfucking day  
  
Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow,  
Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row,  
I heard you want to fuck with Dre,  
You picked the wrong, motherfucking day,
