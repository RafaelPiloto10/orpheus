Whiskey woman don't you know that you are drivin' me insane  
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain  
Don't you know you're driving me insane  
You're tryin' to find your way through life  
You're tryin' to get some new direction  
Another woman got her man  
She won't find no new connection  
  
Takes another drink or two,  
Things look better when she's through  
  
Takes another look around, you're not goin' anywhere  
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care  
You're tryin' to find your way again  
You're tryin' to find some new  
Another woman's got her man  
But she won't find a new  
  
Takes another drink or two,  
Things look better when she's through  
  
You 'bin foolin' with some hot guy  
I want to know why is it why  
Get up get out you know you really blew it  
I've had enough, I've had enough, good God pluck me  
  
Once she was wonderful  
Once she was fine  
Once she was beautiful  
Once she was mine  
She was mine  
  
Now change has come over her body,  
She doesn't see me anymore  
Now change has come over her body,  
She doesn't see me anymore  
  
Changes, changes, changes, changes  
Victim of changes
