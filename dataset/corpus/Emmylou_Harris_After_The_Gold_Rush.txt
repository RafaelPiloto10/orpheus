Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming saying something about a
queen  
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming and the archer split the
tree  
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze  
Look at mother nature on the run in the twentieth century  
Look at mother nature on the run in the twentieth century  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement with a full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for a replacement when the sun burst through the skies  
There was a band playing in my head and I felt like I could cry  
Thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie

Well I dreamed a saw the silver spaceships flying in the yellow have of the
sun  
The were children crying and colors flying all around the chosen ones  
All in a dream all in a dream the loading had begun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home
