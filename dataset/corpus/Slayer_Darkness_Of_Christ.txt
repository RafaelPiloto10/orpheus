Mankind in his insatiable search for divine  
Knowledge has discarded all biblical teachings  
  
Realizing that the strength of religion is the repression of  
Knowledge  
All structures of religion have collapsed  
  
Life prays for death  
In the wake of the horror of these revelations  
  
It was never imagined how graphic the reality that would  
Be known as the end  
Of creation  
Would manifest itself  
  
We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced  
Back to one single event  
  
We hold these truths to be painfully self-evident  
All men are not created equal  
Only the strong will prosper  
Only the strong will conquer  
Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized  
God Hates Us All
