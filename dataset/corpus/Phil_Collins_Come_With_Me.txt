I'll try to make the sunshine brighter for you  
I will even play the fool if it makes you smile  
I'll try to make you laugh if there's a tear in your eye  
After all is said  
After all is done  
I'll do anything for you.  
Come with me, close your eyes  
Hold my hands, it'll be alright  
Don't be scared, don't be shy  
Lift your head it's gonna be alright.  
I'll try to make the star shine brighter for you  
And I'll take you on my shoulders, hold you way up high  
I'll even chase the rainbow hanging in the sky  
Cause after all is said  
After all is done  
I'll do anything for you  
Come with me, close your eyes  
Hold my hand, it'll be alright  
Don't be scared, don't be shy  
Lift your head it's gonna be alright  
Through the eyes of innocence  
You will find, you will see  
There'll come a time it all makes sense  
And you won't know, but it will show inside, deep inside  
Come with me, close your eyes  
Hold my hand, it'll be alright  
Don't be scared, don't be shy  
Lift your head it's gonna be alright  
I'll try to make the days last longer for you  
From the daybreak, 'til the sunset, 'til the end of time  
I'll keep you safe, away from the heartache  
Cause when all is said  
And when all is done  
I'd do anything for you  
Come with me, close your eyes  
Hold my hand, it'll be alright  
Don't be scared, don't be shy  
Lift your head it's gonna be alright.
