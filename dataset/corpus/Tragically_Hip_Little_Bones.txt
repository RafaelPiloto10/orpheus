It gets so sticky down here  
Better butter your cue-finger up  
It's the start of another new year  
Better call the newspaper up 2.50  
For a hi-ball and a buck and a half  
For a beer happy hour,  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
The long days of Shockley are gone  
So is football Kennedy style  
Famous last words taken all wrong  
Wind up on the very same pile  
2.50 for a decade  
And a buck and half for a year happy hour,  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
I can cry, beg and whine  
T'every rebel I find  
Just to give me a line I could use to describe  
  
They'd say, "baby, eat this chicken slow  
It's full of all them little bones"  
  
So regal and decadent here  
Coffin-cheaters dance on their graves music,  
All it's delicate fear  
Is the only thing that don't change  
2.50 for an eyeball  
And a buck and a half for an ear happy hour,  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
Nothing's dead down here,  
Just a little tired they'd say,  
"Baby, eat this chicken slow  
It's full of all them little bones"
