Let's go, come on

Shrivel up and die

Shut up  
Tumble down and give up  
Throw up, spit up

Ain't a loser

Adrenaline pumpin'  
Lies stompin'  
Makeshift poison words, they' mean nothin'  
Twist sideways  
Aim my way  
Now pull the trigger and watch me ricochet  
You shot the shot without making a sound  
You said you cared a lot, but I see through you now  
Go on, throw your weight around  
I won't buckle, I will let you down  
  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit and I'll prove you wrong  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit, as we scream along  
Whoa oh  
  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit and I'll prove you wrong  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit, as we scream along  
Whoa oh  
  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit and I'll take you on!
