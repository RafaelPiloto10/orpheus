You know your mine nears  
My songs are written all, for you  
I'm feeling so confused  
I can't find a way to you  
I need you almost in my life  
To flashes 'em back to me  
I caught you belong in my eyes  
Bleeding it easy, bleeding me  
  
I need you email me love mail  
We don't use no word no  
When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail  
  
You're playing with me  
Not answering my calls, oh no  
And gotten no replies on my messages to you, no more  
I feel like to got crazy  
Thinking of you, all day  
But something tells me you're still my life  
I remain to find for your cars  
  
I need you email me love mail  
We don't use no word no  
When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail  
  
You promise me now before leaving good  
The moment you needed my warm love long lost  
(Oh yeah) I am a steady in your arms  
Thought that I could loose you one day  
I run far away, so far from you I love...  
  
I need you email me love mail  
We don't use no word no  
When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail  
  
I need you email me love mail  
We don't use no word no  
When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail  
  
I need you email me love mail  
We don't use no word no  
When I need to hear your voice (chill hear your voice)  
Baby may your kisses chill me (chill me)  
Send your flowers near to me, Love Mail
