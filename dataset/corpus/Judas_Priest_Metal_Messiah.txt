Unholy Satan begs  
He don't make no sense  
Striving down there to  
Recruit all of you  
Do not live in sin  
Or taste the fear again  
Someone's coming back  
Fuck the almanacs  
  
Premonition say  
Better step away  
Skeptics preach a lot  
Watch in aftershock  
Heed the prophecies  
In your offices  
Someone out the blue  
Explodes into view  
  
The time is near  
The day has dawned  
Be prepared  
For what's to come  
  
He's the man  
Armageddon  
Walking through fire  
Metal messiah  
He's the one  
The father, the son  
Creator destroyer  
Metal messiah  
  
Heaven's in a state  
Someone's at the gate  
Crashing isn't cool  
He don't know the rules  
Stepping in he says  
Time to rock the place  
Like they've got a choice  
Then all hell breaks loose  
  
Hell ain't ready for  
What he's got in store  
Time you fuckers had  
Change of management  
Better fornicate  
Before it's too late  
Cranks the power up  
As he detonates  
  
Never too late  
To extricate  
In the event  
Die or repent  
  
He's the man  
Armageddon  
Walking through fire  
Metal messiah  
He's the one  
The father, the son  
Creator destroyer  
Metal messiah  
  
You can pray to him  
Auditorium  
Buy the merchandise  
Cheap at twice the price  
Rising up above  
With his decibels  
He's come down to earth  
Next the universe  
  
The time is near  
The day has dawned  
Be prepared  
For what's to come  
  
Never too late  
To extricate  
In the event  
Die or repent  
  
Metal messiah  
Thy kingdom come  
They will be done
