There ain't no reason  
You and me should be alone  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
I got a reason that you're  
Who should take me home tonight  
  
I need a man that thinks  
It's right when it's so wrong  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Right on the limits  
Where we know we both belong tonight  
  
It's hot to feel the rush  
To brush the dangerous  
I'm gonna run right to  
To the edge with you  
Where we can both fall far in love  
  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge  
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
oh, oh, oh, on the edge with you  
  
Another shot before  
We kiss the other side  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
I'm on the edge of something final  
We call life tonight  
(Alright, alright)  
  
Put on your shades  
'Cause I'll be dancing in the flames  
Tonight, yeah baby  
Tonight, yeah baby  
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name  
Tonight  
(Alright, alright)  
  
It's hot to feel the rush  
To brush the dangerous  
I'm gonna run right to  
To the edge with you  
Where we can both fall far in love  
  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge  
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment with you  
I'm on the edge with you  
  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge  
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge  
I'm on the edge of glory  
And I'm hanging on a moment with you  
  
I'm on the edge with you  
(With you, with you, with you, with you)  
I'm on the edge with you  
(With you, with you, with you, with you)  
I'm on the edge with you  
(With you, with you, with you, with you)  
I'm on the edge with you  
(With you, with you, with you, with you)  
I'm on the edge with you
