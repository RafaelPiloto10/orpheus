Do I move you, are you willin'  
Do I groove you, is it thrillin'  
Do I soothe you, tell the truth now  
Do I move you, are you loose now  
The answer better be (Yes, yes)  
That pleases me  
  
Are you ready for this action  
Does it give you satisfaction  
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'  
If you are then let's start swayin'  
The answer better be (Yes, yes)  
That pleases me  
  
When I touch you do you quiver  
Form your head down to your liver  
If you like it let me know it  
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it  
The answer better be (Yes, yes)  
That pleases me
