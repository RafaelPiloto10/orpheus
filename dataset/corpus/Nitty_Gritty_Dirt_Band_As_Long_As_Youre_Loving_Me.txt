Some people say that the fate of a man  
Is written down in the palm of his hand  
Others say they can see it all in the cards and how they fall  
I don't need my fortune told  
As long as I've got you to hold  
I can live with the mystery as long as you're loving me  
  
Looking up at the stars tonight  
I can't read 'em, but I love the light  
Heaven knows I'm right where I want to be  
As long as you're loving me  
  
I don't need a crystal ball  
Wouldn't even want to know at all  
I've got everything I need  
As long as you're loving me  
  
Who knows what tomorrow brings?  
One day changes everything  
I'm willing to wait and see  
As long as you're loving me  
  
Looking up at the stars tonight  
I can't read 'em, but I love the light  
Heaven knows I'm right where I want to be  
As long as you're loving me  
  
I don't need my fortune told  
As long as I've got you to hold  
I can live with the mystery as long as you're loving me  
  
I've got everything I need as long as you're loving me  
As long as you're loving me  
Oh, as long as you're loving me
