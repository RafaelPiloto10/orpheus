No one will eat him  
A yellow raspberry  
Perched on top of the thorn bush  
Up high and ugly  
Up high and weird  
This minute 20 years ago  
Your hair looked just as bad  
Talking nonstop to a little rubber pixie  
What has changed when you tell  
Your doll hello?  
More indignant, less recognizable  
You became a bag lady's son  
Beating off non stop  
To the escort pages  
What has changed when you tell  
The cross hello?  
You left with some money  
More self righteous, less hopeful  
Up high and ugly up high and ZORP  
This minute 20 seconds ago  
Your face looks just as dumb  
Singing nonsense to your voice mail  
What has changed as you tell  
Your cactus hello?  
More fixated, less relief  
You became a faggot  
Dressed like a bunny  
Beating off nonostop  
To the escort pages  
What has changed as you tell  
The mirror hello?
