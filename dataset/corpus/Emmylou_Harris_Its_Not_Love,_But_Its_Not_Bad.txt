He was always there each time I needed you,  
Holding on to me like I held on to you  
We still don't have what you and I once had  
No, It's Not Love, But it's not bad.  
  
No, It's Not Love, not like our love It's Not Love,  
But it keeps love from driving me mad  
And I don't have to wonder who he's had  
No, It's Not Love But it's not bad  
  
I turn to him when you leave me alone,  
Sometimes even when you're here you're still gone.  
He'e slowly changing what you leave so sad  
No, It's Not Love, But it's not bad  
  
No, It's Not Love, not like our love It's Not Love,  
But it keeps love from driving me mad  
And I don't have to wonder who he's had  
  
No, It's Not Love But it's not bad  
No, It's Not Love But it's not bad
