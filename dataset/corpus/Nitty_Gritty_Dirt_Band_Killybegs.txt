My heart was warm with family love as I slipped into a  
Chair  
beside my uncle john, my daughters 'cross the table there  
I'd walked the docks in misty rain, a pain was in my legs  
but I'd seen the dream of kinsmen in the boats of Killybegs  
  
the banter of my uncle and my daughters filled the air and  
The  
gunning brothers?(Donegalers) next to us were glad that we  
Were there  
I was kind of quiet listening at the window ledge  
for the music of the harbor, the birds of Killybegs  
  
down the coast not far was Galway land of joys (Joyce) and  
Kinnamar?  
at their (after) supper and asleep we would visit? (be  
Goin') there tomorrow  
I worried if my words would e'er be sung by Irishmen  
or out (rot) here on the docks??  
like the fish of Killybegs  
  
a radio was playing though we never heard a word (I don't  
Think this phrase is right)  
but the rhythm of the music was familiar if absurd  
and harkning  
(a heightening) intensity? for silence did I beg  
oh what a song was playing in the air of Killybegs  
  
I couldn't quite believe it for it sounded rather strange  
the instruments were different and the key had been changed  
I reached to turn the volume up then teetered on my legs  
A girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs  
a girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs
