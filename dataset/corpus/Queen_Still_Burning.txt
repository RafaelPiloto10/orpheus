I can't wake in the mornin'  
I can't sleep at night  
I got a pain in my memory  
That just won't sit right  
You might say I'm losing my mind  
What a shame, shame, shame  
But I don't want and I don't need  
To play the cryin' game  
  
Music lights this flame in me  
I won't let it go and it won't let me be  
I'm just a happy slave and oh I can't leave it  
'Cause I'm still, and I always will, be a believer  
  
Still burnin' (Yeah)  
Still yearnin' (And the wheel's)  
Still turnin' (Let me tell you why)  
We're jivin' (And the beat's)  
Still drivin' (And we are all)  
Divin' (Rock'n'roll never die)  
  
I can't breathe in the city  
Got dust in my lungs  
I get mad in the country  
Everythin' seem to go wrong  
You might think I'm playin' around  
But my heart is true  
I got reason to believe  
That sweet soul magic  
Gonna tear my heart in two  
  
Music makes the world go round  
I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound  
It feels so good from way up here  
I'm still a believer  
Headin' for the stars  
  
(Still burnin')  
(Still yearnin')  
Still turnin' (Better than every guy)  
(We're jivin')  
(Still drivin')  
Sky divin' (Rock'n'roll never die)  
  
Don't say that you love me I can't go down that road  
But don't think for a moment that my heart went cold  
I keep thinkin' about what I lost  
And what I might have found  
I went to sleep and when I woke  
Everything had turned around  
  
Still burnin' (Yeah)  
(Still yearnin')  
Still turnin' (A new day dawnin')  
(We're jivin')  
(Still drivin')  
Sky divin' (Early in the morning)  
  
Still burnin' (Yeah)  
Still yearnin' (And the wheel's)  
Still turnin' (Better than every guy)  
We're jivin' (And the beat's)  
Still drivin' (And we're all)  
Sky divin' (Rock'n'roll never die)
