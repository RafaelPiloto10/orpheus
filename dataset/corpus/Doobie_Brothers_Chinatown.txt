Patrick simmons  
You can see from the top of the hill  
Tangled streets and the mystery there  
Painted lanterns hang from balconies  
People running everywhere  
Chinatown, with all your dark mystery  
Chinatown, chinatown  
Your spell is capturing me  
Lovely ladies with almond eyes  
Dressed in silk and laces  
Twilight falls and the shadows move  
Silently in secret places  
Chinatown, with all your dark mystery  
Chinatown, chinatown  
Your spell is capturing me  
You've got me under your spell  
You've got me under your spell  
You've got me under your spell  
You've got me under your spell  
Ah, ah  
Ah, ah
