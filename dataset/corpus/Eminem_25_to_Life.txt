Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Yeah  
Too late  
I cant keep chasing 'em  
I'm taking my life back  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life  
  
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed  
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid  
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you  
No more pain bitch you  
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it  
Now my respect I demand it  
I'm a take control of this relationship  
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit  
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me  
So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left  
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath  
You know what you've done no need to go in depth  
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left  
I'd laugh while you wept  
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me  
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said  
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept  
Its unfortunate but its  
  
[Chorus]  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
  
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
Til I snap  
Don't think I'm loyal  
All I do is rap  
I can not moonlight on the side  
I have no life outside of that  
Don't I give you enough of my time  
You don't think so do you  
Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know  
But tonight I'm serving you with papers  
I'm divorcing you  
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me  
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you  
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat  
I'm moving on forget you oh,  
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you  
All I ever felt was this  
Helplessness  
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
Chew me up and spit me out  
I fell for this so many times  
Its ridiculous  
And still I stick with this  
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
Your as addictive as they get  
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em  
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away  
I'm addicted  
To the pain, the stress, the drama  
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess  
Cursed and blessed  
But this time I'm a  
Ain't changing my mind  
I'm climbing out this abyss  
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed  
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  
You left me off your list  
  
Fuck you hip-hop  
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch  
And its just  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too late  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life
