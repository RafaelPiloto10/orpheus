Everything is catching up with me.  
I await to find I'm not at all where I should be.  
And it feels I'm getting to the end.  
And it's hard to figure out what's real and what's pretend.  
  
To break from what we're tied too.  
God knows how much I've tried too.  
And I am still inside you.  
And I am still inside you.  
  
I escape every now and then.  
And to think I find myself back here again.  
And again.  
  
I used to know who I was until you came along.  
I return to the only place I've ever felt I belong.  
  
To break from what we're tied too.  
God knows how much I've tried too.  
And I am still inside you.  
And I am still inside you.
