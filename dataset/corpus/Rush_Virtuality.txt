Like a shipwrecked mariner adrift on an unknown sea  
Clinging to the wreckage of the lost ship Fantasy  
I'm a castaway, stranded in a desolate land  
I can see the footprints in the virtual sand  
  
Net boy, net girl  
Send your signal 'round the world  
Let your fingers walk and talk  
And set you free  
  
Net boy, net girl  
Send your impulse 'round the world  
Put your message in a modem  
And throw it in the Cyber Sea  
  
Astronauts in the weightlessness of pixelated space  
Exchange graffiti with a disembodied race  
I can save the universe in a grain of sand  
I can hold the future in my virtual hand  
  
Let's dance tonight  
To a virtual song  
Press this key  
And you can play along  
  
Let's fly tonight  
On our virtual wings  
Press this key  
To see amazing things  
  
Like a pair of vagabonds who wave between two passing trains  
Or the glimpse of a woman's smile through a window in the rain  
I can smell her perfume, I can taste her lips  
I can feel the voltage from her fingertips  
  
Net boy, net girl  
Send your heartbeat round the world
