So damn easy to say that life's so hard  
Everybody's got their share of battle scars  
As for me, I'd like to thank my lucky stars  
That I'm alive and well  
It'd be easy to add up all the pain  
And all the dreams you sat and watched go up in flames  
Dwell on the wreckage as it smolders in the rain  
But not me, I'm alive.  
  
[Chorus]  
And today, you know, that's good enough for me  
Breathing in and out's a blessing, can't you see  
Today's the first day of the rest of my life  
And I'm alive and well  
Yeah, I'm alive and well.  
  
Stars are dancin' on the water here tonight  
It's good for the soul and there's not a soul in sight  
This boat has caught it's wind and brought me back to life  
Now I'm alive and well.  
  
And today, you know, that's good enough for me  
Breathing in and out's a blessing, can't you see  
Today's the first day of the rest of my life  
And I'm alive and well  
Yeah, I'm alive and well.
