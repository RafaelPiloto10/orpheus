Answer me  
Why won't you answer me  
I can't recall the day that I last heard from you  
Well you don't get a town like this for nothing  
So here's what you've got to do  
You work your way to the top of the world  
Then you break your life in two  
  
Well what's the use in complaining  
When you've got what you don't need  
Anyone would think you were hardened too  
What do you want me to believe  
  
What the hell is happening  
I can't think of everything  
I don't know what day it is  
Or who I'm talking to  
  
But I know that I'm ok  
'Cause you're here with me today  
I haven't got a single problem  
Now that I'm with you  
  
So what's the use in complaining  
When you've got everything you need  
Anyone would think you were hardened too  
What do you want me to believe
