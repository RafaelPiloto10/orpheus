In this world, if you read the papers, darling,  
You know everybody's fighting with each other.  
You got no one you can count on, dear,  
Not even your own brother.  
So if someone comes along,  
He gonna give you love and affection,  
  
I'd say get it while you can, yeah,  
Honey, get it while you can, yeah,  
Honey, grab it while you can,  
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no, no.  
  
When you're loving somebody, baby,  
You're taking a gamble against some sorrow.  
But who knows, baby,  
'Cause we may not be here tomorrow.  
And if anybody comes along,  
He gonna give you love and affection,  
  
I'd say get it while you can, yeah!  
Honey, grab it when you're gonna need it!  
Yeah hey, hold it while you can,  
Don't you turn your sweet back on love,  
No no no, no no no no no!  
  
Ah! Once I had me a man,  
But I didn't know enough at the time  
To count my blessings, no no,  
But I wish he could see me crying today,  
'Cause his love don't feel to listen.  
And if anybody comes along,  
He gonna give me love and affection,  
Yeah, hey!, Hey! Yeah! Hey!  
  
Get it while you can, yeah!  
Honey, get it while you can, yeah!  
Honey, get it while you can,  
Don't you turn your back on love,

Hold on to that man whole,  
Yeah, get it, want it, need it,  
Get it, get it, hold it, need it, want it,  
Get it, need it, want it, hold it,  
Get it, squeeze it, love it, touch it,  
Use it, need it, want it, get it,  
Need it, want it, hold it,  
  
Yeah hey, get it while you can, baby,

I just don't sleep, man, that's the trouble.  
I gotta sleep sometime.  
There's too much happening, why sleep, man?  
I might miss a party.
