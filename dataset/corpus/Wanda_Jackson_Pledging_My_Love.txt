Forever my darling my love will be true always and forever I'll love just you  
Just promise me darling your love in return  
Make this fire in my soul dear forever burn

Making you happy is my desire dear keeping you is my goal  
I'll forever love you the rest of my days I'll never part from you and your
loving way  
  
My heart's at your command...
