I am a tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tough tough guy  
I tell no tales I do no lie  
  
I am a tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tough tough guy  
Halo round my head too tough to die  
  
Main attraction in a freak side show  
Down in the basement where the cobwebs grow  
On my last leg just gettin' by  
Halo round my read too tough to die  
  
Rainy days rain cool wine  
I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine  
Hot sweat on my face  
I feel like goin' out someplace  
  
Up late at night my chocolate sweet  
Down at the gym where the muscle boys meet  
I am very nice guy very sincere  
In real good shape I have no fear  
  
At the concert when the band comes on  
I am in the ring where I belong  
On my last leg just gettin' by  
Halo round my head too tough to die
