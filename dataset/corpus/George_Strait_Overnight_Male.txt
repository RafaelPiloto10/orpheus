Let me be your male-man  
And I'll always come though  
There's no denying'  
Come rain or shine  
I'll deliver my love to you  
I do things by the letter  
You can put your stamp on me  
Cause there ain't nobody better  
For a special delivery  
  
[Chorus]  
Like the pony express  
And the wild wild West  
I'll ride hard all night long  
And I can saddle up fast  
Get ya there first class  
Long before the dawn  
You know your male's gonna get to you  
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail  
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do you right overnight male  
  
I know your heart is fragile  
So I'll handle it with care  
There ain't no doubt  
I know love's route  
So baby let me take you there  
I'll bring you cards and flowers  
But I know just what you need  
Just give me 24 hours  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know your male's gonna get to you  
Come snow, rain, sleet, or hail  
'Cause I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male  
Yeah I'm a top flight, hold ya tight, get ya there by daylight  
Do ya right overnight male
