Oh oh oh  
In the heart  
Of the night  
When it's dark  
In the lights  
I heard the loudest noise  
A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
I looked down  
And my shirt's turning red  
I'm spinning around  
Felt her lips on my neck  
And her voice  
In my ear  
Like I missed you  
Want you tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Straight through my heart  
A single bullet got me  
I can't stop the bleeding  
Oh oh  
Straight through my heart  
She aimed and she shot me  
I just can't believe it  
Oh oh  
No I can't resist  
And I can't be hit  
I just can't escape this love  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
  
Thought I moved  
More than on  
Thought I could  
Fool her charm  
I really wanna go  
But I can't leave her alone  
Oh oh  
  
Hear the sound  
Of a love so loud  
I just can't  
I just can't  
Ignore this feeling  
Said she missed me  
And she wants me  
Wants me tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the heart  
Of the night  
When it's dark  
In the lights  
I heard the loudest voice  
A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
My heart, my heart, my heart  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
Oh oh
