Granada, I'm falling under your spell,  
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.  
Of an age the world has long forgotten.  
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.  
  
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada,  
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.  
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.  
Entranced by the beauty before me,  
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.  
  
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,  
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.  
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars,  
Play a soft habanera.  
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday,  
Romantic and gay.
