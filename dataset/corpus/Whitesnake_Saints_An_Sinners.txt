Get ready for Judgment day  
An' the final curtain call,  
Don't lie when you testify  
'Cause the good Lord know you're all  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
When Moses stood on the Red Sea shore  
Laying the Law on the line,  
He said don't come knocking  
On the Pearly Gates  
If all you did was have a real good time  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful.  
  
Saints an' sinners  
  
I stand guilty of a thousand crimes,  
An' I suffer temptation still,  
Show me a man who won't give it to his woman  
An' I'll show you somebody who will  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful  
  
Saints an' sinners,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
  
Get ready for Judgment day  
An' the final curtain call,  
Don't lie when you testify  
'cause the Good Lord know you're all  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves,  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
For what we are about to receive  
May the Lord make us truly thankful  
  
Saints an' sinners, priests an' thieves  
  
Saints an' sinners
