Maching to distant shores  
Killing for freedom's gain  
My sword, hands held high  
Together we stem the tide  
And  
[Chorus:]  
Let it roar- let the lion in you raise its head and roar  
Let it roar- let the lion in you come right out and roar  
Burning the street's on fire  
Pounding, the blood runs red  
In power we call to arms  
Rising a million strong  
[Chorus]  
Cry out, life's a struggle but it's worth the price  
With fists of fire we can melt the ice  
Behold the king who wears the crown of hate  
I think we're gonna break him!  
Listen, the devil won't be coming here today  
Even death can take an holiday  
Shout it loud 'cross the land  
Freedom is alive now!  
Roar!!!  
[Chorus]  
Roar, roar, roar- together  
Roar, roar, roar- I can't hear ya  
Roar, roar, roar- let it...  
ROAR!!
