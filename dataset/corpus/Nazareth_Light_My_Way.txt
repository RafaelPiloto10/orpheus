Locked in a shadow  
Praying for release  
You found my prison  
Your love was the key  
So come on, light my day  
And come on, light my way  
  
Lonely's just a word now  
Something from my past  
Horizon's look brighter  
Loving you will last  
So come on, light my day  
And come on, light my way  
  
The world's now my oyster  
Had me marked "reject"  
You changed the story  
Gave me back respect  
So come on, light my day  
And come on, light my way
