I thought no one could keep us from sharing the rest of our lives.  
Like a fool I believed you were true and had no disguise.  
There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,  
But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine.  
  
It's the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man.  
So I have to forget you though I'm not even sure if I can.  
There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,  
But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine.
