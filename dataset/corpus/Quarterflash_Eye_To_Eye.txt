Standing in your doorway  
Nothing much to see  
Remember conversations  
Between you and me  
Forgot about the feeling  
Forgot about the pain  
Forgot about the hopeful nights  
Calling again  
Just a victim of the moment-  
Nobody's fault, nobody fooled  
Ah, it's funny how things seem to slip away  
From me and you...so I keep going  
  
From eye to eye  
Face to face  
Moving oh so fast  
Never getting any place  
I keep going  
Eye to eye  
And face to face  
Will I ever find you, will I ever find you?  
  
Looking in a window  
Nothing much to do  
Almost feeling humble  
Needing you  
Most of my embraces  
Don't hold on so tight  
But after all, if I don't try  
What will feel right?  
Yes, it has to make me wonder-  
I'm so alone and yet so free  
Ah, it's funny how things seem to slip away  
From you and me - still I keep going  
  
From eye to eye  
Face to face  
Moving oh so fast  
Never getting any place  
I keep going  
Eye to eye  
And face to face  
Will I ever find you, will I ever find you
