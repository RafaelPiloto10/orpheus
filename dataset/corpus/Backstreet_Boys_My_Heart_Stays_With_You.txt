You know, sometimes being  
On the road is rough, especially the loneliness  
  
Girl I miss you  
And it's only been one day  
Since I been away  
And aw lady I say I long to kiss you  
And hold you in my arms  
The nights are much too long when you're gone  
Baby that's why...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wherever I go  
Girl, my heart stays with you  
My heart stays with you  
After every show  
I want to rush over to you  
My heart stays with you  
  
Trust me, when we are apart  
I won't break your heart  
Wherever you are I know you feel me, Baby  
And I can feel you too  
No matter what you do  
I think of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, yeah  
When I'm leaving town  
Girl, it hurts me too  
But I've got a job to do  
I'll be back around  
To see your sweet face  
Your embrace  
No one can take your place  
I want you to know...  
  
Wherever I go  
I'll be rushing over to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wherever I go  
Where I stop, who knows  
Whatever I do  
My heart stays with you  
I'm gonna rush, gonna rush over.
