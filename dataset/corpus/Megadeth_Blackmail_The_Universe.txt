This is breaking news  
It appears that Air Force One was shot down  
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning  
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists, firing a Stinger Missile  
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for  
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown  
And he is presumed missing  
  
The Vice President, Secretary of State,  
And principals of the military are assembling  
Our nation stands at Defcon 3  
The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?  
I "red, white and blew it"  
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained  
How could anybody do this?  
  
Betrayal, I peel away the days  
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me  
I'm not important, no one will ever come  
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell  
Nuclear battlefields energized  
Cold wars are heating up again  
The tensions mounting  
  
People lift up your fists in revenge  
The stage is set  
Who will be the first to blink?  
We can't go to war  
Remember that "Vietnam thing"  
Peace at any price  
With a gun to your head, bang, bang  
  
Weakness runs in your family  
What runs in mine is death  
This is your 5 minute warning  
Burn all your classified documents  
And if cooler heads don't prevail  
First strike from a political dead man  
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive  
He understands only one language, action!  
And he respects only one word, force!  
No sign of them stopping,  
No time for back channel communiques  
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions!  
Retaliate, I say!  
  
The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war  
Blackmail the Universe with the greatest of calamities  
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground  
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence  
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours  
Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means  
And in hatred you see men as they really are  
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them  
All along, only another region of hell
