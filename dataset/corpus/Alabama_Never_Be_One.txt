Drift off and dream in your paper-doll world.  
Play with the presents from the boys and the girls.  
You big day is over. The cake is all gone.  
We sang you to sleep with the birthday song.  
  
[Chorus]  
No. you'll never be one again.  
The two's are tumbling on in.  
Daddy's little girl is growing up in the world.  
You'll never be one again.  
  
The toy piano is quiet in the hall as Kermie the frog sits watching it all.  
And soon your legs will and make the tricycle go and take you away from us
all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodnight, Baby. Goodnight, Daddy.
