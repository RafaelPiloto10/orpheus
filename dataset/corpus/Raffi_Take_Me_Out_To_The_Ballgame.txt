Take me out to the ballgame  
Take me out with the crowd  
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack  
I don't care if I never get back  
  
With our root, root, root for the home team  
If they don't win, it's a shame  
For it's one, two, three strikes  
You're out at the old ballgame  
  
Take me out to the ballgame  
Take me out with the crowd  
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack  
I don't care if I never get back  
  
With our root, root, root for the home team  
If they don't win, it's a shame  
For it's one, two, three strikes  
You're out at the old ballgame
