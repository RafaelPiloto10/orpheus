Run!  
Because the master has sent us  
We announce the downfall  
Of the riders of evil  
Feed his ulcer of envy  
The truth is like a thunderstorm  
It comes to you, you can hear it  
To proclaim it It is so bitter  
It comes to you in order to destroy  
Because the night lay dying  
We announce Doomsday  
There will be no mercy  
Run, run for your lives  
The Truth is a chior of wind  
No angel comes to revenge you  
These days are your last  
Like wood you will be broken  
It comes to you as the evil
