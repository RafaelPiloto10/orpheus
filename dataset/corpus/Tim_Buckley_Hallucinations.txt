I saw you walking  
Only yesterday  
When I ran to catch you  
You disappeared  
And the street was gray  
  
The candle died  
Now you are gone  
For the flame was too bright  
Now you are gone  
  
I heard you laughing  
With your laugh of gold  
When I called out to you  
Silence returned  
And the air was cold  
  
The castle fell  
Now you are gone  
  
No more rings the bell  
Now you are gone  
I found a letter  
On the day it rained  
When I tore it open  
There in my hands  
Only ash remained  
  
The castle fell  
Now you are gone  
No more rings the bell  
Now you are gone  
  
I felt you breathing  
As I fell asleep  
When I reached out to touch you  
No one was there  
And the night was deep  
  
The candle died  
Now you are gone  
For the flame was too bright  
Now you are gone  
  
I saw you walking  
Only yesterday  
When I ran to catch you  
You disappeared  
And the street was gray  
  
The castle fell  
Now you are gone  
No more rings the bell  
Now you are gone
