Love o'love o'love o'love  
Say love o'love o'love o'love  
I had a love so pure so strong  
I keep wondering just where my love went wrong  
My love went wrong  
  
I say why oh why won't love free me  
Why o why won't love love free me  
Oh untie my hands unchain my feet  
And set my poos ol' body free  
  
I... Why must love keep me a slave oh  
Why why must love keep me a slave  
I can't help myself I ain't got no friends  
It will take me take me straight to my grave  
Love will take me straight to my grave
