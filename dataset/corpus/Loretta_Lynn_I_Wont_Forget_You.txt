I know that I won't forget you  
For I've loved you too much for too long  
Though you don't want me now  
I'll still love you till the breath in my body is gone  
That's how it is with me  
And you'll always be the only love I ever knew  
I'll forget many things in my lifetime  
But darling I won't forget you  
  
That's how it is with me  
And you'll always be the only love I ever knew  
I'll forget many things in my lifetime  
But darling I won't forget you
