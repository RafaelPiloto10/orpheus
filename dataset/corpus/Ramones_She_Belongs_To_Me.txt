What makes you think she'll go with you  
What makes you think you're better than me  
You think you can read her mind  
Maybe you're just looking for a good time  
Maybe you can give her more  
Tell me what you're doing this for  
Stay away from her,  
Cause it's making me angry  
  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
  
You come around looking for kicks  
But I know all about your dirty tricks now  
You think you took away my dream  
Ain't gonna be easy 'cause I get real mean  
Get out of here, get out of my life  
You're gonna be sorry if we have to fight  
Stay away from her,  
Cause it's making me angry  
  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
Don't tell me how to love my baby  
She belongs to me  
She belongs to me  
She belongs to me
