I don't ever want to see you crying,  
And I don't ever want to see you blue,  
oh no, all I ever wanted to do was know you  
And maybe hope you could know me too.  
Well I don't ever want to make you sorry  
For anything you've ever said or done,  
Oh no, all I ever wanted to do was love you,  
And maybe hope you could love me too.  
And it's all right baby, I'm in love with you,  
And it's all right, I would never make you blue or try to play with you,  
  
Well I don't ever want to spoil your party, babe,  
Or tell you where to go or what to do,  
Oh no, all I ever wanted to do was know you,  
There may be hope you could know me too.  
And it's all right baby, I'm in love with you,  
And it's all right, I would never make you blue or try to play with you,  
  
Well I don't ever want to spoil your party, babe,  
Or tell you where to go or what to do,  
Oh no, all I ever wanted to do was love you,  
There may be hope you could love me too
