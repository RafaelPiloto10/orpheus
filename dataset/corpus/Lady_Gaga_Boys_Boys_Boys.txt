Hey there sugar baby  
Saw you twice at the pop show  
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll  
I like you a lot lot  
Think you're really hot hot  
  
I know you think you're special  
When we dance real crazy  
Glamaphonic, electronic, disco baby  
I like you a lot lot  
All we want is hot hot  
  
[Chorus]  
Boys boys boys  
We like boys in cars  
Boys boys boys  
Buy us drinks in bars  
Boys boys boys  
With hairspray and denim  
Boys boys boys  
We love them! (We love them)  
  
Oh, oh  
  
Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers  
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers  
I like you a lot lot, think you're really hot hot  
Let's go to the party heard our buddy's the DJ  
Don't forget my lipstick I left it in your ashtray  
I like you a lot lot, all we want is hot hot  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm not loose, I like to party  
Let's get lost in your Ferrari  
Not psychotic or dramatic  
I like boys and that is that  
Love it when you call me legs  
In the morning buy me eggs  
Watch your heart when we're together  
Boys like you love me forever  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus: x3]
