I know a fat girl, she wears a orange skirt  
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work  
She'll take food stamps and a traveller's check  
Because her hair and her face and her life's a wreck  
She wears a bright blond wig, some high heeled pumps  
She's down in the dumps so she's sellin' her rump  
She's a hot little momma and she works every day  
If you want to pay to play, here's where she stays  
She's at the  
  
[Chorus]  
(Bristol Hotel) Room 515  
(The Bristol Hotel) Where that at? (Jamaica, Queens!)  
  
I seen her standin' there, slutty as could be  
Offering the putty for a itty-bitty fee  
Every red light she'll come over to your ride  
Or she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside  
The Bristol Hotel, 'cause it ain't no thing  
And her meat tastes better than Burger King  
Japanese executives in three-piece suits  
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place  
The girlies in the Bristol, they're all in cahoots  
He fell asleep and got robbed, and cold chumped his face at the...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Party people check the story 'cause the story is ill  
It's the story of two men, one Harold, one Bill  
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night  
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight  
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool  
"Never ever rush, that's the golden rule  
I been comin' to the Bristol's ten years of my life  
A-yo, what the hell? Yo, man that's my wife!"  
  
(The)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You see, a Bristol girl is a one of a kind  
And if you know her good enough she won't make you stand on line  
She'll let you inside, make you pay for the ride  
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died  
You say "What the heck", because you already paid  
Not knowin' that the guy that went before you had AIDS  
Bang bang boogie, she was so amusin'  
Next week you're at the clinic gettin' blood transfusions  
At the  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(The Bristol Hotel)
