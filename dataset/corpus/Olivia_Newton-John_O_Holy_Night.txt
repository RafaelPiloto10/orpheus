O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth  
  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel voices  
O night divine, O night when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night, O night divine  
  
Truly he taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise me  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
Christ is the Lord  
Then ever, we will praise thee  
O night divine! O night when Christ was born  
O night divine! O night, O night divine
