It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know I love you  
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to control you  
And like the other little children you're gonna dream a dream or two  
But be careful what you're dreamin' or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you  
It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know I love you  
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to console you  
You go out to play this evenin' play with fire flies till they're gone  
Then you rush to meet your lover play with real fire till the dawn  
It's not supposed to be that way
