To live and not to breathe  
Is to die in tragedy  
To run, to run away  
To find what you believe  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
I lost my faith to this  
This town that don't exist  
So I run, I run away  
The light of masochist  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
And I walked this line  
A million and one fucking times  
But not this time  
I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize  
When there ain't nowhere you can go  
Running away from pain  
When you've been victimized  
Tales from another broken home  
You're leaving, you're leaving  
You're leaving, ah, you're leaving home
