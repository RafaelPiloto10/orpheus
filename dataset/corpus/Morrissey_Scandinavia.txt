[Verse:]  
I was bored in a Fjord  
And I curse the heart and soul of Scandinavia  
Let the people burn  
Let their children cry and die in blind asylums  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
But then you came along  
And you held out your hand  
And I fell in love with you and Scandinavia  
  
[Chorus:]  
I kiss the soil  
I eat the soil  
I hug the soil  
And I praise the God who made you  
Stop me in your own time in Scandinavia  
Unprotesting I'll die in Scandinavia  
  
[Verse:]  
Into a crime in Trondheim  
I despise each syllable in Scandinavia  
Let the people burn  
Let their children cry and die in blind asylums  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
But then you came along  
And you held out your hand  
And I fell in love with you and Scandinavia  
  
[Chorus:]  
I kiss the soil  
I eat the soil  
I hug the soil  
And I praise the God who made you  
Stop me in your own time in Scandinavia  
Are we happy to die? In Scandinavia
