Baby take me  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
I can't get you off of my mind  
Think about you all of the time  
Don't you know you know my heart  
All you gotta do is make a start  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
Give me a chance to prove it to you  
I would treat you oh so good  
'Cause I love you like I should  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
If you want a love that's true  
That's what I'm offering you  
It will be forever  
We will part never  
Baby can't you see  
You're the one for me, oh  
If you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
I can't get you off of my mind  
Think about you all of the time  
I want you all by myself  
And I want some on no one else  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
Baby take me
