Don't call me baby  
Don't call me your inspiration  
Don't call me jealous  
I don't need you  
Don't try to use me  
You can use your own imagination  
Just a little bit of information before I leave you  
  
You gotta go for the throat (you can use your own imagination)  
You gotta do it alone (just a little bit of information)  
I am what I am (you can use your own imagination)
