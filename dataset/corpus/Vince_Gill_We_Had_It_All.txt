We closed down the border cantina  
And drank margaritas till dawn  
You were my sweet senorita  
And I was your handsome Don Juan  
  
We danced like there was no tomorrow  
We laughed and we lived and we loved  
That moment in time that we borrowed  
Never did last long enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah, we had it all going our way for a little while  
We had it all right in the palm of our hands  
We had it all going our way for a little while  
Oh, how I wish we could go back there again  
  
We thought we were too young to marry  
Slowly we drifted apart  
Well baby, I miss you like crazy  
Those memories still burn in my heart  
  
Oh, let's find a way to rekindle  
That flame that burned long ago  
These days just can't hold a candle  
To those sweet nights in old Mexico  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
