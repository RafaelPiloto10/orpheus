Mama, I'm dying of a heart attack, heart attack, heart attack  
I love that girl, but she don't love me back  
My girl, she tells me that we're breaking up, breaking up, breaking up  
My heart can't handle the strain that's shaking it  
  
She tried to tell me not so long ago  
I would not listen but now I know  
  
Papa, I'm drinking for an overload, overload, overload  
The gun in my pocket is all ready to explode  
Papa, I'm dying of an overdose, overdose, overdose  
I tried to warn you, don't come too close  
  
I tried to tell you way back when we were young  
I tried to warn you there was something wrong  
Mama, I'm dying  
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying  
  
Heart attack
