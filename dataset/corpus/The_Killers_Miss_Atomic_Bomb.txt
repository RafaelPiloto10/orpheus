You were standing with your girlfriends in the street  
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be  
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes  
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirls' lies  
  
When I look back on those neon lights  
The leather seats, the passage rite  
I feel the heat, I see the light  
  
Miss Atomic Bomb  
Making out, we've got the radio on  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
  
Racing shadows under moonlight  
Through the desert on a hot night  
And for a second there we'd won  
Yeah, we were innocent and young  
  
Cast out of the night, well you've got a foolish heart  
So you took your place but the fall from grace was the hardest part  
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back  
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack  
Your soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black  
You should have seen your little face, burnin' for love  
Holdin on' for your life  
  
All that I wanted was a little touch,  
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no  
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time  
  
Miss Atomic Bomb  
Making out we've got the radio on  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
  
Racing shadows under moonlight  
We're taking chances on a hot night  
And for a second there we'd won  
Yeah we were innocent and young  
  
The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear  
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear  
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here  
Sweat on my skin  
And this love that I've cradled  
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)  
But I'm standing here and you 're too late  
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate  
  
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back (It's so cruel)  
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack (and you turn your
back, you're so)  
Your soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black (on a losing
game)  
You should have seen your little face, burning for love,  
(Miss Atomic Bomb)  
  
Holdin' on for your life  
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)  
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)  
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)
