I see I hear it's very clear  
Because the day has come when you have won  
It's myself I feel  
She calls me calls me the sun the sea yeah  
I know it's not for today  
It's not for today, it's for you and me yeah you and me  
  
Alone in my room you're there on the floor  
Open up your eyes let me get inside  
Learned to love on TV  
Learned to come on TV  
Can I help you?  
Can I guide you?  
  
It amazes me how I broke free  
Then got brought back in  
'Cause when the feelings there shattered and scared  
I know you've won goodbye I'm gone  
  
Alone in my room, you're there on the floor  
Open up your eyes let me get inside  
Said you learned to come on TV then hold on to me  
Can I help you? Can I guide you?
