I've been left out alone like a damn criminal  
I've been praying for help cause I can't take it all  
I'm not done,  
It's not over.  
  
Now I'm fighting this war since the day of the fall  
And I'm desperately holding on to it all  
But I'm lost  
I'm so damn lost  
  
Oh I wish it was over,  
And I wish you were here  
Still I'm hoping that somehow  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
In the blink of an eye  
I can see through your eyes  
As I'm lying awake I'm still hearing the cries  
And it hurts  
Hurts me so bad  
  
And I'm wondering why I still fight in this life  
Cause I've lost all my faith in this damn bitter strife  
And it's sad  
It's so damn sad  
  
Oh I wish it was over,  
And I wish you were here  
Still I'm hoping that somehow  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
Oh, your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark
