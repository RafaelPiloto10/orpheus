Catfish girl, makes it feel so fine  
Catfish girl, always pulling on my line  
When I see her smiling face, She get me every single time  
Yeah she does.  
Catfish girl, I miss you Lord I feel so blue  
Oh my Catfish girl, Oh and every little thing that you do  
Oh Catfish girl, I only want to be with you.  
Oh Catfish come on now...  
Ain't' that the prettiest thing you ever did see.........
