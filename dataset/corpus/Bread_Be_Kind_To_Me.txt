Be kind to me  
Be kind to me  
Be kind to me  
Oh baby and I'll show you the way  
  
Kindness is a virtue  
Come on now babe  
It won't hurt you to be  
A victim of kindness  
No more hesitations  
We don't need no  
Explanations this time  
We'll leave them behind us  
  
While you play the martyr  
You know you just  
make it harder for us  
To love one another  
So much indecision  
That don't mean you  
Got religion I think  
You're gonna discover  
  
Be kind to me
