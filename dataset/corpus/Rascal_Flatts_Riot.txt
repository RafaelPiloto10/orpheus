I'd be riding in a cab going downtown  
Finding faces I know in a big crowd  
Trying to drink the pain away, mmm  
And I'd be staying out all night, never going home  
Girl you know I'd lose all control  
If I lost you  
  
There would be a riot  
Breaking up my heart, I'd try to fight it  
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin  
If I said I could live and breathe  
Without you  
There'd be a lot of lonely  
Wishing and praying that you would hold me  
I would do most anything baby  
If only you would come back to me  
Come back to me  
There would be a riot  
Oh yeah, oooh  
  
I'd be checking on my phone every minute  
Waiting round for it to start ringin  
And praying it would be you  
I don't know what I'd do  
  
There would be a riot  
Breaking up my heart, I'd try to fight it  
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin  
If I said I could live and breathe  
Without you  
There'd be a lot of lonely  
Wishing and praying that you would hold me  
I would do most anything baby if only  
You would come back to me  
Come back to me  
There would be a riot  
If I ever lost you  
If I ever lost you  
  
There would be a riot  
Breaking up my heart, I'd try to fight it  
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin  
If I said I could live and breathe  
There'd be a lot of lonely  
Wishing and praying that you would hold me  
I would do most anything baby if only  
You would come back to me  
Come back to me  
There would be a riot  
If I ever lost you  
  
There would be, there would be a riot  
Breaking up my heart, I'd try to fight it  
There would be a riot  
If I ever lost you
