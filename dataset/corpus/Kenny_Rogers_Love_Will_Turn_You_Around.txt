You can run you can hide never let it inside  
Keep livin'' your life in the dark  
But sooner or later that gentle persuader  
Is gonna catch up with your heart  
Make you a dreamer, believer  
Believin'' in love  
  
Right when a man''s doin'' all that he planned  
And he thinks he''s got just what he needs  
Life will deliver a shock that will shiver  
And drivin'' him down to his knees  
Make him start givin'', livin''  
Livin'' again  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, it''s your mind, that tricks you in believin'' every time  
Love will turn you around, turn you around  
Well, it''s your heart, that talks you into to stayin'' where you are  
Love will turn you around, turn you around  
  
Out of the blue she reaches for you  
And you tell her you don''t have the time  
So you move away fast but you know it won''t last  
''Cause you can''t get her off of your mind  
Thoughts are burnin'', turnin''  
They''re turnin'' around  
  
How do you know when to stay or to go  
And how do you know when it''s real  
You don''t need a sign to make up your mind  
You got your heart at the wheel  
You want to start sharin'', carin''  
Carin'' again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love will turn you around, turn you around  
Love will turn you around, turn you around  
Turn you around
