Don't things change  
Don't we all  
What's it like to crash?  
The driver  
  
Nothing more to prove  
So please just send in the machines  
We know little of celebrations  
And how things are with you  
You're hung up on time  
You're hung up on age  
Now there's me  
Now there's me  
What is it like to  
Crash? The driver  
  
You drink to rumors and talk  
About someone new in your bed  
There is no game to win so  
Get out as fast as you can  
  
Hung up on 'the time'  
Hung up on 'my age'  
You don't know  
You don't know  
What it's like to  
Crash? The driver
