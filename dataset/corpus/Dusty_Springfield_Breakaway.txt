The springfields  
  
Breakaway, my heart is cryin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna tell myself don't sit and mourn  
Lookin' sad and so forlorn  
Tell myself I'm glad I'm born  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
  
Breakaway, the breeze is sighin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna pack a bag and get my coat  
Lock my door and leave a note  
Take a train or take a boat  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
  
I'll take me round from town to town  
I'll see the friends I knew  
I left 'em by the wayside  
But I know their hearts are true  
  
I'll give myself a holiday  
I need it oh-so bad  
And if I find a new love  
I'll be glad, glad, glad  
  
Breakaway, my heart is cryin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna find out what this world can give  
While I'm young I'm gonna live  
That's my plan, I'm positive  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
  
I'll take me round from town to town  
I'll see the friends I knew  
I left 'em by the wayside  
But, I know their hearts are true  
  
I'll give myself a holiday  
I need it oh-so bad  
And if I find a new love  
I'll be glad, glad, glad  
  
Breakaway, my heart is cryin'  
Breakaway, the time is flyin'  
So, I'm gonna find out what this world can give  
While I'm young I'm gonna live  
That's my plan, I'm positive  
Well, I'm gonna breakaway  
Gonna breakaway  
Gonna breakaway  
Breakaway  
Breakaway
