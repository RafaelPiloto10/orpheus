Well, I'd like to figure out where we stand Before darkness falls  
And I'd like to figure out Before too late  
Before hope is lost  
Cause the sun that's shining on my face  
Is shining down on you  
And the fruit that gives me strength to live  
Is giving you strength too  
  
Can we find a way to find a compromise  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
  
Well, I'd like to figure out a way  
To leave a troubled past behind  
To forget those angry words and wars we fought  
Across the battle lines  
Cause tomorrow we could find a road to peace  
For you and me  
And our children in their innocence  
Will follow what they see  
  
Oh, we've got to find a way to live our lives  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
  
Oh...how easy it would be  
To close the door and walk away  
I can't walk out when I believe  
You are my brother  
And we owe it to each other  
We've got to try  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
Oh...how easy it would be  
To close the door and walk away  
I can't walk out when I believe  
You are my brother  
And we owe it to each other  
We've got to try  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
  
Well, I'd like to find a way  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
  
Well, I'd like to figure out where we stand  
Before darkness falls...
