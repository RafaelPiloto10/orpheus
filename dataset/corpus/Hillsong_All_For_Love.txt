All for love the Father gave  
For only love could make a way  
All for love the heavens cried  
For love was crucified  
  
Oh how many times have I broken Your heart  
But still You forgive  
If only I ask  
And how many times have You heard me pray  
Draw near to me  
  
Everything I need is You  
My beginning, my forever  
Everything I need is You  
  
Let me sing all for love  
I will join the angels song  
Ever holy is the Lord  
King of Glory  
King of all  
  
All for a love a Saviour prayed  
Abba Father have Your way  
Though they know not what they do  
Let the Cross draw man to You
