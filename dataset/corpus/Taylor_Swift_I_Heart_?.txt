Wish I had concentrated,  
They said love was complicated,  
But it's something I just fell into.  
And it was overrated,  
But just look what I created,  
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.  
Before you ask me if I'm alright,  
Think about what I,  
Had to do, yeah  
  
Wake up and smell the break up,  
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,  
Another mess I didn't plan.  
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,  
Wish you could only see,  
I got an "I Heart ?"  
Written on the back of my hand!  
  
I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,  
But you had to talk about why  
You were wrong and I was right.  
But I can't believe you made me,  
Sit at home and cry like a baby,  
Wait right by the phone every night.  
And now you ask about you and I,  
There's no you and I,  
Remember what you put me through,  
I had to  
  
Wake up and smell the break up,  
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,  
Another mess I didn't plan.  
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,  
Wish you could only see  
I got an "I Heart ?"  
Written on the back of my hand!  
  
And when you're home all alone at night,  
You'll still wonder why  
You took everything I had, oh baby.  
I haven't thought about you and I,  
There's no you and I, and I know  
Someday you will  
  
Wake up and smell the break up,  
Realize that we won't make up,  
It didn't go the way you planned.  
And you'll know you didn't beat me  
When you look down and see  
I got an "I Heart ?"  
Written on the back of my hand!  
  
Written on the back of my hand!  
An "I Heart ?", yeah.  
Written on the back of my hand!
