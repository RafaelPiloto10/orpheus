[Chorus]  
My heart is set on You  
Oh, my heart is set on You  
No other love will do  
Oh, my heart is set on You  
  
I'm placing my life safely in Your keeping  
Knowing Your love is here to stay  
I'm holding on to You no matter what I'm feeling  
Ever always  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm alone, I know Your there beside me  
Feeding me on for all days  
Wherever I go I know Your hand will guide me  
Ever always  
  
Nothing else will do Your love is better  
My hearts set on You forever and ever  
Nothing else will do 'cause Your love is better  
My heart's set on You forever and ever  
  
[Chorus]
