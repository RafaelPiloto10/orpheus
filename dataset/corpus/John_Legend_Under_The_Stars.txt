[Intro]  
  
[Chorus]  
Here we are, under the stars  
Here we are, under the stars  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Under the stars  
  
[Verse 1]  
We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold  
We'll find an angel lying out in the snow  
We'll see a light to lead us all the way home and  
Wherever we go, we will know  
  
[Chorus]  
Here we are, under the stars  
Here we are, under the stars  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Under the stars  
  
[Verse 2]  
Let's raise a toast for all the good days to come  
Let's celebrate the season, come everyone  
Let's save a kiss for us when the night is done  
Oh my love, I'll keep you warm  
  
[Chorus]  
Here we are, under the stars  
Here we are, under the stars  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Under the stars  
  
[Bridge]  
All the lost and lonely  
All the lovers holding on  
All of us, no matter what we've done  
We are not alone although we're far apart  
We are one, under the stars  
  
[Chorus]  
Here we are, under the stars  
Here we are, under the stars  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Heaven is not so far  
Under the stars
