Hold on and don't give up  
Don't you worry  
You don't have to cry  
Cause He He sees what you're going through  
Yes Yes he does  
God is willing and He is able  
This did not catch him by surprise  
So just trust him  
And just oh step aside  
Be still and don't question it  
These obstacles they were allowed  
He wants to take you higher and higher  
If you will hold on  
God is willing and more than able  
This did not catch him by surprise  
So just trust him  
And just step aside  
Oh I know he's faithful  
My God is faithful  
To do what He said He'll do  
Now if He said just believe it  
There's nothing he can't do  
You must stand on His word (stand on His word)  
Put all your cares on him (give them to Him)  
Cause He knows and He loves you  
He did it for me that why I can say  
Step step aside  
God can work a miracle for you  
Step aside  
You got to let go  
And let God  
And let go and let God be God  
Move yourself out of the way  
Move your pride out of the way  
He'll never leave you  
Nor forsake you  
This what I know it ain't just what I heard  
So Thank You Lord for being awesome to me  
You're marvelous  
Praise him Praise Him  
Oh step aside  
Let go let go let go  
He knows what you go through  
He knows what you can bear  
He can do what you can't do  
So step so step so step aside  
Thank you Lord  
And you're in control  
So I step aside
