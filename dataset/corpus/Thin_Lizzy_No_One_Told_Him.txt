Hey, listen closely  
Listen while I tell you  
Why he loves you  
And what he misses mostly  
  
It's pointless his pretending  
He's got a broken heart  
A broken heart  
That needs mending  
  
You didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
He's going crazy  
He's reckless  
Without you, baby  
He's helpless  
  
It's deadly how you broke him  
He's a fool  
Without you, baby  
I'm not joking  
  
You didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
Now when I'm down  
My friends, they come around  
And when I'm upset  
My friends, they help me forget  
  
But how can he forget?  
He hasn't got a friend  
'Cause no one told him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
He's all washed up and washed out  
Without you, baby  
Every place he goes  
He's thrown out  
  
He's turned vicious  
He's malicious  
Just goes to show how much he misses  
You know what  
  
He wouldn't tell me  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
You didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
I couldn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
I didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again
