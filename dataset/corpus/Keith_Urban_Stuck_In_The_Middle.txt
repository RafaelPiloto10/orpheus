Well, I don't know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something ain't right  
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs  
Yeah clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Well, I'm stuck in the middle with you  
And I'm wondering what is I should do  
It's so hard to wipe this smile from my face  
Lose control and I'm all over the place  
Yeah clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Well, you started out with nothing  
And you're proud, you're a self-made man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, oh please"  
Oh no  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am  
Well, you started out with nothing  
And you're proud, you're a self-made man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, oh please"  
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something ain't right  
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And I'm wondering if I'll get down, get get down the stairs  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Here I am, well here I am stuck in the middle with you
