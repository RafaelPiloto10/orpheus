The lines are drawn in the sand across the caress of time  
The lines are drawn in the sand across the caress of time  
  
There's a face in the glass  
Looking through the mirror  
At the maze of my past  
It was never clearer  
  
On the distant horizon  
The sun approaches  
Better cover my eyes  
Better hide the roaches  
  
In the best of my time  
There was something better  
And the quest of my mind  
Was to try and get her  
  
Something simple and pure  
As the thoughts in my head  
Not the tears in the rain  
Over me she shed  
  
We were almost there  
Still I was unaware  
  
Here in the Brave New World's embrace  
I watch the parade begin  
Searching for one familiar face  
And I wonder where I fit in  
How will I know if there's a place  
For me in the Brave New World  
  
To be calm in the eye  
Of the human storm  
In house full of dreams  
I am safe and warm  
  
Looking back at a life  
Filled with warm embraces  
No regrets only memories  
Of smiling faces  
  
We were almost there  
Now change is in the air  
  
Until now I held the zone  
I ruled the world  
I called it home  
I never saw the down side  
  
See the now see the Zen  
There is no division  
Through the eyes of a child  
There is perfect vision  
  
And the best of our lives  
Resonate the hills  
And the sun's gonna shine  
And you know that I will
