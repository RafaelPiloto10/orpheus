You got a dream, you've got it bad  
But it's just another one of those fads  
Just a joke, gone up in smoke  
Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope  
Lost your money in a parking lot  
It was funny but it's all you've got  
You're walking home, with sticky clothes  
And a very healthy overdose  
Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Ain't got no shoes  
Ain't got no job  
Ain't got no decent banks to rob  
Ain't got no rent  
You pitch a tent  
But the parking meter money's spent  
You need a girlfriend like a kick in the head  
Sleeping all night solo with the grateful dead  
Yeah you know it ain't easy  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Chorus repeats  
You've got a dream, you've got it bad  
But it's just another one of those fads  
It's just a joke, gone up in smoke  
Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope  
You're walking home, with stiky clothes  
And a very healthy overdose  
Yeah you know it ain't easy  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child  
Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child
