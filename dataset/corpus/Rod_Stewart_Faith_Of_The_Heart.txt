It's been a long road,  
To get from there to here.  
It's been a long time,  
But my time is finally here.  
  
And I can feel a change in the wind right now.  
Nothing's in my way.  
And they're not gonna hold me down no more.  
No they're not gonna hold me down.  
  
Cause I've got faith of the heart.  
I'm going where my heart will take me.  
I've got faith to believe.  
I can do anything.  
I've got strength of the soul.  
And no one's going to bend or break me.  
I can reach any star.  
I've got faith,  
I've got faith,  
Faith of the heart.  
  
It's been a long night,  
Trying to find my way.  
Been through the darkness,  
Now I finally have my day.  
  
And I will see my dream come alive at last.  
I will touch the sky.  
And they're not gonna hold me down no more.  
No they're not gonna change my mind.  
  
Cause I've got faith of the heart.  
I'm going where my heart will take me.  
I've got faith to believe.  
I can do anything.  
I've got strength of the soul.  
And no one's going to bend or break me.  
I can reach any star.  
I've got faith,  
Faith of the heart.  
  
I know the wind's so cold,  
I've seen the darkest days.  
But now the winds I feel,  
Are only winds of change.  
I've been through the fire,  
And I've been through the rain,  
But I'll be fine.  
  
Cause I've got faith of the heart.  
I'm going where my heart will take me.  
I've got faith to believe.  
I can do anything.  
I've got strength of the soul.  
And no one's going to bend or break me.  
I can reach any star.  
Cause I've got faith,  
Cause I've got faith,  
Faith of the heart  
  
Faith of the heart.  
I'm going where my heart will take me.  
I've got faith to believe.  
And no one's going to bend or break me.  
I can reach any star.  
'Cause I've got faith,  
'Cause I've got faith,  
Faith of the heart...  
  
It's been a Long Road...
