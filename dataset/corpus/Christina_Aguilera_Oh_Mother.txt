Whoa, oh, yeah,  
  
She was so young with such innocent eyes  
She always dreamt of a fairytale life  
And all the things your money can't buy  
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy  
Then suddenly, things seemed to change  
It was the moment she took on his name  
He took his anger out on her face  
She kept all of her pain locked away  
  
Oh mother, we're stronger  
From all of the tears you have shed  
Oh mother, don't look back  
Cause he'll never hurt us again  
  
So mother, I thank you  
For all you've done and still do  
You got me, I got you  
Together we always pull through  
We always pull through  
We always pull through  
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother  
  
It was the day that he turned on his kids  
That she knew she just had to leave him  
So many voices inside of her head  
Saying over and over and over,  
"You deserve much more than this."  
  
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide  
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)  
So tired of defending her life, she could have died  
Fighting for the lives of her children  
  
Oh mother, we're stronger  
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)  
Oh mother, don't look back  
Cause he'll never hurt us again (he'll never hurt us again)  
  
So mother, I thank you (thank you)  
For all that you've done and still do (still do)  
You got me, I got you, (yeah you got me and I got you)  
Together we always pull through.  
We always pull through  
We always pull through  
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother  
  
All of your life you have spent  
Burying hurt and regret  
But mama, he'll never touch us again  
  
For every time he tried to break you down  
Just remember who's still around  
It's over, and we're stronger  
And we'll never have to go back again  
  
Oh mother, we're stronger  
From all of the tears you have shed  
Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)  
Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again)  
  
So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)  
For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)  
You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)  
Together we always pull through (always pull through)  
We always pull through  
We always pull through  
  
I love you mom
