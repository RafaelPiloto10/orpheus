She had an earthquake on her mind  
I almost heard her cry out as I left her far behind  
And knew the world was crashing down around her  
  
I sink to the ocean floor  
Because I know that we are more  
But I've made this mess  
I built this fire  
Are you still mine?  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause, baby, I'm not all right when you go  
I'm not fine  
Please be all mine  
I never want you to go because I am all yours  
So please be all mine  
  
She had an earthquake on her mind  
Apparently, the kind that would bury us alive  
By putting all this weight on us forever  
I lie here on the ocean floor  
Broken castle by the shore  
And I made this mess  
I built this fire  
Are you still mine?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me save us  
I've slaughtered us  
I've murdered our love  
I can taste it,  
This blood in my mouth  
This knife in my lungs  
Have I murdered our love?  
Have I murdered our love?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause, baby, I'm not all right  
Baby, I'm not all right when you go  
Please be all mine  
I never want you to go because I am all yours  
So please be all mine
