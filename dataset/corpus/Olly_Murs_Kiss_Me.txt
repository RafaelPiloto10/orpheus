[Verse 1]  
I want to love you, give you that loving baby  
Take it high with you, do what you like baby  
I got to find out, how you can be my lady  
I got to do things, do things to drive you crazy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We got one chance and I want it badly  
Do you feel like it's going the right way?  
Do you know what you're doing inside me?  
If you want that then bring that fire baby  
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it  
If you like that then we can go round it  
If you need that then tell me right now  
Baby cause I wanna know  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
  
[Verse 2]  
I want to show you, show you that good life baby  
You got my heartbeat, beating inside me lately  
I'm watching your lips move, can't hear a word you're saying  
Cause I want to do things, do things that drive you crazy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We got one chance and I want it badly  
Do you feel like it's going the right way?  
Do you know what you're doing inside me?  
If you want that then bring that fire baby  
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it  
If you like that then we can go round it  
If you need that then tell me right now  
Baby cause I wanna know  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh kiss me, oh hold me  
Let's go to a place, we'll never be lonely  
Oh I need you, I need you to hold me  
Oh baby, kiss me like you mean it  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
Kiss me like you mean it, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it
