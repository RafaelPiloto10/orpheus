While they dance  
How she holds him  
Pulls him close  
And loves him so  
While he dreams of another  
And counts the days  
Until he lets her go  
  
Same old story  
That everybody knows  
It's one heart holdin' on  
One letting go  
  
While they ride  
Lord he tells her  
How they two  
Will settle down  
But she only hears the highway  
And a voice  
In some other town  
  
And the harder  
He holds her  
The more she slips away  
  
Same old story  
That everybody knows  
It's one heart holdin' on  
One letting go  
Same old story
