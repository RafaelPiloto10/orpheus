Besides Yourself  
Before I let you all go  
Before I pull you from this show  
Before I wave to you  
I'd like to say to you  
I wish you never to be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Besides yourself what can you say  
Millions apart and miles away  
Besides yourself what do you need  
Some feel no pain while others bleed  
  
So if you're going to save my words  
Make sure it's this time you deserve  
Before I walk away  
I know your every day  
Will play before you on it's own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm not saying I'm not saying any wrong by you  
And I'm not saying I'm not talking my time for you  
  
[Chorus]
