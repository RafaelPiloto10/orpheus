I remember when it all first began  
We were tight right from the start  
It wasn't long before you came on strong  
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it)  
  
I played hard to get but I couldn't help  
I gave up my ironing  
You were thoughtful  
Careful not to hurt the relationship  
  
What happened to those days when  
You used to be compassionate  
Caring what I thought and said  
So attentive gentleman  
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set  
Taking me for granted lately  
Frankly, it's gotta quit  
  
I feel under appreciated  
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say  
I'm feeling underappreciated  
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment  
  
Back to the beginning, to the very beginning  
When our love was something new  
Back when romance was important  
Not just another thing to do  
  
I was feeling high on love tonight  
Thought I never come back down  
Now it seems that you and me  
Have lost our solid ground  
  
Half the time I realize  
I seem to give more than I get  
Funny how things seem to change  
After a few years commitment  
  
Used to talk for hours on end  
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed  
How I missed those days when you stayed awake  
Now you roll over and snore instead  
  
I feel under appreciated  
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say  
I'm feeling under appreciated  
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment  
  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I miss those nice massages  
The long for closeness  
The way you talk  
How it turned me on  
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips  
  
I needed those days back  
  
I feel under appreciated  
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say  
I'm feeling under appreciated  
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment
