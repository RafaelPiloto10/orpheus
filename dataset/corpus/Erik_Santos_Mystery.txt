The moment you walked through the door  
My heart stopped beating  
I know you've heard that line before  
Baby don't tease me..  
  
Somehow I knew that I met you before  
Without you I am lost  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Baby you're a mystery  
I know what you do to me  
And I know, coz love's a mystery  
Baby you're a mystery  
You walked into my dream  
And I know  
Coz you're a mystery  
  
The moment your eyes met mine  
I feel the passion  
I guess it's time to realize  
Anything can happen  
  
With your sweet kiss  
How can I miss your love  
Don't leave me hangin' on  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
How can I.. Each time you cry,  
Hold you endlessly..  
Will there ever be you and me?  
Baby it's here and now..  
  
[Repeat chorus]
