Momma I just killed a man  
My body still trembling can you feel my hand  
Don't she'd no tears, it won't be long before they find out it was me momma  
This may be the last time you see me free ma  
Don't spend it cryin'  
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'  
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police  
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep  
A drunk and high fool  
Skip a class, fluncking high school  
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned  
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned  
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed  
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned  
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy  
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me  
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me  
At times I wonder 'bout my father  
Would it change for me if he was around?  
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's  
Bum ass n-ggas no jobs, no life  
Seen them n-ggas killed for no price  
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light  
I pulled the trigger momma  
Tryna be hard, I aint mean to kill the n-gga momma  
But what's done is done  
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer  
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer  
  
Yeh, now I'm a killer  
Guess I'm a killer  
They got me in here with the killers  
Yeah I mean the killers  
  
I wonder what's in store for me  
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me  
Than just a simple life  
N-ggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life  
Gave up the jump shot  
Work on the john shot  
Who woulda thought I used to block this n-ggas lay ups  
Now he's in a cell layed up  
I wish you well, stay up  
Like insomniacs  
This life can make a n-gga fold like a laundry mat  
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain  
And so that I react slow, in this fast world  
Slow n-ggas, fast girls  
Hoes give up ass while these ho n-ggas hold triggers  
Blast on 'em  
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em  
Chalk lines by the do not park sign  
It's deep, all these cold hearted n-ggas holding heat  
I'd rather blast before they steal a n-gga  
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer  
  
Yeah, into a killer  
Don't make me turn into a killer  
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh  
  
To those who had love for me in the past  
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast  
I remember back in class we used to make believe  
Like it was draft day  
Swore that we would make the league, be rich  
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit  
Watch how they pile up  
Seem like a mile up  
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend  
Skating ring is where we headed tonight  
And if a n-gga disrespect, yes we ready to fight  
In retrospect that shit seemed petty  
At the time, the shit was heavy  
Cause life was all about your name  
You had to scrap with any n-gga that would call you lame  
Ashamed no doubt, so many n-ggas go they brains blown out  
Snatched a n-gga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries  
Another body in a cemetary  
Another young n-gga in the penetentiary  
And he don't give a f-ck no missionary  
Rap visionary, paint a picture n-gga pictionary  
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary  
I knew a n-gga that threw his d-ck in every chick in every city that he went
to  
Went hard like the rent do  
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict  
And he stay on with that thriller  
Shit, f-cking around with them killers  
  
Yeah, with them killers  
F-cking around with them killers  
Say I'm a killer
