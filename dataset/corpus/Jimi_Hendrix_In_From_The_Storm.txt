Well I,  
Just came back today  
I just came back from the storm  
Yeah  
I said, I just came back baby  
I just came back from the storm  
Yeah  
From the storm  
  
Well I did not know it then  
But I was sufferin', sufferin'!  
From the love that keep me born  
It was so cold and lonely, yeah  
The wind cryin' through the rain tared me up  
It was so cold and lonely  
Cryin' through rain was tearin' me up  
Woo  
A tearin' me up  
I want to thank you my sweat darlin'  
For diggin' in the mud, for diggin' me up  
  
It was a terrible rain burnin' my eyes  
The wind and lightning took us by surprise  
It was you my love who brought me in  
I love you so much, I'll never stray from you again  
Hey!  
  
I just came back, today  
I just came back today my baby on her way  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Good thing  
Good thing
