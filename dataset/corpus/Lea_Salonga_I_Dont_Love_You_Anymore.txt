I've been thinking  
It seems we're going nowhere  
You don't share my feelings  
It doesn't seem fair  
I guess there's nothing  
Much more I can do  
I know I've got to try  
And make it without you  
  
I don't love you anymore  
Can't you see, it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
There's nothing left to say  
I've gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
  
We've had bad times  
But that's no reason to go  
I can't live without you  
I need you, don't you know  
That I still love you  
Don't, don't do this to me  
You know I won't make it alone  
Can't you see  
  
I don't love you anymore Don't do this to me  
Can't you see it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
That's no reason to go  
There's nothing left to say  
I can't live without you  
I've gotta go my way  
Oh no  
  
I don't love you anymore  
Don't do this to me  
Can't you see it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
That's no reason to go  
There's nothing left to say  
I can't live without you  
I've gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
Okay  
If there's no other way  
Then, go
