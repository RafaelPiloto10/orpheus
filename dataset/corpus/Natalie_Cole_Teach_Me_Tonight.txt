Excuse me did you call yourself a love expert  
Studied, graduated and qualified to show me what it's all about?  
Honey, talk is cheap, you gonna have to convince me  
  
Did you say, I've got a lot to learn?  
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn  
Right here is the perfect spot to learn  
Teach me tonight  
  
Starting with the A, B, C of it  
Right down to the X, Y, Z of it  
Teach me the whole mystery of it  
Teach me tonight  
  
The sky's a blackboard high above us  
And if a shooting star should fly by  
I'll take that star and write, I love you, I love you  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing isn't very clear, my love  
Should the teachers stand so near, my love?  
Graduation's almost here, my love  
Come on and teach me tonight  
  
The sky's a blackboard high above you  
And if a shooting star should fly by  
I'll take that star and write, I love you  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing, one thing isn't very clear  
Should no teachers stand so near  
Graduation's almost here, my love  
Come on and teach me tonight  
Graduation's almost here, my love  
Teach me, teach me tonight
