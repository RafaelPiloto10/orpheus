Everybody's lookin' for somethin'  
Somethin' to fill in the holes  
We think a lot but don't talk much about it  
'Til things get out of control  
How do I know when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when it's love  
It's just something you feel together  
When it's love  
You look at every face in a crowd  
Some shine and some keep you guessin'  
Waiting for someone to come into focus  
Teach you your final love lesson  
How do I know when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when it's love  
It's just something you feel together  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh when it's love  
Oh oh oh oh  
You can feel it yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Nothing's missing  
Yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Nothing's missing  
How do I know when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
