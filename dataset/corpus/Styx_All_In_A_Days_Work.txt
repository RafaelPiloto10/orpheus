She wakes up from a dream, checks the mirror for reality  
She says "Come on girl, it's all in a day's work"  
Gets herself dressed just in time, disappears on the 8:05  
Oh the whistle blows and it's all in a day's work  
'Til she calls it a day  
  
Oh she smiles as he glances up from the swimsuit issue  
Oh she sighs as he walks away into the downtown day  
  
Day after day night after night  
Loneliness creeps in her window  
She locks the door, turns off the light  
Rehearsing a kiss on her pillow, she cries  
It's all in a day's work  
  
Turning pages while the memories pass  
Familiar faces from her senior class  
How the years go by when it's all in a day's work  
"Dearest Ruby, hope you reach your star  
Don't ever change, stay as sweet as you are"  
And when a teardrop falls she calls it a day's work  
She calls it a day  
  
Oh she waits by the telephone for the call he promised  
Oh it's late  
She puts her heart away for another day  
  
Day after day night after night  
Loneliness creeps in her window  
She locks the door, turns off the light  
Rehearsing a kiss on her pillow, she cries  
All in a day's work
