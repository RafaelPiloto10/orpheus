All I need is some inspiration  
Before I do somebody some harm  
I feel just like a vegetable  
Down here on the farm  
  
Nobody comes to see me  
Nobody here to turn me on  
I ain't even got a lover  
Down here on the farm  
  
They told me to get healthy  
They told me to get some sun  
But boredom eats me like ketchup  
Down here on the farm  
  
Drinking lemonade shanty  
Ain't no body gonna do me harm  
But I'm like a fish out of water  
Down here on the farm  
  
I write a thousand letters  
'Til my fingers all gone numb  
But I never see no postman  
Down here on the farm  
  
I call my baby on the telephone  
I say come down and have some fun  
But she knows what the score is  
Down here on the farm  
  
I can't fall in love with a wheat field  
I can't fall in love with a barn  
When everything smells like horse shit  
Down here on the farm  
  
Blue skies and swimming pools  
Add so much charm  
But I'd rather be back in Soho  
Than down here on the farm  
  
On the fucking farm!  
  
Are you born in a fucking barn or what?  
  
Baaaaaa!
