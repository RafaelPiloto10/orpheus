Weekend love  
Gonna spend a weekend love  
Weekend love  
Just a case of weekend love  
[Queen Latifah]  
Have you been misled  
Anything I said  
Didn't mean to turn you on  
The bite is oh so strong  
You got things to do  
But I have got things too  
So I'll catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays I don't see you then

A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D  
And a L-O-V-E we were meant to be  
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D

Seems it's been so long  
Since you thrilled me with your charms  
I tenderly imagine me  
Resting in your arms  
You've got things to do  
And I have got things too  
So I'll catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays, I don't see you then

Because we're sorry when we part  
And we love when we meet  
I know we only do that ?  
Once in a week  
Sorry when we part  
And we love when we meet  
I know we only do that ?  
Once in a week

I know, you know  
We all occupied  
From our own love life  
This has been denied  
Many feelins high  
Many tears of pride  
But by the weekend  
Let my spirit divide  
[Queen Latifah]  
Weekend love  
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday we'll change)  
Weekend love  
Just a case of weekend love  
[Queen Latifah]  
If you've been misled  
By anything I've said  
Didn't mean to turn you on  
The bite was oh so strong  
You've got things to do  
But I have got things too  
So I'll catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays I don't see you then

??????????  
To nourish and cherish every moment  
To deliver the goods I am ???  
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients  
Till the weekend the days seems to be long  
But by the weekend I wish I could reverse its time  
Good things can come in a small bag  
So let's make use of the time that we have  
When we are together 'cause we stay popular  
???????????  
When we are together you and I wonder  
If this love is gonna last forever  
Well then I think and I start remember  
That we are a ? star  
[Queen Latifah]  
Weekend love  
Gonna spend a weekend love  
Weekend love  
Just a case of weekend love
