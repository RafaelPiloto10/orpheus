Out on the street, dead on my feet  
At the mercy of the stone-cold night  
It's hard to compete  
In a dead-end street  
With frustration in your line of sight  
Do you ever stop to think  
Do you ever stop at all  
Do you have the time to feel  
And if you do  
Do you know the feeling's real  
  
Followed a sign that  
Pointed the way  
And I found myself  
Right back at that start  
I like to feel good  
I've tried feeling sad  
But I can't stand a broken heart  
Don't wanna wait till my dyin' day  
To realize  
I guess I'm lucky in  
A strange kinda way  
'cause it's clear before my eyes  
  
A gray cloud they say  
Hides a surprise  
But it rained until I lost my belief  
Just close your eyes  
We'll show you the way  
But I believe I've lost my faith  
One man speaks and one man does  
While another soul wields the sword  
I hear you all, but I still can't see  
Just who it is  
Who speaks the chosen word
