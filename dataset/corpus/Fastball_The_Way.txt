They made up their minds and they started packing  
They left before the sun came up that day  
An exit to eternal summer slacking  
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?  
They drank up the wine and they got to talking  
They now had more important things to say  
And when the car broke down they started walking  
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?  
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold  
It's always summer they'll never get cold  
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray  
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere  
They won't make it home but they really don't care  
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today  
The children woke up and they couldn't find 'em  
They left before the sun came up that day  
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em  
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?  
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold  
It's always summer they'll never get cold  
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray  
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere  
They won't make it home but they really don't care  
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today  
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold  
It's always summer they'll never get cold  
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and gray  
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere  
They won't make it home but they really don't care  
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today
