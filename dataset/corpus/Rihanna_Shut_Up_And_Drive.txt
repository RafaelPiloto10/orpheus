I've been looking for a driver who is qualified  
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride  
I'm a fine cool supersonics speed machine  
Got a sunroof top and a gangster lead  
  
So if you feel it let me know, know, know  
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for  
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode  
So start me up and watch me go, go, go  
  
[Chorus]  
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean  
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine  
Can you handle the curves, can you run all the lights  
If you can baby boy, than we can go all night  
Cause it's zero to sixty in three point five  
Baby you got the keys  
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive  
Shut up and drive, drive, drive  
  
I got class like a fifty-seven Cadillac  
Start over drive with a whole lot of boom in the back  
You look like you can handle what's under my hood  
You keeping saying that you will, boy I wish you would  
  
So if you feel it let me know, know, know  
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for  
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode  
So start me up and watch me go, go, go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You play that game, got what I got  
Get it get it, don't stop, it's a sure shot  
Ain't a Ferrari, huh boy, I'm sorry  
I ain't need to worry, so step inside  
And ride, ride, ride  
  
So if you feel it let me know, know, know  
Come on now what you're waiting for, for, for  
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode  
So start me up and watch me go, go, go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shut up and drive, drive, drive  
Shut up and drive, drive, drive  
Drive, drive, drive
