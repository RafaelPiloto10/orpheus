I've been living my life in a cage  
Freedom spits in my face  
It was such a disgrace  
And I was lonely  
And feeling empty  
Desperate  
  
I had my head in a noose  
I had nothing to loose  
Had enough of abuse  
And now I'm dangerous  
Hateful, contagious  
It haunts us  
  
I'm angry (I'm angry)  
I'm raging (I'm raging)  
I'm breaking through the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
The monster's loose  
And now you know the truth  
Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
The monsters loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove you can take it  
To the top before you fall  
  
I've walked a slippery road  
Felt a twitch in my soul  
Through the wind and the cold  
With no protection  
Just one direction  
Destruction  
  
I've paid for all my mistakes  
Taking all I can take  
Until I'm ready to break  
I'm feeling vicious  
And so outrageous  
It breaks us  
  
I'm leaving  
Still breathing  
I'm tearing through these chains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've lived a thousand years in darkness  
Banished all alone  
Inside my mind with just my madness  
Behind these walls of stone  
  
I was falling apart at the seams  
Holding my breath just to breathe  
I tasted the sting of my tears  
  
I was waking up stuck in a dream  
Ran out of air, couldn't screamed  
Wasted away by my fears  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you know the truth  
Tell me can you feel it  
As you hit the wall  
  
The monster's loose  
And now you have to choose  
And prove that you can take it  
To the top and never fall  
  
The monster's loose  
You've lost your last excuse  
Now show me that you got it  
Even when you fall  
  
The monster's loose  
This game is win or loose  
Sometimes you gotta' do it  
And show the world you want it all
