Here am I a sinner free,  
Pardoned by your majesty  
Love has led me into liberty  
Holy King upon the throne,  
You made this heart your very own  
I feel like the leper who's been healed  
  
I have known a love so sweet,  
A saving love that brings relief  
I healing love that makes the blind eye see  
King of love and Prince of Peace,  
Your shepherd's love is tending me  
A love that satisfies my deepest needs  
  
Lost and dirty yet you found me,  
Stained by sin but you have cleansed me  
Can it be I'm precious in Your sight?  
What is man and who am I? A child of God,  
My Father's pride.  
What a joy to be the Lord's delight  
  
Oh, oh, ohhhh, How can it be?  
How can it be that you would seek a friend in me?  
How can it be that I am precious in Your sight
