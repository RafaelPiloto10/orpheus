Took a plane to Cairo  
Then a Cessna to Rome  
I got hijacked to Tel Aviv  
And it's the first time that I've flown  
  
But I've found my Shangri-la  
In a place that's not too far, back home  
  
Took a train to Jordan  
And to Texas and back  
I met Lyndon B. Johnson and I felt his hand on my back  
  
But I found my Shangri-la  
In a place that's not too far, back home  
  
Back home, back home  
back home, back home  
back home, back home  
(repeat back home and fade)
