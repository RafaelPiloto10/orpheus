Never thought I'd fall in love again  
To find the pieces of the puzzle  
Life cannot begin  
The search begins with knowing  
I need you  
Could not imagine in my dreams  
That you need me too  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart  
There was an empty void inside my heart  
I tried to fill the space with anything  
But left it in the dark  
Then a blessing came in the form of you  
Now I know that God has smiled on me too  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart  
I didn't know when it would come  
All I know is that I wanted someone  
To take me far away from my loneliness  
So I thank you, I thank you coming  
Into my life  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart
