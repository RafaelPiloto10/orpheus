Ask your mommy and daddy, "What happened to the Indian?  
How come they're all living in places  
With too much snow or too much sand?"  
Tell your mommy, "I got a funny feeling deep inside of me"  
Ask your daddy, "Is it really as bad as people make it seem?"  
  
Wa ta tick it ta too too  
Ask your mommy why everybody swallows all those little pills  
Ask your daddy why that soldier doesn't care who he kills  
After they've put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed  
Whisper, "Mommy and Daddy would you rather that  
I learned it from my friends, instead?  
Do you think I'm to young to know, to see, to feel, or hear  
My questions need an answer or a vacuum will appear"  
  
Don't be surprised if they turn and walk away  
And tell your mommy and daddy that you love them anyway  
That you love them anyway  
Give them a kiss  
Love will set you free
