A certain type of wind has swept me up  
But till it's found each bone  
I, I'm overcome  
There is an icy breath that escapes my lips  
And I am lost again  
A certain type of darkness is stalling me  
Under a quite mask of uncertainty  
I wait for light like water from the sky  
And I am lost again  
  
In the sea of lovers without ships  
And lovers without sign  
You're the only way out of this  
Sea of lovers losing time  
And lovers losing hope  
Will you let me follow you  
Wherever you go  
Bring me home  
  
A certain type of silence's filled my voice  
A scream beneath the water make no noise  
All my prayers go quiet and never heard  
And I am lost again  
  
In the sea of lovers without ships  
And lovers without sign  
You're the only way out of this  
Sea of lovers losing time  
And lovers losing hope  
Will you let me follow you  
Wherever you go  
Bring me home  
  
A certain type of wind has swept me up  
But till it's found each bone

There is an icy breath that escapes my lips  
And I am lost again  
  
In the sea of lovers without ships  
And lovers without sign  
You're the only way out of this  
Sea of lovers losing time  
And lovers losing hope  
You're the only way out of this  
Sea of lovers without ships  
And lovers without sign  
You're the only way out of this  
Sea of lovers losing time  
And lovers losing hope  
Will you let me follow you  
Wherever you go  
Bring me home
