When I think back to the  
first time in my childhood  
When I saw that face  
I thought right then,  
'That's a real good looking boy'  
  
I saw myself in the mirror  
in profile  
for the first time  
I thought,  
'Hey! That's a real good looking boy'  
  
And I felt then  
that I moved  
With all those lucky bucks and angels  
High in the theatre  
In the sky  
  
So I ran to my mother  
I said,  
'Mom take a look at me  
Have you ever seen a teen  
Fly so high?'  
  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
  
She said,  
'Son, well, you know,  
you're an ugly boy.  
You don't really look like him  
  
In this long line  
There's been some  
real strange genes  
You've got 'em all  
You've got 'em all  
With some extras thrown in'  
  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
  
Wise men say  
Only fools, only fools rush in  
But I, I can't help  
Falling in love, in love with you  
  
Now I'm here with you little darling  
And you say, 'You're beautiful as you are'  
And I've managed somehow to survive  
  
You arrived in my life like a fragrance  
You helped me find a way to laugh  
Now I know where my so-called beauty lies  
  
God gave him a face  
Then he gave me something above  
God gave me a grace  
Then he gave me your sweet, sweet, sweet love  
  
You make me feel like I'm a real good looking boy  
I feel I'm a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy  
That's a real good looking boy
