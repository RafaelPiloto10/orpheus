Watching all the insects march along  
Seem to know just right where they belong  
Smears a face reflecting in the chrome  
Hiding in the crowd, I'm all alone  
No one's heard a single word I've said  
They don't sound as good outside my head  
It looks as though the past is here to stay  
I've become a million miles aw-  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
  
All the jagged edges disappear  
Colors all are brighter when you're near  
The stars are all afire in the sky  
Sometimes I get so lonely, I could  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
Why do you get all the love in the world?  
[repeat]
