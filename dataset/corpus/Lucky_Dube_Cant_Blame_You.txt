Trying so hard not to cry  
Since they say man ain't supposed to cry  
But these tears keep running from my eyes  
I remember the day I came to the city.  
My children were crying  
My wife was crying  
She's gonna lose me  
To the girls in the city  
To make her feel alright I  
said it's impossible  
But I was wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't blame you when you're going  
This is something you've got to do  
You've got to go ho ho.  
You've been keeping me here all these years as your private lover  
Letters came from home  
But I never answered  
'Till today when I got this letter  
From my little daughter saying  
"Missing you daddy."  
It's time to go.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Can't blame you (as above)  
See me now, see me no more  
I heard that whistle blow  
I knew it's time to go  
Sitting here in this train  
Going so fast past the trees  
I'm thinking of words to apologize  
'Cause sorry ain't enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Can't blame you (till fade)
