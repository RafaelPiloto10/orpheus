As I lay me down  
Heaven hear me now  
I'm lost without a cause  
After giving it my all  
  
Winter storms have come  
And darkened my sun  
After all that I've been through  
Who on earth can I turn to  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
After losing my breath  
There's no more fighting left  
Sinking to rise no more  
Searching for that open door  
  
And every road that I've taken  
Led to my regret  
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it  
Nothing to do but lift my head  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Oh yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
(my levies have broken, my walls have come)  
  
Coming down on me  
  
(crumbling down on me)  
  
All the rain is falling  
  
(the rain is falling, defeat is calling)  
  
Set me free  
  
(I need you to set me free)  
  
Take me far away from the battle  
I need you  
Shine on me  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength has gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
I look to you  
I look to you
