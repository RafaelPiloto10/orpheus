Realising a form out of stone.  
Set hands moving.  
Roan shaped his heart  
Through his working hands.  
Work to mold his passion into clay, like the sun.  
  
In his room, his lady  
She would dance and sing so completely.  
So be still he now cries  
I have time, oh let clay transform thee so.  
  
In the deep cold of night  
Winter calls, he cries "Don't deny me!"  
For his lady, deep her illness.  
Time has caught her  
And will for all reasons take her.  
  
In the still light of dawn, she dies.  
Helpless hands soul revealing.  
  
Like leaves we touch we learn.  
We once knew the story.  
As winter calls he will starve.  
All but to see the stone be life  
  
Now Roan, no more tears.  
Set to work his strength.  
So transformed him  
Realising a form out of stone. His work  
So absorbed him.  
Could she hear him?  
Could she see him?  
All aglow was his room dazed in this light.  
He would touch her  
He would hold her.  
Laughing as they danced.  
Highest colors touching others.  
  
Did her eyes at the turn of the century  
Tell me plainly  
When we meet, how we'll love, oh let life so transform me.  
  
Like leaves we touched we danced.  
We once knew the story.  
As autumn called and we both  
Remembered all those many years ago.  
I'm sure we know.  
  
Was the sign with a touch  
As I kiss your fingers.  
We walk hands in the sun.  
Memories when we're young.  
Love lingers so.  
  
Was it sun through the haze  
That made all your looks  
As warm as moonlight?  
As a pearl deep in your eyes,  
Tears have flown away,  
All the same light.  
  
Did her eyes at the turn of the century  
Tell me plainly  
When we meet how we'll look  
As we smile time will leave me clearly.  
  
Like leaves we touch, we see.  
We will know the story.  
As autumn calls we'll both remember  
All those many years ago.
