Mary and Joseph drove into town,  
Searching for a place to stay.  
The moon was up, and his foot was down  
A miracle was on its way.  
  
They tried the hotels, the motels, the bed-and-breakfast  
Locals, but no one seemed to have any room.  
  
Better find a double room soon!  
  
[Chorus]  
So where would Christmas be without  
Mary and Joseph?  
Walk of the Wise?  
Laurel and holly?  
Cracker Surprise?  
Lights on the pine tree?  
And more aftershave?  
I'm not forgetting Jesus who was born on Christmas Day!  
  
They found a place with the neon lights  
TV, Pool, and Vacancies  
The man at the desk didn't hear them right  
When the two of them booked for three.  
  
They watched the TV  
And deeply, she thought about the needing  
Of the heavens to deliver this way  
And it happened on Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary and Joseph were so surprised  
With admirers around the crib  
There was something in their son's eyes  
They identically took one in.  
  
Like a Messiah, and a Fire  
Like the tread around a tire  
That grip all roads  
It's to bond you there.  
  
And it happened on Christmas Day!  
Christmas day.  
Christmas day.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Not forgetting Jesus."
