When I was a little girl  
I used to have a dream  
Now that I'm older  
I wake up to find it isn't as good as reality  
Cause you are here with me  
I was wishing on a star out in the universe  
Now that I'm wiser I finally find that all I need is here on Earth  
Cause you are here with me  
  
Oh, I, I take a breath in and realise  
That I'm, I'm living the good life  
  
Thinking back to long ago, you were the mystery  
All of the visions that I ever had could never live up to what I see  
Cause you are here with me  
  
Oh, I, I take a breath in and realise  
That I'm, I'm living the good life  
The good life Oooh, oooh, oooh...  
I'm living the good life  
The good life  
  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life
