Ooh  
[Kelly]  
Watchin every motion in  
The foolish lovers game. On  
This endliss ocean Finally lovers  
No shame. Turning and returning to  
Some secert place inside watchin in slow  
Motion as you turn around and say my love  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
[Kalan]  
Watching I keep waiting  
Still anticipating love never  
Hisating to become the faded  
Ones. Turning and returning to  
Some secert place inside watching  
In slow motion as you turn around  
And say  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
[Both]  
Through the hour glass  
I saw you in time you slipped away  
When the mirrior crashed I called to you  
And say  
  
[Kelly]  
If only for today I'am unfraid  
  
Repeat Chours  
  
[Kelly]  
Ohh you take my breath away kalan.  
Ohhh  
  
[Both]  
TAKE MY BREATH AWAY  
  
[Chours: Both]  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
[Repeat till fade]
