Well she got up every morning and she waited in the cold  
Got on the stinking yellow school bus and did what she was told  
And she stared out the window, all the way down to high school.  
She went to home economics just like all the other girls  
  
Making chicken a la king and peanut butter swirls  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better somewhere.  
Well the boys in the school, they were just a bunch of fools  
And they acted like a bunch of bad bumpkins.  
  
But she went out with this guy 'cause she knew a girl's gotta do something.  
He showed her pictures of his car (pictures of his car!),  
Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.  
  
She wasn't meant to stick around here, and be some quarterback's wife  
She wasn't meant to stick around here, be barefoot and pregnant the rest  
of her life...  
Well she got up every morning and she waited in the cold  
  
Got on the stinking yellow cab, put the money through the hole  
And she stared out the window, all the way down Fifth Avenue.  
She went on all the cattle calls just like all the other girls  
And she waited by the phone in her rollers and her curls  
  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better.  
Well she ran into this guy who was down at 54  
Had a lot of gold and chains and he got her in the door,  
And he knew so many people, and he made her lots of pretty promises.  
  
He showed her pictures of his car (pictures of his car!),  
Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.  
He showed her pictures of his car (pictures of his car!),  
  
Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.  
Ohhhh, she's on the zoom, she's on the zoom.
