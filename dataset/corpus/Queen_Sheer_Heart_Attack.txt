Well you're just seventeen - all you wanna do is disappear  
You know what I mean there's a lot of space  
Between your ears  
The way that you touch don't feel nu nu nothin'  
Hey hey hey hey, it was the D.N.A.  
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?  
  
Sheer heart attack  
Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar - ticulate  
  
Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like a paralyse  
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise  
Turn on the T.V. let it drip right down in your eyes  
Hey hey hey hey, it was the D.N.A.  
Hey hey hey hey hey, that made me this way  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?  
  
Sheer heart attack  
Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar - ticulate  
Just how I feel  
Do you know, do you know, do you know. do you know, just how I feel ?  
  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel ?  
  
Sheer heart attack  
Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac
