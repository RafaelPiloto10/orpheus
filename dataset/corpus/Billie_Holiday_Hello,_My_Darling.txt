I'll forget your tender kiss  
I'll be brave after this kiss  
I'll say "Hello my darling"  
It we should meet again  
  
You'll forbid the tears to slip  
You'll behave, bite your lip  
And say "Hello my darling"  
If we should meet again  
  
If we do meet again  
Our moments can't be sweet again  
Oh my love, go my love  
Though it's a bitter pill, I know my love  
  
Please remember not to sigh  
Over this last goodbye  
Just say "Hello my darling"  
If we should meet again
