I want to tell you a story  
Every man ought to know  
If you want a little loving  
You got to start real slow  
She's going to love you tonight now  
If you just treat her right now  
  
Squeeze her real gentle  
Got to make her feel good  
Tell her that you love her  
Like you know you should  
So if you don't treat her right  
She won't love you tonight  
  
If you practice my method  
Just as hard as you can  
You're going to get a reputation  
As a loving man  
And you'll be glad every night  
That you treated her right
