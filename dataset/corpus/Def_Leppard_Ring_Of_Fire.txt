Fun girl, you tempted me, a feast of sparks  
In the night is what I need  
Ooh I'm a-ready to roar, and I'm a-ready for more  
And I'm a-ready to burn like the light into the dawn  
  
Oh I gotta see the fire in me, turning into ecstasy  
So stick around and settle down enjoy the mystery  
A voice in the wilderness, there's somethin' in the air  
A little love won't bring your precious self a secret flame  
  
Fun girl  
(Are you ready, ready for fun girl?)  
Feels like fire  
(Are you ready, ready for fun girl?)  
Ring of fire  
  
I left, so indiscreet, you're stealing all of the fire  
Electric me  
I'm staring into the sun, I'm staring into a gun  
I'm staring at the sky, turn it out and let it burn  
  
Fun girl  
(Are you ready, ready for fun girl?)  
Feels like fire  
(Are you ready, ready for fun girl?)  
Ring of fire  
  
Fun girl, you tempted me, ya cut me up  
Like a knife so tenderly  
Oh I gotta see the fire in me, burning up my ecstasy  
A little love won't bring your precious self a secret flame.  
Oh no  
  
Fun girl  
(Are you ready, ready for fun girl?)  
Feels like fire  
(Are you ready, ready for fun girl?)  
Ring of fire  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh
