[Chorus]  
All my ex's live in Texas  
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be  
But all my ex's live in Texas  
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee  
  
Rosanna's down in Texarkana  
Wanted me to push her broom  
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene  
She forgot I hung the moon  
And Allison's in Galveston  
Somehow lost her sanity  
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's  
Got the law looking for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I remember that old Frio River  
Where I learned to swim  
But it brings to mind another time  
Where I wore my welcome thin  
By transcendental meditation  
I go there each night  
But I always come back to myself  
Long before daylight  
  
All my ex's live in Texas  
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be  
But all my ex's live in Texas  
Therefore I reside in Tennessee  
  
Some folks think I'm hidin'  
It's been rumored that I died  
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee
