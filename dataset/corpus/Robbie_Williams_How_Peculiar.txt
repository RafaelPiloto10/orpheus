I am all of the above babe  
Johnny long strokes to the grave  
Saving all the stamps and spend it on a kettle  
  
Rub me rub me up right lovely  
If you lick it, then lick it battery  
Good and properly all night if you want  
  
I haven't got a clue what to do with you  
I need for you to love me so much  
Jesus what am I gonna do with this crush  
Just get the old fella and wack it up against her tush  
  
How peculiar  
  
Bend your long legs against the sofa  
In the Dorchester you can get your All Bran  
I'm not into hard sports  
  
Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you  
Jesus all the things my head is going through  
God what am I going to do with this crush  
Just wack the old man out and get it up against your tush  
  
How peculiar  
  
Jesus what am I to do man  
I am a depressed man  
Not sure what I'm doing all of the day  
How peculiar  
  
I am all of the above man  
I have what you want man  
If you want me here I am  
Come and get it baby
