I had no reason for shopping this season  
But I hung your stocking today  
It makes me feel better  
Though we're not together  
You'll always be in my heart  
Merry Christmas, wherever you are  
Since it was Christmas  
I thought you might call  
Or have you stopped thinkin' about me at all  
It'd be a perfect white Christmas  
A storybook picture  
If I could just share it with you  
Though you're not here with me  
I've got your memories  
They keep me goin' sweetheart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are  
Though you're not here with me  
I've got your memories  
You'll always be in my heart  
Merry Christmas wherever you are  
Tag:  
Merry Christmas wherever you are
