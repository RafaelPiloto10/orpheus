So you're trying to make connection, you heard whispers in the hall  
She'll be out again this evening, when you come around to call  
So, you dodge the lady-killer, who came creepin' 'cross the floor  
Then you caught up in a whirlwind, you got blown right out the door  
  
Oh, yes it was a whirlwind, sweet romance was on your side  
If you wanna dance on my face, you must tell me why you lied  
  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
When you try to believe her just a little too much  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
  
I see a look of recognition, so well hidden in your eye  
And your peepshow regulations, they just don't seem to apply,  
Well, did I see you in the circus, in the ring without a hand  
Now you think that you can curse us, steal the show and stop the band  
  
Oh, you can follow your dreams, oh but please don't lead me on,  
If you wanna bleed in my face, you were here and now you're gone  
  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
When you try to believe her just a little too much  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch
