This sunny Sunday  
Is a good day to go  
Guess you want me to stay  
Well let me know  
And I hate to say  
It's been a waste of time  
I hate to interrupt the flow  
  
[Chorus]  
Why, Why, Why  
Hushabye  
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?  
Why, Why, Why  
Hushabye  
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?  
  
You say you'd love to  
But you've lost what's left to do  
Almost decided to stay because of you  
And I'm here today to exchange your dreams  
For one more ticking of your time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why, why  
What you hanging up for?  
What you doing that for?  
What you breakin' up for?  
Why, hushabye  
  
I hate to interrupt the flow  
For one more ticking of your time  
  
Soothing Sunday is a good day to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hushabye  
Why, why, why I  
What you breaking up for?  
Why, why  
Hushabye
