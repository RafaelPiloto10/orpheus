I can still remember my first guitar  
Bright and shiny like a brand new car  
Even took it with me when I went to school  
And I practiced every day till I got real good  
  
I learned every lick on the radio  
From Wabash Cannon to Go Johnny Go  
I majored in rhythm with a minor in blues  
Then I hit the road with my blue suede shoes  
  
[Chorus]  
And I dreamed of seeing my name in lights  
Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night  
Standing where my heroes stood  
Hillbilly Hollywood  
  
I played some bars where you never want to go  
From Oklahoma City down to Tupelo  
My ears would be ringing like an old fire bell  
When I'd lay me down in some cheap hotel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I pray before too long  
They will hear my song  
  
And I dreamed of seeing my name in lights  
Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night  
Standing where my heroes stood  
I dreamed grand old Opry on a Saturday night standing  
Hillbilly Hollywood  
Hillbilly Hollywood  
Hillbilly Hollywood
