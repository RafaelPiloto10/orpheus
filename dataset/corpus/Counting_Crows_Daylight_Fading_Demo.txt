Sunday morning paper dated 1992  
There are cowboys in my kitchen  
Empty bottles on the roof  
I've been trying to quit these cigarettes  
I've been trying to think it's true  
Maybe she's gone to California  
Maybe I'll go out there too  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before it's gone  
Daddy's on the rooftop with his fingers in  
The gun and I am waiting at the window I am  
Waiting for the one  
Shying in that paper when she walked into my room I said I want to  
Say good-bye to you good-bye to all my friends good-bye to everyone I know  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before it's gone  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before it's gone
