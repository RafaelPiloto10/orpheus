Strolling along country roads with my baby.  
It starts to rain, it begins to pour.  
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin.  
I feel a shiver run up my spine.  
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
  
After a while we run under a tree.  
I turn to her and she kisses me.  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.  
Sharing our love under stormy skies.  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.  
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feelinside
