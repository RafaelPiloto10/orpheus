Only brokenhearted, life's not over  
I can start again  
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted  
Its a hurting, thing to get over  
  
I'm young but I'm wise enough to know  
That you don't fall in love overnight  
That's why I thought if I took my time  
That everything in love would be right  
Oh, oh  
  
But as soon as I closed my eyes  
I was saying to love "good-bye"  
  
[Chorus]  
But I guess I'm only brokenhearted  
Life's not over I can start again  
While I'm lonely brokenhearted  
Its a hurting thing to get over  
  
No more empty conversations  
Next time I will be totally sure, oh  
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love  
Its more than my poor heart should endure  
  
So I'll listen to all advice  
And remember each time I cry  
  
Chorus  
  
Da, da, da, da, da-ha whoa.  
  
Chorus  
  
Think about you all the time  
  
Never thought Id be alone again  
That's why I asked you to be my best friend  
You know you're always on my mind  
Think about you all the time  
  
You know what I'm saying?  
  
Oh baby
