Well there was a time when life caught you by surprise.  
What you see going by is a shadow.  
You've got to live in front of your eyes.  
In a typical way we stray, checking back with the past.  
In a typical day we'll stay to see what's gonna last.  
But I didn't mind at all.  
  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
  
Well there was a place we'd chase through the woods in my juvenile days.  
What a typical waste of space, what a wonderful place to stay.  
But I could have cried but I just left my soul to fly.  
And I could have chilled at will, but I didn't know how to die.  
But I didn't mind at all.  
  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
  
No, I've been woken, and I have been broken.  
But this time it's gonna change  
For,  
I've been lazy, and I been crazy.  
Has been stolen,  
But from,  
From this day on I swear to you true.  
From this day on I swear to you.  
Well there was at time when I could have flown out of the room.  
Yet I didn't care just where I was going after noon.  
Though I didn't know and I chose to live my life so fair.  
And I could have died, but I chose to live here instead  
But I didn't mind at all.  
  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
  
I've been woken, and I have been broken  
But this time its gonna change  
For, I've been lazy and I have been crazy  
But this time it's not hazy at all  
Cause I've been,  
I've been chose my heart has been stolen  
But from,  
From this day on, I swear to you true.  
From this day on, I swear to you true.  
I say now way back when you and all your friends  
Had some good times we should do this again we'd say  
Hey, hey, hey we should do this again, we'd say.  
But in the mean meanwhile, I'll just walk the mile.  
I won't look back won't forget your smile  
Oh no, hey hey hey we should do this again, we'd say.  
But I swear to you true.  
From this day on I swear to you true I swear I do I.  
  
No.  
I won't give you back.  
No.  
Won't give you back.  
No.  
Won't give you back.  
No.  
Can't give you back.  
No.  
I won't give you back my baby.  
Said I can't give you back.  
No.  
Said I won't give you back.  
No.  
I swear to you true.  
  
From this day on I swear to you true.  
I swear.  
I do, I.  
God, I do.  
My baby, I swear to you true.  
I swear, I do.
