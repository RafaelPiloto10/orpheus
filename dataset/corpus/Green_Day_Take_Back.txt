You pushed me once too far again  
I'd like to break you fucking teeth.  
Stick a knife in the center of your back.  
You better grow some eyes in the back of your  
Head. I fight dirty, just like your looks.  
Can't take, can't take, can't take anymore.  
Take back, take back, take.  
The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue.  
An eye for an eye. Gun for a gun.  
Cold-cocked and I'm taking back what's mine.  
Expect it when you're least expecting it.  
No loss of love, the smell of regret.  
Lights out  
Can't take anymore  
Shit
