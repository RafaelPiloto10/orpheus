Oh...  
I know I'm unloveable  
You don't have to tell me  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
Oh...  
  
I know I'm unloveable  
You don't have to tell me  
Oh, message received  
Loud and clear  
Loud and clear  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
  
I know I'm unloveable  
You don't have to tell me  
For message received  
Loud and clear  
Loud and clear  
Message received  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
  
I wear black on the outside  
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside  
I wear black on the outside  
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside  
  
And if I seem a little strange  
Well, that's because I am  
If I seem a little strange  
That's because I am  
  
But I know that you would like me  
If only you could see me  
If only you could meet me  
  
Oh...  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
I don't have much in my life  
But take it - it's yours  
Mmm...  
Oh...
