You know it  
You show it  
And the time has come  
To shoot you down  
What a sound  
When the day is done  
And it all works out  
  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
  
You know it  
You show it  
And the time has come  
To shoot you down  
What a sound  
When the day is done  
And it all works out  
  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
  
I never wanted  
The love that you showed me  
It started to choke me  
And how I wish I'd said  
No too slow  
I couldn't take  
That too fast  
I want you to know  
  
You know it  
You show it  
But I can't back down  
It's far too late  
I can't wait  
Now the time has come  
It'll all work out  
And when this  
Thing is done  
It'll leave no doubt  
So when you've  
Had your fun  
Will you all walk out ?  
  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming
