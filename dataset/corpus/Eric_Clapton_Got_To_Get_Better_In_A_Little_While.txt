Don't you know what's wrong with me?  
I'm seeing things I don't want to see.  
Sniffing things that ain't no good for me.  
I'm going down fast, won't you say a prayer for me?  
  
It's got to get better in a little while.  
It's got to get better in a little while.  
It's got to get better in a little while.  
It's got to get better in a little while.  
  
The sun's got to shine on my guitar someday.  
  
Revolution all across the land.  
Just like Sly, you got to take a stand.  
Please don't hurt nobody, don't knock them down
