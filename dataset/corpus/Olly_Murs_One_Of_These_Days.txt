One of these days I'm gonna find someone to love  
One of these days I'll find you if I don't give up.  
  
Time is going by, I'm only getting older  
Middle of the night, it's only getting colder  
Are you cold out there too?  
  
My room is big enough for the both of us  
So won't you come around? Help me fill it up  
'Cause I'm sitting here in all this space  
Why don't you come and show your face?  
  
One of these days I'm gonna find someone to love (Ahhh)  
One of these days I'll find you if I don't give up (Ahhh)  
  
Time is going by, I'm only getting older  
Middle of the night, it's only getting colder  
Are you cold out there too?  
  
My room is big enough for the both of us  
So won't you come around? Help me fill it up  
Oh I'm sitting here in all this space  
Why don't you come and show your face?  
  
Ooooh! Oooh, yeah  
  
One of these days I'm gonna find someone to love  
One of these days I'll find you cause I won't give up
