Goodbye desperado  
If they hadn't sucked out all the poison  
From your veins you'd be dead by now  
Too late frida kahlo  
You could have the power of the phoenix  
And the flame if you knew just how  
  
Come the hour  
Come the mantra  
Repeat in defeat with the pots and the pans  
Walk away  
Walk on water  
They're young then they're old then they don't give a damn  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Sleepless situation  
Shaken by the clatter of the clinking  
On the bars of your private jail  
Twisted ultimatum  
Searching for a lifeline or a band aid  
For your sins in the morning mail  
  
Tow the line  
Floating islands  
They're here and they're now but they're oceans away  
Tie them down  
Baby lions  
You'll bleed and you'll plead and you'll beg them to stay  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Don't be afraid now  
Your cover is blown  
Don't shed a tear now  
Your babies are grown
