Well I heard you sold them America  
You said it was built to last  
Price is right, the time is now  
You said it was going fast  
  
Well I've got my beliefs  
And I don't agree with a single word you say  
A convincing smile, a twist of truth  
You seem to get your way  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head  
  
Well they call you Mr Cover  
A predator at heart  
A man who's reputation  
Was dangerous from the start  
You lie and you steal, cheat and you rob  
Sold anything you could  
You never had a second thought for people that you hurt  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head  
  
It's been so many years  
Well you've hurt so many people  
As you've singed their lives away  
Do you ever spare a moment's thought about the price they have to pay?  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head...
