You've been talking in your sleep again.  
About the way you've been pulling my heart strings  
When I think I'm on my feet again,  
I fall down,  
Oh I fall down  
  
At forty seven Park Avenue  
Loud is the singing down in the bar room  
So lonely  
I wish I was in paradise  
  
The broken lover in me, girl  
Has been fixed in my memory  
Lay your love, lay your love on me  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love, love I gave away  
I gave away  
  
You've been making those eyes again  
Down in the city and up in your ivory tower  
One day soon you're gonna reach out and call my name  
  
Yeah, the broken lover in me girl  
Has been fixed in my memory  
Lay your love, lay your love on me  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love, love I gave away  
Oh, I gave away  
Oh, I gave away  
  
Love's got me down on my knees again  
There's no easy, no easy way out  
There's no easy way out  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away,  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, oh baby  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
I gave away  
I gave away  
I gave away
