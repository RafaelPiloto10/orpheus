I'm an outsider outside of everything  
I'm an outsider outside of everything  
I'm an outsider outside of everything  
Everything you know  
Everything you know  
It disturbs me so  
  
Everybody tried to push me push me around  
Everybody tried to put me try to put me down  
  
All messed up, hey everyone I've already had  
All my fun more troubles are gonna come  
I've already had all my fun  
  
I'm an outsider outside of everything  
I'm an outsider outside of everything  
I'm an outsider outside of everything  
Everything you know  
Everything you know  
It disturbs me so
