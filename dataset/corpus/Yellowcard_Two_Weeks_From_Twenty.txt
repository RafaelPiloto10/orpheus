Jimmy wasn't really popular  
He had a couple of friends back home  
Sooner or later they're all gettin' out  
So he had to join up alone  
  
He was dreamin' of the ivy leagues  
Since he was only three feet tall  
Get the hell out of Jersey  
And then he would never look back at all  
  
And then you hear em' say  
That miles away  
We lost another one that we sent with a gun  
They're gonna miss him  
He was two weeks from twenty  
And there's still no shame  
From the man to blame  
  
Jimmy never had a reason to stay  
Cause all the factories shut down  
All he had was a line for his name  
So he could sign away his right to be proud  
He tried to kiss her on the way out the door  
She just put her little hand on his face  
I don't understand why you're leavin', she said  
But I hope you're gonna ask me to wait  
  
And then you hear em' say  
That miles away  
We lost another one that we sent with a gun  
His lady missed him  
He was two weeks from twenty  
And there's still no shame  
From the man to blame  
  
Jimmy's mother went to capitol hill  
So she could fill her heart up with joy  
Maybe shake a few hands while she's there  
And tell em' thank you sir for takin' my boy  
  
And then you hear em' say  
That miles away  
We lost another one that we sent with a gun  
His momma missed him  
He was two weeks from twenty  
And there's still no shame  
From the man to blame  
  
No there's still no shame  
And we're all to blame  
We're all to blame  
We're all to blame  
We're all to blame  
We're all to blame
