I am The Count, this is my song.  
A coffee, a burger, you can't go wrong.  
  
Rock me Daddio.  
Rock it.  
  
I am The Count and I love to wear silk stockings on my head.  
  
Sing it my pretty sing.  
  
Hip hop, be bop,  
  
I am The Count, this is my song.  
A coffee, a burger, just sing along.  
  
Rock it.  
  
Take it to the bridge, take it up, up, up, up.  
  
Transylvania.  
  
Our chance living in the mystical powers.  
Instead I am here alone, a bird in a cage.  
I will spread my wings and head home.  
  
Transylvania.  
  
Sock it to me baby.  
  
Burger, burger,  
  
One coffee, two burgers, three ham and cheese burgers,  
And one chicken sandwich.  
Poor on the mayo, pass me the relish.  
Some more onion rings
