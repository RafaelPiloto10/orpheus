Woman don't like it, hurting her this way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman don't like me in her own way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman don't like it, treating her like this  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman she don't love the lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back  
  
Woman don't like it, begging on her knees  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Oh please, please, don't desert me  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman don't like it, treating her this way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
There is tenderness in the heart of the lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back  
  
Someday she is going to hit back (4 times)  
Woman don't like it (4 times)  
Someday she is going to hit back (4 times)  
  
She feels so lonely  
Woman don't like it  
She feels so blue  
Woman don't like it  
He has lost her now  
Woman don't like it  
Oh, woman, you knew what she could do  
Woman don't like it  
  
Woman don't like it, says it has to stop  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman she says she doesn't love me  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman don't like it, the woman don't say a lot  
Someday she is going to hit back  
With one last kiss she leaves him lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back
