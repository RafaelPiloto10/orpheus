I made a deal with the holy ghost  
I made a plan to preserve the peace  
Before I started I lost my guts  
Saw traces of the past destroyed  
  
Always thought I could write it down  
Where'd it go, and you read my mind  
Make an enemy like a friend that never existed  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I thought I knew everything  
I thought I knew what it meant to me  
Turns out I don't know anything  
Just know enough to keep my head  
And just play dead  
  
Is the criminal in your thoughts  
Like a poppy that blessed the fields  
And the price that is on my head  
Inflates the cost of smut magazines  
  
Just take a look at what we believe  
Selling freedom to slavery  
You have us screaming that  
War is peace  
And strength is ignorance  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I thought I knew everything  
I thought I knew what it meant to me  
Turns out I don't know anything  
Just know enough to keep my head  
And just play dead  
Just play dead  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I let you get to me  
I let you get to me  
I let the ability to stay collected keep my head  
  
I thought I knew everything  
I thought I knew what it meant to me  
Turns out I don't know anything  
Just know enough to keep my head  
And just play dead
