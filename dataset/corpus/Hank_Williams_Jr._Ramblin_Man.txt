I can settle dow-own and be doin'just fine  
Til I hear an old train rollin'down the line  
Then I hurry strai-aight home and pack  
And if I didn' go, I believe I' blow my stack  
I love you ba-aby, but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me  
He made a ramblin' man.  
  
Some folks might sa-ay that I' no good  
That I wouldn' settle down if I could  
But when that open ro-oad starts to callin'me  
There' somethin'o'r the hill that I gotta see  
Sometimes it' har-rd but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me, he made a ra-amblin'man.  
  
I love to see the tow-owns a-passin'by  
And to ride these rails 'eath god' blue sky  
Let me travel this la-and from the mountains to the sea  
'Cause that' the life I believe he meant for me  
And when I' go-one and at my grave you stand  
Just say God called home your ra-amblin'man.
