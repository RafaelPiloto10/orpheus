What kind of spell is this  
That you've cast on me with your kiss  
Its like I've lost all control of my senses  
Its just not like me, to give in so easily  
And drop my guard and leave my heart defenseless  
Oh, but I'm feelin' good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a surprise, here by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
I waited so long, for something this strong  
And now I gotta be fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you baby  
  
There's nobody here to see  
These sparks between you and me  
We'd better be careful my love, or these woods will be burning  
Or maybe we just give in, throwing caution to the wind  
Its funny how we ain't got any say in the matter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh huh  
Oh take me downtown  
Uh huh  
My sweet angel  
  
Yeah, I waited so long, somethin' is strong  
And I know I'm falling 'cause I'm already callin' you  
Oh  
  
What a surprise, hear by your side  
Its more than a full moonshine and its driving me crazy  
Oh waited so long, for something this strong  
And we know I'm fallin' 'cause I'm already callin' you  
Oh callin' you baby  
Yeah, uh huh
