[Chorus]  
I heard you talking in your sleep  
Is there anything that I can do  
I don't believe we've had a word all day  
Bout anything at all  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
That's right, yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
It's a name I don't recall  
I heard you softly whisper  
I reached out to hold you near me  
Then from your lips there came that secret  
I was not supposed to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I heard you talking in the night  
That's right, yes I heard ya call  
Though I could hardly hear the name you spoke  
It's a name I don't recall  
  
[Chorus]
