No good man  
Lovin' all the no good things  
Never treats me as he should  
That ain't no good  
He's always bringing me down  
He's no saint  
Heaven knows that's what he ain't  
Spends his money foolishly  
Not on me  
I'm the one who gets the run-around  
  
I ought to hate him and yet I love him so  
For I require  
Love that's made of fire  
And in his arms  
I find  
I always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began  
There have been other fools like me  
Born to be  
In love with a no good man
