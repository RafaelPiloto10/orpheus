I feel a little blue 'cause I can't sew  
There's still a lot of things that I should know  
Anyone can guess  
I don't know how to press  
My Saturday clothes  
And everyone's goin' home  
I feel a little sad to watch them leave  
But I'll be cool because I don't believe  
The happy times are gone  
I can still put on  
My Saturday clothes  
Every warm body knows  
I've got to tell you that was a swell time  
Now I'll take the butts away  
And put the glasses on the tray  
I'll see you all next Saturday  
I feel a little off because they're gone  
And if my gal were here I'd still be on  
But in a week or two  
There's lots of things to do  
In my Saturday clothes  
And everyone's gone home  
I've got to tell you that was a swell time  
So now I'll take the butts away  
And put the glasses on the tray  
I'll see you all next Saturday
