Like a bird  
Like a bird without a cage

If you choose to walk away  
Don't walk away

I'm an outcast  
I got that  
So the player list the Cadillac music  
And that's just a start  
  
My life I took it from the back  
To the front rosa park  
Who cares what they blink or they bought  
Who cares what they think or they thought  
Baby we can do it in the car  
In the kitchen  
In the floor  
In the middle of the park  
  
I'm here to play  
With a little ding  
I pump blood through your veins  
Your heart  
  
And all these (...) lil players  
Acting like they can hate  
But they can not  
  
Can't  
Won't  
Don't  
Never  
  
Will  
You  
Keep  
Real  
  
One  
Two  
Three  
Four times
