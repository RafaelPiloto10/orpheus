It's just her and the band and the clean up man  
She's counting up her tips, she did alright  
She says good-night  
She drives home to a three-room flat  
Checks her machine and she feeds the cat  
She's almost asleep, before she turns out the light  
  
In her dreams, she rides wild horses  
And they carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight, she rides wild horses, again  
  
She's fallen in love a time or two  
Somehow it always fell through  
But she's strong, she carries on  
Her life ain't always gonna be this way  
She knows she's gonna shine someday  
But for now, she'll escape until the dawn  
  
In her dreams, she rides wild horses  
And they carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight, she rides wild horses, again  
  
In her dreams, she rides wild horses  
And they carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight, she rides wild horses, again  
  
In her dreams, she rides wild horses  
And the carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight, she rides wild horses, again
