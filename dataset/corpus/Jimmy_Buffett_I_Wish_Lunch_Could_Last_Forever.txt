The place down the block, the one  
with no clock  
Covert rendezvous with you at the  
usual time  
I savor the scent of the fish on  
the grill  
Life's so spicy up on bar-be -q-hill  
  
Lookin' good, you look so fine  
Waiter bring us one more bottle of wine  
  
CHORUS  
  
I wish lunch could last forever  
Make the whole day one big afternoon  
We'll begin with dessert a little coconut tart  
Mmmm tastes as sweet as a piece of your heart  
Cafe au lait beneath the Paris moon  
  
Don't hide you eyes just wear your disguise  
Brazil's in the air I swear it feels like Mardi Gras time  
I savor the scent love that Anik Goutal  
As we walk in time to the cathedral bell  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I wish lunch could last forever  
Make the whole day a first time love affair  
We'll begin with a kiss, such a warm place to start  
Let me into your life, let me into your heart  
Mea culpa mea culpa carnival's in the air
