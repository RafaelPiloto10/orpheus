Never seen such a beautiful girl  
Got me shaking inside  
Calling on me from deep within her eyes  
Not the kind you go handing around  
Want to keep her right there  
But this love it don't come as no surprise  
  
And when I saw the way that she smiled at me  
I knew it there and then that she was A 1  
And then I felt the way she was touching me  
Was something I had known I was waiting upon  
  
Never seen such a beautiful girl  
Had me quickly untied  
Calling to me she made me realize  
Not the kind that is lost or is found  
She has always been there  
A lover needed for this soul to survive  
  
And when I saw the way that she smiled at me  
I knew it there and then that she was A1  
And when I felt the way she got through to me  
Was something I had know I was waiting upon  
  
Never seen such a beautiful girl  
Got me shaking inside  
Calling on me from deep within her eyes  
Not the kind you go handing around  
Want to keep her right there  
But this love it don't come as no surprise
