Well, there's a light in your eyes  
That's guiding my way to your doorstep  
And your voice called my name  
With a sound that I've never known  
I was a kid in a comic book-world looking for answers  
When out of the darkness she came  
  
Like a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesn't care if it's late  
Doesn't matter if it's right  
And I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
[Chorus]  
Last night  
You turned a frightened little boy into a man without shame  
Last night  
We tore the hands off a clock and it read just the same  
Last night  
I had a crazy little dream and you turned it all around  
Last Night  
We took a chance, we shook it up, and now the world's upside down  
  
All the fire in your heart  
And the heat of your touch I'll remember  
And you're dancing like a flame  
Perfection in motion  
It was the masterpiece from the start  
Only you and I could have rendered  
And I'll never be the same  
  
I'm a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesn't care if it's late  
Doesn't matter if it's right  
And I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesn't matter if it's late  
Doesn't matter if it's right  
'Cause I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last night
