You don't need to give me reasons  
I understand  
Somethings are best kept secrets  
And you've done all you can  
I wants no recompense  
Just as much as you can give of yourself  
And nothing else  
And I'll keep it confidential  
It's secrets, confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So don't worry, I'll keep this confidential  
Between you and me  
Go on tell me that you love me  
Show me you dare  
We may not venture out in public  
At least I know, you care  
It can't be guaranteed  
Just as much as you can give of yourself  
That's all I need  
And I'll keep it confidential  
It's secrets, confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So don't worry, I'll keep this confidential  
Between you and me  
Stay secret  
So secret  
You play some silly games  
And if everyone knew about us I'd feel no shame  
But I'll keep its confidential  
It's secrets, confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So don't worry, I'll keep this confidential  
Between you and me  
Between you and me
