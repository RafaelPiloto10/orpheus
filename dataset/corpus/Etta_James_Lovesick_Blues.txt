I got a feeling called the blues, oh Lord  
Since my baby said goodbye  
Oh Lord, I don't know what I'd do  
All I knew is sit and sigh  
  
The last long day, he said goodbye  
Oh Lord, I thought I would cry  
He'll do me, he'll do you  
He got the kind of loving, Lord  
I love to hear him when he call me  
Sweet ma ma, mama  
  
Such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it's all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
I've grown so used to, to you somehow  
Woah, I'm nobody's, well, sugar mama now  
And I'm lonesome  
Oh, I got those lovesick blues  
  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful guy  
That's what's the matter with me  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful guy  
But he don't care about me  
  
Lord, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied  
Oh, he just wouldn't stay  
So now that he's leaving  
This is all I can say, hey, yeah  
  
I got the feeling called the blues  
  
I got the feeling called the blues, oh Lord  
Hate to think it's all over, over  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
I've grown so used to you somehow  
Woah, I'm nobody's sugar mama now  
And I'm lonesome, Lord  
I got those lovesick blues  
I got those lovesick blues  
  
Oh, I got a feelin' called the blues, blues  
Got a feelin' down in my shoes  
I got those lovesick blues  
Yeah, a feelin' in my shoes  
  
Lovesick blues  
From my heart to my shoes  
I got those lovesick blues  
I, I, I, I, I, I got the lovesick blues  
Feelin' in my shoes
