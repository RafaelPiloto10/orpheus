(graham russell)  
You didn't have to be so mad  
When you ran across the road  
The light alone soon told me  
You had a heavy load  
But I can't see why you didn't stay  
Why you didn't come to see if I felt  
The same way  
And I do, and I do  
I never asked for any comfort  
To take up your time  
But now I feel so very different  
I need to make you mine  
And I want to take what you have to  
Give me  
And bring you the words that fall  
From my head  
And I will, and I will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will  
Know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will, always will
