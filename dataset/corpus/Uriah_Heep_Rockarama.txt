Wind it up, here comes the video  
It's that song again  
Turn it up, it's on the radio  
  
Charge me up, I got electric eyes  
I won't fall down  
Light me up  
Just like a christmas tree  
Or am I seeing things  
  
Wind it up, turn it up  
Charge me up, never stop  
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on  
And give me rock'n'roll  
Give me rock'n'roll  
  
Strap me in to the rocket ship  
I'm headin' for the sun  
Tune me in to the mother ship  
I must be seeing things  
  
Wind it up, turn it up  
Charge me up, please don't stop  
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on  
And give me rock'n'roll  
  
Rockarama, it's on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on the stereo  
Give me rock'n'roll ...  
  
Plug me in jack to jack  
Pin me to the wall  
Hey leave that on, I'm on MTV  
Now I'm seein' things  
  
Wind it up, here comes that video  
It's that song again  
Turn me up, I'm on the radio  
Or am I hearing things  
  
Wind it up, turn it up  
Charge me up, don't you stop  
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on  
Give me rock'n'roll  
  
Rockarama, it's on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on the stereo  
Give me rock'n'roll  
Give me rock'n'roll  
Rockarama, it's on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on my stereo  
Give me rock'n'roll ...
