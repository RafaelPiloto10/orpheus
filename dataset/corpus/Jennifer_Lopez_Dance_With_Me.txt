Too much is on your mind  
Gotta let it go  
Can't worry all the time  
Just let it flow  
Say you need a break  
There's nothing I can do  
Sitting here listening to you  
Baby, what's this you tell me  
Things ain't been goin' your way  
Just take it from me  
It's gonna be alright  
So let's go out tonight  
And we can leave all our cares behind  
  
Dance the night away  
Party 'til the sun comes up  
Go grab a friend  
Get on the floor  
Come on and dance  
Dance  
Dance with me  
DJ if you please  
  
Nobody's on the wall  
That's what I like  
Come closer to me now and hold me tight  
Tell me just how you're feeling right now  
Are you really havin' a good time  
Baby, what's this you tell me
