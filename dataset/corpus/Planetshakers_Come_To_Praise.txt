When I think of the way that He gave all for me  
I just can't stop singing this song that I sing  
He is so unbelievable take it from me  
His Love is irreplaceable it's all that I need  
For everything that He's done in me  
All I wanna do is just Praise Him  
(Everybody)  
I don't know what you've come to do  
I've come to Praise Him, Praise Him, Praise Him  
It's just plain to see that when I'm Praising Him  
I can't contain it, I can't hold it in
