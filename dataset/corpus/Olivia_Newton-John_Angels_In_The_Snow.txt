When the twilight hour is sparkling  
And the city's all aglow  
Come with me my darling  
To the place we love to go  
When the frost's upon the window  
There's a tingle in your toes  
To the fields of virgin white  
For angels in the snow  
Lying on the frozen ground  
Arms go up and legs go down  
How it looks so perfect I don't know  
With the snowflakes all around  
It feels like heaven's reaching down  
To tell us here on earth we're not alone  
As the rooftops glisten  
And your cheeks turn to rose  
We will lie in wonder making angels in the snow  
With the snowflakes all around  
It feels like heaven's reaching down  
Telling us that we are not alone  
The silver moon is shining  
On the winter world below  
How she'll smile to see us  
Waving our hellos  
And as each season passes  
I will watch as your wings grow  
I'll always think of you this way  
My angel in the snow
