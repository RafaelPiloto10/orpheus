It's how we do it, our feet in the sand.  
It's how we do it, our heads in our hands.  
It's how we do it, I'm not looking for a reason to go.  
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, but never before.  
  
I know,  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
I'm gonna make sure the money is right.  
Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
It's how we do it.  
It's how we do it, if I lose you I'm losing control.  
So snap your fingers, pull the trigger cause I figure we're better as gold.  
It's how we do it, I'm a satellite looking for a signal to space.  
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, let's do it again.  
  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
I'm gonna make sure the money is right.  
Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up,  
No I've never been better than when falling apart.  
  
I, Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive,  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
For all that I know, it's gonna come back, tenfold.  
For all that I know, it's gonna come back, tenfold.  
  
But Darlin', Oh no, I don't think that we'll make it out alive.  
  
Darlin', Oh no, we won't make it, out alive.  
Now I'm lying, with each passing day.  
  
So if you're coming, then come quick 'cause, I'm scared.  
I'm floating away.  
  
  
It's how we do it, for the first time, I don't need a reason to go.  
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, let's do it some more.  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
I'm gonna make sure the money is right.  
Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
  
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up,  
No I've never been better than when falling apart.  
I, Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive,  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
You put the keys in the car...  
  
And drive!
