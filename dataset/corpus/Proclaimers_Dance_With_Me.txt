Music sounds through the room  
And you take a stance  
Moving a tiny wee bit  
Like you want to dance  
  
Do you want to dance  
Do you want to dance  
And be held tenderly?  
Do you want to dance  
Do you want to dance  
Want to dance with me?  
  
My eyes rest on your hips  
And the way they sway  
I'm sure if I held you tight  
I could move your way  
  
Do you want to dance  
Do you want to dance  
And be held tenderly?  
Do you want to dance  
Do you want to dance  
Want to dance with me?  
  
Ooh, it would be ecstasy  
Holding you against me  
  
Now we move 'round the floor  
But not too far  
I guide you under the light  
That shows how beautiful you are  
  
Do you want to dance  
Do you want to dance  
And be held tenderly?  
Do you want to dance  
Do you want to dance  
Want to dance with me?
