One day I'll hear  
The laugh of children  
In a world where war has been banned.  
  
One day I'll see  
Men of all colors  
Sharing words of love and devotion.  
  
Stand up and feel  
The Holy Spirit  
Find the power of your faith.  
  
Open your heart  
To those who need you  
In the name of love and devotion.  
  
Yes, I believe.  
  
I believe in the people  
Of all nations  
To join and to care  
For love.  
  
I believe in a world  
Where light will guide us  
And giving our love  
We'll make heaven on earth.  
  
I believe in the people  
Of all nations  
To join and to care  
For love.  
  
I believe in a world  
Where light will guide us  
And giving our love  
We'll make heaven on earth.  
  
Yes, I believe.  
  
I believe in the people  
Of all nations  
To join and to care  
For love.  
  
I believe in a world  
Where light will guide us  
And giving our love  
We'll make heaven on earth.  
  
I believe.
