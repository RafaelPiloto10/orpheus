You're a no good heartbreaker  
You're a liar and you're a cheat  
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me  
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good  
They don't know that I would leave you if I could  
I guess I'm on tight  
And I'm stuck like glue  
Cause I ain't never  
I ain't never  
I ain't never, no, no,  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
Sometimes I know I thought  
You would run out of fools  
But I was so wrong  
You got one that you'll never lose  
The way you treat me is shame  
How could you hurt me so bad  
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had  
Kiss me once again  
Don't you never never say that we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
Never  
Never no no  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me  
  
I ain't never loved a girl  
I ain't never loved a girl  
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad  
What am I gonna do about it  
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to her  
I'm gonna hold on to her
