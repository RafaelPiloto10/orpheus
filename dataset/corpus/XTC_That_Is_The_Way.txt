Go and speak to your niece (do this do that)  
Kiss your aunt on the cheek  
Don't talk back, now run along  
It's gone eight, say goodnight  
That's the way that it's done  
Boy and girl, girl and boy  
This is how you do it and  
Who am I to reason why  
Wear a shirt, wear a tie  
You look smart in a suit  
Use your fork in the left  
Straighten up shoulders back  
This is the way that it's done
