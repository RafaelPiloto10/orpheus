I'm a fake  
I can't ever write my own lyrics  
Maybe it's because I don't have any imagination  
I'm a fake  
  
I listen to weird music  
Music that no one has heard about  
Maybe it's because I want to be different.  
I'm a loner  
  
I believe in god  
Sometimes I even read the bible  
Maybe I should become a catholic or a baptist  
I'm religious  
  
I never tell the truth  
Not even to myself  
Maybe I just need attention  
I'm a liar  
  
I eat candles  
And sometimes I eat worms  
Maybe I just need a shrink  
I'm mentally disturbed  
  
I bet you didn't see that one coming?  
Haha
