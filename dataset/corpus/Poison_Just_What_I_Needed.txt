I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near  
I kinda lose my mind, yeah  
It's not the perfume that you wear  
It's not the ribbons in your hair  
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess you're just what I needed  
(Just what I needed)  
I needed someone to feed  
I guess you're just what I needed  
(Just what I needed)  
I needed someone to bleed  
  
I don't mind you hangin' out  
And talkin' in your sleep  
It doesn't matter where you've been  
As long as it was deep, yeah  
You always knew to wear it well and  
You look so fancy I can tell  
I don't mind you hangin' out  
And talkin' in your sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near  
I kinda lose my mind, yeah  
It's not the perfume that you wear  
It's not the ribbons in your hair  
I don't mind you comin' here  
And wastin' all my time  
  
[Chorus x2]
