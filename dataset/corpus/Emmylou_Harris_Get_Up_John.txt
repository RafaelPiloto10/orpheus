I never thought I'd need you  
But now I find I'm wrong  
Come on back, sweet mama  
Back where you belong  
I've rambled over town  
To find that I can't win  
Come on back and pick me up again  
Now, if I lose  
(If I lose)  
Let me lose  
(Let me lose)  
I don't care  
(I don't care)  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?  
My baby, she's got money all the time  
Of all the other gals I've known  
There's none to take your place  
'Cause when I get into a jam  
They just ain't in the race  
So, now that you're back here  
Let's take another round  
With you here by my side  
Babe, the deal just can't go down  
Now, if I lose  
(If I lose)  
Let me lose  
(Let me lose)  
I don't care  
(I don't care)  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?  
My baby, she's got money all the time  
Now, if I lose  
(If I lose)  
Let me lose  
(Let me lose)  
I don't care  
(I don't care)  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?  
My baby, she's got money all the time
