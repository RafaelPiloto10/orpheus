All I say is thank you to my mother,  
To my father, my brothers and sisters  
  
To be in my dream, to be not full of sorrow  
And we call you to be in this way  
  
All I say is...  
  
Some people say to be fat is not nice,  
But I tell them to me it's perfect.  
My father only told me to be in the eye of all them,  
And not to be sad about what people say, but I'm not no no  
  
All I say is...  
  
I'm happy to be, to be on this way,  
When you not let me play  
  
All I say is....
