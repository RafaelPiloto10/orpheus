Hush my darling , sleep my lover  
There'll be rain till we run for cover  
Lost in love in a world of strangers  
Something only the lord arranges  
Oh my darling , now I found you  
Want to live all my life around you  
You're my light in a world of sorrow  
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow  
I just want to hold you forever , forever  
Loving one another that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
Oh my darling , if you leave me  
I lose the love that has always freed me  
Not knowing angel , what's coming after  
Never hearing you're golden laughter  
Oh my baby , hearts like thunder  
Can't escape from the spell I'm under  
I surrender to all your treasure  
Endless nights of pain and pleasure  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever  
Loving one another , that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
(break)  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever  
Loving one another , that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
(repeat last verse and fade out )
