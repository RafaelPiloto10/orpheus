Well it was alright at midnight and you fell out at three  
So I made you warm and stoked the dying fire  
When it all came down this morning you were lying next to me  
How sweet the wine of desire  
  
Well we cheated on a friend and cheaters never win  
Oh the truth I know would be a small relief  
I could never be the one to say  
Her best friend took you down  
  
Gonna run in the night hide when ever it's light  
Gonna run in the night like a thief  
Just ain't no use think it over I was blind but now I see  
Well she's coming back and I know just what I'll do  
If it comes right down to you leaving her or staying here with me  
  
How sweet the memory of you  
Well we cheated on a friend and it looks like I lose again  
I could never be the one to say  
  
Her best friend took you down  
I'd rather run in the night hide when ever it's light  
Gonna run in the night like a thief  
Like a thief in the night hide when ever it's light  
Gonna run in the night like a thief
