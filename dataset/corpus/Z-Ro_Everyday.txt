[Verse 1: Z-Ro]  
My nigga Redd been assisting me with holdin' my head  
But I can't focus cause so many niggas in the street owe me some bread  
And if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed?  
If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby  
My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht  
Might take a little time for me to see bigger living plus or not  
But I want stop until I'm touchin' my figures, you better move(bitch)  
Cause I be bustin' my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through  
Been so broke and embarrassed couldn't afford a tooth brush fool  
If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O  
Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low  
Runnin' up and down Houston slangin' dimes and nickles  
Performing for my hood niggas spittin' rhymes and riddles  
Forever stayin' on our grind because of the shine it give us  
And fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Everyday it's like I can't maintain  
But still I feel I'm in it for the same thing  
All I ever wanted is just to get my change  
Living strength is my only type of mind frame  
  
[Verse 2: Z-Ro]  
It's in my blood, it's in my body, it's in my soul  
Gettin' paper been so important since I've been on my own  
Don't nobody love me in this cold world  
Fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl  
Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna' hear it, I ain't tryna' know ya  
Unless you be a hustler tryna' come up on some mo' bucks  
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun  
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond  
Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march  
Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin' on this cross  
Witness the J.Prince runnin' the south  
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide receivers cause we all be runnin' our route  
I'm goin' long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong  
Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin' on try to maintain  
Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne  
Win it just to stay in the game (mayne)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: Z-Ro]  
Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness  
Kickin' it with the jealous got me beggin' for forgiveness  
This record label presidential think they live like me  
Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me  
They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name  
But they can't sell records without me that's a goddamn shame  
Hoe nigga get ya roll up, every time I flex you cats in check  
Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch!  
Every time I speak bitch niggas steadily be plottin'  
On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin' prison  
But it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out  
But me you've seen I'm havin' things in my dreams I can't get it out  
God blessed the child that can double his fetti  
Duckin' and dodgin' trouble cops and trouble times come get me  
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone  
And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home  
  
[Chorus: Repeat Til End]
