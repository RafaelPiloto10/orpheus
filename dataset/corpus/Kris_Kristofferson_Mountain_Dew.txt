Now there far from me there's an old holler tree  
Where you lay down a dollar or two  
You go round the bend and you come back again  
With a jug of that good ole mountain dew  
They call it that ole mountain dew Lord Lord and them that refuse it are few  
I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew  
  
The preacher came by with his head high said hi said his wife took down with
the flu  
And he thought that we're hard just to give him a quart  
Of that good old mountain dew  
Well we call it that ole mountain dew...

My uncle Mort he's sawed off and he's short he measures bout four foot two  
But he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain
dew  
Well we call it that ole mountain dew...  
Hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew
