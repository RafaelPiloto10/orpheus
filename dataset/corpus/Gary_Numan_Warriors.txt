I fall  
Down  
No control somehow  
  
No help  
Now  
My favour slides  
  
No one comes  
Here  
Now I'm feeding strangers  
  
Thin air  
Like cold death  
Here in my heart  
  
I fell for so long for you all  
I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you  
  
Come in  
I'm the ghost  
Of the white faced clown  
  
She's gone  
Gone. I won't look back  
She's gone  
  
I'm old  
So old  
This infection of time  
  
My skin  
Age  
Shows no kindness to me  
  
I fell for so long for you all  
I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you
