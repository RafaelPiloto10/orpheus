There's never a day  
When I've got nothing to do  
Something to me  
Might mean nothing to you  
  
So don't don't don't don't  
Look at me strangely now  
We'll find the line  
That's in the middle and run  
  
Something, something or nothing  
  
You say you love to spend days  
But I will save mine  
Waiting for the sun in your eyes  
To turn the river to wine  
  
But don't don't don't don't  
Look at me strangely now  
We're gonna find the line  
That's in the middle and run
