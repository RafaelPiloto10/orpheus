Always, in all ways  
You'll be in my mind  
For always, in all ways  
Words have been so hard to find  
  
I still remember you as a child  
Holding you in my arms  
The way you looked up to me  
I thought that I'd always be  
I'd be there beside you  
For always, in all ways  
  
For always, in all ways  
You'll stay in my heart  
Always, in all ways  
This distance is too far apart  
  
I thought you'd always be daddy's child  
And suddenly you were grown  
Now that you're on your own  
If ever you feel alone  
  
I'll be there beside you  
For always, in all ways  
  
I never thought that this day would come  
When we'd have to say goodbye  
But now that your on your own  
Whenever you need a home  
  
I'll be there inside you  
Always, in all ways  
I'll be there beside you  
For always, in all ways
