You wake me up  
In the middle of the night  
And burn the cover down.  
You're on the phone in the air  
  
Like a record try to spin me around.  
Oh won't you move away,  
Oh honey get away.  
The joy of a toy,  
  
Is it all that you came for?  
The joy of a toy  
Got the look of a lie.  
The joy of a toy  
  
Put the hurt into action.  
The joy of a toy,  
You can kiss this love goodbye.  
How can you win  
  
When you don't know a thing  
What love is all about?  
Don't want to fight  
So get out of my sight  
  
I won't surrender now.  
It's independence day,  
Oh honey get away.  
The joy of a toy...  
  
Hello, goodbye...
