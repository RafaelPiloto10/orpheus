On a beach, North Africa  
Nine tribesmen stand alone  
Waiting for a distant call  
Waiting for the world to answer  
  
through' the night of a thousand stars  
Encircled by the light  
They began to sing a new song  
Of forces that surround us  
  
Nine voices  
This dialogue  
Nine voices  
Singing as one  
  
Nine voices  
This dialogue  
Nine voices  
  
When the sun came up they sang  
As the perfect calendar says  
Each had the power of people  
Speaking new languages  
  
They gave forgiveness meaning  
New ways of letting go  
Each child is born for greatness  
With forces that surround them
