I heard a human voice who sang like no one else  
I heard a proud lady singing loud  
Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn  
But soon she found she was underground and wasted  
  
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage  
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff  
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much  
If you take the smooth you gotta take the rough  
  
Why do you have to die to be a hero  
It's a shame a legend begins at its end  
Why do you have to die if you're a hero  
When there's still so many things to say unsaid  
  
I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd  
I felt the sound shower 'round  
And he would take you with him where no music's been before  
As you merged the power surge together  
  
His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake  
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice  
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream  
But once so strong survive or become weak  
  
Why do you have to die to be a hero  
It's a shame a legend begins at its end  
Why do you have to die if you're a hero  
When there's still so many things to say unsaid  
  
If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there  
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care  
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds  
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds  
  
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame  
But fast car user lose  
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame  
'Cause every year new ones appear  
  
Why do you have to die to be a hero  
It's a shame a legend begins at its end  
Why do you have to die if you're a hero  
When there's still so many things to say unsaid.
