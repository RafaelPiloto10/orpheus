You know it hurts me  
When I can't be next to you  
And though we're young I know  
You feel the same way, too  
Deep in our hearts we know  
It?s just a matter of time  
?Cause we?ll be together one day  
And when we met  
Out on the streets along the way  
It wasn't by chance that we  
Were passing by that day  
As sure as there's a moon  
And stars above I know  
We?ll be together for sure  
As sure as that nose on your face  
We were meant for each other?s arms  
Just as one and one make two  
You were made for me  
I was made for [unverified]  
don't try to hide that smile  
I know that's on your face  
And when you [unverified] at me  
I?ll look the other way  
And we won't give away  
What we know from the start  
That we've got that love in our hearts  
Deep in our hearts  
In our hearts, we've got that love  
In our hearts, we've got that love  
In our hearts, we've got that love  
Oh, deep down in our hearts  
We've got that love  
Oh, we're very into lovin?, yeah  
Oh, that love in our hearts  
We've got that love in our hearts  
Oh baby, we've got that love
