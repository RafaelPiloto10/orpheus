I don't know what you've got  
But it's getting to me  
Makes my cold nights hot  
Hot wind just goes right through me  
  
We're hummin', baby  
It's in your hands  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
  
Wow, wake up early at night  
I can't go back to sleep  
I even walk alone on red lights  
I tied my tongue and try to speak  
  
When it's my time to walk  
When my feet is startin' to run  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
'Cause you've got me hummin', yeah  
  
Oh no  
Tough baby
