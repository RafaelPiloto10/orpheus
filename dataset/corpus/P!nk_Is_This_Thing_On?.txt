Got your voicemail, can you call me at a hotel?  
There's something that's weighting heavy on my heart  
And heavy on my chest!  
I'm the lone night, you're the morning  
I annoy you, and you bore me  
And it's hard enough to make it through a... Zone of enemies  
All in good time, we'll be just fine  
Either way we need to be happy!  
  
Chorus:  
Tell me, is this thing still on?  
How do I keep it true?  
How do I keep you into me,  
Into me without faking it too  
What do we have to try,  
When everything is too lose?  
Cause it always is just me and you  
But it's the hardest thing to do,  
The hardest thing to do!  
  
And I want you, to want me, like the first time you saw me  
I know in ten years I'm betting my head is still young and dumb  
It would be so hard to let go and replace you, I still love you  
I just wanna find the thing that made me think this was the one!  
All in good time, we'll be just fine  
Either way we need to be happy!  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
Tell me, is this thing still on?  
How do I keep it true?  
How do I keep you into me,  
Into me without faking too  
What do we have to try  
When everything is too lose  
Cause it always is just me and you  
But it's the hardest thing to do,  
The hardest thing to do!
