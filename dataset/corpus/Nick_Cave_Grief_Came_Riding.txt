A grief came riding  
On the wind  
Up the [Solemn] river Thames  
I was sittin' on the bank with my mouth open  
When I felt it entering  
  
I began thinkin' about our wedding day  
And how love was a vow  
I was thinkin' about the chamber door  
Only we can enter now  
  
I began thinkin' about our ancient friends  
And of kissin' them goodbye  
And then the wind blew under Battersea bridge  
And a tear broke from my eye  
  
I started thinkin' about London  
[How] nothing good ever came from this town  
And if the Thames weren't so filthy  
I would jump in the river and drown  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
Thinking loud  
  
[A grief came riding on the wind  
Up the river where the bridges crouch  
Blowin' people back and forth  
From the marital bed to the psychiatric couch]  
  
Blowin' people far apart  
Blowin' others so they collide  
Blowin' some poor bastard right out of the water  
Blowin' another one over the side  
  
Hear the ancient iron bridge  
And listen to it groan  
With the weight of a thousand people  
Leavin' or returning home  
  
To their failures  
To their bordoms  
To their husbands  
And their [wives]  
Who are carving them up for dinner  
Before they even arrive  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
[Thinking loud]  
  
Now look there just [Below] the water  
See the saviour of the human race,  
[with] the fishes and the frogs,  
Has found his final resting place  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
[Thinking loud]
