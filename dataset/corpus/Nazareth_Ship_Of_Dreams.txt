Here we are  
We sail on a ship made of dreams  
  
And I  
I only exist to believe  
The stars  
The stars that I see watching me  
  
Hold me close  
Your arms and your love comfort me  
The sea  
Is deep and it waits endlessly  
Oh why  
To give just to take it from me  
  
Here we are  
We sail on a ship made of dreams  
And I  
I watch for a sign constantly  
The sea  
Is deep and it waits ceaselessly.
