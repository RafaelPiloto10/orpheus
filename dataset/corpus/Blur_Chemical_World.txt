The pay-me girl has had enough of the bleeps  
So she takes the bus into the country  
Although she got herself rosy cheeks  
She didn't leave enough money to pay the rent  
The landlord says that she's out in a week  
What a shame she was just getting comfy  
Now she's eating chocolate to induce sleep  
In a chemical world, it's very, very, very cheap  
  
And I don't know about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
It's been a hell of a do  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes  
  
Peeping Thomas has a very nice view  
Across the street at the exhibitionist  
These townies they never speak to you  
Just stick together so they never get lonely  
Feeling lead, feeling quite light-headed  
Had to sit down and have some sugary tea  
In chemical world, in a chemical world  
It's very, very, very cheap  
  
And I don't know about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
It's been a hell of a do  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes, yes  
  
I don't know about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
It's been a hell of a do  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes  
And now she's found about you  
But they're putting the holes in, yes, yes  
Well I don't know about you  
They've been putting the holes in, yes, yes  
  
Until you can see right through  
Until you can see right through  
Until you can see right through
