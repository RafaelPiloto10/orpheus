All summer long we were happy we were one  
We didn't think of an ending to our play  
All summer long nights of wine, days of song  
It couldn't last, our aging sun had to go  
I will always remember you  
  
Watching the waves in the wind  
The beach dogs hiding from the rain  
Suddenly my colors have turned to grey  
Will I ever see your face again  
  
And all winter long I will walk my lonely road  
Waiting for you and your return  
I will always remember you
