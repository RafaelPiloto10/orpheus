Come on and open up that door to your heart and let my love walk in  
Open up that door to your heart and let the big romance begin  
See you had my lovin' and my kissin' you don't know what you've been a missin'  
Open up that door to your heart and let my love walk in  
Open up that door and let my love walk in  
Open up that door and let the big romance begin  
Don't let the good times roll by that would be a sin  
Open up that door sweet baby and let my love walk in  
Don't you know I've been a waitin' for a long long time  
Just to have you near me and hear you say you're mine  
I'm pleadin' with you baby on a bended knee  
Open up that door sweet sugar and take a little chance on me  
Open up that door...  
Open up that door...
