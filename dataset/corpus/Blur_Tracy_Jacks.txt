(Tracy Jacks) works in civil service  
(Tracy Jacks) it's steady employment  
(Tracy Jacks) it's a golfing fanatic  
(Tracy Jacks) but his put is erratic  
(Tracy Jacks) saw a harley street doctor  
(Tracy Jacks) who prescribed healthy living  
(Tracy Jacks) but he's getting past forty  
(Tracy Jacks) and all the seams are splitting  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But it's just so overrated  
  
(Tracy Jacks) left home without warning  
(Tracy Jacks) at five in the morning  
(Tracy Jacks) got on the first train to walton  
(Tracy Jacks) and stood on the seafront  
(Tracy Jacks) threw his clothes in the water  
(Tracy Jacks) and ran around naked  
(Tracy Jacks) got stopped by the police  
(Tracy Jacks) and escorted back home  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But then it's just so overrated  
  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
  
And then it happened on a Tuesday morning  
Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in  
Saying it's just so overrated  
  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
Tracy Jacks  
  
Everyday he got closer  
He knew in his heart he was over  
I'd love to stay here and be normal  
But it was always overrated
