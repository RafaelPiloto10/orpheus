Hey!  
She's freaky, and she knows it  
She's freaky, and I like it  
  
Listen  
  
She grabs the yellow bottle  
She likes the way it hits her lips  
She gets to the bottom  
It sends her on a trip so right  
She might be going home with me tonight  
  
She looks like a model  
Except she's got a little more ass  
Don't even bother  
Unless you've got that thing she likes  
I hope she's going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
She's freaky, and she knows it  
She's freaky, but I like it  
  
She shuts the room down  
The way she walks and causes a fuss  
The baddest in town  
She's flawless like some uncut ice  
I hope she's going home with me tonight  
  
And all she wants is to dance  
That's why you'll find her on the floor  
But you don't have a chance  
Unless you move the way that she likes  
That's why she's going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned from everywhere  
She's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Now dance  
Little girl  
You're freaky, but I like it  
Hot damn!  
Let me put my funk on this one time  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned from everywhere  
She's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
I think I'm love stoned  
She's got me love stoned  
  
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh  
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh  
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
I'm love stoned from everywhere, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
Think that she knows, oh, oh  
  
And now I walk around without a care  
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I  
I'm love stoned, and I could swear  
That she knows  
Think that she knows, oh, oh  
She knows, she knows, oh, oh
