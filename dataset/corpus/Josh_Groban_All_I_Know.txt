Barbra:  
Once I found a perfect love  
And you showed me everything there was  
To know of love  
Time will not betray the truth  
And for all the years we've shared  
I celebrate with you  
For you  
Josh:  
Un giorno T' incontrai (One day I met you)

D' allora insieme noi (From then on, together we)  
  
Both:  
Forever.  
  
Both:  
You are all I know of love  
How could I ask for more?  
You're everything I'm dreaming of  
You're all I need from love.  
And every star above  
Spells out your name.  
I swear I'll always feel the same  
You're all I want
