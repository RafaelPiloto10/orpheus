Cameron's getting logical,  
A Vulcan in disguise,  
The mysteries of the night are  
Putting sparkle in his eyes.  
He's looking for sound reasoning,  
But the best that I can do,  
Is this transcendental story,  
That I'll pass along to you.  
  
Past the falls they call Victoria,  
Down the river named the Nile,  
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat,  
It's shaped just like a smile.  
  
And steered by a magician,  
With the knowledge that he needs,  
To keep him on his destined course,  
Past the crocodiles and reeds.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean,  
The Lone Eagle in the sky,  
He gave me my first sextant,  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
It's been quite a lengthy passage,  
From the dawn of time till now,  
He has weathered the infernal storms  
In his trusty petite dow.  
  
He has soared about colossal waves,  
Sailed the endless sea.  
Sometimes he resembles you,  
Sometimes he looks like me.  
  
I saw him through my telescope,  
On a cloudless night in June,  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
There are windows to the galaxies  
And hallways to the past.  
There are trapdoors to the future  
And a splintered ancient mast.  
There are relics from Apollo trips,  
When the earthmen came to play,  
And a hammock from a distant star,  
Out in the Milky Way.  
  
He's the Admiral of the ocean  
The Lone Eagle in the sky.  
He game me my first sextant  
And he taught me how to fly.  
  
I saw him through my telescope  
On a cloudless night in June  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon.  
  
A stripped bass breaks the surface  
As the sunset fades away  
And our journey from the Sea of Storms  
Takes us home beside the bay.  
We go fishing in the ocean  
We go traveling back in time  
Like the song says 'teach your children'  
To go fishing with their minds.  
  
Cameron's contemplating  
I'm not sure just what he thinks  
"Is my dad some kind of lunatic  
With his stories and high hi-jinks".  
Then he says when I get old and gray  
And feel like I'm marooned,  
He will take me in his rocket ship  
To that beach house on the moon.
