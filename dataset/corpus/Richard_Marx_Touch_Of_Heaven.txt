Your eyes burn through me,  
Oh, like a raging fire.  
I fall blissfully,  
Every time you say just one little word.  
You know it makes me crazy.  
You ask way too much,  
Oh, when you say that I can look but do not touch.  
I have never wanted any other girl,  
The way I want you, baby.  
I surrender to what I can't control.  
Drunk with desire, I've opened up my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
You know I would go around the world,  
I'd take you anywhere,  
Oh, baby anywhere,  
For a touch of heaven.  
Tell me what you want, I'll give you anything,  
Oh, baby everything,  
For a touch of heaven  
  
I have dreamed of this,  
Your body next to mine.  
Drowning in every kiss.  
How I've longed to find my one and only girl.  
And I found her in you, baby.  
All I ever wanted is everything that you are.  
Don't leave me longing,  
Be tender with my heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everyone says you've been leading me on.  
Too late for warnings, I 'm already gone.  
Ooh, I surrender to what I can't control.  
Drunk with desire,  
I'm giving you my soul.  
  
[Chorus]
