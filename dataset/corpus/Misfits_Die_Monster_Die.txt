First things first, Ms. Monroe rises from the dead  
The henchmen came knocked down the door to my never world  
  
I hope you die  
Die Monster die  
Die monster die  
Die monster die  
  
First things first, we must find out which mirror evil lives  
I enter this door look into the mirrors I don't recognize this face that's
lookin' back at me  
  
Die  
Die Monster die  
Die monster die  
Die monster die  
  
There's a place where the mirrors don't lie  
There's a place where the mirrors don't lie  
There's a place where the mirrors don't lie  
  
I hope you die  
Die Monster die  
Die monster die  
Die monster die  
  
There's a place where the mirrors don't lie  
There's a place where the mirrors don't lie  
There's a place where the mirrors don't lie  
Die monster die
