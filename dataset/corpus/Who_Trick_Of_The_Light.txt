Wide awake in the middle of the night  
I wonder how she's feelin'  
Is it just a trick of the light  
Or is her ceiling peeling?  
  
She's sitting up in bed, shakin' her head  
At a copy of "true confessions"  
Ooh, it must seem like a fairy tale  
To a woman of her profession  
  
[Chorus:]  
But was I all right? (was I all right?)  
Did I take you to the height of ecstasy?  
Was I all right? (was I all right?)  
Did a shadow of emotion cross your face  
Or was it just another trick of the light?  
[Repeat]  
  
Come on, tell me  
What's a nice girl like you doin' in a place like this?  
They don't make girls like you no more  
And I'd like to get to know you  
On closer terms than this  
But I guess you've heard it all before  
  
Lady of the night  
Won't you steal away with me?  
Lady of the night  
Won't you steal away with me?  
  
The money's lyin' on the floor, she looks at me  
Shakes her head and sighs  
Out of time, out the door  
Red light shinin' in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right?  
But was I all right?  
All right?
