Meant to refuse,  
But just smash the whole gate down.  
Tried for the truth,  
But just, lied when it really mattered.  
  
Anywhere,  
That your going.  
Anytime,  
That you feel like.  
Should have been there.  
Should have spoken.  
Tell me there's nowhere you're going.  
  
If you only faced it when.  
Then you,  
Decide to,  
Finally make it in.  
It's over.  
It's breaking.  
  
In case that's all,  
That you want,  
Unprotected.  
Kept it all hidden.  
It's safe from you,  
That's what matters.  
  
Anywhere,  
That your going.  
Anytime,  
That you feel like.  
Should have been there.  
Should have spoken.  
Tell me there's no way of knowing.  
  
If you only faced it when.  
Then you,  
Decide to,  
Finally make it in.  
It's over.  
It's breaking.  
It's broken.  
  
Adjusting, nothing.  
You get just what you pay for.  
Believe in, anything.  
Another stab, in the back, that you let go.  
Don't know how to react, now you don't know.  
Swear up and down, this is the last, time, you, will, get,burned.
