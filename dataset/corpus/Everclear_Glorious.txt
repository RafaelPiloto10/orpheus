You were shining in a white light  
Like a fairytale movie star  
Never really thought I would find snow white drinking in a downtown bar  
You were underneath the white light  
Like a vision in a deep dark place  
Never really thought I would fall for a country girl with an angel's face  
  
Aw everything fades away  
The world changes every day  
When I think about you, it makes me want to say  
  
Glorious  
Glorious  
You are glorious  
  
We were walkin' in the white sun  
Growing up and throwin' down loud  
There was silver in our eyes and we didnt know why,  
The power of the north so proud  
We were lost inside a long dark summer  
Headed down a no where road  
Looking for a light in the middle of the night,  
A place that felt like home  
  
I know everything fades away  
The world changes everyday  
When I think about you, and what we had,  
It makes me want to say  
  
Glorious  
Glorious  
You are to me  
Glorious  
Yeah this glorious life has never been what it seems  
I was asleep when I was living the dream  
Living the dream  
I know I was living the dream  
  
I think about the time in the city  
Running away trying to live free  
I could never believe that you wanted to be with me  
We'd wait in the cold for the last bus home  
Sleeping with your arms around me  
The world is never what it seems to be  
I was living the life when  
I should have been living the dream  
  
Glorious  
Should've been living the dream  
Glorious  
Should've been living the dream  
Glorious  
I know I never understood how much you would mean to me  
Now I know I was living the dream  
Glorious  
I know I was living the dream  
Glorious  
I know I know I was living the dream  
Glorious  
I know this glorious live has never been what it seems  
I was walkin' around half asleep when I was living the dream
