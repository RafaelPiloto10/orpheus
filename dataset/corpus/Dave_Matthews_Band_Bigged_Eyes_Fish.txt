Look at this big - eyed fish swimming in the sea oh  
How it dreams to be a bird swoop and diving through the breeze  
So one day caught a big old wave up on to the beach  
Now he's dead you see beneath the sea is where a fish should be  
  
But oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem brighter on the other side  
  
You see this crazy man decided not to breathe  
He turned red and blue - purple, colorful indeed  
No matter how his friends begged and pleaded the man would not concede  
And now he's dead you see the silly man should know you got to breathe  
  
But oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem brighter on the other side  
  
Oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem so much better on the other side  
  
No way, no way  
No way out of here  
  
You see the little monkey sitting up in his monkey tree  
One day decided to climb down and run off to the city  
But look at him now lost tired living in the street  
As good as dead you see what a monkey does - stay up your tree  
  
But oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem brighter on the other side  
  
Oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem so much better on the other side  
  
No way, no way, no way  
No way out of here  
  
Rain in my dreams  
  
Fall away
