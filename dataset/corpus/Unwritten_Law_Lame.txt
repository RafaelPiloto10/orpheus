Communication is where it breaks down  
Humiliation is all that's left now  
Apologetic you say you're sorry  
You're so pathetic you won't be bothering me  
Just like I told you before  
Don't want to see you knockin' at my door  
Don't wanna see you round here no more  
  
Give me a little respect  
Not long till someone breaks your neck  
You're just a wreck  
And nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fucking lame  
  
Your misdirection is all you offered  
Co-operation is dead why bother  
You live your life in someone elses dream  
And you will find you've slid between the seams  
  
I thought I told you before  
Don't want to see you knockin' at my door  
Don't want to see you round here no more  
  
I think enough has been said  
Takes too much to get it through your head  
Might as well be dead  
And nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fuckin' lame  
  
And you think something's wrong with me  
Or maybe you can't see what I can see  
I say there must be something wrong with you  
Or maybe you can't do what I can do  
I want to know what happened to you  
  
Give me a little respect  
Not long till someone breaks your neck  
You're just a wreck  
And nothing's gonna change  
Nothing's gonna change  
Not much that you can say and  
Everything you do is fucking lame  
Fucking lame  
Fucking lame  
It's all fucking lame
