Watched from a distance, it's beautiful  
Somebody's caught in the undertow  
Have you ever felt desperation?  
The saltwater's filling your lungs  
We will regret it when we sleep  
Promises never meant to keep  
When all of the shadows need  
Is a good man to hide in the dream  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
  
Time is a price we can't afford  
An empty glass and an open door  
You get what you paid for in sweat  
And a voice that says please don't forget  
  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is now?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that it's time?  
  
Caught in a maze you can't escape  
The flickering lights, and the colored lens  
The walls that we build just close in  
Until we decide to begin  
Are we distracted by the sun?  
The glittering jewels, and the beating drums  
Is it going the distance we fear?  
Have you heard that we're already here?  
  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is now?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice speak out  
Do they know that the world's on fire?  
Do they know that the time is here?  
Do they know that you gotta stand up, stand up  
Let your voice be clear  
Do they know that it's time?  
  
Some will say we've gone too far  
We're on the edge and in too deep  
Some will say we're too far gone  
You can't erase the tragedy
