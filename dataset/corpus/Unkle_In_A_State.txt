My mind is in a state  
'Cause all I seem to do is tempt my fate  
Well I try every space  
But all the while we're crushing at the gate  
This time, this time  
  
Reality struck me between the eyes  
My mind is in a state  
'Cause everything I miss it comes too late  
So I try and disappear  
But there is only one way out of here  
This time, this time  
  
Reality struck me between the eyes  
My mind is in a state  
But all I need to do is change my pace  
And I know there's fear to face  
But happiness is firm in its embrace  
This time.
