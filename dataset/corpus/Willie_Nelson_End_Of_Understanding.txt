Each time you hurt me, you say you're sorry.  
I try to understand, and say: "OK."  
But there must be an end to understanding,  
And the end of mine can't be too far away.  
  
I try to understand that you're "only human".  
And "we all make mistakes" every day.  
But there must be an end to understanding,  
And I know that I just can't go on this way.  
  
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:  
Ask too much of one and both will die.  
And there must be an end to understanding,  
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.  
  
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:  
Ask too much of one and both will die.  
And there must be an end to understanding,  
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.
