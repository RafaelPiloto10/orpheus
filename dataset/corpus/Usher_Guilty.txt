He said,  
You swear to tell the truth,  
The whole truth,  
And nothing but the truth?  
I said, yeah man  
Right hand high,  
Never tell a lie  
  
Your honor I didn't know that I hurt her  
I didn't know she was cryin'  
I didn't know that it was killin' her slow  
And, and, your honor she can't say I ain't love her  
Can't say I ain't tried  
But I guess my love wasn't good enough  
  
I guess I'm guilty for wantin' to be up in the club  
I guess in guilty cause girls always tryin' to show me love  
I guess I'm guilty for leavin' 'n' havin' a little fun  
Girl I'm guilty  
For that, girl I'm guilty  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
(I ain't did nothin' to her,  
Gave everything to her, for that)  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
(I ain't gon' cry  
While you make me do the time, oh yeah)  
  
Your honor, she accused me of cheating  
It was all in her thinkin'  
She gon' believe what she want to  
So what the hell am I gon' do  
Turn my life around, it ain't going down  
She know bout the life I live why she crying now  
This shit is so silly to me but won't I plead that  
  
I guess I'm guilty for wantin' to be up in the club  
I guess in guilty cause girls always tryin' to show me love (hey)  
I guess I'm guilty for leavin' 'n' havin' a little fun  
Girl I'm guilty  
For that, girl I'm guilty  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail (take me)  
Don't take me to jail  
(How we supposed to get along,  
With her going through my phone  
In her mind she decided to get it)  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
(Don't want to cop a plea,  
I swear it wasn't me,  
Don't matter cause to her I'm guilty)  
  
Lets go,  
Right hand to the sky  
Strike me down if I lie  
If she saying she the victim in this case then  
What am I?  
If I hurt her I ain't try to,  
In the club I may decide to  
Ride through  
She got proof  
Well I got alibi's to  
Couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes  
Seven carrot solitaire, Caribbean water blue  
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera and the Bentley coupe  
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to  
Her life I submit to you is evidence  
I never been on bullshit  
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit  
Knew what I expected when she met me  
Should have left me then  
Balling against the law shorty go on arrest me then  
  
I guess I'm guilty for wantin' to be up in the club  
I guess in guilty cause girls always tryin' to show me love (hey)  
I guess I'm guilty for leavin' 'n' havin' a little fun  
Girl I'm guilty  
For that, girl I'm guilty  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail (take me)  
Don't take me to jail  
(If your gon' treat me like a crook  
Put money on my books  
Never mind forget it)  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail  
Don't take me to jail

Fuck it I'll take the blame)  
Guilty, yeah
