Baby, I never seen nobody like you  
You're a good friend, you know, you've been there for me  
From the beginning, that's why I love you  
I mean I place no one above you, no what I'm sayin'?  
Anything you want, you just come to Daddy  
Listen  
  
When I discovered you I discovered a piece within  
A joy like no other, you are my closest friend  
Girl, if you were a number you'd be a perfect 10  
Right out of the blue sky you were heaven sent  
The way we make love over and over again  
If I had to describe it there'd be nowhere to begin  
And I'm so proud to be your next of kin  
Bring a train over me when I had no reason  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, plenty caramel coated taffies  
Chocolate covered strawberries  
Love so sweet  
You're my chocolate factory  
Gumdrops mixed with chocolate milk bars  
There's so much variety, love so sweet  
You're my chocolate factory  
  
Now if I could write a book on how you made me feel  
The title would read a strong black man and that's for real  
I been going round and round just like a Ferris wheel  
And in and out of relationships with out appeal  
Ain't nobody else on Gods green earth for me  
If we turn ourselves together, we'll make the perfect team of dreams  
Change me for the world as long as I exist  
Always in the kitchen cookin' up my favorite meal  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're that puzzle piece that completes me (girl something so sweet)  
Girl you're everything (girl you're everything that I need)  
You're my escape when I want to be free (when I want to be free)  
You full of plenty treats (like peppers and sweet tarts, big blue red hot)  
Baby you are  
  
[Chorus: x3]
