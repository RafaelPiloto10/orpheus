I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
  
Last night I played the drunken fiddle  
Disabled love with a word of dribble  
On and on about some jumbled subject  
I said your friends were a bunch of muppets  
  
Said your sister should've grown a moustache  
Said you didn't need to take off your mask  
Down the staircase I made my stagger  
I left you cryin' but it didn't matter  
  
And so I sat inside my car in wonder  
A headache in my head like the thunder  
I chewed my nails like a guilty victim  
I couldn't see or feel the night or nothin'  
I wanted to explain, but oh so clever  
Love was like it was some endeavor  
Then I don't remember who said what, when  
On a stack of paper I placed my pen  
  
And when I woke up in the mornin'  
Beside you in the bed  
My mouth was full of nothin'  
My arms around your head  
I don't know how I got there  
But I didn't want to check  
Now back between each other  
We're salvaging our wreck  
Now I've returned  
  
You throw our jigsaw all over the floor  
We're at the deepest deep  
I thought our love had died forever  
But it just went to sleep  
  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned
