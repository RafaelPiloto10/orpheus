And we stare each other down  
Like victims in the grind  
Probing all the weakness and  
Hurt still left behind and we cry  
The tears of pearls  
We do it. Oh we do it.  
  
Is love really the tragedy the way you  
Might describe?  
Or would a thousand lovers  
Still leave you cold inside?  
Make you cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world  
  
Your kisses are like pearls,  
So different and so rare  
But anger stole the jewels away  
And love has left you bare,  
Made you cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
Well I could be the tired joker  
Pour my heart to get you in  
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win  
Maybe cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world  
  
We twist and turn where angels burn  
Like fallen soldiers we will learn  
Once forgotten, twice removed  
Love will be the death  
The death of you  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world
