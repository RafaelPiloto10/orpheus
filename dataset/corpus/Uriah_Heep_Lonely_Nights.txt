Will you risk your reputation  
I don't know  
You just don't know  
What you're saying  
Anymore  
You know beggars  
Can't be choosers  
And it's fair  
We may win, we may be losers  
I don't care, no no no  
  
Oh baby, I just can't stand  
Another lonely night  
So come on over and save me  
Save me from another lonely night  
  
I hear every word you're saying  
They're all lies  
But with every breath you're taking  
You're thinking of  
Ways to say goodnight  
  
Baby, I just can't stand  
Another lonely night  
So come on over and save me  
Save me from another lonely night  
Come on over  
Come and save me
