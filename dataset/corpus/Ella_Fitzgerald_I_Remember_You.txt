Was it in Tahiti,were we on the Nile  
Long long ago say an hour ago  
I recall that I saw your smile  
I remember you-ooh  
You're the one who made my dreams come true  
A few kisses ago  
  
I remember you-ooh  
You're the one who said "I love you, too"  
Yes, I do, didn't ya know?  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell  
Like the rain out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of it all  
Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell  
Just like the rain out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of it all  
Then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember  
Tell them I remember you
