[Verse:]  
I, I, I don't know why why  
It seems like every other night you pick a fight, fight  
And I know I do the same, be callin' you out your name,  
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You tell me to go, I start walking out  
But we both know what we're all about  
We fuss, fight, and scream  
And it's all because of love  
But you and I both of we ain't ever giving up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Baby, before you say, say,  
Something you know you'll take back later on today, day.  
Sometimes you drive me crazy, but I love ya, baby  
All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me, ooohh...  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You tell me to go, I start walking out  
But we both know what we're all about  
We fuss, fight, and scream  
And it's all because of love  
But you and I both of we ain't ever giving up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around  
  
Aint Nobody That Could Love Me  
Like You Love Me  
That's Why I Always Turn Around  
For you You Y-You You You...  
  
[Bridge:]  
Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.  
That's why I always turn around for you, you you, youuu... You, you, you,
youuu...  
Ain't nobody that can love me, like you love me.  
That's why I always turn around. For you, you you, youuuu... You, you yooou...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everytime I try to leave  
Somethin's tells me turn around  
'Cause how could I ever leave  
The only one that holds me down  
'Cause I know we can work it out  
Talk it out, stick it out oohh  
Everytime I try to leave  
Find that we can figure it out  
That's why I always turn around
