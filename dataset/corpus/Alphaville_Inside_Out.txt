Your hand full of hours, sand from the urns  
A traveling companion, the secret of ferns  
From darkness to darkness, where shall I begin  
When whiteness attacked us, sewn under our skin  
And there were the stars  
That helped to navigate our souls  
With all my love, I went into the world  
From inside out, and I gave it all to you  
But I need your love, that was looking for me  
Just on my lips look for your kiss  
And always I think where we might have gone  
If we'd never met inside this song  
Our names are enciphered  
But the words became true  
When I was the sun and you, you were the moon  
And there were the stars
