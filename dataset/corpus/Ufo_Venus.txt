Tell me now and I'll understand  
Does Venus hold you in the palm of her hand  
Has her blackness touched your very heart  
She'll smile sweetly as your world falls apart  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just can't quit it babe  
I just can't stand the pain  
And I just can't quit it babe  
I keep running back again  
  
Little by little piece by piece  
Your defenses have all slipped away  
And real beauty's such an elusive thing  
Somewhere down the line you'll have to pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, its such a cold, cold feeling  
Cuts your body to the bone  
Oh no, its a strange, strange feeling  
Loves been abandoned and I'm so alone  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I've nothing left but this very life to save  
And evrey night I feel that I'm a winner  
She's taking me down to the grave  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I can't seem to chase the ghosts away  
And every night I get too high, I'm a winner  
I've nothing left but to pray  
  
And every night she makes me feel like a winner  
And every night she makes me think I'm a winner  
Venus smiles and encircles me  
And wraps me in a soft princely gown  
  
Waves of darkness rise like the sea  
In her addiction I will drown
