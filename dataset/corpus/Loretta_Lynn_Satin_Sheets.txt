Satin sheets to lie on satin pillows to cry on  
But still I'm not happy don't you see  
Big long Cadillacs pretty clothes upon my back  
But still I want you to set you free  
I found another man who can give me more than you can  
So you've given everything that money can buy  
But your money can't hold me tight like he does on a long long night  
No you didn't keep me satisfied  
Satin sheets to lie on...  
Oh but still I want you to set you free
