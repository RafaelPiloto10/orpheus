[Chorus:]  
So you tried, to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand.  
  
I sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers,  
Try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus,  
God knows I got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons  
I'm fighting myself, believe me,  
I'm far from ignorant, Far from greedy  
If you know where I come from, know what I've been through  
You think there should have been another outcome  
Just like most kids, a father I did it without one  
Come from the city, X you like Malcolm, then you wonder how come  
I can move in the room full of wolves so swift so smooth,  
Thank you mom for making me a man  
Let that mother fucker knock me and my castle to the sand  
  
[Chorus:]  
So you tried to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand.  
  
Look  
I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple  
Came down the south beach to build a new castle  
Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle,  
Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to,  
Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner,  
I'm coming out with dinner wearing the chinchilla,  
I did it for my town to show em the big picture,  
Kid Hit the switch, I promise to never switch up,  
This is for my brother two three who went to jail,  
I'm send all the picture of my shows through the mail  
He hit me with a letter, said: I knew you'd never fail,  
So put me on a beach with a bucket and a pale  
  
[Chorus:]  
So you try to believe in the castle made of the sand  
When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land  
Reach for my hand, reach for my hand
