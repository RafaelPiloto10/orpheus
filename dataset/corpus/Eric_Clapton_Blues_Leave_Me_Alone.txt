Blues, blues trying to drive me away from home.  
Blues, blues trying to drive me away from home.  
Had the blues so bad, blues followed me all day long.  
  
Blues, blues won't let me take my rest.  
Blues, blues won't let me take my rest.  
My mind is rambling like a wild geese out in the west.  
  
Well, you're my all day steady, baby you're my midnight dream.  
Yes, you're my all day steady, baby you're my midnight dream.  
I love that woman better than anyone I've ever seen.  
  
Blues, blues follow me all day long.  
Blues, blues follow me all day long.  
Blues, blues won't you please leave me alone.
