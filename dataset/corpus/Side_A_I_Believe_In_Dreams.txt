Lying in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
Thinking of how to reach you  
Dreaming of having you.  
I believe in dreams  
And I believe in miracles  
I believe the toy balloons  
Can reach the moon.  
I don't have the courage and the will  
To say the words  
But I can't feel of what's inside me is for real  
Oh and I know someday  
I'll have the chance to prove and say  
Three simple words would come your way  
I know I have the chance someday  
Coz I believe in dreams.  
And I believe in miracles  
I believe the toy balloons  
Can reach the moon.  
I don't have the courage and the will  
To say the words  
But I can't feel of what's inside me is for real  
Oh and I know someday  
I'll have the chance to prove and say  
Three simple words would come your way  
I know I have the chance someday  
The chance for me to say...  
That I love you...  
Oh I love you...  
Yes I love you...  
Oh I love you...  
I believe in dreams  
I believe my dreams would all come true  
(I believe it will all come true)  
Ooh I believe..  
(I believe it will all come true)  
Ohh I believe..  
(I believe it will all come true)  
Ooh I have faith to believe in dreams...  
(I believe it will all come true)
