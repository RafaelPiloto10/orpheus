Scared of love, love and swimming pools  
Falling in you said was for fools  
  
But when you're standing on the edge  
You won't hear me because your blood is singing  
  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If it's what your heart is wanting to do  
This is real life you're dreaming through  
And there is no glue to hold you down, so go ahead and...  
Go ahead and jump  
  
Scared of love, love and aeroplanes  
Falling out I said takes no brains  
  
But if your flight is going rough  
Your soul will lead you to the nearest exit  
Jump, jump...  
While you're waiting  
Time is grinning  
Clocks and watches laughing at your indecision  
While you're waiting  
Worlds are spinning  
Find another heart and drive into collision  
Knowing this can you tell me you're...  
  
Scared of love, love and swimming pools  
Stubbornness, I say is for mules  
  
But if you're standing on the edge  
You won't hear me because your blood is singing  
  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If it's what your heart is wanting to do  
This is real life you're dreaming through  
And there'll be no wake up  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If it's what your heart is wanting to say  
This is really your lucky day  
And there is no glue to hold you down, so go ahead and...  
Go ahead and jump
