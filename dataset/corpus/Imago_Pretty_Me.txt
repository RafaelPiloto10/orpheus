The cicatrix beneath  
Max Factor 101 to 009  
I don't get my hgopes up  
On Pond's rosy pride  
I don't get my teeth  
Stuck midway to brave  
A close-up smile  
  
Chorus:  
The arrow goes off  
Oh it hits your behind  
You fall blindly  
You gotta pay the price  
You gotta check some  
Fine print they tell you,  
You can't do without  
Till the next product line  
Come.  
They'll have you in mind  
  
When a funny line escapes  
From a callow pretense of an ad  
An inflicted sense of the word  
Kicks in.  
"Oh so pretty,  
Not pimple-friendly"  
Pass the word around...  
Then you're 70 not 117  
It's your raisin face they mock  
Rely on pension for a last  
Lipo stunt  
Get a face life a lip contour  
  
Techno takes it's toll on you  
Pass the word around  
  
Outro:  
The arrow goes off  
You borrow this  
It hits your behind  
You fall behind  
You fall blindly  
You pay blindly  
You gotta pay the price  
Buy it thrice  
You gotta check some fine prints  
Find your way out  
They tell you, you can't do without  
Find your way out now  
Till the next product line comes  
Find your way, you gotta fiund your way  
They'll have you in mind
