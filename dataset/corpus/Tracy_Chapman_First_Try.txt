Can't run fast enough  
Can't hide I can't fly  
I'm struggling with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
I'm just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  
  
Can't hear what you say  
Can't see by the light  
I'm struggling with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
I'm just a  
Just a  
Just a first try  
  
Can't say what I mean  
Can't love from the heart  
Can't trust in the mercy and the goodness in the world  
Can't learn to accept that it's alright  
To struggle with the limits of this ordinary life  
  
Can't be  
Just a  
Just a first try  
Can't be  
Just a  
Just a first try  
Just a  
Just a  
Just a first try
