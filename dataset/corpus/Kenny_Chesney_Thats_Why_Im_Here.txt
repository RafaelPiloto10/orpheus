No I ain't had nothing to drink  
I knew that's probably what you'd think  
If I stopped by this time of night  
Remember way back when  
I promised you I'd drop in  
At one of those meetings down at the Y  
When they started talkin' 'bout the steps you take  
Mistakes you make, the hearts you break and the price you pay  
I almost walked away  
You could hear a pin drop when this ole man  
Stood up and said, I'm gonna say it again like I do every week  
For those who don't know me...  
  
It's the simple things in life  
Like the kids at home and a loving wife  
That you miss the most when you lose control  
Everything you love starts to disappear  
The devil takes your hand and says, no fear  
Have another shot, just one more beer  
I've been there, that's why I'm here  
  
This ole boy stood up in the aisle  
Said he'd been living a life of denial and he cried  
As he talked about wasted years  
I couldn't believe what I heard  
It was my life word for word  
And all of a sudden it was clear  
  
It's the simple things in life  
Like the kids at home and a loving wife  
That you miss the most when you lose control  
Everything you love starts to disappear  
The devil takes your hand and says, no fear  
Have another shot, just one more beer  
I've been there, that's why I'm here  
  
For us it may be too late  
But it would mean the world to me  
If you were there when I stand and say  
  
It's the simple things in life  
Like the kids at home and a loving wife  
That you miss the most when you lose control  
Everything you love starts to disappear  
The devil takes your hand and says, no fear  
Have another shot, just one more beer  
I've been there, that's why I'm here
