Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere  
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze  
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'  
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding  
The future that lies before me I cannot see  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising  
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
(look at, look at, the future I cannot see)  
  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start  
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
(Got to take the blame for an old love song)  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Oh it's a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
(All you get from love is an old love song)  
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'  
For the music to start
