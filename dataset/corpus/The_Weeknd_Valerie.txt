There comes a time in a man's life  
He must take responsibility  
For the choices he has made  
There are certain things that he must do  
Things that he must say  
  
Like I Love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's goin' to know if it's true  
  
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight)  
My hand on another girl  
I wish I didn't have to lie  
I wish I could let you know  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true  
  
Valerie  
I know you can see through me  
Valerie  
You just choose to never know  
Valerie  
Why pretend to trust in me?  
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I might know )  
Valerie  
You'd rather this than be alone  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true  
  
And I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody gonna know
