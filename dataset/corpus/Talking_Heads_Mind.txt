Time won't change you  
Money won't change you  
I haven't got the faintest idea  
Everything seems to be up in the air at this time  
  
I need something you change your mind  
  
Drugs won't change you  
Religion won't change you  
  
Science won't change you  
Looks like I can't change you  
I try to talk to you, to make things clear  
But you're not even listening to me...  
And it comes directly from my heart to you...  
  
I need something to change your mind.
