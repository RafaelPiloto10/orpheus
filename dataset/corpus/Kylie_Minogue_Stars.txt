[Verse 1]  
You're asking yourself, what's real?  
What to do with these feelings  
That you have inside surreal  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
When you look deep into the pockets of the universe  
You never know what you find  
Because stars don't shine in singular places  
Open up your mind's eye and  
Light up familiar faces  
Because in time  
You'll find life and all of its races  
So open up your mind's eye  
And go tonight  
Begin to feel the light  
  
[Verse 2]  
How do we know the truth?  
Gotta look to the root  
Inside the meaning of life for you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
Stars don't shine  
  
[Verse 3]  
You never know what you find  
Because stars don't shine in singular places  
Open up your mind's eye and  
Light up familiar faces  
Because in time  
You'll find life and all of its races  
So open up your mind's eye  
And go tonight  
Begin to feel the light  
  
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight  
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight  
Yeah, familiar faces  
Go tonight, go tonight, go tonight
