In the roses  
In the spring  
I remember  
There was a time  
I wasn't afraid of anything  
But with the lilacs  
And the rain  
One day you went away  
I remember  
I forgot everything  
[Chorus:]  
My mother's always trying to tell me  
How to be grateful how to believe  
My father's always trying to say  
Baby you're beautiful in every way  
My lover's always got me in his arms  
Trying to protect me keep me from harm  
So why do I always have to be  
My worst my own worst enemy  
In the shadows in the grays  
In the lonely  
There is a place  
Where we can all hide away  
But in the windows of the soul  
There is nowhere we can go  
If we keep running  
Running from our destiny  
[Chorus:]  
My mother's always trying to tell me  
How to be grateful how to believe  
My father's always trying to say  
Baby you're beautiful in every way  
My lover's always got me in his arms  
Trying to protect me keep me from harm  
So why do I always have to be  
My worst my own worst enemy  
You say I walk on water  
You say I walk on the moon  
But it's never enough  
(no it's never enough no it's never enough)  
You say I'm only human  
It's all in my head  
But it's never enough  
(no it's never enough no it's never enough)  
One day I'll find  
My alibi...  
[Chorus:]  
My mother's always trying to tell me  
How to be grateful how to believe  
My father's always trying to say  
Baby you're beautiful in every way  
My lover's always got me in his arms  
Trying to protect me keep me from harm  
So why do I always have to be  
My worst my own worst enemy
