I rode the highway to heartache  
I took a trip on the ship of fools, whoa yeah!  
And I paid the price to have my way  
'Cause money makes the rules, yeah!  
  
Sing it!  
Lay down!  
I'm looking through ya'  
Stay down!  
You got what you should  
Pay now!  
All that you never would, it feels good!  
  
Hell or hallelujah!  
No matter what you do, I'm running through ya'  
Yeah!  
  
You said that love's never lasting  
We surrender our hearts to lose, yeah  
Times up there's nobody askin'  
This time I get to choose!  
Let me hear ya!  
Lay down!  
Don't say that you're sorry  
Stay down!  
I knew that you would  
Pay now!  
Don't say you're misunderstood, it feels good  
  
Hell or hallelujah!  
No matter what you do, I'm running through ya'  
One more time!  
Hell or hallelujah!  
C'mon c'mon  
The rest is up to you  
It's overdue, yeah  
  
Listen!  
One heart is breakin'  
One chance I'm takin'  
No lies, no fakin'  
Goodbye, feels like it should!  
It feels good!  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Hey, one heart is breakin'  
One chance I'm takin'  
No lies, no fakin'  
Goodbye, feels like it should!  
  
Yeah, let me tell ya' how it feels, it feels good!  
  
Hell or hallelujah!  
No matter what you do, I'm running through ya'  
C'mon c'mon  
Hell or hallelujah!  
The rest is up to you  
It's overdue, yeah!
