(Traditional:arr K.J.Garside C.Gray)  
Polly pretty Polly come go away with me,  
Polly pretty Polly come go away with me,  
Before we get married some pleasures to see.  
She jumped up beside him and away they did go,  
She jumped up beside him and away they did go,  
Over the mountains and the valleys below.  
Billy oh Billy I'm afraid for my life,  
Billy oh Billy I'm afraid for my life,  
I'm afraid you mean to murder me and leave me behind,  
Polly pretty Polly you're guessing about right,  
Polly pretty Polly you're guessing about right,  
I've been digging your grave for the best part of your,  
Life.  
He stabbed her through the heart and her hot blood did,  
Flow,  
He stabbed her through the heart and her hot blood did,  
Flow,  
And into the grave pretty Polly did go.  
He threw a little dirt over her and started for home,  
He threw a little dirt over her and started for home,  
Leaving nobody there but the wild birds to moan.  
A debt to the devil Billy must pay,  
A debt to the devil Billy must pay,  
For killing pretty Polly and running away.
