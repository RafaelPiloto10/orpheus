It was a test that we could all hope to pass  
But none of us would want to take  
Faced with the choice to deny God and live  
For her there was one choice to make  
  
This was her time  
This was her dance  
She lived every moment  
Left nothing to chance  
  
She swam in the sea  
Drank of the deep  
Embraced the mystery of all she could be  
This was her time  
  
Though you are mourning and grieving your loss  
Death died a long time ago  
Swallowed in life so that life carries on  
Still it's so hard to let go  
  
What if tomorrow  
And what if today  
Faced with the question  
Oh what would you say  
  
This is your time  
This is your dance  
Make every moment  
Leave nothing to chance  
  
Swim in the sea  
Drink of the deep  
Call on the mercy  
Hear yourself praying  
  
Won't You save me  
Won't You save me
