They say the world must end somehow  
They say the end's not far from now  
I think they're wrong  
Don't worry your life away  
Start living for today  
Don't think about tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
And if the lights go out  
On all of us  
In just a year or two  
And if the sky falls down  
Like pouring rain  
Then I'll be here with you  
I'll go down with you  
  
Well I'm gonna try  
For all I'm worth  
To stay with you till the ends of the earth  
Don't let me down  
Don't let your feelings win  
Don't give out and don't give in  
Don't think about tomorrow  
  
[Chorus x2]
