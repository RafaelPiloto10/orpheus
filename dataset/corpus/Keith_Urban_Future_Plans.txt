It's six Monday morning, she's back into her routine  
Kicks off the covers, and thinks about last night's dream  
Shower and coffee, she heads for the train  
Thinkin' how every day's the same  
There's gotta be more than a life on her own  
All that she wants is a man to come home to  
  
[Chorus]  
She's lookin' for someone to love her  
And stay forever true  
Just somebody who she can believe in  
And say they need her too  
She's lookin' for someone to hold her  
Until the light of day  
Somebody she can make future plans with  
And know he's here to stay  
  
Late in the evening she is dreamin' in black and white  
An old love story she wishes portrayed her life  
No one would know what goes on in her mind  
Thinkin' it's only a matter of time  
Til' someday she finds what she's lookin' for  
And her ship'll come sailin' into her shore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's lookin' for someone to love her (Oh, someone to love her)  
And stay forever true (Oh, no)  
Just somebody who she can believe in  
And say they need her too (Someone who needs her too)  
She's lookin' for someone to hold her  
Until the light of day (Oh, until the light of day)  
Somebody she can make future plans with  
And know he's here to stay.
