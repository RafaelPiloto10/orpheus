Do you like it heavy  
Do you love it mean  
Do you want it dirty  
We don't play it clean  
  
Standing in the spotlight  
Ceiling to the floor  
I can see you rockin'  
Let me hear you roar  
  
Turn it up  
Tear it down  
Hammering through  
Can you feel the sound  
  
Any day. Any night  
Midnight madness  
Dynamite  
  
If you want it  
Come and get it  
Do you want it  
Come and get it  
  
Can you feel the power  
Blinded by the light  
Keep on goin' crazy  
Burnin' up the night  
  
Shouting out together  
Boiling like the sun  
Metal lives forever  
Blazing on and on  
  
Turn it up  
Tear it down  
Hammering through  
Can you feel the sound  
  
Any day. Any night  
Midnight madness  
Dynamite  
  
If you want it  
Come and get it  
Do you want it  
Come and get it  
  
Do you like it heavy  
Do you love it loud  
  
If you want it  
Come and get it  
Do you want it  
Come and get it
