Love is but the song we sing  
Fear the way we die  
It can make the mountains ring  
Make the angels cry  
So the bird is on the wind  
You may not know why  
Hey people now, smile on your brother  
Let me see you get together  
And love one another  
Some may come and some may go  
We will surely pass  
Will the one who left us here  
Return for us at last?  
We are but a moment's sunlight  
Fading in the grass  
Hey people now, smile on your brother  
Let me see you get together  
And love one another  
If you hear the song I'm singing  
You will understand  
You hold the key to love and fear  
All in your trembling hand  
Just one key unlocks them both  
It's at your command  
Hey people now, smile on your brother  
Let me see you get together  
And love one another
