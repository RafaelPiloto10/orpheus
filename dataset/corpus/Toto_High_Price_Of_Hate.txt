Got the eyes of a vulture  
As you gaze from your meaningless throne  
And the pain that you've been selling  
I'd rather die before I'd own  
  
I'll call you a doctor  
Or find you a priest  
'Cause no one can save you  
And you won't get no peace  
  
I've felt your displeasure  
And girl I used to relate  
So don't hand me no anger  
I'll be crushed by the weight  
  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate  
Lord what's the cost of my fate  
  
She'll lay out wide open  
Like a surgical knife  
I've watched it take over  
What's left of your miserable life  
  
She'll live on deception  
Your pleasures long dead  
Your soul is left bleeding  
From the lies that you spread  
  
Don't pull on my collar  
I won't rise to debate  
Don't ask me for comfort  
You're a lifetime too late  
  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate  
Lord what's the cost of my fate  
  
Oh, there's a storm overhead  
Will it ever end baby  
It's all inside your head  
Is it gonna end  
  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate  
Yeah, I hope I ain't asking too late  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate
