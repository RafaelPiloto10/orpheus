Jealous heart oh jealous heart stop beating can't you see the damage you have
done  
You have driven him away forever jealous heart now I'm the lonely one  
I was part of everything he planned for and I know he loved me at the start  
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for all because of you oh jealous heart  
[ steel ]  
Jealous heart why did I let you rule me when I knew the end would bring me
pain  
Now he's gone he's gone and found another and I'll never see my love again  
Through the years his memory will haunt me even though we're many miles apart  
It's so hard to know he'll never want me cause he heard your beating jealous
heart  
Cause he heard your beating jealous heart
