I know you like it hot  
Love to writhe and sweat  
You think that this feels good  
You ain't felt nothin' yet  
  
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand  
Feel your body quake  
As we hit the promised land  
I'm heavy duty  
  
We'll rise inside ya till the power  
splits your head  
We're gonna rock ya till your metal  
Hunger's fed  
  
Let's all join forces  
Rule with iron hand  
And prove to all the world  
Metal rules the land  
We're heavy duty  
So come on let's tell the world  
  
We are defenders of the faith
