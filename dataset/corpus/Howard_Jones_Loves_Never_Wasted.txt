I remember the day we met  
Like a thunderbolt out of the blue  
You kinda liked the way I came across  
But it always meant more to me than it meant to you  
  
Recalling a daydream I had as a child  
A half hidden memory from a more innocent time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If your heart is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
On your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So no need to be worrying  
No need to count the cost  
No separating the inside from the outside world  
No finding No loss  
  
I'm remembering something, so distant so fine  
Ancient, eternal and still ahead of it's time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
In your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So love with abandon  
Without judgement. Without fear  
With a confidence in tomorrow  
Love with a grin and a tear  
  
Not always reflected, not always fulfilled  
Love's not out to get you but wants you to build  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the sweetest of ways  
On your brightest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
Surely be coming back to you
