Chorus  
I know a man from Galilee  
If you're in sin He'll set you free  
He's the one that will save your soul  
Heal your body and make you whole  
Oh, do you know Him?  
  
Verse  
I know a man from Galilee,  
If you're in sin He'll set you free.  
He's the one that will save your soul,  
Heal your body and make you whole,  
Heal your body and make you whole,  
He's the one that delivered me,  
Loosed my shackles and set me free,  
Loosed my shackles and set me free.  
  
Bridge  
Do you know Him,  
Do you know my Jesus?(repeat)  
Do you know Him?  
Oh, do you know Him?(repeat)
