One!  
I'm biting my tongue.  
Two!  
He's kissin' on you.  
Three!  
Oh, why can't you see?  
One! Two! Three! Four!  
Word's on the streets and it's on the news:  
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you.  
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves.  
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance! dance! dance! dance!  
The second I do, I know we're gonna be through.  
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you.  
He don't suspect a thing. I wish he'd get a clue.  
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance! dance! dance! dance!
