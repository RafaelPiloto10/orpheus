Only got my life, one time  
One ticket one step one love  
When I'm living up large, so don't stop  
Come on everybody come move your body and turn it way up loud  
Oh yeah, wooh, yeah, wooh  
  
It's a world of love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Where all of my friends make me feel so good  
So here we go  
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Ups and down at the rhythm dance all night  
  
So your hands up high, in the sky  
My crowd, the groom goes wild  
Hands up in the air, like you just don't care  
Come on everybody come move your body and turn it way up loud  
Oh yeah, wooh, yeah, wooh  
  
It's a world of love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Where all of my friends make me feel so good  
So here we go  
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Ups and down at the rhythm dance all night  
  
It's a world of love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Where all of my friends make me feel so good  
So here we go  
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh  
So throw your hands in the air just like you should  
  
Ups and down at the rhythm dance all night  
  
  
We live in a wonder for world  
Come on come on every boy and girl  
We live in a crazy twisted world  
Come on come on every boy and girl  
  
  
Now it's a world of love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Where all of my friends make me feel so good  
So here we go  
  
It's a world of love  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Where all of my friends make me feel so good  
So here we go  
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh  
So throw your hands in the air just like you should  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Ups and down at the rhythm dance all night
