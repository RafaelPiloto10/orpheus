Day drinkin' just stinkin' out loud  
Sundown's come down along with that nighttime crowd  
Bookends good friends thoughts of the past  
Your time is my time as long as it last  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
Chain smokin' all jokin' aside  
Wishin' and waitin' and hesitatin' tryin' to take it all in stride  
Night flight back home everything's changed  
All night tonight my thoughts rearranged  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
  
Night hawkin' talkin' out of my head  
Hometown show down give me the lowdown  
But please don't tell me what you think I said  
Give me the feeling I'm on the right track  
Catch me a night train I ain't comin' back  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do
