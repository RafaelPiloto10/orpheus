You're mine for awhile till a new face appears  
And then you're no longer with me  
They call me a fool and laugh at my tears  
But they know I'll never be free.  
  
CHORUS  
Between fire and water  
That's where you got me  
I get burned every time I'm with you  
Between fire and water  
I cry an ocean  
Cause without you I'm bluer than blue  
  
My love cannot die though you break my heart  
I'll want you the rest of my days  
I try to forget but each time I start  
I'm still but a slave to your ways  
  
CHORUS  
Between fire and water  
That's where you got me  
I get burned every time I'm with you  
Between fire and water  
I cry an ocean  
Cause without you I'm bluer than blue
