Behold the flashing waters  
A cloven dancing jet  
That from the milk-white marble  
For ever foam and fret  
Far off in drowsy valleys  
Where the meadow saffrons blow  
The feet of summer dabble  
In their coiling calm and slow  
The banks are worn forever  
By a people sadly gay  
A Titan with loud laughter  
Made them of fire clay  
Go ask the springing flowers  
And the flowing air above  
What are the twin-born waters  
And they'll answer Death and Love  
  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
Two lonely spirits wait  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
'Fore paradise's gate.  
They may not pass the portal  
Poor earth-enkindled pair  
Though sad is many a spirit  
To pass and leave them there  
Still staring at their flowers  
That dull and faded are  
If one should rise beside thee  
The other is not far  
Go ask the youngest angel  
She will say with bated breath  
By the door of Mary's garden  
Are the spirits Love and Death
