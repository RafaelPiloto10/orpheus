Everybody knows all the highs and all the lows,  
And in that nothing ever goes right,  
It's not up to me if you look but you don't see,  
What could obviously be alright?  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere  
  
It's a vision,not religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
Nowhere you can hide,  
So don't blame me.  
  
There's no guarantee what you get is what you see,  
Don't try to find it,just don't try,  
Don't try living in the past,if you want your dreams to last,  
Don't hide behind the mask of lies,  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby,  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere  
  
It's a vision,not religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
So don't blame me [Repeat x4]  
  
Deep inside of me,lives a hunger to be free,  
I know I'll have to pay the prize,  
I may never know when it comes or when it goes,  
I guess it's just a part of life?  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby,  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere,  
  
It's a vision,it's religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
Nowhere you can hide,  
So don't blame me [Repeat x4]
