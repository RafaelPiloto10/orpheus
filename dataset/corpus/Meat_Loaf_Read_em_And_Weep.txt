I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say  
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or firey speech  
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play  
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense  
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away  
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around  
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks  
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world  
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks  
And everything's blank  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
If I could find the words then I would write it all down  
If I could only find a voice I would speak  
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight  
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep  
  
I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream  
We let the past slip away, and put the future on hold  
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream  
  
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense  
I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away  
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant  
  
Well I could tell you good-bye or maybe see you around  
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks  
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark  
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks, and everything's blank  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart  
It's running silent and angry and deep  
It's there in my eyes and it's all I can say, c'mon and read 'em and weep  
  
Read 'em and weep, for all the hours we'll be spending alone  
Read 'em and weep, for the dreams we'll ignore  
Running silent and deep,  
And all those promises we promised to keep, they won't be kept anymore  
  
Read 'em and weep, for the magic that our bodies had made  
Read 'em and weep, for the blood that we lost  
Running silent and deep, and all the secrets that we somehow betrayed  
For whatever the cost  
  
Read 'em and weep, for the memories still alive in the bed  
Read 'em and weep, for the lies we believed  
Running silent and deep, and all the things that can never be said  
  
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep  
c'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep  
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart  
It's running silent and angry and deep  
It's here in my eyes and it's all I can say  
c'mon look at me and read 'em and weep
