How did it happen  
When did we lose it  
The love we looked for so long  
I'm sorry I called you  
But it's the first night you see  
How does it feel to be free  
  
How does it feel now  
To reach out for someone  
And find there's nobody there  
Is it weighing on you  
Cause it's sure killing me  
Tell me how does it feel to be free  
  
Funny how love is so hard to find  
And yet so easy to lose  
Maybe in time this old heart of mine  
Can learn to be free without you  
  
How did it happen  
When did we lose it  
The love we looked for so long  
I'm sorry I called you  
But I just have to see  
How does it feel to be free  
  
I'm sorry I called you  
But it's the first night you see  
Now how does it feel to be free
