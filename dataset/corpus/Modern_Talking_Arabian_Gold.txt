What kind of fool I am  
There's no smoke without a fire  
You don't want me in your game  
There's a shadow of desire  
Come on in my arms again  
I don't need no heart that's broken  
Come and try me as friend, my love  
  
Arabian gold  
For your gangster love  
Arabian gold  
The last albatross  
Arabian gold  
For your heart and pride  
Arabian gold  
For you, midnight child  
  
Arabian gold  
For your precious love  
Arabian gold  
I can turn it off  
Arabian gold  
Frozen in my tears  
Oh, I'm crying  
Take away, away my fears  
  
Take the ship that never sailed  
Silent lover and devotion  
Seven lonely nights too late  
Oh, you're breaking my emotions  
Like a loser I will smile  
Hearts are better left unbroken  
Come an try me for a while, my love
