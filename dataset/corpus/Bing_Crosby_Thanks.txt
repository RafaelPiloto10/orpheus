We used to dwell in love's own palace  
A palace of dreams come true  
Now that we're through I bear no malice  
Though we've called it a day  
All I can say is  
Thanks for all the lovely delights  
I found in your embrace.  
I'm thankful though I know  
It's ending all too soon  
And thanks for unforgettable nights  
I never can replace  
And memories that linger like a haunting tune  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes it's better, for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our road, but still I must convey our thanks  
  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes, its better, for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway, an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our way but still I must convey my thanks
