I heard the rain  
As it skipped and rolled down the pane  
Sleep was almost here  
But I stirred from not having you near  
We were apart  
For the first time since you'd claimed my heart  
I said your name  
And I knew we would burn like a flame  
Now twenty years have gone  
And I know how much I've done you wrong  
I caused you pain  
And I know that things can't be the same  
But my love has a name  
And it's yours and it burns like a flame
