Well there ain't no hu  
Ain't no telling baby  
When you will see again  
But I pray it will be tomorrow.  
  
Well the sunrise  
Is burnin' my eyes baby  
Well now I must leave now  
But I really hope to see you tomorrow.  
  
Yeah Well my house is oh, such a million miles away  
The feelin' there always hangs up my day  
Oh Cleopatra, she's driving me insane  
She's tryin' to put my body in her brain  
So uh, just uh, kiss me goodbye, just to ease the pain.  
  
Sing it, hah, sing it, hah!  
  
Ain't no, ain't no telling baby  
There ain't no telling baby  
When you're gonna see me  
'Cause I really hope that uh, it'll be tomorrow  
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Wooo, yeah  
Hope it'll be ah, hope it'll be tomorrow, ah  
Ain't no tellin' baby  
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Anyway, must leave now.
