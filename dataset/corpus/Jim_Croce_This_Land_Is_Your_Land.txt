This land is your land  
This land is my land  
From California to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest  
To the Gulf Stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
As I was walking that ribbon of highway  
I saw above me that golden skyway  
I saw below me the golden valley  
This land was made for you and me  
  
The sun was shinin' and I was strollin'  
The wheat fields waving, the dust clouds rolling  
And all around me a voice was singing  
You know that this land was made for you and me  
  
This land is your land  
This land is my land  
From California to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest  
To the Gulf Stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
This land was made for you and me  
This land was made for you and me
