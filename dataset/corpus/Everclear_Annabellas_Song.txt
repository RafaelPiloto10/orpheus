I see you roll your eyes  
You know it makes me smile  
You are like the sun to me,  
Bright as liquid fire  
I feel so powerless  
To hold you up above the world  
You are quite a lot of trouble,  
Such a pretty little girl  
  
Such a pretty little girl  
  
You know I'm never home  
I'm always miles and miles away  
I feel I'm running out of time  
To say the things I need ta say  
Call you on the telephone, you will not talk to me  
Yea you just don't understand  
You are my everything.  
  
Anna  
Anna  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
Anna, Anna  
You are never alone  
You are never alone  
  
Hey yea yea  
Hey yea yea  
Hey yea yea  
  
Anna  
Anna  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
Anna, Anna  
You are never alone  
You are never alone  
  
I like to watch you play  
When you don't know I'm there  
See you when you're sleeping and I  
Reach out and touch your hair  
I'm gonna make this world  
Be just how you want it to be  
Yea you just don't understand  
You're my everything.  
  
Anna  
Anna  
Tell me what you want  
Baby tell me what you need  
Anna, Anna  
You are never alone  
You are never alone  
  
Anna  
Anna  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
Anna, Anna  
You are never alone  
Anna  
You are never alone  
Anna  
Oh, you are never alone  
Anna  
You are never alone  
Anna  
You are never alone  
Anna
