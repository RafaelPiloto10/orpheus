Many miles of memories, many tears I can't forget  
But I know you live inside me yet, oh  
Many hours to contemplate many dreams I can't recall  
Many nights I've felt I was too small  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah, yeah  
It's a hard and bitter world when you face reality  
And it's hard to be who you want to be, oh  
Many miles of memories catch the wind and blow away  
But I know that it's over, over anyway, oh  
But tonight I sit and wonder why you left me here  
After all this time I don't know why you left me here  
If it's all behind me, you know you'll find me, oh  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
But tonight, I sit, wonder why you left me here  
After all this time I wonder why, wonder why you left me here  
If it's all behind me, you know you'll find me, oh, oh  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, yeah  
(I'm a loser)  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart, oh yeah  
(I'm a loser)
