The phone call was wrong  
The i.b.m.'s have already gone  
Talkin's too late  
The future has ended now  
Can't change our fate  
  
So sorry now  
But that don't change a thing anyhow  
Let the games begin  
The dealer laid hands out that no one can win  
  
What made us this way  
Something I'm doing or something I say  
But could it be a fact  
That I never thought I'd get caught in the act  
  
And I, I don't know why I still keep  
Hangin' around when I know that it's time  
Popped the silo  
Pushed the button  
It's the big one this time  
  
Doctor strange love, we're all in your movie now  
You get no change love  
Your bill is too high  
  
The threat's on it's way  
The package from hell that you ordered today  
Pray to your sign  
Your wish has been granted this time  
  
And I, I don't know why I still keep  
Hangin' around when I know that it's time  
Popped the silo  
Pushed the button  
It's the big one this time.
