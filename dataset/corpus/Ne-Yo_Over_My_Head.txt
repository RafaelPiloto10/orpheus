So I had someone  
You had someone  
We started out as nothing more than friends  
Oh  
But as the time got spent  
I started liking spending time with you more than him, oh  
And it wasn't what I'm meant to do  
Starting thinkin bout kissin you  
Accidentally  
Accidentally... Ooh  
Suddenly out of the blue  
As she was thinking about it too  
Cause you kissed me and he saw it, damn, damn  
  
I might be over my head  
A little over my head but I kinda like it  
This is not what I expected  
A little over my head but I kinda like it  
I kinda like it  
Oh, I said I kinda like it  
Oh oh  
  
So of course he started acting crazy  
Wound up punching you right in the eye  
Oh  
He felt like a man but I felt bad so I called you later  
To apologize  
Oh  
And it wasn't what I'm meant to do, started thinking  
Bout seeing you  
Accidentally  
Accidentally  
Oh  
Suddenly out of the blue (hey)  
As she was thinking about it too  
Cause you came to get me, and he saw you, damn, damn girl  
  
I might be over my head  
A little over my head (over my head) but I kinda like it  
This is not what I expected  
A little over my head but I kinda like it  
Kinda like it  
  
This is so crazy yet so hard  
They're fighting over me in the front yard  
I don't know who I should root for  
But there's one thing that I do know  
Oh...  
  
I might be over my head  
A little over my head but I kinda like it  
This is not what I expected  
A little over my head (over my head)but I kinda like it  
Kinda like it  
  
I might be over my head (hey hey)  
A little over my head but I kinda like it  
This is not what I expected  
A little over my head but I kinda like it  
Kinda like it  
  
Oh  
A little over my head  
A little over my head, my head  
A little over my head  
Oh...  
A little over my head...
