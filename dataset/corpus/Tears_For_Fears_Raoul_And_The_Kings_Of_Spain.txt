When the seventh of the seventh son  
Comes along and breaks the chains  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Making it plain, making it sane  
To turn this loss into a gain  
  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
  
Did you know your father was an island  
Did you know your mother was the sea  
Can we ever hope to seek asylum  
From the bounds of fate and family  
  
When the seventh of the seventh son  
Comes along and breaks the chains  
  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Making it plain, making it sane  
To turn this loss into a gain  
  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
  
Did you know all mothers come from heaven  
Did you know all fathers come from hell  
That is why they're at sixes and seven  
That is why their marriage isn't well  
  
When the seventh of the seventh son  
Comes along and breaks the chains  
  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Making it plain, making it sane  
To turn this loss into a gain  
  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and The Kings of Spain
