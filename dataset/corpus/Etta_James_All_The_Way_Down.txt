Out on the street  
The summer heat  
Boys playing games  
Changing their names  
Pulling tricks  
Getting their kicks  
All the way down  
Let it ride  
  
Meeting the stars  
In funky bars  
Shiny new cars  
And back door lies  
Trying to hike  
Or any other type of ride  
All the way down  
Let it ride  
  
Trying everything now  
Gotta check it out  
Trying everything now  
Gotta check it out  
Hey girl!  
You want a blow?  
Why not?  
I got no where to go  
  
Benny the albino  
Says don't be a whino  
Try these here flakes  
They got what it takes  
To make you a star  
And change who you are  
All the way down  
Let it ride  
  
Tell me were you satisfied?  
Did you mix it?  
Did you like it?  
Oh! tell me was it good to you  
I wanna know did you make enough money?  
Did you make enough money to go down in style?  
Or did you find yourself just dying  
Dying, dying, dying, after a while?  
  
Got to get off!  
Got to get off!  
I got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get off!  
Please help me, help me!  
To git off now, now!  
Before I freeze, and before I can come up off my knees  
And lose my key to freedom  
And I go, all the way down, all the way down
