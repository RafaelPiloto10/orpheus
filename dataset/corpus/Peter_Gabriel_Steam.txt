Stand back!  
Stand back!  
  
What are those dogs doing sniffing at my feet  
They're on to something, picking up  
Picking up this heat, this heat  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
Give me steam  
And how you feel to make it real  
Real as anything you've seen  
Get a life with this dreamer's dream  
  
You know your culture from your trash  
You know your plastic from your cash  
When I lose sight of the track  
You know the way back  
But I know you  
  
You know your stripper from your paint  
You know your sinner from your saint  
Whenever heaven's doors are shut  
You kick them open but  
I know you  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Give me steam  
And how you feel to make it real  
Real as any place you've been  
Get a life with the dreamer's dream  
  
Stand back!  
Stand back!  
Can't you see I've lost control I'm getting indiscreet  
You're moving in so close 'til I'm picking up  
Picking up this heat, this heat  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
You know your green from your red  
You know the quick from the dead  
So much better than the rest  
You think you've been blessed  
But I know you  
  
You know your ladder from your snake  
You know the throttle from the brake  
You know your straight line from a curve  
You've got a lot of nerve  
But I know you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
Everybody nosedive  
Hold your breath, count to five  
Back-slap, booby-trap,  
Cover it up in bubble wrap  
Room shake, earthquake  
Find a way to stay awake  
It's going to blow, it's going to break  
This is more than I can take  
  
Oh yeah, I need steam  
Feel the steam all around me  
Ah you're turning up the heat  
When I start to dream aloud  
See you move your hands and feet  
Won't you step into this cloud of steam  
This steam  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
Help me yeah  
Ready to steam out the log jam  
Stir crazy from the freezer to the boil  
Water's bubbling, it's b-b-b-bubbling  
Bubbling [Repeat x 4]  
Like it's coming to a boil  
Give me steam, lady  
Give me steam around me now  
Ahh, coming alive [Repeat x 2]  
Said give me some steam
