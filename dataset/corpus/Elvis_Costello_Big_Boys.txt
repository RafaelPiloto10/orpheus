I am starting to function  
In the usual way  
Everything is so provocative  
Very very, temporary  
  
I shall walk (I shall walk)  
Out of this place (out of this place)  
I shall walk  
Out on you  
'Cause you go silly  
If she's willing  
Trying so hard to be like the big boys  
  
So you take her to the pictures  
Trying to become a fixture  
Inch by inch trying to reach her  
All the way through the second feature  
Worrying about your physical fitness  
Tell me how you got this sickness, oh ohhhh..  
  
I was caught in the suction  
By a face like a truncheon  
I was down upon one knee  
Stroking her vanity  
  
I was stuck on a hammerhead  
I came alive and left for dead  
As my face returned to red  
Choking on my pride and pity  
  
We can talk (we can talk)  
Until your face is blue ('til your face is blue)  
We can talk but she'll get to you  
After you've been loved and hated  
By the ones you've watched and waited  
Found that they were overrated  
  
She'll be the one - when the party's over  
She'll be the one - when the girls have gone home  
She'll be the one - that you'll wish you'd held onto  
She'll be the one - but it's too late for you to  
She'll be the one - who knows all your history  
She'll be the one -  
  
So you can cross her off your list  
And you try so hard  
And you try so hard  
And you try so hard  
To be like the big boys, oh.
