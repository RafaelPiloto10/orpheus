I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sitting all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sittin' all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
  
Cryin' over you  
I'm cryin' over you  
Cryin' over  
Little memories of things we used to do  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you
