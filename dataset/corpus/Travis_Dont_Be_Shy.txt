Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there  
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead  
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by  
On by  
You know love is better than a song  
Love is where all of us belong  
So don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there  
You're there  
Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there  
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead  
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by  
On by, on by, etc.
