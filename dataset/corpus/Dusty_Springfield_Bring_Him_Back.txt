Oh, bring him back  
If he's too much for you  
And you don't know just what to do  
Just send him right on back to me  
'Cause I'm still the fool I used to be  
  
If it's only just for a day  
I'll take him back any old kinda way  
I ain't fooling anymore  
Been crying since he walked out the door  
  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know where to go  
You know I love him so  
You know so won't you  
(bring him back), mmm  
(Bring him back)  
You know you gotta bring him back  
(Bring him back), ooh, yeah  
(Bring him back), mmm  
Just bring him back to me  
  
(I want you to bring him back)  
(I want you to bring him back)  
(I want you to bring him back)  
  
Oh, bring him back to me  
My life is full of misery  
Let me play with the boy  
Let me be his little toy  
  
Oh, bring him back to me  
My life is full of misery  
You know you gotta bring him back  
Ah, ha, you've gotta bring him back  
Oh, bring him back to me  
Oh, my life is full of misery
