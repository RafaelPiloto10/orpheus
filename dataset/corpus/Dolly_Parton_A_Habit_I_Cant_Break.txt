Loving you isn't good for me you keep my tears flowing  
If I loved you I couldn't stay gone so there's no use in going  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
I haven't found a way yet but I've been tryin'  
To stop loving you but I can't wait there's no use a lyin'  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
Loving you is a habit I can't break  
I've been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel  
So I might as well get used to these heartaches  
Loving you is a habit I can't break

(A habit I can't break)  
Loving you is a habit I can't break...  
Loving you is a habit I can't break
