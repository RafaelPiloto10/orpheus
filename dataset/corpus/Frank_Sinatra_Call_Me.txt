When you're feeling sad and lonely there's a service I can render.  
Tell the one who loves you only, I can be so warm and tender.  
Call me, don't be afraid you can call me, maybe it's late but just call me.  
Call me and I'll be around.  
When its seems your friends desert you, there's somebody thinking of you.  
I'm the one who'll never hurt you, maybe it's because I love you.  
Call me, don't be afraid you can call me, maybe it's late but just call me.  
Call me and I'll be around.  
Now don't forget me, 'cause if you let me, I will always stay by you.  
You got to trust me, that's how it must be, there's so much I can do.  
If you call, I'll be right with you, you and I should be together.  
Take this love I long to give you, I'll die at your side forever, call me,
call me.
