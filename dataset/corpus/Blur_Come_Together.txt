I don't understand  
You're walking all over me  
All over me to you  
Well you must be mad  
And you know you are  
You should have known  
I'd do anything for you  
  
So why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?  
Why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?  
  
Inside my head  
There's nothing left  
It's all been taken out  
Been taken out by you  
Do I care?  
Well you know I do  
You should have known  
I'd do anything for you  
  
So it's been said  
And you know it all  
Then you should have known  
I'd do anything for you  
For you  
  
So why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?  
Why, why  
Can't we come together  
Why?
