We stood upon the edge  
Eyes fixed in the sky  
Just before twilight  
Claimed the lights  
Wind carried voices  
Over the waters  
From a whisper  
Into a scream  
  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here  
  
The words that we cast  
Into eternity  
They still echo in my ears  
And in my dreams  
So meet me tonight  
In the place that time forgot  
And take with you  
All that you can't leave behind  
  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here  
  
Headlights open  
The road ahead  
They can't light up the sky  
But they can light our way  
  
We got this one night to make it real  
For tomorrow is too far from here
