You're wearing out your welcome wagon  
Scraped ya up to drag ya  
Home on the range you got the flame  
So now you suck some honeys  
Comb your hair get out of bed  
And wash your face, now look you're all  
Alone in your room you feel the gloom  
So now you curse the day you're  
  
Sorry you missed the boat  
Sorry that's all she wrote  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
Mmm your talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
  
You talk of love and hope someday  
You won't be feeling so  
Neglected, all your promises  
And now you turn to me and scream  
It's hectic at the bottom  
And it's lonely at the top, so run to  
Mommy's always waitin'  
But this time she blew her top, you say you're  
  
Sorry you missed the boat  
Sorry that's all she wrote  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
Mmm your talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
Ah your talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
  
Sorry you missed the boat  
Sorry that's all she wrote  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
Mmm your talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
Ohh your talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
Talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know  
  
I don't wanna hear it  
T-t-talk is cheap  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know
