[Chorus]  
Don't give up an inch girl  
If you won't take me for the mile  
Don't give up an inch girl  
If you won't take me for a mile  
  
Miles from home and I'm all alone  
And looking for a first time  
We took a long ride  
And there by your side  
I did my first crime  
  
Well Mary Mary quite contrary  
Just how does your garden grow  
She said you ring my bell  
And rattle my shell  
I'll be your pretty maid all in a row  
  
Put me to the test  
Lay me down to rest  
While your nails cut me up like a knife  
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo  
And scarred this poor boy for life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was a hot one  
In the summer sun  
And more than heat was rising  
I remember that September  
And just how you left me smiling  
  
I left there shaken  
Body was achin'  
Like it never did before  
  
Begged and pleaded  
Swear I needed  
Needed you a whole lot more  
  
Put me to the test  
Lay me down to rest  
While your nails cut me up like a knife  
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo  
And scarred this poor boy for life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Made this boy's bell ring  
And there I earned my wings  
Left me there in sweet pain  
Hell I'll never be the same  
  
[Chorus]
