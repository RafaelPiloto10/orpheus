After the party, you took me back to your parlour  
A little nervous laughter, locking the door  
My stockings fall onto the floor, desperate for more  
Nobody else can share this  
Here comes one and one makes one  
The glorious union, well, it could be love  
Or it could be just lust but it will be fun  
It will be wonderful  
  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Feel it! See what you're doing to me  
  
God, but you're beautiful, aren't you?  
Feel your warm hand walking around  
I won't pull away, my passion always wins  
So keep on a-moving in, keep on a-tuning in  
Synchronize rhythm now  
  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Feel it! See what you're doing to me
