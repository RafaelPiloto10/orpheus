Paddlin' down the michigan  
Catchin' all the fish I can  
Breathin' holy air in my canoe  
Groovin' down superior  
Takin' taboos easier  
Talkin' with the lord in my canoe  
Send me no pillows I can dream on  
I've seen all the nightmares I can bear to see  
Gotta find the river to your kingdom in my canoe  
Many moons on erie lake  
Not a bottle of beer to break  
Heaven knows I try best I can do  
Maybe lake ontario  
Gonna take me where I hope  
Got to find the lord in my canoe  
Paddlin' down the michigan  
Catchin' all the fish I can  
Breathin' holy air in my canoe  
Send me no willows I can weep on  
I've done all the crying I can bear to do  
Lookin' for the tributary to your kingdom  
In my canoe.
