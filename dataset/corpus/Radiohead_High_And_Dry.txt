Two jumps and a week  
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy  
Flying on your motorcycle  
Watching all the ground beneath you drop  
  
Kill yourself for recognition  
Kill yourself to never ever stop  
You broke another mirror  
You're turning into something you are not  
  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
  
Drying up in conversation  
You will be the one who cannot talk  
All your insides fall to pieces  
You just sit there wishing you could still make love  
  
They're the ones who'll hate you  
When you think you've got the world all sussed out  
They're the ones who'll spit at you  
You'll be the one screaming out  
  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
  
It's the best thing that you ever had,  
The best thing you ever, ever had  
It's the best thing that you ever had,  
The best thing you have had is gone away  
  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high,  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
