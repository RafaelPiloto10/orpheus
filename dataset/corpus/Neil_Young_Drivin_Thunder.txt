People put me down,  
Say that I'm a fool  
But I got news for them  
I ain't never going back  
To driving school.  
  
And I ain't too good  
With numbers  
And I've just run out of fuel  
Here comes  
Another corner baby  
Let me demonstrate  
My slide rule.  
  
Drivin' thunder,  
Rollin' down the highway  
Just one way to go,  
Just one way to go.  
Just one way to go,  
Hey hey, and that's my way.  
  
I stopped into the courthouse  
I had to pay some bills  
Got talking with the judge  
About the finer points  
Of my driving skills.  
  
He said Son,  
You only drive that way  
Tryin' to get your thrills  
But bear in mind  
Your driver's license  
Ain't never been no  
License to kill.  
  
Drivin' thunder,  
Rollin' down the highway  
Just one way to go,  
Just one way to go.  
Just one way to go,  
Hey hey, and that's my way.  
  
Driving school,  
Slide rule,  
Driving skills,  
License to kill.  
  
Drivin' thunder,  
Rollin' down the highway  
Just one way to go,  
Just one way to go.  
Just one way to go,  
Hey hey, and that's my way.
