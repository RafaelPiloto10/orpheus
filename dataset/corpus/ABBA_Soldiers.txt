Do I hear what I think I'm hearing  
Do I see the signs I think I see  
Or is this just a fantasy  
Is it true that the beast is waking  
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight  
In the pale moonlight  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble  
Won't somebody tell me what I hear  
In the distance, but drawing near  
Is it only a storm approaching  
All that thunder and the blinding light  
In the winter night  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance
