Love takes the patience of Job  
That's what my Mama always said  
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know  
That's what the Good Book says  
You gotta play the cards you got  
Who knows what fate is holding  
At times you gotta go without knowing where you're going  
  
That's why I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the baby don't leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin' you  
  
Lord knows we've had our share of fights  
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs  
We've had plenty and then some of baby I'm gones and turnarounds  
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel  
Someday we're gonna look back  
Say look at us now  
  
That's why I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the baby don't leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin' you  
  
Keep on lovin' you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didn't mean it like that's  
I'd never hurt yous  
Oh, I keep on lovin' you  
  
I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didn't mean it like that  
I'd never hurt yous  
Oh, I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you
