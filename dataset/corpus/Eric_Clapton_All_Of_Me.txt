All of me, why not take all of me?  
Can't you see, I'm no good without you?  
Take my lips, I wanna lose them  
Take my arms, I never use them  
  
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry  
How can I get along without you?  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me?  
  
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry  
How can I get along without you?  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me?  
  
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
