[Chorus:]  
God loves people more than anything  
God loves people more than anything  
More than anything he wants  
Them to know  
He'd rather die than let them go  
'Cause god love people more  
Than anything  
  
God loves the weary  
When they're too weak to try  
He feels their pain, he knows their shame  
He cries with those who cry  
He won't give up or walk away  
When other people do  
'Cause god loves people more  
Than anything  
  
[Chorus:]  
More than anything he wants us to go  
And show the world so they will know  
That god loves people more  
Than anything
