They gave you such a hard time  
When they took your babe away  
You heard it on the airwaves  
That she joined the sla  
Oh the stories, tape recordings  
Just when things seemed at their worst  
Then the good Lord heard you calling  
And he gave back Patty Hearst  
  
You got your baby back  
Poor girl is out of the sack  
Silly young thing, was just a fling  
Like any teenager would do  
But daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes  
And maybe a new cadilliac  
You got your baby back  
  
When she started to flee, you gave food for free  
But you knew that you would'nt go broke  
The day in the bank, the sporting, the prank [?]  
Was just a fraternity joke  
  
You got your babe, that's no lie  
Thanks to the old fbi  
Time to relate and sit by a pool  
And maybe she'll go back to school  
  
And Daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes  
Amd maybe a new cadilliac  
You got your baby back  
  
(spoken)  
Why Patty baby  
I knew deep down in my heart that you'd be coming back to your papa  
And honey, I did'nt believe a thing they said in all those silly little old  
Newspapers,  
Especially the ones I didn't own.  
But don't worry darling, We'll be keeping your supper warm  
  
When she started to flee, you gave food for free  
But you knew that you wouldn't go broke  
The day in the bank, the sporting, the prank  
Was just a fraternity joke.  
  
You got your baby back, poor girl is out of the sack  
Silly young thing, was just a fling like any teenager would do  
But daddy is here now, to buy you some clothes and maybe a new cadilliac  
You got your baby back (repeat three times)
