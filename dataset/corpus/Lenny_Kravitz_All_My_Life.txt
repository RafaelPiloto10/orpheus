Is it the way that you feel when i'm kissing on you  
Or is it the soul I can see in your eyes  
The clothes that you wear or the smell of your hair  
Or is it the way I can't sleep when you're not there  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
  
Is it the way that you feel deep inside  
Or is it the way that I feel so alive  
Your star and your flair are beyond compare  
Or is it the way that we feel when we're on fire  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, Oh I, I've been waiting for you  
Every night, Oh I've been waiting for you  
  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, Oh I, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you
