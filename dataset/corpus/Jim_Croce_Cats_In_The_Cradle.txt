A child arrived just the other day,  
Came to the world in the usual way,  
But there were planes to catch  
And bills to pay, he learned to walk while I was away  
He was talking before I knew it and as he grew  
He said I'm going to be like you Dad,  
You know I'm going to be like you.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
My son turned 10 just the other day,  
Said thanks for the ball now c'mon let's play  
Will you teach me to throw, I said not today,  
I've got a lot to do, he said that's ok  
And he walked away and he smiled and he said  
You know I'm going to be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm going to be like you.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
He came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
I'm proud of you, won't you sit for a while  
He shook his head and said with a smile,  
What I'm feeling like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See you later can I have them please.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
I've long since retired and my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind  
He said I'd love to Dad, if I could find the time  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu  
But it's sure nice talking you Dad, it's been real nice talking to you.  
And as I hung up the phone it occured to me  
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon,  
Little Boy Blue, and the Man in the Moon,  
When you coming home son, I don't know when  
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.
