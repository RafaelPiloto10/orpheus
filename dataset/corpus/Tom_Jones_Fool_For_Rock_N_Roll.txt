I step into the light so you can clearly see  
And I don't know the first thing about you  
Here I stand before you, now what you make of me?  
Do I measure up to what you want?  
I been rollin' on the river too long  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long, too long  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long  
I'm a fool for loving it 'cause you know I do, yes I do  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long, too long  
Just take stock of your life, I hear him say to me  
Now you've got your fortune and your fate  
How long can things go on before they cease to be?  
But you know that somethings never change  
And I'll keep rollin' on the only way that I can  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long, too long  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long, too long  
I'm a fool for loving it 'cause you know I do, yes I do  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll  
I remember the way it used to be  
But any way that you want it, that's alright with me  
For maybe too long, too long  
I'll keep rollin' on, the only way that I can  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, for maybe too long, too long  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long, too long, long, long, yeah  
Yes, I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, maybe too long, too long  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, for maybe too long, too long, long, long  
I'm a fool for rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, baby  
I'm a fool baby, for rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll
