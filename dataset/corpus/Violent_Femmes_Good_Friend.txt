If only you could know  
How I'd love you so  
The way good friends do  
The way I would be you  
And me too, I'd be your  
Good friend, I'd be your  
Good friend, I'd be your  
Good friend  
That's what I would've been  
Oh but everytime I turn around  
My heart's on the mend  
These feelings I have  
I have to suspend  
Seems like everytime I turn around  
My heart's on the mend  
Because I don't think you want me  
To be your good friend  
Yesterday is a laugh  
And the traumas slip past  
And I don't think  
That I'll be doing a lot of crying  
But I'll sure do my share of sighing  
I would have been your
