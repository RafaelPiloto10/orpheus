Always look so good on the outside  
When you get to believin' it's true,  
Then you know that you're on your way  
People tug on your shirt, say you're lucky  
You've got ev'rything you want, but you don't  
Yet you dare not say  
Go downtown people runnin' around  
They climb slowly draggin' you downtown,  
Horns make a dent in your mind  
Plush rooms make a blindin' your eye to see,  
Blindin' me. Light, lovely light,  
Won't ya' shine in my window  
Love, precious love won't ya' fill ev'ry room,  
Been too long on the road.  
Maybe cynics veins are my life blood  
Maybe bitin' the hand that I feed so I'll try  
Try to understand what it is that devours your freedom,  
Makes you drop what you used to hold in your heart.  
All the things you planned  
Go upstairs with a someone who says she cares,  
Like the devil she does,  
What comes ever into your mind?  
Then gone, leavin' you with the coldest room,  
Oldest gloom. Warm, won't you be,  
Please be there in my winter.  
Love, precious love won't ya' come full circle,  
Been too long on the road.  
How can I do this to myself?  
Have I taken leave of my senses?  
What kind of changes make a man  
Want to tear down all his fences  
Whoa, I'd like to know. Home ever home,  
How could I ever doubt you  
Love, precious love, how could I live without you?  
Been too long on the road.
