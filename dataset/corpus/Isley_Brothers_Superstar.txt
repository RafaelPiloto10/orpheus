Who's that girl that considers her self a super woman and  
Who's that girl that's independent and hard working and  
Who's that girl that can cook and got some good lovin' and  
Who's that girl that can take it down on her man and turn it into something  
  
[Chorus]  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
  
Tell me who's that man with them 20 inches under that wide body benz and who's
that man  
Sitting in VIP just a thuggin'  
And who's that man all the ladies are kissin and huggin  
Tell me who's that man that the whole ghetto is lovin'  
  
[Chorus]  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
  
Tell me y'all who's that girl that looks so good and dress so sexy  
And Who's that girl that's got me wanting her next to me  
And who's that girl that with one look can knock me of my feet  
And who's that girl that can take me striaght into extasy  
  
[Chorus]  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
  
Tell me y'all Who's that man that considers himself to be full grown  
And who's that man that claims the world to be his own  
And who's that man with a gentle heart and a pleasent tone  
But when you mess with his money  
He's quick to go upside your door  
  
[Chorus]  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
  
You got to let your light shine  
Let your light shine  
Let your light shine  
Let your light shine  
Let your light shine  
  
Let your light shine (your a star you gotta let it show)  
Let your light shine (the world is yours you gotta take control)  
Let your light shine (sang it loud so everyone knows)  
Let your light shine (Just take the key and unlock the door)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top  
  
You's a superstar  
That's what you are  
Money, clothes and fancy cars  
So high your on the top
