Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace  
Molly is the singer in a band  
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face  
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand  
  
[Chorus]  
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra  
La la how the life goes on  
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra  
La la how the life goes on  
  
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store  
Buys a twenty carat golden ring  
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door  
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a couple of years they have built  
A home sweet home  
With a couple of kids running in the yard  
Of Desmond and Molly Jones  
  
Happy ever after in the market place  
Desmond lets the children lend a hand  
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face  
And in the evening she still sings it with the band  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a couple of years they have built  
A home sweet home  
With a couple of kids running in the yard  
Of Desmond and Molly Jones  
  
Happy ever after in the market place  
Molly lets the children lend a hand  
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face  
And in the evening he's a singer with the band  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da
