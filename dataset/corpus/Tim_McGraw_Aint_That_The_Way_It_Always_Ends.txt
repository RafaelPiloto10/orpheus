Johnny came home broken hearted  
Said he lost his girl  
He burrowed up all the hurt in his heart  
But still a hole in the wall of his world  
Now Betty she was a blond haired beauty  
With an eye for a man who could spend  
She stole his heart in a pick up truck  
Then drove off in a Mercedes van  
And he said  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh she looked so innocent  
Talkin' 'bout bein' just friends  
Oh and it don't make a bit of since  
Ain't that the way tit always ends?  
  
Sharon, she had a long time dream  
And only one man in her life  
He kept her waitin'  
But she didn't care  
Cause he promised her he'd make her his wife  
Now Billy, he had a good thing goin'  
But he let it go to his head  
Well he got jealous late one night,  
She caught them both in her bed  
And she said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh it always looks so innocent  
Talkin' 'bout bein' just friends  
Oh and it don't make a bit og since  
Ain't that the way it always ends?  
  
Ain't that the way it always ends?  
  
Ain't that the way it always ends?
