I had a friend who spoke of fate  
And he knew of another place in space and time  
He told of how me and my lady  
Could look but we would never find  
Said if you please I beg your pardon  
Sometimes the things you see they just ain't so  
Your life can be an avant garden  
Cause love's what makes your garden grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
Sometimes my life ain't what it's seemin'  
Right from the start it's what your heart's believin'  
Could all this just be lucid dreamin'  
But dreams just ain't enough for me  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
You know it just ain't right  
To deal with other's shite  
No one should ever be so broken hearted  
Don't never be afraid  
Cause when you got it made  
Yeah you don't even have to try  
So I'll be waiting in your garden  
Ffff...watching all your flowers grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
You'll know we've arrived  
Here inside our avant garden...yeah yeah  
The sun brings the rain  
The moon needs the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
Beware of the lies  
A word to the wise  
There's sweet cherry pies  
And truth inside our avant garden...ooh ah yea  
Do it do it  
Do it do it...  
You can spend your whole lifetime  
Under my skin  
You can be never more mine  
Under my skin
