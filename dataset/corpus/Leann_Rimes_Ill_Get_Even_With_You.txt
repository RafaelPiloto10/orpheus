For all the nights you held me close  
Warmed my heart when it was cold  
When I was giving up  
You gave me love  
  
From some dark alley in my mind  
You made a hidden dream unwind  
Turned my stumbling blocks  
To stepping stones  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll get even with you  
For the hard times you helped me through  
I'll give it back to you  
All the love you've given me  
For the rest of my life  
Everyday and every night  
If it's the last thing I'll ever do  
I'll get even with you  
  
When the odds were against me  
And I was lost with no will to go on  
You wrapped your loving arms around my heart  
Took my losin' hand and led me home  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll get even with you  
For the hard times you helped me through  
I'll give it back to you  
All the love you've given me  
For the rest of my life  
Everyday and every night  
If it's the last thing I'll ever do  
I'll get even with you  
  
If it's the last thing I ever do  
I'll get even with you
