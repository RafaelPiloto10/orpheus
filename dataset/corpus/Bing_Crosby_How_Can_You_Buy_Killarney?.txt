An American landed on Erin's green isle  
He gazed at Killarney with rapturous smile  
"How can I buy it?" he said to his guide  
"I'll tell you how" with a smile he replied.  
  
How can you buy all the stars in the skies?  
How can you buy two blue Irish eyes?  
How can you purchase a fond mother's sighs?  
How can you buy Killarney?  
  
Nature bestowed all her gifts with a smile  
The emerald, the shamrock, the Blarney.  
When you can buy all these wonderful things  
Then you can buy Killarney.
