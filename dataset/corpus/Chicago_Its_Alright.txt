All dressed up  
With no place to go,  
Somebody lost a romance.  
All messed up,  
But you never know,  
This may be a good chance.  
You can hold me.  
I can make it better.  
You can hold me.  
Don't have to fall in love forever.  
I'll be there one night at a time.  
You don't have to love me  
If that's not what you're after.  
Oh, oh, oh and it's  
Alright.  
I got the time.  
Alright  
To tell one more little lie.  
And it's alright  
I'll make you feel fine.  
Alright  
If it's all night.  
Ain't nobody home  
Don't you hang your head,  
Don't get caught up in the sorrow.  
All alone  
Call me up instead,  
Let me take you to tomorrow.  
Let me hold you.  
I'll make you feel better.  
Let me hold you.  
Don't have to fall in love forever.  
Don't be scared to call anytime.  
You don't have to love me  
If that's not what you're after.  
Oh, oh, oh and it's...  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
It's alright to give it one more try.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
It's alright to live it up tonight.
