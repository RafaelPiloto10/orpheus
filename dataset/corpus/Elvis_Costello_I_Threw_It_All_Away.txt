I once held her  
In my arms  
She said she would always stay  
But I was cruel  
And I treated her like a fool  
I threw it all away  
  
Once I had mountains  
In the palm of my hand  
And rivers to drink through everyday  
But I must have been mad  
I never knew what I had  
Until I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
That makes the world go round  
Love as only love  
Can't be denied  
  
Not matter what you think about it  
Just won't be able to do without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So when you find someone  
Who gives you all of her love  
Take it to your heart don't  
Let is stray  
'Cause one thing for certain  
You will surely be hurting  
If you throw it all away  
If you throw it all away
