[Chorus]  
Come back Come back to me  
I've been waiting here patiently  
  
I've been walking a thin white line  
Between love and hate  
I could use a lil' company  
A lil' kindness to go a long way  
  
Weeks turn into months  
Months turn into years  
Reaching the same conclusions  
Gathering up the fear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been walking a thin white line  
Between love and hate  
I could use a lil' company  
A lil' kindness to go a long way  
  
Weeks turn into months  
Months turn into years  
Reaching the same conclusions  
Gathering up the fear  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Come back Come back to me
