I went looking for a new love  
A different kind of true love  
Who would treat me right  
Day and night  
He baby I went looking too,  
and I found out that there is no other love for me but you  
Just me and you.

A different kind of true love  
Who's gonna treat me right  
Day and night  
Then I found what I was after  
Now my life is filled with laughter

And my life was one big question  
I was down and out  
Filled with doubt  
Now I know just where I'm going  
And my happiness is showing
