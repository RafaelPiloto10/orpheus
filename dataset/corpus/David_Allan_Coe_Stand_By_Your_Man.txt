Sometimes it's hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man  
You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't
understand  
But if you love him you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand  
And if you love him be proud of him cause after all he's just a man  
Stand by your man give him two arms to cling to  
And something warm to come to when nights're cold and lonely  
Stand by your man and tell the world you love him  
Keep giving all the love you can stand by your man  
  
Well honey that's the only way that daddy knows how to answer your question  
I knew when your mama passed away that someday I have to explain the things to
you  
That might make me and you both feel unconfortable  
So I thought that the best thing to do  
Is to sing you this song your mama used to sing  
I hope that you will understand cause she did stand by her man  
Stand by your man...  
Stand by your man...
