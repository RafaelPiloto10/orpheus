Well, I have walked love's winding pathway  
Seeking to find love's treasures untold  
And just when I reached the end of my journey  
I'd find that I have three last steps to go.  
  
The first step was heartache I took when you cheated  
The next step was heartbreak he held you so near  
The last step I'm taking now that you love another  
Because you lie I cry these eternal tears.  
  
My fortune to love like rain from above  
I never know eternaly I love you so.  
  
My journey is over now and I realized  
These eternal tears forever I'll cry.  
  
My fortune to love like rain from above  
I never know eternaly I love you so.  
  
My journey is over now and I realized  
These eternal tears forever I'll cry.  
  
My journey is over now and I realized  
These eternal tears forever I'll cry.
