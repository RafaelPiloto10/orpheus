[Chorus:]  
Wham! bam!  
I am! a man!  
Job or no job,  
You can't tell me that I'm not.  
Do! you!  
Enjoy what you do?  
If not, just stop!  
Don't stay there and rot!  
  
You got soul...  
You got soul...  
I said get, get, get on down,  
Said get, get, get, on down.  
Hey everybody take a look at me,  
I've got street credibility,  
I may not have a job,  
But I have a good time,  
With the boys that I meet "down on the line"  
I said, I - don't - need - you  
So you don't approve,  
Well who asked you to?  
Hey - jerk - you - work  
This boy's got better things to do  
Hell,  
I ain't never gonna work, get down in the dirt,  
I choose, to cruise.  
Gonna live my life, sharp as a knife,  
I've found my groove and I just can't lose.  
A.1. style from head to toe,  
Cool cat flash gonna let you know,  
I'm a soul boy - I'm a dole boy,  
Take pleasure in leisure, I believe in joy!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Party nights, and neon lights,  
We hit the floors, we hit the heights.  
Dancing shoes, and pretty girls.  
Boys in leather kiss girls in pearls!  
Hot-damn! everybody, let's play!  
So they promised you a good job - no way!  
  
One, two, three, rap!  
C'mon everybody, don't need this crap!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you're a pub man  
Or a club man  
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi  
A white cool cat with a trilby hat  
Maybe leather and studs is where you're at  
Make the most of every day  
Don't let hard times stand in your way  
Give a wham give a bam but don't give a damn  
'Cause the benefit gang are gonna pay!  
  
Now reach up high and touch your soul,  
The boys from wham! will help you reach that goal.  
It's gonna break your mama's heart, (so sad)  
It's gonna break your daddy's heart, (too bad)  
But you'll throw the dice and take my advice,  
Because I know that you're smart.  
Can you dig this thing? - yeah!  
Are you gonna get down? - yeah!  
Say wham! - wham!  
Say bam! - bam!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you want to work? - no  
Are you gonna have fun? - yeah  
Said one, two, three, rap, c'mon everybody,  
Don't need this crap!  
Enjoy what you do?  
Everybody say wham! - wham!  
Everybody say wham! bam! - wham! bam!  
Enjoy what you do?  
  
(repeat to fade)
