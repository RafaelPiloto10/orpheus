Getting dressed and bunger bound  
Shuffling through the heather  
Neighbors drop their flowers down and worry about the weather  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I dream I'm under you  
All the smiling hands delivering all the ???  
All of the smiling men with suede hands delivering with those pensions  
Wont you please except our sympathy into three dimensions  
Every night I'M floating over you my love  
Every night I'm drifting under you  
Don't want to think about my last cigarette  
Don't want to focus on the curve of your thigh  
Don't want to slip off your white silhouette  
I don't think this is a very sensible way to die.  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Every night I'M floating over you my love  
Every night I dream I'm under you  
Well I'm alter bound and under dressed  
Just slightly out of order hanging on the fringe of daylights  
Soft and pitchy border.  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I'm slipping under you  
Every night I'm floating over you my love  
Every night I'm dream I'm under you  
Lonely lonely ohh I'M so lonely.
