Now look out  
I took a ride with the pretty music  
I went down and baby you can tell  
I took a ride with the pretty music  
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell  
I'll stick it deep inside  
I'll stick it deep inside  
Cause I'm loose  
I feel fine to be dancin', baby  
I feel fine, I'm a shakin' leaf  
I feel fine to be dancin', baby  
Cause it's love, yeah I do believe  
I'll stick it deep inside  
I'll stick it deep inside  
Cause I'm loose  
And I'll stick it deep inside  
And I'll stick it hey  
Well I'm loose, well I'm loose  
Well I'm loose
