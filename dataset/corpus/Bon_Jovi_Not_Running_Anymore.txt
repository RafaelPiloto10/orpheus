Bless me father I have sinned  
I'm not sure where to begin  
I won't name names or where I've been  
But I've been there and back again  
No Hail Marys will save me  
You learned to live with memories  
Here, slip this sinner up your sleeve  
Just stay inside until I leave  
  
I've been running, always running  
Never have both feet on the floor  
I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running any more  
  
The hands of time they tick no more  
Let darkness fall upon this door  
No waves to wash up on this shore  
I won the fight but lost the war  
  
I've been running, always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
And I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running anymore  
  
There were those who I have loved  
Who've given all and given up  
I pushed your patience and my luck  
It wasn't love I didn't trust  
It wasn't you, or me, or us  
You've shouldered ifs, and ands, and buts  
It's not that way okay, I've said too much  
But I've been running, always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running anymore
