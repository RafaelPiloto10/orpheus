What a strange world we live in,  
What a shame, oh what a shame!  
Someone's always quarrellin'  
The marriage don't remain.  
Divorces by the thousands  
Is the human race insane?  
I always thought that marriage  
Should be a sacred thing.  
  
[Chorus]  
Married by the bible divorced by the law  
Ev'ry day there's more and more,  
The worst I ever saw.  
Things have changed, they're not the same  
As the days of ma and pa,  
They were married by the bible,  
No divorces by the law.  
  
Steps are often taken  
Without thinking twice  
And oft' times there's a child or two  
Who's left to pay the price.  
Those little hearts so innocent  
They don't know who's to blame,  
No mom and dad to love them,  
What a shame, oh what a shame!  
  
[Chorus]
