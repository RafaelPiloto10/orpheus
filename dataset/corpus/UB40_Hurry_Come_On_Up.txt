[Chorus]  
Hey, you, hurry come up  
See how fast you come down  
You run up your mouth  
You run out of luck  
You're running out of town  
  
Hurry come up now you're all alone  
You had to kick dirt on your stepping stone  
You lost your way across the land  
Foundations crumble built on shifting sand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurry come up in the blink of an eye  
You crowned yourself king of the castle high  
You'll never get to heaven if you tell a lie  
There's a hole in your bucket and your well's run dry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurry come up we've got nothing to say  
We sit back and watch you give yourself away  
Where's all the power now they've pulled the plug  
You're up to your neck in the hole you dug  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurry come up your edges are rough  
We need a little love ain't life tough enough  
There's no coming back your ticket's one way  
Your journey don't start till judgment day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurry come up just a fast as you can  
Time's running out for your master plan  
Cards on the table enough is enough  
They hold the aces now they call your bluff  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurry come up when you turn off the light  
How do you sleep in your bed at night  
It's all a bad dream but no-one can hear  
You only have yourself to fear  
  
[Chorus]
