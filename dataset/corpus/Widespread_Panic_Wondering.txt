I've been working  
'neath The gray sky  
And I'm wonderin'  
Still, I'm wondering why  
Must I lay low  
In a room full of strangers?  
Well, I'm thinking  
Thinking makes the danger  
My emotions they get all tangled up and  
My heart has just turned 'round  
  
Now I'm watching  
Look into my t.v.  
And I'm thinking  
Wondering about the things I see  
And I see your world  
Worthless stranger  
And I get thinking  
Thinking starts and makes it bigger  
All convictions they get all tangled up and  
Our heart has just turned round, round, round again  
  
I've been driving  
Thinking about you and me  
And I'm thinking  
Wonderin' 'bout the things I see  
When you treat your heart  
Hold you like a stranger  
And I've been thinking  
Little thinking makes the danger  
Our intentions they get all tangled up and  
Our hearts have just turned round, round, round again
