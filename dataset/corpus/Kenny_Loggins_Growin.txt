I've been your lover  
You've been my friend  
Love and a friend's all you need in the end  
We'll keep on growing  
And ever we'll be  
A friend and a love, indivisible  
  
Loving  
The seed we're sowing  
Gonna keep it growing  
As long as we can  
  
Sometimes a sunshine day  
Sometimes we're rain  
Sunshine and rain keeps the fields ever green you know  
It'll keep our love growing  
Sure as a spring  
The rain and the sun's indivisible  
The sunshine and rain indivisible  
  
Growing  
The seed we're sowing  
Gonna keep it growing  
As long as we can  
Uh mama  
Growing  
The seed we're sowing  
Gonna keep it right on growing  
As long as we can  
  
Growing  
The seed we're sowing  
Gonna keep it growing  
As long as we can  
Oh growing  
The seed we're sowing  
Gonna keep it on growing  
As long as we can  
Gonna keep it on growing  
As long as we can
