Oh yeah, here I go again  
Trading my sould to the night - but it's  
Alright, I got no pain tonight  
My demon alcohol's alive  
Oh no I can't stand  
Trading nine lives for tonight  
But it don't matter much  
Cause I don't give a fuck  
Hell on wheels I wanna ride  
  
But tonight  
No I can't die tonight  
Maybe I'll live forever  
I just can't die tonight  
  
Tonight  
No I can't die tonight  
So high I'll live forever  
No I can't die tonight  
  
Whiskey bar superman  
I don't give a damn  
Oh it's alright  
I'm too numb to stand  
And I don't give a damn  
Oh too high to die  
  
Can't die tonight  
No, no not tonight  
Can't die tonight  
Oh no tonight
