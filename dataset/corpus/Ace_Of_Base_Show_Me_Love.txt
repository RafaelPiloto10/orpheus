Show me love  
Double up  
Won't you show me love  
  
Show me love  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years  
I just want to what is mine  
Your love for me wait and see  
I'm not trying to seduce you  
Though it's a long and cold dark night  
You are the one you are  
I would never try to change you  
I want to see who you are inside  
  
Show me love  
And how to share it  
I'll give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years  
  
Life will never ever be bad under my spell  
Kiss and tell  
I feel lonely when I see you  
Why don't you give me just a smile  
You'd make my day in many ways  
Just a fragment of your lifetime  
'Cause the shine in my eyes will tell  
  
Show me love  
And how to share it  
I'll give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years  
Won't you show me love  
  
Show me love  
Let me know  
Double up  
  
Show me love  
Show me love (oh oh oh)  
Double up (I want to know)  
  
I, I'm not beautiful  
But I can give you something  
No one's gonna give you  
Me, I will fight for you  
So I'll be yours  
Just give me time  
  
Show me love  
I live, I'm learning  
Life will never ever be bad under my spell  
  
Show me love  
And how to share it  
I'll give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living  
'Cause it's been gray for so many years  
  
Show me love  
Show me love  
Show me love  
Show me love
