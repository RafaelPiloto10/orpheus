Somebody breathin' down my neck  
While I'm tryin' to roll the bones  
I don't care I'll just float a check  
Cause I'm feelin' my gamblin' Jones  
Here come seven, gimme eleven come again  
Love to hideout where I am my own best friend  
  
There's crazy little Linda Lou  
With the long and lanky legs  
Nobody do it like Linda do  
At these backwoods lone star dregs  
Like I told you, head out FM 92  
Roll in slowly, you'll be safer if you do  
  
If you don't know what I'm talkin' about  
Let me ease your worried mind  
It's the place to go without a doubt  
But it's a little bit hard to find  
Back in the timber, once you're there  
You'll want to stay  
Get loose and limber anytime night or day  
Just remember, ask for the Avalon hideaway
