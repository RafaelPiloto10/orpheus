In the year of 1492  
When Columbus sailed the ocean blue  
Had he landed on India's shore  
You might never have come to knock on my door.  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason?  
Some dreams we're made to find  
So I know that I must follow  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love.  
  
Through the rain clouds thundering nights  
Mr. Franklin stood there holding his kite  
He was crazy always pressing his luck  
But he got what he wanted when lightning struck, yeah.  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason?  
Some dreams we're made to find  
So I know that I must follow  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light.  
  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love.  
  
I believe in you and the special love we could share  
And maybe one day darling you'll turn around  
And all I really know is I will be there.  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason?  
This dream was made to find  
So I know that I will follow  
  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light  
I will find the shining light of our love.  
  
Ask me just how much I love you (of our love)  
I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love  
Ask me just how much I love you (of our love)  
I'm Galileo.
