Some of us spend hours  
In front of a friday night mirror  
Trying to understand the kinda world  
Where the beautiful prosper  
Slicking up the kinda hair  
That the magazine's say's a lost cause  
Picking out the kinda girl in your mind  
To go walking with you  
  
Yesterday I met a girl  
She made marilyn monroe look like. .. Me  
All she had to do was walk in the room  
And my problems were starting  
Then she'd at me and she'd smile  
And I feel feel such a pain in my heart  
Wanting her to come and whisper to me  
"you're the man of my dreams"  
  
Beautiful world, beautiful world  
Sending me dreams, touching my hair  
Making me cry. .. So I feel alive  
Beautiful world, why do I hide?  
  
I dunno why  
I should spend so much time feeling so bad  
I got everything a sinner could hope to get  
This side of eden  
Maybe some day I'll wake up  
And I'll do what I should  
Write a song to make heaven and earth  
Go waltzing in time  
  
Repeat chorus
