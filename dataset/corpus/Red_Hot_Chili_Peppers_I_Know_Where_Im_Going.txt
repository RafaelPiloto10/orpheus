I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too  
I got my reservations  
And I got one for you  
The trains leavin' just after dark  
There's always room for a lovin' heart  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you wanna come too  
  
I know my destination  
It's all waiting for you  
I got no hesitation  
That's where I want to be  
And by the time that the sun comes up  
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too  
  
Don't you wanna come  
Don't you wanna ride  
Don't you wanna be there by my side  
Hand in hand  
Holding on to  
The sweet salvation  
That's waiting for me and you  
  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'  
Let the spirit move you  
  
Just close your eyes  
And let it flow  
Lean your head back, let it go  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you wanna come too  
  
Don't you wanna come  
Don't you wanna ride  
Don't you wanna be there by my side  
Hand in hand  
Holding on to  
The sweet salvation  
That's waiting for me and you  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you wanna come too  
I got my reservations  
And I got one for you  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'  
Let the spirit move you  
Spirit move you, yeah  
  
I know where I'm going'  
Don't you wanna come too  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you wanna come too
