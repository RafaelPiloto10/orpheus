Brother to brother  
Now we must join our hearts and hands  
Yeah, if we love one another  
We hold the key to the promised land  
Think of all that we've been through  
The shucks and jives and royal blues  
Let us pray our time will come  
When this world will live as one  
Brother to brother  
Now don't let the devil get you down  
Oh 'cause it's bread and it's butter  
That makes this whole damn world  
Go round and round  
Do you know where we went wrong  
Tell me why the lines are drawn?  
And let us break our bound'ries down  
And live our lives on common ground  
Oh mothers and fathers  
Where will tomorrow's children be?  
Oh brother, my brother  
Let us live our lives in peace  
Brother to brother  
Brother to Brother
