Autumn in New York  
Why does it seem so exciting (inviting)  
Autumn in New York  
It spells the thrill of first-knighting  
  
Shimmering clouds - glimmering crowds (glittering crowds and shimmering
clouds)  
In canyons of steel  
They're making me feel - I'm home  
  
It's autumn in New York  
That brings a (the) promise of new love  
Autumn in New York  
Is often mingled with pain  
  
Dreamers with empty hands  
(They) All sigh for exotic lands  
  
(But) It's autumn in New York  
It's good to live it again  
  
This autumn in New York  
Transforms the slums into Mayfair  
Autumn in New York  
You'll need no castles in Spain  
  
Lovers that bless the dark  
On benches in Central Park  
  
(But) It's autumn in New York  
It's good to live it again  
  
(- in New York)
