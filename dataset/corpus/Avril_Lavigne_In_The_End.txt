Do you ever feel  
So perfect  
You're not for real  
But it's worth it  
It seems like  
Evrybody's friends  
And in time  
You know that this will end  
  
But you're not thinking of how it should be done  
So maybe you're losing your mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I can think of a thousand places  
That I know I could be  
But it's just one of those days  
When I'm hopeless and useless but happy  
  
Do you ever work out  
How it could be done  
I ain't got a doubt  
I know this is the one  
And if you feel  
Like nothing will change  
Stay for real  
Reality's not out of your range  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Another milestone  
Or maybe not so  
But still you can turn  
You can burn  
Or just go  
But it all  
Fills up  
In the end  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
Do you ever feel  
So perfect  
You're not for real  
But it's worth it  
  
In the end
