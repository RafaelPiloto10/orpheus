I would like to leave this city  
This old town don't smell too pretty and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
And when I leave this island I'll book myself into a soul asylum  
'Cause I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
  
So here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say?  
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
Half the world away, half the world away  
  
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down  
  
And when I leave this planet  
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
And if I could leave this spirit  
I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and  
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind  
  
Here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole  
My body feels young but my mind is very old  
So what do you say ?  
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway  
Half the world away, half the world away  
Half the world away  
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down  
  
No I don't feel down  
No I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
I don't feel down  
Don't feel down  
I don't feel down
