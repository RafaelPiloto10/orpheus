Why don't you call me?  
Do you think I won't answer?  
Jupiter's risin'  
And the moon is in cancer  
You been down in the hunger, baby  
I been around there, too  
Tonight, you could be in the arms of  
The arms of a woman who loves you  
  
You got your questions  
Baby, I got an answer  
Or just the hands of a healer  
And the feet of a dancer  
Yeah, it's all in the wrists now, baby  
And when the aim is true  
There'll be no blink of the eyes, baby  
The eyes of this woman who loves you  
(The eyes of this woman who loves you)  
(The eyes of this woman who loves you)  
  
Heaven's gettin' nearer  
Transmission gettin' clearer  
Now my love  
Stars are fallin' over the ocean  
Come on and show a little emotion now  
My love  
  
Why don't you call me?  
You know I'm gonna answer  
Temperature's risin'  
And the moon is in cancer  
There's a road you can ride now, baby  
Out to that wild and blue  
It runs right through the heart of  
The heart of this woman who loves you  
Yeah, right through the heart of  
The heart of this woman who loves you  
  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah, ah, ah, ah
