Darling lets turn back the years  
And go back to yesterday  
Lets pretend the time has stopped  
And I didn't go away  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
It wasn't meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling lets turn back the years  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
It wasn't meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling lets turn back the years
