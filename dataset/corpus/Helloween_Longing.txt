Feelings come and go, I've never known  
Something longs to grow, won't let go  
Spirits 'round my head, are whispering  
I turn inside instead, a-wondering  
  
Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be  
A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free  
If I don't want to know, what's written inside me  
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?  
  
Restless minds have searched, long before  
The truth will be the same, for evermore  
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel  
Can give you all you need, just listen still  
  
Here is love and there is pain  
It's all around, it's all the same  
There's nothing new that I could tell to you  
  
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts  
We might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't reject  
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be  
  
There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know  
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do  
Until we're home!  
  
Deep inside of me, I know there's  
  
Feelings come and go, I've never known
