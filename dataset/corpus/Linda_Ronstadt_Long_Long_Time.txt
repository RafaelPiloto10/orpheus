Love will abide, take things in stride  
Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side  
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen  
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means.  
  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time  
  
Caught in my fears  
Blinking back the tears  
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near  
And I never drew one response from you  
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time  
  
Wait for the day  
You'll go away  
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay  
And life's full of flaws  
Who knows the cause?  
Living in the memory of a love that never was  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind  
and I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time  
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine  
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time.
