I dreamt I saw a woman  
Standing by the strand  
Waiting for her people  
To come in from the land  
  
Waiting there for seven days  
She built a fire in the sand  
Waiting for her people  
To come in from the land  
  
She had the look of a refugee  
Hiding in her eyes  
And when I tried to talk to her  
She answered with a cry  
  
And pointed to the water  
Out beyond the harbour line  
Where a thousand ships lay waiting  
They lay waiting for my sign  
  
Chorus:  
I remember days of sunlight  
With my father by my side  
And the children, ran before us  
Like the foam upon the tide  
  
We ran like frightened partridge  
When the strangers came to talk  
Bringing sickness 'round them  
And the thunder in their walk  
  
We ran into the valleys  
And we ran into the hills  
They only ran before us,  
Driven by the strangers' will  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm waiting by the landwash  
Giant standing near  
I see them coming always  
Children in their fear  
  
I'm waiting on my blanket  
And the giant waits with me  
And I will wait here always  
As they fill the endless sea  
  
Chorus  
Repeat
