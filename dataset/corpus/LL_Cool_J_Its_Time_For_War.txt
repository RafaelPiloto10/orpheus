Welcome to Exit 13  
I am your host  
LL Cool J  
  
You said I was finished  
And Father Time was the blame  
You disrespected my legacy  
And threw dirt on my name  
Told DJs he's over  
He ain't spittin' the same  
What he says is irrelevant  
Hip-Hop culture has changed  
When I walk in the room  
Young boys look at me strange  
As if I am a relic  
From some long forgotten game  
It makes my blood boil  
Turns my eyes to flames  
I built an empire  
They tried to kick me out in the rain  
So I called on an inner power  
It's hard to explain  
It's like a holy spirit  
Utilizing hip hop slang  
I'm beyond the gold grills  
And logos on chains  
You see I changed rap forever  
I elevated the game  
Launched the greatest label  
In the history of rap  
And for twenty four years  
I carried it on my back  
I've always shined brighter  
When I'm under attack  
I might be down for a moment  
But I always come back  
  
[Chorus]  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Check it)  
It's time for war  
  
This is a resurrection  
I'm back from the dead  
They told me quit a long time ago  
But I conquered instead  
I had dreams and visions  
Swirling around in my head  
I had this hunger deep inside of me  
That has to be fed  
Hip hop will respect  
All the blood that I shed  
I have a covenant with God  
I have swallowed the bread  
Hip hop my co-defendant  
With this mic I thee wed  
I made an entire generation  
Obey what we said  
I'm talkin' France to Germany  
From Italy to Japan  
From London to Belgium  
To Afghanistan  
From Farmers Boulevard  
Smokin' a blunt with my man  
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board  
To build Def Jam  
You see, I'm the undisputed  
King of all hip hop  
Everything after is my legacy  
Like it or not  
And I will keep making history  
I can't stop  
LL Cool J  
Eternally hot  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how easily I flipped it  
And switched the style around  
Competition losin' their footing  
I see them falling down  
They will plot against me  
It kills them because I'm ballin' now  
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone  
But I got you callin' now  
This is a job that must get done  
Even if I become public enemy number one  
If I had to pick up an Uzi  
That weighs over a ton  
I will attack hip hop  
Until competition is none  
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L  
You end up tortured  
And trapped in psychological hell  
And this is the beginning  
Of a new era in rap  
LL Cool J, feel the impact  
It's okay if you call it a comeback  
And let them know  
I'm ready for combat  
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back  
The crown looks wrong on your head  
I want that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time for war  
  
It's time for war
