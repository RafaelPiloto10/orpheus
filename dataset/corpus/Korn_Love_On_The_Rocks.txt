Love on the rocks  
Ain't no surprise  
Just pour me a drink bitch, and I'll tell you some lies  
Got nothing to lose, so you just sing the blues, all the time  
  
I gave you my heart, gave you my soul  
You left me alone here, with nothing to hold  
Yesterday's gone, now all I want, is a smile  
  
At first they say they want you  
They really need you  
Suddenly you find you' re out there, walking in the storm  
And when they know they have you, then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You got to leave, just get away  
  
We all know the song...  
  
Need what you need, you can say what you want much you can do when the feeling
is gone  
Baby blue skies above, but it's cold, when your love's on the rocks  
  
At first they say they want you  
They really need you  
Suddenly you find you' re out there, walking in the storm  
And when they know they have you, then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You got to leave, just get away  
  
We all know the song...  
  
Love on the rocks  
Ain't no big surprise  
Just pour me a drink bitch, and I'll cover your eyes  
Yesterday's gone, and now all I want, is a smile
