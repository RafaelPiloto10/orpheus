This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
Back of the liquor store bout to blaze this joint  
Got some dice in my hand, my man says six is your point  
Trying to hit the hard way so I can break like Steve Millar  
Take the money then I run son, I'm a lover and a killer  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
I feel like God and the devil, I'm a saint, I'm a sinner  
I'm a hard rocking, hard headed, hard sick summer winner  
I'm a cooch blazing, bush chasing product of the city  
And I ain't asking for your love and I don't want your pity  
So girl don't talk about me shitty, don't act all high and ditty  
Cause if your man keep playing me funny I'm a come take all his money  
And leave him holy from this blessing with my four pound Smith-N-Wesson  
Better watch out who you're stressin', fuck around you'll learn your lesson  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
Back of the liquor store tryin' to break these chumps  
Bunch of heads in a circle, daddy's handing out lumps  
Trying to shake these bones, I'm trying to get these shoes  
But yo they all think Whitey's cheating 'cause tonight I can't lose  
They want to take my funds but I'm a blaze my guns  
With burning sensations and heart palpitations  
Why you breathing so heavy, while your palms all sweaty  
And if you thinkin' bout a stick move, word to God you ain't ready  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
This, this, this, this is a warning, I, I warned you baby  
This, this, this is a warning  
This is a warning, this is a warning  
This is a warning, this, this is a warning
