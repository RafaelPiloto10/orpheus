It was not posed  
It messed me up  
It was her recording herself  
Whisper.  
"What is it worth to me?"  
Thinking one thought  
The advice to be okay.  
Break into children's hospital  
Cry it out.  
"don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me"  
And I broke up  
Without a note  
And I broke up  
Its a mess  
Go go go go go  
Away from here.  
Food color poured out all over her shorts mixed with  
I'll make a gate you cannot pass  
Taped to there loinclothes  
A sign that says "Why us?"  
Flip yourself off but erase it when someone sees you.  
"This, this is the worst vacation ever, I am going to cut open your  
Forehead with a roofing shingle, Ohh Ohh"  
And I broke up  
Without a note  
And I broke up  
And I broke up  
Behind your house  
And I broke up
