I'm tired of being me,  
And I don't like what I see,  
I'm not who I appear to be  
So I start off every day,  
Down on my knees I will pray,  
For a change in any way  
But as the day goes by,  
I live through another lie,  
If it's any wonder why  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Will I always stay the same  
If I say one thing,  
Then I do the other  
It's the same old song,  
That goes on forever  
Am I ever gonna change  
I'm the only one to blame  
When I think I'm right,  
I wind up wrong  
It's a futile fight,  
Gone on too long  
  
Please tell me if it's true,  
Am I too old to start anew,  
Cause that's what I want to do  
But time and time again,  
When I think I can,  
I fall short in the end  
So why do I even try,  
Will it matter when I die,  
Can anyone hear my cry?  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Take it day by day  
My will is weak  
And my flesh too strong  
This peace I seek  
Till thy kingdom comes
