The rains coming down hard tonight,  
Pull the car over  
Now I'm sittin' alone on the roadside  
I tilt the mirror down and say to me,  
Why you always think the answers gotta be,  
To just leave  
I'm making the same mistake  
I'm hoping its not too late  
Because I  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know where I'd be without you now  
I guess I get scared  
And that's why I act like such a fool  
Cause you're the one thing I can't lose  
I feel the tears coming  
And I wanna cry  
I think of us baby  
And all the love inside comes shining through  
And it always leads me right on back to you  
  
I never felt it,  
I never knew  
Someone who could get inside my soul the way you do,  
Yes you do  
  
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hand  
Its beautiful and terrifying,  
Can't you see  
For someone like me  
But instead of running in,  
I know  
Its when I should hold you closer  
Because I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know where I'd be without you now  
  
I guess I get scared and that's why I (lie?)  
Such a fool  
Cause you're the one thing I can't lose  
I feel the tears coming  
And I wanna cry  
I think of us baby  
And all the love inside comes shining through  
And it always leads me right on back to you  
  
Cause nobody's ever loved me  
Like you  
And I was born to be your man forever  
  
Forever baby  
Yeah  
I feel the tears coming  
And I wanna cry  
I turn the car around  
And put it in drive  
And I know what to do  
Gonna come on back,  
Come on back to you  
Yeah  
  
Oh, oh baby  
Gonna come on back,  
Come on back to you  
Oh, oh baby  
Gonna come on back,  
Come on back to you  
Cause I can't live without you,  
I cant breathe without you  
Yeah  
And I'm nothin', I'm nothin'  
Without you  
Yeah  
I was a fool, I was a fool baby
