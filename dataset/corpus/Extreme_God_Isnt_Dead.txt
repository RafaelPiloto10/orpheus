Ah look at all the lonely people, losing faith  
In a world full of despair. No one who cares,  
Wondering where God disappeared.  
  
I see the pain in everybody's faces, asking why  
The God up in the sky didn't say goodbye.  
Please tell me God didn't die.  
  
Please tell me God isn't dead.  
Please tell me God isn't dead.  
Please tell me God isn't  
I wanna know if he's  
Please tell me God isn't  
Tell me God isn't dead.  
  
I wanna know
