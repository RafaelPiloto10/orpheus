Better than words  
But more than a feeling  
Crazy in love  
Dancing on the ceiling  
  
Every time we touch  
I'm all shook up  
You make me wanna  
How deep is your love  
God only knows, baby  
  
Woo  
I don't know how else to sum it up  
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow  
There's no way I can explain your love, no  
I don't know how else to sum it up  
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow  
I can't explain your love, no  
It's better than words  
Better than words  
  
Better than words  
You drive me crazy  
Someone like you  
Always be my baby  
  
Best I ever had  
Hips don't lie  
You make me wanna  
One more night  
Irreplaceable (yeah), crazy (crazy)  
  
Woo

To see what it feels like (Feels like)  
But they'll never be right  
'Cause it's better (it's better)
