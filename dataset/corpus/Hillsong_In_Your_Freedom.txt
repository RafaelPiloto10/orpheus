I search for you god of strength  
I bow to you in my brokenness  
No other king could have so humbly come  
To save my soul and heal my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I have nothing more  
Than all you offer me  
I have nothing else  
That's of worth to me  
I love you lord  
You rescued me  
You are all I want  
You're all I need  
  
I pray to you god of peace  
I rest in you my cares released  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In your freedom I will live  
In your freedom I will live  
I offer devotion  
I offer devotion [Repeat: x 3]  
  
I love you lord  
You rescued me  
You are all I want  
You're all I need [Repeat: x 2]
