Nothing is so good it lasts eternally  
Perfect situations must go wrong  
But this has never yet prevented me  
Wanting far too much for far too long.  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
One of few more moments who can tell  
But it took time to understand the man  
Now at least I know I know him well.  
Wasn't it good? Oh so good  
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?  
But in the end he needs  
A little bit more than me  
More She needs security  
He needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well.  
  
No one in your life is with you constantly  
No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide.  
  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
Could have played things some other way.  
Learn about the man before I fell  
I was just a little careless  
But I was ever so much younger then.  
I was so much younger then  
Now at least I know I know him well  
Wasn't it good? Oh so good  
Wasn't he fine? Oh so fine  
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?  
Didn't I know how it would go?  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart?  
Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness  
He won't be mine?  
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me  
More She needs security  
He needs his Fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
It took time to understand me  
I know him so well.
