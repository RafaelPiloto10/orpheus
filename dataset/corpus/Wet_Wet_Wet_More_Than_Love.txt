Every morning takes a chance, it might not come around  
So it's maybe coming later  
A preacher man on my t.v.  
Says he's got the streets for me  
And prays you write the letter  
Heavenly Father tell me how it's gonna be  
So that I can try to make it better  
Restless bars, you and I suppose they are  
For blowing it all away  
That's why I say  
  
It takes more than love to get it on  
You know it takes more than strength to carry on  
It takes more than words to get it wrong  
It takes more than love to get it on  
  
Making us crazy, burnin' our bridges  
Taking them out one at a time  
Goodbyes you know don't come easy  
Did you want to go, for the thrill of it all  
Why d'you want to go cause you had no reason  
For blowin' it all away  
  
[Chorus:]  
It takes more than love to get it on  
You know it takes more than strength to carry on  
It takes more than words to get it wrong  
It takes more than love to get it on  
  
Ships are sailing and you know your aim is true  
The figureheads have broken in your mind  
You paint yourself a picture, and it turns to black and white  
And settle with the people one more time  
  
[Chorus]
