It starts with one  
One thing I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind as I designed this rhyme to explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away  
It's so unreal  
You didn't look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on but you didn't even know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go  
Kept everything inside  
And even though I tried  
It all fell apart  
What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
  
One thing  
I don't know why  
It doesn't even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind as I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how I tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Actin like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you've fought with me  
I'm surpirsed it got so far  
Things arent the way they were before  
You wouldnt even recognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end  
I kept everything inside and even though I tried  
It all fell apart  
What it meant to be will evenutally be a memory of a time  
  
I tried so hard  
And got so far  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
  
I put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this there's only one thing you should know  
I put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this  
There's only one thing you should know  
  
I tried so hard and got so far  
But in the end it doesn't even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end  
It doesn't even matter  
  
Repeat til end
