Yeasterday has been and gone  
Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain  
Everybody's having fun except me I'm the lonely one  
I live in shame  
  
[Chorus]  
I say goodbye to romance  
Goodbye to friends  
Goodbye to all the past  
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end  
  
I've been the king, I've been the clown  
Still broken wings can't hold me down  
I'm free again  
The jester with a broken crown  
It won't be me this time around to love in vain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I feel the time is right although I know  
That you just might say to me  
What ya gonna do  
What ya gonna do  
'Cause I have to take this chance  
Goodbye to friends and true romance  
And to all of you  
And to all of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the weather's lookin fine and I think the sun will shine again  
And I feel I've cleared my mind all the past is left behind again  
  
[Chorus]
