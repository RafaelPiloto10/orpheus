Take the time to look around you  
Look what's growing from the seed you sow  
Take a look around you  
By the fruits of their labor shall you know them  
  
How much time do you waste talking  
On and on about the good things you like to do  
When all the good's in doing  
By the fruits of their labor shall you know them  
  
Without labor the grapes would never ripen on the vine  
And never be pressed into wine  
Make sure your harvest is taken safely inside  
Don't let it wither and die  
  
In the dark abyss of ignorance  
It's impossible to make things grow  
In the light of truth it's easy  
By the fruits of their labor shall you know them  
By the fruits of their labor shall you know them
