I'm a radio Joe of the biz called show  
I'm a rockin' popstar with a get up and go  
Rubbin' elbows with the big wigs at my sold out shows  
I've been on every cover even rolling stone  
  
Put us on MTV  
All we really need  
Begging on our knees  
Please, please, please, please, please  
  
Conforming to the norm straight out of the mold  
Compromising each and every ounce of soul  
I'm a doin' anything for the records of gold  
I only want what I can hold  
  
Put us on MTV  
All we really need  
Begging on our knees  
Please, please, please, please, please  
  
We know that we'll never be better than  
Mister slick superstar David Letterman  
I promise we'll be perfect gentlemen  
Just put us on the show you'll regret us then  
  
Put us on MTV  
All we really need  
Begging on our knees  
Please, please, please, please, please  
  
Thank you very much be sure to label us  
We wouldn't want to cause a ruckus or a fuss  
AOR, CHR, top forty or bust  
  
Put us on MTV  
All we really need  
Begging on our knees  
Please, please, please, please, please  
  
What I am is a picture on the TV screen  
Don't make waves don't make a scene  
What I say when I play isn't worth a bean  
I'm a video Joe in an industry  
  
Put us on MTV  
All we really need  
Begging on our knees  
Please, please, please, please, please
