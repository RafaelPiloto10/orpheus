Yeah  
This is a song... was sung by Leadbelly and it was written for...his friend...  
He had a friend named Blind Lemon...  
And they used to ride back and forth on a train from somewhere to Texas...  
And I leraned this tune from a record  
I heard by him  
  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promises land  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promised land  
  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promises land  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promised land  
  
I'm Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound  
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down
