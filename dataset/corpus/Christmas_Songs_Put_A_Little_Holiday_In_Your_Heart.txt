Feel the cold wind blowing-winter's coming on  
'Tis the season, so they say  
If you need help believing 'cause your spirit ain't  
Too strong  
Hold my hand - we'll push that cloud away  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah - you gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
There's a man on the corner who doesn't have a name  
People pass and turn their heads away  
But to share a simple kindness would set there heart aflame  
And you'll get more than you'll ever give away.  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah - you gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
It starts with you, it starts with me  
This ain't no stranger, he's family and it don't  
Matter if we agree  
It all comes down to love  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you wanna join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah - you gotta put a little holiday in your heart
