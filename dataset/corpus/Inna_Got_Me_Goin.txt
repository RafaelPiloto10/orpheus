You are my fire  
The one desire  
Believe when I say  
I want it that way  
  
When we are two worlds apart  
Can't reach to your heart  
When you say that I want it that way  
  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
I want it that way  
  
Am I your fire  
Your one desire  
Yes I know  
It's too late  
But I want it that way  
  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
I want it that way  
  
Now I can see that we're falling apart  
From the way that it used to be, yeah  
  
No matter the distance I want you to know  
That deep down inside of me  
  
You are my fire  
The one desire  
You are (You are)  
  
Don't wanna hear you say  
Ain't nothing but a heartache  
Ain't nothing but a mistake  
(Don't wanna hear you say)  
I never wanna hear you say  
(Oh yeah)  
I want it that way  
  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
(Don't wanna hear you say)  
I want it that way  
  
Tell me why  
Ain't nothing but a heartache  
Ain't nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
(Don't wanna hear you say)  
I want it that way  
  
Cause I want it that way..
