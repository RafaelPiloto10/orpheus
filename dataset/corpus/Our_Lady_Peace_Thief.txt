I don't want to understand this horror  
There's a weight in your eyes I can't admit  
Everybody ends up here in bottles  
But the name tags are the last thing you wanted  
As the world explodes you fall out of it  
And you can't let go because this  
Will not go away  
There's a house built out in space  
  
And can't see the thief that lives inside of your head  
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed  
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend  
But I can be all, be all  
  
Someone help us understand who ordered  
This disgusting arrangement of time and the end  
I don't want to hear who walked on water  
Cause the hallways are empty, clocks tick  
As the world implodes we fall in to it  
And we can't go home because this  
Will not go away  
There's a house built out in space  
  
And I can't see the thief that lives inside your head  
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed  
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend  
It's a long, long get away, it's a long, long get away  
Make it home again, make it home again  
It's a long, long get away, it's a long, long get away  
  
And I can't see the thief that lives inside your head  
But I can be some courage at the side of your bed  
And I don't know what's happening and I can't pretend  
But I can be all, be all I'm here  
But I can be all, be all I'm here  
It's a long, long get away
