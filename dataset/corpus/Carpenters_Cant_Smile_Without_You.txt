Ah  
  
You know I can't smile without you  
  
I can't smile without you  
  
I can't laugh, and I can't sleep  
  
I don't even talk to people I meet  
  
And I feel sad when you're sad  
  
I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
You came along just like a song  
  
You brightened my day  
  
Who'd believe you were part of a dream  
  
That only seemed light years away  
  
  
And you know I can't smile without you  
  
I can't smile without you  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
Some people say the happiness wave  
  
Is somethin' that's hard to find  
  
Into the new leavin' the old behind me  
  
And I feel sad when you're sad  
  
I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
Into the new, leaving the old behind me  
  
And I feel sad when you're sad  
  
I feel glad when you're glad  
  
And you must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you  
  
  
You must know what I'm goin' thru  
  
I just can't smile, without you
