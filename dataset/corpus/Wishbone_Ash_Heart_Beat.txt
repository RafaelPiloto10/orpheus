Is it a crime to love a woman,  
To give her everything?  
People change, she goes away,  
And you're left with nothing.  
You've been together for so long,  
That's what's makin' it hard,  
Just like an old-fashioned noose.  
You cry some tears, and you move along.  
In your arms I was singin',  
Now my ears are ringin'  
To hear your heart beat for another man.  
Can you be in love again  
When you've been burned through and through?  
Having to stop with an open heart  
Leaves a lot to lose.  
'cause you've been together for so long,  
That's what's makin' it hard,  
Just like an old-fashioned noose.  
You cry some tears, move along.  
In your arms I was singin',  
Now my ears are ringin'  
To hear your heart beat for another man.
