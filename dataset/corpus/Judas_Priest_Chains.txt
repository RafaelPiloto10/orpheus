Up into an endless state of time  
With nothing good or bad just one  
We have been strangers for a very long time  
We have watched and we have tried  
And now I need this  
Know this taste this want this...  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
This is the line that will fall  
Now that there's nothing left  
That can shut you down  
It doesn't take much to break  
A life beyond the things you live for  
Into a place where you have all that it takes  
We have watched and we have tried  
And now I need this  
Know this taste this want this...  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
Swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
This is the line that will fall  
Now that there's nothing left  
That can shut you down  
You will reap just what you sow  
You will reap just what you sow  
You will reap just what you sow  
You will reap just what you sow  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
And let me reap my rewards and start again  
Let me reap my rewards and start again  
Let me reap my rewards and start again  
Let me reap my rewards and start again
