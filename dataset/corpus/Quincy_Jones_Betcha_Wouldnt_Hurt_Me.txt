Loving you came easily  
Yet it made me blind to all there was to see  
Now my heart is filled with pain  
  
You understand I never will  
How did it come to be that you don't love me still?  
Now it's getting to be plain  
  
If you really cared about anyone else  
I know you wouldn't hurt me  
If you cared about more than yourself  
I bet ya wouldn't go  
If you really cared about anyone else  
I know you wouldn't hurt me  
If you cared about more than yourself  
You wouldn't walk out the door  
  
Though some days the blues was our parade,  
Still we marched through all the tears we made  
Now I find that it wasn't no game of charades that you played  
  
I did my best to bring you joy  
How can you just leave me like a broken toy?  
Where's the man that once was you?  
  
If I could be within your mind  
I would never think to treat you this unkind  
The pain you caused will come to you
