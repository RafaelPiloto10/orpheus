I can't believe what you're saying about me  
I can't believe it's true  
You know you never should doubt me and take this attitude  
You say, "There's somethin' between us"  
That something just ain't right  
But every time I ask you to tell me why  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
You say you're tired of walking on eggshells and falling in between  
That I'm two timing you but you know quite well that's just not my scene  
An' now my friends are starting to call me  
They say, "There's somethin' wrong"  
Ah, but you just continue to stall me  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
You say, "It's not the moment"  
Ya, we need to talk this through  
I do depend on you  
So let it out and try to clear the air  
I've got nothing I should hide  
I'm burning up inside  
But you just act like you don't even care  
Oh, well I know sometimes it ain't easy  
I know you're feeling bad  
But you know it's the wrong time to tease me  
It just gets me mad  
I'm goin' to find out sooner or later  
Just what you're tryin' to say  
So, when I ask you now for just one more time  
Don't say, "It's not the moment"  
Don't say, "It's not the moment"  
Ya, we need to talk this through  
I do depend on you  
So let it out and try to clear the air  
I've got nothing I should hide  
I'm burning up inside  
But you just act like you don't even care  
I told you I would be your friend  
Be there to the very end  
And then you had to let me down  
And go spreading dirty words around
