Well I've been lying awake all night just thinking of you  
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view  
I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills  
And I know that I'm leading a life that kills  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my time  
(Wasted) I'm shooting a line  
(Wasted) I'm stuck in a hole  
(Wasted) I'm losing control  
  
And I've been meaning to call, I've been wanting to phone  
You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone  
Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen  
I've seen things down here that should never be seen  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my money  
(Wasted) I've wasted you honey  
(Wasted) I'm out of my brain  
(Wasted) I'm going insane  
  
I'm running in thin air  
There's nothingness everywhere  
I've gotta get out  
(Won't you help me?)  
I've gotta get out  
(Won't you help me?)  
I've gotta get out, oh won't you help me get out?  
  
I thought I saw you just the other day  
But it couldn't be you 'cos you had nothing to say  
'He's going away', they told all my friends  
Well now I'll be stuck in here til the misery ends  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my time  
(Wasted) I'm shooting a line  
(Wasted) I'm out of my head  
(Wasted) I wish I was dead
