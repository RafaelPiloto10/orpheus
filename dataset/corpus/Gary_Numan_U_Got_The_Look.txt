You walked in  
I woke up  
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby  
You got that look  
Color you peach and black  
Color me taken aback  
Crucial  
I think I wantcha  
  
You've got the look  
You've got the hook  
you sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book  
Your face is jammin'  
Your body's heck a slammin'  
If love is good  
Let's get to rammin'  
You got the look  
You got the look  
  
You got the look  
You must a took  
A whole hour just to make up your face baby  
Closin' time, ugly lights,  
Everybody's inspected  
But you are a natural beauty unaffected  
Did I say an hour?  
My face is red  
I stand corrected  
  
You walked in  
I woke up  
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby  
You got that look  
Yes you do  
Color you peach and black  
Color me taken aback  
Baby  
Crucial  
I think I wantcha
