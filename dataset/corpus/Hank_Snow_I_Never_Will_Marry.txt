One morning as I rambled  
Down by the sea shore  
The wind it did whistle  
And the waters did roar.  
  
I heard a fair maiden  
Make a pitiful sound  
It sounded so lonesome  
In the waters around.  
  
I never will marry  
I'll be no man's wife  
I expect to live single  
All the days of my life.  
  
My love's gone and left me  
The one I adore  
She's gone where  
I'll never see her anymore.  
  
She plunged her fair body  
In the waters so deep  
She closed her pretty blue eyes  
In the waters to sleep.  
  
I never will marry  
I'll be no man's wife  
I expect to live single  
All the days of my life.  
  
The shells in the ocean  
Shall be my death bed  
The fish in deep water  
Swim over my head...
