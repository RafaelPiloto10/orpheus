I don't know bout you  
But umm...  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
My girlfriend, got a girlfriend  
My girlfriend, got a girl and we do [X8]  
What we do [X8]  
What we do  
  
[Verse 1:]  
You know me, young F hoe  
I gets all in her mouth like strep throat  
I gets all in her belly like pepto  
Straight stompin' in dat pussy like a stepshow  
Ghetto bitches keep me wit em like lip glow  
College bitches keep me wit em like cliffnotes  
Cold bitches keep me wit em like thick coats  
Two foreign bitches, now that's a mink show  
Pull your skirt up, and let ya hips show  
She fell in love with a stripper at the strip show  
And now.. Theres  
Two bitches and me [X3]  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I like long hair, I hate make up  
Fuck my pillows up, fuck is really up  
I like slim chicks, I love big broads  
All the bitches love me, I need a dick guard  
And if she don't give head, shes a nimrod  
Bitch I would never put your number on my sim card  
I look at M J G and 8 ball as mentors  
And shit... All they ever told me was pimp hard  
Pimp harder, I get head and tail like a quarter  
Yup, yup, in dat order  
Two bitches and me [X2]  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Two bitches and me [X4]  
And..  
They kissin and huggin [X4]  
  
Hello  
I could play wit it, I could beat it up  
Yup, beat it up, get ya pussy lip bust  
Wait  
She said she wanna know how pussy taste  
She wanna suck dick while she get her pussy ate  
Ha  
Movies, massage, menage, bedroom, bathroom, garage, goodbye  
Just leave me be, and it was just us three, two bitches and me  
  
[Chorus: X2]
