Do you remember chalk hearts melting on a playground wall  
Do you remember dawn escapes from moon washed college halls  
Do you remember the cherry blossom in the market square  
Do you remember I thought it was confetti in our hair  
By the way didn't I break your heart?  
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart  
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart  
But you broke mine  
Kayleigh is it too late to say I'm sorry?  
And Kayleigh could we get it together again?  
I just can't go on pretending that it came to a natural end  
Kayleigh, oh I never thought I'd miss you  
And Kayleigh I thought that we'd always be friends  
We said our love would last forever  
So how did it come to this bitter end?  
Do you remember barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars  
Do you remember loving on the floor in Belsize Park  
Do you remember dancing in stilettoes in the snow  
Do you remember you never understood I had to go  
By the way, didn't I break your heart  
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart  
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart  
But you broke mine  
Kayleigh I just wanna say I'm sorry  
But Kayleigh I'm too scared to pick up the phone  
To hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home  
Kayleigh I'm still trying to write that love song  
Kayleigh it's more important to me now you're gone  
Maybe it will prove that we were right  
Or ever prove that I was wrong
