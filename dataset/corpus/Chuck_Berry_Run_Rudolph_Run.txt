Out of all the reindeers you know you're the mastermind  
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run, run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round  
  
Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"  
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"  
And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town, come on  
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round  
  
Said Santa to a girl child "What would please you most to get?"  
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, and wet"  
And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down  
Run, run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
