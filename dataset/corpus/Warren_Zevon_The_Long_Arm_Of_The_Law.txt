When I was young, times were hard  
When I got older it was worse  
First words I ever heard:  
"Nobody move, nobody get hurt"  
  
It's the long arm, it's the strong arm  
It's the long arm of the law  
It's the long arm, it's the strong arm  
It's the long arm of the law  
  
After the war in Paraguay  
Back in nineteen ninety-nine  
I was laying low in Lima  
Working both sides of the borderline  
  
It's the long arm, it's the strong arm  
It's the long arm of the law  
  
You can run, but you can't hide  
  
Well, I have to live like a fugitive  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Someone's coming after me  
And I'm running, running, yeah  
  
Now, don't protest your innocence  
Only the dead get off scott free  
And when the judge says, "Whodunit?"  
You'll be crying, "Not me! Not me!"
