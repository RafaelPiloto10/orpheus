So you've seen the sunrise on the Nile  
Solved the mystery of the mona Lisa's smile  
You proclaim your innocence  
What you saying  
Makes no sense to me at all  
So you help the needy and the sick  
Heard confessions of a lunatic  
My eyes are growing dim  
Ghost shadows closing in  
Around me now  
And there ain't no sympathy at all  
Just a sea of angry faces  
Staring at me  
There ain't no sympathy at all  
I gotta find someone  
To make me happy  
So you've scattered roses at Versailles  
Wiped a teardrop from an old man's eye  
Seeing you in such distress  
I'm afraid I must confess  
That boys don't cry  
And there ain't no sympathy at all  
Just a sea of angry faces  
Staring at me  
There ain't no sympathy at all  
I gotta find someone  
To make me happy  
  
[Solo]  
  
And there ain't no sympathy at all  
Just a sea of angry faces  
Staring at me  
There ain't no sympathy at all  
I gotta find someone,  
Gotta find someone,  
Gotta find someone
