Revengeful corpse out to kill  
Smell the stench, your guts will spill  
Vomit for a mind, maggots for a cock  
With his axe the corpse will chop  
  
Stare into his eyes  
Now in his spell  
Kiss the rotting flesh  
Now you're in hell  
  
Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore  
Taste the zombie's drug, now you want more  
Drifting from the living, joining with the dead  
Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head  
  
Zombie ritual  
Zombie ritual  
  
Ceremony now complete  
Chosen one is now deceased  
Fucking, raping zombie whores  
Killing, feasting no remorse  
  
Stare into his eyes  
Now in his spell  
Kiss the rotting flesh  
Now you're in hell  
  
Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore  
Taste the zombie's drug, now you want more  
Drifting from the living, joining with the dead  
Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head  
  
Zombie ritual  
Zombie ritual  
  
Zombie ritual  
Zombie ritual
