Don't stop the music  
The music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music  
Yeah, don't stop the music  
I don't wanna walk away from the, the  
Yeah  
Don't stop  
No no no no  
On the street, in the park, on the floor, anywhere you are  
Something fresh, something wild, take it up like a shooting star  
'Cause I never found anyone like you  
And you are the beat in my heart  
(Come on take me higher)  
Don't stop the music  
We can make beautiful music  
Don't fight the feeling  
Now that we're falling in love  
Take a trip to the stars, make a wish, rocket to the moon  
There you are between Venus and Mars, now you're in the groove  
'Cause I see the passion that's in your eyes  
And you lift me up to the sky  
(Come on take me higher)  
Don't stop the music  
We can make beautiful music  
Don't fight the feeling  
When the feeling's good, when the feeling's right  
Don't stop the music  
We can make beautiful music  
Don't fight the feeling  
Now that we're falling in love  
Oh, don't stop the music, baby  
Let the rhythm drive you crazy  
Don't fight the feeling, baby  
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart  
(I don't want to stop the music, right now)  
Keep it up, gotta keep it up, you gotta keep it up  
Keep it up, gotta keep it up, you gotta keep it up  
Don't stop it now  
Don't stop the music  
We can make beautiful music  
Don't fight the feeling  
When the feeling's good, when the feeling's right  
Don't stop the music  
We can make beautiful music  
Don't fight the feeling  
When the feeling is good, when the feeling is right  
Keep it up, gotta keep it up, you gotta keep it up  
Keep it up, gotta keep it up, you gotta keep it up  
Keep it up, gotta keep it up, you gotta keep it up  
...
