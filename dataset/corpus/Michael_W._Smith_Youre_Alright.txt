You're Alright  
You take a look inside  
But you don't like what you see  
And so you choose to look away  
It doesn't coincide  
With how you'd like to be  
And each glimpse of hope can easily fade  
  
[Chorus:]  
Down on your confidence  
It's a fight that won't let go  
(But) you've got to realize  
That you're alright  
('Cause) under your rubble  
Lies a heart the Father holds  
And when you see your life  
through his eyes  
You're alright  
  
To learn how He loves you  
Is to learn to love yourself  
To live the life He's livin' in you  
(And) what others think of you  
Could never measure to the wealth  
Of what he's paid and given to you  
  
[Chorus]
