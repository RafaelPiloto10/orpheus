[Verse 1: John Legend]  
All this trouble in this here town  
All this shit going down  
When will they focus, on this?  
Streets ride up with the TV crews  
Look ma, we on the news  
But they didn't notice, before this  
They float above the city lights  
Forget the truth, inhale the lies  
Just enjoy the show  
They see us reaching for the sky  
Just in order to survive  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Maybe we should go  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Penthouse floor  
  
[Verse 2: John Legend]  
All that bubbly, all that wine  
Oh man, look at the times  
Didn't they notice, notice?  
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be  
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this  
Once you're above the city lights  
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own  
The holding on is made for us  
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for  
Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Penthouse floor  
  
[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]  
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh  
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?  
Just us, who dis? Just playin'  
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era  
I'm in the penthouse, baby  
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs  
Held back, I had to grab crab legs  
And then there were only but a few  
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view  
What a dress, what a song  
What a beautiful time  
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line  
They never been in these rooms  
Never stayed with these folks  
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes  
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover  
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another  
He said "What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?"  
Then he pushed me off the top and said "Jump, nigga, jump!"  
  
[Bridge: John Legend]  
Oh, don't bring me down, I need a room in the clouds  
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate  
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss  
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse  
  
[Chorus: John Legend]  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for  
We'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Those penthouse doors  
We'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)  
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor  
Baby, let's ride the elevator  
Til we can rise some more  
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
