Sat on my bed and looked in my eyes  
Saw I was grieving for some other time  
Stood on my breath and moved close to say  
Oh won't you love me let's walk out to play  
  
Ooh we caught the moon from the sky  
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
Now there is nothing left that can numb me  
Do you love me or do I run  
  
Why don't you ask me to stay?  
Ask me to stay  
  
Looked so surprised when she said to me  
Can you move the mountain then we can both see  
She fell in my arms then I melted away  
She said why won't you ask me to stay, ask me to stay?  
  
Ooh we caught the moon from the sky  
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
Now there is nothing left that can numb me  
Do you love me or do I run?  
  
She picked up the pillow and lay down her head  
We were loving like good friends again  
Why don't you touch me, like we used to know  
Move over and love me or let me go  
  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
Now there is nothing left that can numb me  
Do you love me or do I run  
  
Why don't you ask me to stay?  
Ask me to stay  
Ask me to stay  
Ask me to stay  
  
As first you make a wish and pray that things will never change (ask me to
stay)  
And then we reach the point of being just good friends again (ask me to stay)  
As first you make a wish and pray that things will never change (ask me to
stay)  
And then we reach the point of being just good friends again (ask me to stay)
