Everybody's talkin' at me  
I don't hear a word they're sayin',  
Only the echoes of my mind  
  
People stoppin' starin'  
I don't see the faces,  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the pourin' rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off the northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer breeze  
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
People stoppin' starin'  
I don't see the faces,  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the pourin' rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off the northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer breeze  
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me
