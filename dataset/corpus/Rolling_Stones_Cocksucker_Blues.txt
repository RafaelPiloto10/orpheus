Well, I'm a lonesome schoolboy  
And I just came into town  
Yeah, I'm a lonesome schoolboy  
And I just came into town  
Well, I heard so much about London  
I decided to check it out  
  
Well, I wait in Leicester Square  
With a come-hither look in my eye  
Yeah, I'm leaning on Nelson's Column  
But all I do is talk to the lions  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, where can I get my cock sucked?  
Where can I get my ass fucked?  
I may have no money  
But I know where to put it every time  
  
Well, I asked a young policeman  
If he'd only lock me up for the night  
Well, I've had pigs in the farmyard  
Some of them, some of them, they're alright  
Well, he fucked me with his truncheon  
And his helmet was way too tight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a lonesome schoolboy in your town  
I'm a lonesome schoolboy
