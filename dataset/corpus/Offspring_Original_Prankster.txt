You can do it!  
Until the break of dawn  
Life, Life, and I quote by the letter  
Time, Time, Prozac can make it better  
Noise, Noise, any kind will do  
Can you feel it slip away, well it's all on you  
  
Crime, Crime, rockin' like Janet Reno  
Time, Time, 18 and life in Chino  
Freud, Freud, all along it's true  
Well, you see the common day catches up to you  
Yeah  
  
Knock down the walls  
It's alive in you  
Knock down the place  
You alone it's true  
Knock down the walls  
It's alive in you  
You're gonna keep your head up through it all  
You're gonna bust out ohh  
Original Prankster  
Break out yeah  
Original yeah  
Bust out ohh  
Original Prankster  
You'll never stop now, stop now  
That's what the main men say  
  
You can do it!  
You know it smells like shit, goddamn  
Tag team, the double header  
Son of Sam, fire always makes it better  
Navigate with style and aplomb  
'Cause wherever you're at  
  
Lies, Lies, says he's down at the Bahamas  
Tries, Tries, all you little hoochie mamas  
No way, none of this is true  
When you see it coming down when the joke's on you  
  
Knock down the walls  
It's alive in you  
Knock down the place  
You alone it's true  
Knock down the walls  
It's alive in you  
You're gonna keep your head up through it all  
You're gonna bust out ohh  
Original Prankster  
Break out yeah  
Original yeah  
Bust out ohh  
Original Prankster  
You'll never stop now, stop now  
That's what the main men say  
  
Hey!  
You can do it!  
Time, Time, so cool to see ya  
Nein, Nein don't want to be ya  
Time, Time, so cool to see ya  
Nein, Nein, don't want to be ya  
Crime, Crime, fine sensamilla  
Crime, Crime, fine sensamilla  
Crime, Crime, fine sensamilla  
You'll see the common day catching up to you  
  
Knock down the walls  
It's alive in you  
Knock down the place  
You alone it's true  
Knock down the walls  
It's alive in you  
You're gonna keep your head up through it all  
You're gonna bust out ohh  
Original Prankster  
Break out yeah  
Original yeah  
Bust out ohh  
Original Prankster  
You'll never stop now, stop now  
Stop now, stop now  
That's what the main men say
