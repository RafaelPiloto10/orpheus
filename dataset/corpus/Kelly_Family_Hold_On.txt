I wake up and see a suicide,  
Standing out in the road with no ride.  
Hold on, hold on to what's inside.  
(text missing) and the lies,  
Witnessing your loss in brother's eyes.  
Hold on, just hold on.  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope for me now.  
  
Invented my child of happiness  
I look to God to fill my emptiness.  
Hold on, just hold on.  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope for us all.  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope,  
There is hope for us all  
Hold on,  
Hold on,  
Hold on to what's inside.
