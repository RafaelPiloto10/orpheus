Hey now don't make a sound  
Say have you heard the news today?  
One flag was taken down  
To raise another in it's place  
  
A heavy cross you bear  
A stubborn heart remains unchanged  
No home, no life, no love  
No stranger singing in your name  
  
Maybe the season  
The colors change in the valley skies  
Dear God I've sealed my fate  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
[Chorus]  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead-end in sight  
  
Let's say we take this town  
No king or queen of any state  
Get up to shut it down  
Open the streets and raise the gates  
  
I know a wall to scale  
I know a field without a name  
Head on without a care  
Before it's way too late  
  
Maybe the season  
The colors change in the valley skies  
Oh God I've sealed my fate  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead-ends  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For every piece to fall in place  
Forever gone without a trace  
Your horizon takes its shape  
No turning back, don't turn that page  
  
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight  
Come now, let's leave it all behind  
Is that the price you pay  
Running through hell  
Heaven can wait  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
Long road to ruin  
There in your eyes  
Under the cold streetlights  
No tomorrow  
No dead ends  
  
[Chorus]
