Right in front of your eyes  
Why can't you see me?  
Can't you read all the signs  
Why can't you feel it?  
  
Can we love just a little bit harder  
My heart's beating to this drum  
It hasn't even started  
But I know that it's love  
  
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
Feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
When you touch my body  
I go weak but you're so hard for me to reach  
I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away  
  
Feels like I'm going crazy  
'Cause I'm always craving your touch  
My daydreams are amazin'  
Oh boy you're never too much  
  
I wanna love just a little bit harder  
My heart's beating to this drum  
It hasn't even started  
But I know that it's love  
  
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
Feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
When you touch my body  
I go weak but you're so hard for me to reach  
I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away  
  
I feel so invisible why can't you see me?  
You're the one that I want it's so clear to me.  
I feel so invisible.  
I feel so invisible.  
I feel so  
I feel so  
I feel so  
  
I feel like I'm a million, million,  
Feel like I'm a million miles away.  
Feel like I'm a million, million,  
Feel like I'm a million miles away.  
When you touch my body I go weak  
But you're so hard for me to reach  
I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away  
  
I feel so invisible I feel a million miles away.  
I feel so invisible I feel a million miles away.  
  
Right in front of your eyes why can't you see me?
