It's baby's first Christmas,  
It's somethin' to see,  
Mommy and Daddy,  
Trimmin' baby's Christmas tree.  
Baby's big brother,  
Is busy with his toys,  
He's shinin' up the chimney,  
For Santa Claus!  
  
It's baby's first Christmas,  
And oh, what a joy,  
Shopping all around,  
For every pretty toy.  
It's a very special Christmas,  
A blessing from above,  
It's baby's first Christmas,  
A Christmas full of love!
