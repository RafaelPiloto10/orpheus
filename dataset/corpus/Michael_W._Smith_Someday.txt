Sexual harassment - nuclear reactors  
Natural disasters from here to L.A.  
Drug importers  
New World Order  
Wars over borders  
Murder on the subway  
  
The social classes - high rise of taxes  
Diplomats are passive with a promise again  
  
Talk of recession - people in depression  
Dow Jones, bank loans, the Japanese yen  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
I wait for Kingdom come  
When love will be here to stay  
It will change us everyone  
Someday, someday  
  
Violence in the movies  
Drive-by shootings  
Rioting and looting  
With the boys in the hood  
  
Cults and religions  
Deadly premonitions  
Fiery oppositions  
Evil battling good  
  
AIDS awareness  
Temporary marriage  
Pro-life, pro-choice  
Roe v Wade  
  
Ethics and the media  
Tabloid T.V.  
The Kennedy Conspiracy  
The Trial of O.J.  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
I wait for Kingdom come  
When love will be here to stay  
It will change us everyone  
Someday, someday  
There peace will make a stand  
and the anger will fall away  
We'll see the lion with the lamb  
Someday, someday, someday  
  
[Chorus 2:]
