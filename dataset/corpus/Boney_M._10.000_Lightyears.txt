10.000 light years somewhere out in space  
They practice love and they know what it takes  
No competition and no jealousy  
Living in freedom and humanity  
  
10.000 light years away, light years away far from pain  
Came to a place full of grace and of peace  
10.000 light years away from our fear  
  
Suddenly it's ringing in my ears  
Why is it now i don't want to be here  
I feel like flow in that clock at the wall  
God, how i wish that this dream would go on  
  
10.000 light years away, light years away far from pain  
Came to a place full of grace and of peace  
10.000 light years away from our fear  
  
10.000 light years somewhere out in space (10.000 lightyears)  
10.000 light years somewhere out in space (10.000 lightyears)  
10.000 light years somewhere out in space (10.000 lightyears)  
10.000 light years somewhere out in space (10.000 lightyears)  
  
3rd verse - on promo-lp 206 318-000 only!!!  
Reality comes knocking at my door  
I face the same obligations once more  
Dreams took me 10.000 light years away  
I'd give all i got if that's where i could stay
