Summon up the mas! Play on the pan!  
Staring dreads are jerking their locks  
As the white star liner sank in the docks  
But on the drummers face, there is a look of dread  
As he drums away 400 years of dread  
The dancer man-in the power of mas  
Is smoking ti the mighty sparrow's blast  
  
But you better be careful  
You still got to watch yourself  
  
You want to be crazy  
So you want to go crazy  
Let's go crazy  
So you want to be crazy  
Then let's go crazy  
Let's go crazy  
  
The lawful force are here of course  
For special offenders for the special court  
But the young men know when the sun has set  
Darkness comes to settle the debt  
Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect  
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest  
  
They're waiting for the sun to set  
  
The mighty observer who keeps his cabinets hot  
A great meeting of rhythm and face  
A humming of values and a children's place  
But the sticks man gives the copper good excuse  
To shut off the ganja and control the juice  
  
To control the juice  
  
So you want to go crazy? Then let's go crazy  
So take it on crazy! So they get all crazy  
Bricks and bottles corrugated iron  
Shields and helmets carnival time  
'N moa ambassa, sledgehammer sound  
Ray symbolic from jamdown town
