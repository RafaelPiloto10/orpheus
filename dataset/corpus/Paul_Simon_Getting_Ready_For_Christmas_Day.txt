From early in November to the last week of December  
I got money matters weighing me down  
Oh the music may be merry, but it's only temporary  
I know Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
In the days I work my day job, in the nights I work my night  
But it all comes down to working man's pay  
Getting ready, I'm getting ready, ready for Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you, namely, the undertaker, he's getting ready for your body  
Not only that, the jailer he's getting ready for you  
Christmas Day. Hmm? And not only the jailer, but the lawyer, the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day, and I want you to bear it in mind)  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq it's his third time back  
But it's ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner he'll be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready, for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that I'm going, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago  
I'm going, on a trip, getting ready, for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come, nobody knows where you'll be  
You might ask me. I may be layin' in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready, for Christmas Day)  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes, we're getting ready  
  
(Getting ready, ready for your prayers,  
"I'm going and see my relatives in a distant land"  
Getting ready, getting ready for Christmas Day)  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready, oh ready, ready for Christmas Day  
Ready, getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day
