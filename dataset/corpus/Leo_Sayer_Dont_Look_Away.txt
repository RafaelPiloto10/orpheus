Well, she talks in her sleep  
About the men that she meets  
With so much passion  
In the morning i ask  
But she takes me to task  
Says i'm overreacting  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her, she looks at me like i'm strange  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no  
  
Well, she sits on the phone  
Like she's here on her own  
Making these calls to no one  
Now she slides out a ten  
Says she's seeing a friend  
She's got so much going on  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her  
She looks at me like i'm strange  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no  
  
Well, i follow her down to some part of town  
Where we've never been before  
There's a car in the drive, and a man sits inside  
I gotta stop her, before she gets in  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her  
She looks at me like i'm insane  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no
