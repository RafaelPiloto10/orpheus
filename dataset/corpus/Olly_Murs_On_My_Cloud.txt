Love is moving faster but I'm taking my time  
I'm gonna be there when I get there  
You just follow the signs  
I'm making something out of nothing  
And if you want a ride  
Get your self together  
And we'll leave the world behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way (Oh)  
Get up get on my cloud  
I'm not gonna let you down  
Let's make it happen today  
  
I'll be busy doing nothing  
And it's starting to show  
But let's turn nothing into something  
I can't do it alone  
So if you wanna make it happen  
And you got time to do  
Get your self together  
And we'll leave it all behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way (Oh)  
Get up get on my cloud  
I'm not gonna let you down  
Let's make it happen today  
  
Can we just float away  
I've got a plan to make you stay  
I know you feel the same  
Get your self together  
Leave the world behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way (Oh)  
Get up get on my cloud  
I'm not gonna let you down  
Let's make it happen today  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Get up get on my cloud  
Get up get on my cloud (Yeah)  
Get up get on my cloud  
Get up get on my cloud  
Let's make it happen today
