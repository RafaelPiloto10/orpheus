I like the way sparkling earrings lay  
Upon your skin so brown  
And I want to sleep with you in the desert night  
With a million stars all around  
  
I get a peaceful easy feelin'  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standin'  
On the ground  
  
And I found out a long time ago  
What a woman can do to your soul  
Aw but she can't take you any way  
You don't already know how to go  
  
I get a peaceful easy feelin'  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standin'  
On the ground  
  
I get this feelin' I may know you  
As a lover and a friend  
This voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear  
Tells me I may never see you again  
  
I get a peaceful easy feelin'  
And I know you won't let me down  
'Cause I'm already standin'  
Yes I'm already standin'  
Yes I'm already standin'  
On the ground
