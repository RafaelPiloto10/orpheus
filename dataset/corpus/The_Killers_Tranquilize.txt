Time it tells living in my home town,  
Wedding bells they begin easy  
Live it down, baby don't talk that much,  
Baby knows, but baby don't tease me  
In the park we could go walking,  
Drowned in the dark or we could go sailing  
On the sea  
  
Always here, always on time  
Close call, was it love or was it just easy  
Money talks when people need shoes and socks,  
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me  
  
I was just sipping on something sweet  
I don?t need political process  
  
I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door  
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more  
See I was thinking that I lost my mind  
But it's been getting to me all this time  
And it don't stop dragging me down  
  
Silently reflection turns my world to stone  
Patiently correction leaves us all alone  
And sometimes I'm a travel man  
But tonight this engine's failing  
  
I still hear the children playing  
  
Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack  
Steal a car and ring a round-rosy,  
Rock and roll, candyland, bogeyman,  
  
Run away and give me your sneakers  
  
Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain  
We began the weeping and wailing  
A hurried high from pestilence pills and pride,  
It's a shame, we could have gone sailing  
But heaven knows,  
Heaven knows everything  
Tranquilize  
  
I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door  
I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more  
See I was thinking that I lost my mind  
But it's been getting to me all this time  
And it don't stop dragging me down  
  
Silently reflection turns my world to stone  
Patiently correction leaves us all alone  
And sometimes I'm travel man  
But tonight this engine's failing  
  
I still hear the children playing  
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay  
  
Cause I don't care where you've been  
And I don't care what you've seen  
We're the ones who still believe  
And we're looking for a page  
In that lifeless book of hope  
Where a dream might help you cope  
With the Bushes and the bombs  
Uh huh, Tranquilized
