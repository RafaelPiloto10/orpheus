Staying at home  
Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen  
Being a god  
I thought about it in the Galleria  
Liquid crystal like a man ray tear  
A shiny surface, velveteen queer  
Bailey contrast, a Lucas idea  
I've seen your set up and it's perfect in form  
Let's call somebody to connect both our arms  
You bring the orange I'll bring the clock  
We'll pay the dream police to circle the block  
Staying al home  
Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen  
And being a god  
Slaying at home  
Plugging it in  
Lucking the screen  
And being a god
