Gonna sing a song, gonna be a love song  
Sing about the good good feeling you brought along  
You put my mind at rest  
Made me feel like I'd been blessed  
With good time, good music and good good friends  
  
When I was feeling down, when I was feeling low down  
You turned me on to good good music  
You turned me right around  
You took be to your breast  
You held me up with your sweet caress  
And good times, good music and good good friends  
  
I remember when you found me  
I was hungry and alone  
First you fed me then you loved me  
You made me feel at home  
  
Wanna sing a song, got to be a love song  
Sing about the good good feeling you brought along  
Wanna scream and shout  
How did I ever do without  
Good times, good music and good good friends  
  
Music  
  
Wanna scream and shout  
How did I ever do without  
Good times, good music and good good friends
