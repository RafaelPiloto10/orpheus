Old man sunshine, listen you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it, and I'll start a riot  
  
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare  
Ever tell me he will care  
I'm certain, it's the final curtain  
  
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas  
Who tells you fate supplies a mate  
It's all bananas  
  
They're writing songs of love, but not for me  
A lucky star's above, but not for me  
With love to lead the way I've found more skies of gray  
Than any Russian play, could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall, and get that way  
Hi ho alas and also lackaday  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me  
  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me
