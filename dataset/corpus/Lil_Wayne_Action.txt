Go, I'm in love with a beauty, she is a cutie  
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in da movies  
We had a drink or two, we saw Rush Hour 2  
Then we went home and we made our own movie  
  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
It's show time, it's show time  
Show me yours, show you mine  
  
Like ohh, it's goin' down in this bitch  
Like a boxer in the first round in this bitch  
1-800 I would dick you down in this bitch  
Uptown in this bitch, don't make a sound in this, shh  
  
Now let me whisper in ya ear  
Every single word your little ear wanna hear  
Flip ya body over, have no fear  
Can I put my tongue here until you tear?  
  
Cry baby, cry baby, suck ya momma titty  
You know I like dem old, I might have yo' momma with me  
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriendses  
Honor my pole like a flag on da end, bitch  
  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
It's show time, it's show time  
Show me yours, show you mine  
  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
It's show time, it's show time  
Show me yours, show you mine  
  
I say ohh girl, I love you so  
Oh ohh girl, I love you so sike  
But I don't give a fuck about a dog ass hoe  
But I don't give a fuck about a dog ass hoe  
  
Pop these pills, take, take this glass  
Pop, pop that pussy, shake, shake that ass  
And if your pussy stank, girl, you know you better douche it  
You're nasty girl, now wash dat stanky funky, funky pussy, bitch  
  
Stop talkin' that shit and suck a nigga dick for an outfit, ha  
And I wear my pants below my waist and  
I never dance when I'm this place 'cause you and your man  
Be planning to hate, I'm so hood  
  
And she likes it  
And when we fuck I'm keepin' on my Nikes  
I'll tear dat pussy up, I'll tear dat pussy up  
I'ma good looking rapper, I ain't tryna front  
  
Ohh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand  
Ohh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand  
Ohh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand  
And I'm the cameraman  
  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
Lights, camera, action, ya dig?  
It's show time, it's show time  
Show me yours, show you mine  
  
Cut, check the gates, wait, why wait?  
When I can just bend you over and do what I told ya  
Do what I wanna, do what I wanna  
Ya heard me, I gotta lie like [unverified]  
  
And now every once in a while her knees jerk  
She forgets how to walk, I better teach her  
I got her walkin' funny, just tell 'em that your feet hurt  
You'll prolly see her on one of my t-shirts  
  
I super soak a hoe, skeet, skeet, skeet, squirt  
But don't worry 'cause if y'all are like swingers  
Hey I'm high over features  
Haha new single, oh so now you single  
You crazy, say da baby
