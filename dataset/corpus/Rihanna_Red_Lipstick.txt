Red lipstick, all on the paper  
Let me take a hit while you sit and rush  
Go hate, talk shit, it's all in the paper  
Let me grab my tit while you sit on top  
  
Do you right here while the whole world's watching  
All up in my mental, gotta get up in my physical  
  
Don't know what you did  
But you really got me feeling  
That feeling tonight  
All on you, K  
Cause you really got me feeling  
That feeling tonight  
  
I want you babe  
Got me going cray  
Hard to let it go, let it go  
Just show me where you want me baby  
Can't fight the feeling  
'Cause you really got me feeling  
That feeling tonight  
  
Can't fight the feeling  
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah  
(When I like, can't lie)  
I just can't fight the feeling  
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah  
(Do whatever you like)  
  
Can't fight the feeling  
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah  
(You're gonna learn tonight)  
Can't fight the feeling  
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
