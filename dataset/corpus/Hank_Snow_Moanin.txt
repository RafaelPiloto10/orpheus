Moanin' my life slowly away  
Sittin' here waitin' for the new commin' day  
They try to cheer me as I trudge on my way  
Moanin' for you  
  
Can't seem to hide it and why should I try  
Good Lord, he knows it up there in the sky  
A million heartaches with your last goodbye  
Left me moanin' for you  
  
Work these poor fingers way down to the bone  
When things seemed right my whole world went wrong  
Then I found your letter, baby, sayin' so long  
I've been moanin' for you  
  
They find me alone at the close of the day  
Countin' each petal from your rose bouquet  
Guess I'll be here till eternity  
Moanin' for you  
  
This ole rockin' chair, I have rocked it apart  
The last spark of flame in my fireplace is dark  
But this old flame that's burnin' deep down in my heart  
Keeps me moanin' for you  
  
Work these poor fingers way down to the bone  
When things seemed right my whole world went wrong  
Then I found your letter, baby, sayin' so long  
I've been moanin' for you
