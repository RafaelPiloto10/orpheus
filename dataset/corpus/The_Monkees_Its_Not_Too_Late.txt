If I had a penny for every time I thought about you  
I would be a millionaire  
I would send you flowers each day  
And I would show you in every way  
Just how much I really care  
  
The summer sun and the winter snow,  
The autumn leaves let the spring rains know  
Just how much I need your love  
And if I knew that my time was near,  
And you were there,  
I would have no fear  
Your name would be my dying prayer  
  
It's not too late  
To turn this ship around  
To sail into the wind my love  
Before we run aground  
  
It's not too late  
To say that I love you  
And it's not too late for you, my love  
To say you love me too  
(It's not too late)  
  
If I was a rich man's son  
I would work till the day was done  
Just to prove my love was true  
I would take you for my wife  
And I would love you all my life  
And I would never leave or be untrue  
  
It's not too late  
To turn this ship around  
To sail into the wind my love  
Before we run aground  
It's not too late  
To say that I love you  
And it's not too late for you, my love  
To say you love me too  
(It's not too late)  
  
You know our future and your feelings  
And the love that I have for you  
They're always in my heart and on my mind  
A never ending love affair  
We'll go together everywhere  
Our love will last till the end of time
