Satellite in my eyes  
Like a diamond in the sky  
How I wonder.  
  
Satellite strung from the moon  
And the world your balloon  
Peeping Tom for the mother station.  
  
Winter's cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasing  
Everything good needs replacing  
Look up, look down all around, satellite  
  
Satellite headlines read  
Someone's secrets you've seen  
Eyes and ears have been  
  
Satellite dish in my yard  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Who's the king of your satellite castle?  
  
Winter's cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasing  
Everything good needs replacing  
Look up, look down all around, satellite  
  
Rest high above the clouds no restrictions  
Television we bounce 'round the world  
And while I spend these hours  
Five senses reeling,  
I laugh about this weatherman's satellite eyes.  
  
Satellite in my eyes  
Like a diamond in the sky  
How I wonder.  
Satellite strung from the moon  
And the world your balloon  
Peeping Tom for the mother station  
  
Winter's cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasing  
Everything good needs replacing  
Look up, look down all around, satellite
