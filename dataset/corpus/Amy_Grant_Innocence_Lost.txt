I can't relive my life  
I can't retrace my tracks  
I can't undo what's done  
There is no going back  
I chased a selfish dream  
Did not survey the cost  
Illusions disappeared  
I've found my innocence lost  
Some say it's lessons learned  
Some say it's a living life  
I say it's choices made  
Knowing wrong from right  
One night I fought to sleep  
In my slumber I turned and tossed  
I woke to a cloudy day  
And found my innocence lost  
Innocent child is a beautiful thing  
Secure in her father's arms  
Sleeps while a mother sings  
There's no way to know  
All the harm this world can bring  
I miss my innocence  
Oh, to be innocent  
My heavenly Father  
The way of eternal love  
That overflows with grace  
I can completely trust  
My broken heart repaired  
And all my sin forgot  
I can be pure again  
In spite of my innocence lost  
In his eyes I'm a newborn child  
'cause I accept his love  
I have a newfound hope  
Though I've found my innocence lost  
I can be pure again  
I've found my innocence lost
