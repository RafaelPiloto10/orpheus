I'm so tired, you on my head.  
Whiskey'n mama, you shouldn't have said  
You wanted me to be your lover true,  
Then turn around and treats me just likes you do.  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.  
  
Now I could be right and could be wrong,  
You been layin' out all night long.  
You telephoned this mornin', said you'd be home soon.  
The doorman said he seen you at the Club Blue Lagoon.  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.  
  
Whiskey'n mama, you standin' there  
With your curly hair  
Just to have you do me good.  
I know you could if you only would.  
  
Whiskey'n mama, you standin' there  
With your curly hair  
Just to have you do me good.  
I know you could if you only would.  
  
Well, the sun come shinin' on the rain soaked street.  
Whiskey'n mama, where can she be?  
I guess I'll have to put you down on my list,  
I didn't want to do it but you insist.  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.
