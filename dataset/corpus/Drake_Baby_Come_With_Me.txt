[Verse:]  
All right!  
She'll be jumping up and down,  
Trying to fit that ass in.  
Took her half an hour just to get that...  
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion,  
I don't know where she's going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Cause her spirit is free,  
And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree  
I'm the only one she loves, there's no copy of the key  
Homie that's a guarantee  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in,  
Kinda' hard to concentrate when cameras are flashing.  
Other dudes will suffocate her, I don't want her gaspin,  
Don't know where she's going, and I do not plan on asking at all  
I've never been the type felt a like my connection  
With niggas that wanna fight over women, that's not right,  
There's too many in the world, homie you could have yo pick  
But I swear that one's my girl, I swear that one's my girl
