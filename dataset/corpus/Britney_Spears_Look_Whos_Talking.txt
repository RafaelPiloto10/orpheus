Champagne, caviar  
Hot boys at the bar  
Lookin' at me  
Yeah, they're lookin' at me  
I was true to you  
Just to prove my point of view  
Now you're lookin' at me  
Yeah, you're lookin' at me  
  
They wanna give it to me  
They wanna give it to me  
But I won't go for that  
'Cause boy I had your back  
This song is all about me  
Damn right it's all about me  
(La la la la la la)  
(La la la la la la)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, hey, hey  
So look who's talkin' now  
That's what this songs about, me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Hey, hey, hey  
You think you got me figured out  
But look who's talkin' now, it's me  
  
Fast cars and bubble baths  
High heels steppin' on the gas  
Lookin' at me  
Yeah, they're lookin' at me  
Dreamsicles melt away  
I'm thinkin' every day  
Lookin' at me  
You're still lookin' at me  
I wanna give it to you  
I wanna give it to you  
But I can't go for that  
'Cause boy it's in the past  
This song is all about me  
Damn right it's all about me  
(La la la la la la)  
(La la la la la la)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Controversy is like  
A ticking time bomb  
Controversy, it's what they want  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Good news for me, it's about  
What I spend my time on  
Controversy is all they want  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
(Chorus 2x)
