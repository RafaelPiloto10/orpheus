Once we were lovers  
But somehow things have changed  
Now we're just lonely people  
Trying to forget each other's names  
Now we're just lonely people  
Trying to forget each other's names  
  
[Chorus]  
What came between us?  
Maybe we were just too young to know  
But now and then  
I feel the same,  
And sometimes at night I think  
I hear you calling my name  
Mm, mm, mm, these dreams  
They keep me going these days  
  
Once we were lovers  
But that was long ago  
We lived together then  
And now we do not even say hello  
We lived together then  
And now we do not even say hello  
  
[Chorus: x2]
