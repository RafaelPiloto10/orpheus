I see the clouds and I feel the rain  
It's all coming down to you again  
And I take the ashes  
Though memories stays the same  
It's all coming down to love and pain  
  
Headin' for the coast  
Trying to make the most of this misery  
Cause there's a pain in my heart  
And it's tearing me apart  
Well I guess it all comes down to loving you  
(Do you see the clouds, can you feel the rain)  
It's all coming down to love and pain  
  
On the road again (thinking about you baby)  
Tomorrow I will play L. A.  
But there's a pain in my heart  
And it's tearing me apart  
Well I guess that's just the ay my story goes  
  
Well there's a hunger in my veins  
And it's driving me insane  
But I guess it all comes down to love and pain  
  
Well there's a hunger in my veins  
And it's driving me insane  
So won't you help me, so won't you help me  
Ah won'tcha help me, help me, help me, help me  
  
But there's a hunger in my heart  
And it's tearing me apart  
Well I guess that's just the way my story goes  
And there's a hunger in my veins  
And it's driving me insane  
Well I guess it all comes down to loving you  
Oh I guess it's all coming down to love and pain
