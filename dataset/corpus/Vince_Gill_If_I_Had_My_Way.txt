If I had my way, we'd love one another  
If I had my way, we'd all live as brothers  
There'd be no more fussing and fighting  
No more hungry innocent dying  
I'd make it all go away  
If I had my way  
  
If I had my way  
I'd carry your burden  
If I had my way  
No one would be hurtin'  
And there'd be no more hatred and lying  
No more lonely little kids crying  
I'd make it all go away  
If I had my way  
  
Maybe one day the walls will come down  
If I had my way, the lost would be found  
Love will find a way to turn everything around  
  
There'd be no more fussing and fighting  
No more frightened little kids crying  
I'd make it all go away  
If I had my way
