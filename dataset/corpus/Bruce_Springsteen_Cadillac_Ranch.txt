Well there she sits buddy just a-gleaming in the sun  
There to greet a working man when his day is done  
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt  
I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac ranch  
  
Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts  
Rides just like a little bit of heaven here on earth  
Well buddy when I die throw my body in the back  
And drive me to the junkyard in my Cadillac  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up your engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
James Dean in that mercury '49  
Junior Johnson runnin' through the woods of Carolina  
Even Burt Reynolds in that black Trans Am  
All gonna meet down at the Cadillac ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight  
Drivin' alone through the Wisconsin night  
You're my last love you're my last chance  
Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac
