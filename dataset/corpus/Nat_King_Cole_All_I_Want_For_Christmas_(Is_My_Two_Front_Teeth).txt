All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie, sitting on a thistle?  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie, sitting on a thistle?  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
Two front teeth, two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas
