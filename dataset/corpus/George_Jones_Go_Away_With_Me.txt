Go go go away with me hm  
Far from his heart and eyes I can love you and you'll realize  
That your life holds so much in store  
When you wanted and loved and adored  
Go go go away with me and I know you soon will forget  
His false love that's haunting your memories  
Go and you'll never regret  
  
You're his plaything and nothing more  
He will hurt you he's done it before  
Then you'll cry out cry out in vain  
For his heart to go wondering again  
Go go go away with me  
Go go go away with me hm
