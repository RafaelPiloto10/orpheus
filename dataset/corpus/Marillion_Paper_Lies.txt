Good morning!  
  
When you look into the mirror  
Do you see a face you hardly recognise  
If you look into the sun too long  
Do the things you see begin to burn your eyes  
  
Paper lies  
  
Just to express what he's thinking  
Must a man take all the mail will bring  
Are we living only for today  
It's a sign of the times  
We believe anything and nothing  
  
Paper lies  
  
When you kill the truth  
You can make a killing  
You might just make losing look like winning  
  
You came to tell the people what's goin' on  
But nobody knows whose side you're on  
Seems like you're sailin' pretty close to the wind again  
  
Paper lies  
You have already won a prize!  
  
I know something that you don't know  
Something that you ought to know  
It's burning a hole in my pocket book  
Listen ... do you want to know a secret?  
We can print our own money here  
If you let us do a piece on you  
We can take you to pieces  
  
When you look into the money  
Do you see a face you hardly recognise?  
When you get behind the news of the world  
Do the things you find begin to bend your mind?  
  
Paper lies  
  
Why don't you let us take a piece out of you?
