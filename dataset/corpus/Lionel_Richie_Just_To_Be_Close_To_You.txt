Just to be close to you, girl  
Just for a moment, well,  
Just for an hour  
Just to be close to you girl  
  
I was a lonely man  
A man with no direction  
With no purpose  
With no one to love  
And no one to love me, for me  
  
Oh girl then you came into my life  
You made my jagged edges smooth  
You made my direction so clear  
And you oh women you became my purpose  
My reason for living girl you see  
  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
You're my strong inspiration baby  
That's why I'm standing here  
Singing and opening my arms to you  
I want to say child, why don't you  
  
Take my hand,  
Oh we'll live and love forever  
Take my hand,  
Ooh we'll be alone you and me  
Take my hand  
Girl we'll live our lives together  
Yeah together  
  
Just to be close to you, girl  
Just for the moment baby,  
Well just for an hour  
Just to be close to you, girl  
I need you baby  
  
To make love, to be loved by you baby  
To have your warm body close to mine  
To whisper words that make you feel like a woman  
Girl I know our love will stand the test of time  
  
Just to be close to you girl  
For the moment baby (for the moment baby, for the moment baby)  
For the sugar sugar yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Just to be close to you girl  
Just for the moment
