Breathe your life.  
  
I've got to come down  
I've been awake for far too long  
My eyes look torn, they were so strong  
I wore the crown, I wrote the song  
Now it's fading  
My heart was open  
Like a window to a summer breeze  
  
I breathed your love,  
I filled my lungs and veins  
And I breathed your love  
Until I felt the pain  
And like rain it slipped away  
  
I tried to find out  
What love was really all about  
Behind the curtain waits the sky  
It's rare I feel enough to cry  
I'm drying up inside  
My life was open  
Like a window to the summer breeze  
  
I breathed your love,  
I filled my lungs and veins  
And I breathed your love  
Until I met the pain and like rain  
It slipped away, just like a little rain.  
  
I breathed your love  
And nothing stayed the same.  
Yes, I breathed your love  
And filled my heart in vain 'cause like rain  
It slipped away, just like rain it swept away.
