Look who's advertising  
Billboards everywhere  
"See hellacious acres  
Your tailor made nightmare"  
Traffic is backed up for miles  
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles  
Steady...steady ...  
Have your tickets ready  
Steady...steady ...  
Go to hell  
After dark  
It's a sin filled city  
An amusement park  
It's a one way ticket to the other side  
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde  
See Lizzie Borden, she's one of the stars  
And tricky Dicky barkin'  
Flashin' you his pardon  
Jack the ripper slashin' your tires  
Even the devil needs money  
To cover his overhead  
That's why he opened hellacious acres  
Or so his press agent said  
Hang out with heavies  
Your partners in crime  
Forget the consequences, have a good time  
Steady...steady ...  
Have your tickets ready  
Steady...steady ...  
Go to hell  
After dark  
It's a sin filled city  
An amusement park  
It's a one way ticket to the other side  
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde  
Get down and study suspicion and doubt  
At hellacious acres  
Listen mischief makers  
Admission's free you pay to get out
