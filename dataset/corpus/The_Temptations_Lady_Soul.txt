Oh  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
My lady soul  
  
Lying here beside you  
Close as we can be  
I know what this leads to  
I know what you need, yeah  
  
I'm ready to surrender, my love  
Lay it all in your hands  
Give you my forever  
Everything I am  
  
'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul  
You warm my heart  
When I grow cold  
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul  
You are my life  
You make me whole  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
My lady soul  
  
I feel it in your heartbeat  
Hear it in your crys  
This is where our hearts meet  
I see it in your eyes  
  
I've waited for this moment, my love  
It's a dream come alive  
Heaven must have sent me  
An angel of the night  
  
'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul  
You warm my heart  
When I grow cold  
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul  
You're my lady soul  
You are my life  
You make me whole  
  
I always knew we'd end up together  
Right from the very start  
And I believe we'll make it forever  
It's written right here in my heart  
  
Oh yeah! Aii!Hoo!  
You're my, you're my, my lady soul  
You warm my heart  
When I grow cold  
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul  
You are my life  
You make me whole  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
Oh wo oh wo oh wo oh wo  
My lady soul
