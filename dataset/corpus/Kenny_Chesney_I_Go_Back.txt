"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,  
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me  
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to a two-toned short bed Chevy  
Drivin' my first love out to the levy  
Livin' life with no sense of time  
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rockin' Me Baby"  
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies  
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor  
And the taste of salt on the Carolina shore  
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends  
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives  
Takes us to another place and time  
  
So I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir  
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire  
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church  
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
To the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
I go back (I go back)  
To watchin' summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
I go back (I go back)  
To the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
I go back, I go back, I go back
