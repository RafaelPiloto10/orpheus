It's automatic  
I need to unload  
Under the pressure  
Gone middle of the road  
Fall into fashion  
Fall out again  
We stick together  
'Cause it never ends  
  
Here comes a low  
I'm a boy and you're a girl  
Here comes a high  
The only ones in the world  
Here comes everything  
You and me can work it out  
Here it comes  
You, me, we'll work it out!  
  
Here comes tomorrow

We stick together  
Gone middle of the road  
'Cause that's entertainment  
It's the sound of the wheel  
It rolls on forever  
You know how good it feels  
  
Here comes a low  
I'm a boy and you're a girl  
Here comes a high  
The only ones that's in the world  
Here comes everything  
We're like monkeys out in the space  
Here it comes  
We are members of the human race  
You, me, we'll work it out!
