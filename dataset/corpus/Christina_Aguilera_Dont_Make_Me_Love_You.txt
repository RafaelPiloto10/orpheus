Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
I need you to go slow and steady  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
  
Ooh, oh yeah  
  
Why you wanna rush into my life  
Don't you wanna stop and get to know me better  
We got all the time in the world tonight  
And if we're meant to be we'll be together, oh oh  
Stay around just slow it down  
Till we find out if we got what it takes  
  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
I need you to go slow and steady  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
  
Everything I know about you so far  
Makes me believe that you're the one for me  
But there's still a lot that's on my mind  
And I need time before we go further  
Don't you see  
So hold me, fold me, but don't be  
Thinking I don't want you too  
  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
I need you to go slow and steady  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
I need you to go slow and steady  
(Till I'm ready baby)  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
  
It's better with a little bit of mystery  
Let's wait till we have a bit of history  
Behind ourselves, ooh ohh yeah  
We don't got to be in such a rush  
We can live for the moment if we trust  
We'll be right here tomorrow, oh yeah yeah  
  
Don't make me love you, ooh, ohh ooh  
Don't make me give you, ooh ohh  
I need you to go, ooh yeah  
Don't make me love you, oh, oh, oh yeah yeah  
  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
(Till I'm ready, ooh ohh)  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
I need you to go slow and steady  
(Slow and steady)  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
  
Don't make me love you, don't make, ooh ohh  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
I need you to go slow and steady, baby  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
(Ready, yeah yeah)  
  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
Don't make me give you more than my kisses  
(More than my, love ohh oh)  
I need you to go slow and steady  
Don't make me love you till I'm ready  
Yeah yeah
