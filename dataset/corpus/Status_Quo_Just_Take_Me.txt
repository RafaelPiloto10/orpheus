I am just a poor man, got nowhere to go  
All my leaves have fallen, left me all alone  
If I was a rich man, if I was a king  
I would give you all I have, give you everything  
  
If you'd just take me  
Just take me now  
If you'd just take me  
  
Never seen my daddy, died when I was two  
Mama did the best she could, taught me all she knew  
Said that love was everything, tears came to her eyes  
Never knew the meaning, now I realize  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love is all you need  
All you need now  
If you just take me  
  
I'm trying hard to get you, I'm not the only one  
Never had a big car, but I'm not on the run  
If love has got a meaning see it in my eyes  
If you see the beginning, then you'd realize  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is all you need  
All you need now  
If you just take me  
  
Just take me  
Just take me now  
Won't you just take me
