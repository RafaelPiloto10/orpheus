When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speakin' words of wisdo-om  
Let it be  
And in my hour of dar-arkness  
She's standing right in front of me  
Speakin' words of wisdo-om, let it be  
  
Let it be, oh let it be-ee  
Whisper wor-ords of wisdom  
Oh let it be  
  
When the night is cloudy  
There's still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow-ow  
Let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speakin' words of wisdo-om  
Just let it be  
  
Let it be-ee, oh let it be-ee  
And there will be an answer  
Just let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Livin' in the world agree  
There'll now be an answer  
Oh God let it be  
Though they may be parted  
There's a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer-er  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be-ee, oh let it be-ee  
Whisper words of wisdo-om  
Ah let it be  
  
Let it be (let it be, let it be)  
There will be an answer  
Just let it be  
  
(Let it be-ee, let it be-ee-ee-ee)  
There will be an answer-er  
Just le-et it be
