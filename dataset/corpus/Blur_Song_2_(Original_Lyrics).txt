You try then suffer  
Unemic birth-er  
Gets in the way-ey  
He never earns her  
  
Wohoo  
'Cause he did run it easy  
Wohoo  
If I will do the same  
Wohoo  
'Cause you're sick and you're easy  
All that you get when you ever say  
'Cause you're never  
pleased to see me  
  
I never taught her  
And 'cause how easy  
She's not my problem  
It's not my problem  
  
Wohoo  
'Cause I know what my name is  
Wohoo  
And I go on again  
Wohoo  
If you ever regret it  
You don't say what you never deem  
'Cause you're never  
pleased to see me  
  
Oh Yeah x4
