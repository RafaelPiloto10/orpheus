Well, I think it's really time again for a revolution  
Not to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's there  
Can you remember a time when water was still water  
Or are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirs  
  
Inhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain!  
I'll surely make our children feel a lot more sane!  
  
Revolution now!  
  
I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissance  
And today we're all faced with death, rubbers, and AIDS  
In '68 some people went out to fight for freedom  
They would never ever have thought that their children wear ties  
  
And if you come to San Francisco  
You're gonna meet some broken people there  
  
Revolution now!
