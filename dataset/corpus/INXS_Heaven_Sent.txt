Your eyes are like deep wells of desire  
Once in your arms I'm on fire  
You were sent girl so perfectly true  
Changing my life  
Now I'm a survivor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
  
Late at night when the evening fire has died  
There's a look in your eye  
Seductive images fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day you'll see what angels can see  
Dressed in black if she comes back  
I think I'll loose my mind  
  
Tuesday she works  
In the library uptown  
Some useful knowledge  
Can always be found  
Don't burn the library  
Till you've read all the books  
Sometimes in life  
You get a second look  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
  
Heaven sent [Repeat: x5]
