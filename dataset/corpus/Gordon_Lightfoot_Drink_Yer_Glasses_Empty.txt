Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do  
Forget about music and alcohol too  
Forget about your baby  
We got other work for you  
Better drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to rise and shine  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
It was back in 39  
When I was one year old  
Sitting by the backyard fence  
And the world had turned so cold  
Drink yer glasses empty now  
Was all that they were told  
Drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder  
There's no time to wonder why  
We'd love to take life over that is plain  
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain  
And watch a John Wayne movie  
To remind us once again  
Better drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the line  
You got one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
Drink yer glasses girls and boys  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder  
There's a tear in every eye  
I'd like to take things one at a time  
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme  
Because beg, steal or borrow  
You got another hill to climb  
So drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the road  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
Drink yer glasses girls and boys  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder  
There's no time to wonder why  
We'd like to take life over again  
When time of war had passed away into the rain  
And watch a John Wayne movie  
To remind us of the plains  
Just drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to rise and shine  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for  
Listen up and I'll tell you what is true  
They done some thinking and they changed a thing or two  
You been living in the hindsight  
Of a backwards point of view  
So drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the road  
There's one less cause in the world  
To be leaving for
