Some days are just a copy  
Of a day you had before  
You flash yourself thinking  
You can't take it anymore  
Never feels more alone  
When you're in a crowded room  
And bang your head to a wall  
You feel nothing, nothing at all  
  
Just want to feel the same  
Just want to feel the same  
  
Some things will never change  
Just want to feel the same  
Just want to feel the same  
  
Always knew you'd be a star  
Now I know that's what you are  
And we cry  
To a new beginning  
We deny  
A new beginning  
  
So let me introduce to you  
This favourite play of mine  
A comedy called Germany  
You may not understand  
The funny thing it's about someone  
Who's never been alone  
Just trying to be a friend  
So you can start all over again  
  
Some things will never change  
Just want to feel the same  
Just want to feel the same  
  
Always knew you'd be a star  
Now I know that's what you are  
And we cry  
To a new beginning  
We deny  
A new beginning
