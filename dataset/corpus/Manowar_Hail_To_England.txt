Raise sails head for the open sea.  
With sails full of wind - our hearts  
Overflow with belief.  
  
The guest for the grail to England  
We sail, with our steel. We  
Bring what was lost. If  
Lives are the cost, let it be.  
  
Strong she stands - reaching her  
Hand. Brave and grand. On English  
Ground - we were born. Proudly  
We return. - To English shore  
  
Hail, hail, hail.  
  
We march from the hills  
Down to London Town. -  
Join Raise your hand - or hide  
When we ride for the crown.  
  
The sign of the hammer and  
The black winds blow through  
The night. Long was our wait  
Our meeting with Fate is tonight.  
  
Strong she stands - reaching her  
Hand. Brave and grand. On English  
Ground - we were born. Proudly  
We return. - To English shore  
  
Hail, hail to England -  
Hail, hail, hail.  
  
Standing tall - one and all -  
Light the hall. -  
  
Years have passed - I've dreamed  
of this day.  
As we raise our hands - we  
proudly say.  
  
Hail, hail to England -  
Hail, hail, hail.
