[Intro]  
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle  
  
[Verse 1]  
Why are you standing so far away?  
Running men is looking on. Why...  
Why don't you come out to play?  
And get closer to your animal, inside  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ready I act like the gentleman that your mother would love,  
(Ooh, get to know me)  
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up,  
(Things you wanna show me)  
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love,  
(Please be slowly)  
I think you're ready to try,  
Walk a little closer and...  
  
[Chorus]  
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid  
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage  
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know (don't know), I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
  
[Verse 2]  
Show me your T-shirt, and spreed your wings (your wings)  
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud  
Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain  
Sorry, show it for the whole crowd  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ready I act like the gentleman that your mother would love,  
(Ooh, get to know me)  
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up,  
(Things you wanna show me)  
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love,  
(Please be slowly)  
I think you're ready to try,  
Walk a little closer and...  
  
[Chorus]  
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid  
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage  
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know (don't know), I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
  
[Bridge]  
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle  
  
[Chorus]  
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid  
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage  
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know (don't know), I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
  
[Bridge]  
Sound's a calm...  
Sound's a calm...  
  
[Chorus]  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know (don't know), I want  
Come in, (come in), gimme what I don't know, I want
