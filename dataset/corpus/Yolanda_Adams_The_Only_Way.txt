Everywhere that I go  
I must tell everyone of the Savior I know  
And the things He has done  
He's the truth and the life  
And there's no other way to the Father, but by Him  
Long ago when He knew you'd be out on a limb  
He gave His life for you, can't you live yours for Him?  
He's the Almighty rock and you won't have a firm foundation  
Unless you're built on Him  
You can't live without Him  
You can't move without Him  
You can't breathe without Him  
You can't think about doing one thing without Him  
You can't do without Him  
'Cause there's no you without Him  
Because He's the only way  
The only way  
There's no other name  
Than the name of Jesus  
There's no one  
Than the one who frees us  
There's no other way  
No other way  
What more can I say?  
He's the only only way  
The only way
