Midnight in the big city  
At the bar drinking all on my own  
Just thinking about that girl and me  
How something's going wrong  
  
Mister, tell me, what's my saving grace?  
The back room boys  
Were all telling me  
I'm a borderline case  
  
Back on the borderline one more time  
  
Seven beers and still sober  
It's time to change to something stronger  
I cannot take this scene no longer  
She could have told me it's all over  
  
Back in my home town  
The old place is still the same  
But time can cast a spell over something  
You can't go back again  
  
Back on the borderline one more time  
  
Mister, fill me another  
Till I go crazy and it turn my mind around  
Just pass that bottle one more time  
And slowly drink it down  
  
Jeanie can I tell you?  
The shame of my disgrace  
It's just love or rejection  
For this borderline case  
  
Back on the borderline one more time  
  
I'm on my bended knees crawling  
I'm begging you darling
