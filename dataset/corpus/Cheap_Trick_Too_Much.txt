Don't wanna see you again,  
You're takin' a little too much.  
Maybe it's my fault, OK,  
You've taken away too much.  
Swimmin' in sorrow all day,  
Well fakin' it doesn't do much.  
Maybe you've fallen from grace,  
It's takin' a little too much.  
I couldn't be you, my friend,  
You're makin' a lie of your love,  
My love  
  
I-I swear-you had it all,  
Diamonds and pearls,  
In time  
You've taken all mine.  
  
I couldn't be you my friend,  
You've taken a little too much.  
Don't wanna hold you again,  
And fall for the tricks in your touch.  
No one can charm like you can,  
You're makin' a lie of our love,  
My love  
  
You'll be there without a care,  
I'll go alone-I'll fall into life all over again.  
  
In time I will find a girl  
Who knows just how to be kind.  
Some days the power's so bright-my love,  
I can't find no easy way out.  
  
I-I swear-a light, a voice,  
Tells me to stop.  
Something inside screamed out:  
Get my life back again.  
  
Don't wanna see you my friend,  
You've taken a little too much.  
Maybe it's my fault, OK,  
You've taken away too much.  
  
I couldn't be you my friend,  
'Cause none of your riches mean much.  
I couldn't stand to pretend,  
You're makin' a lie of our love.  
My love, come on, come on,  
You're takin' a little too much, too much.  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la, la la la la la la
