I don't know just what to make of this world  
My friends are wonderin' too  
I got some doubt about the state of this world  
'N what we're gonna do  
  
All I know is you  
'N the feelin' I feel is the truth  
I'm in love with you  
'N I don't need to figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
All I know now is that  
I got No Doubt About Love  
Hesitation is out  
Now that I got No Doubt About Love  
  
You're never sure about your place in this world  
Or what you need to survive  
Some people say that  
What it takes in this world  
Is constant compromise  
  
But your love's so fine  
And I must have done somethin' so right  
To be in love with you  
And I ain't givin' up what I got  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can it be  
Certainty  
Has taken ahold in my life  
Imagine my surprise  
No doubt Big Love has arrived  
Every day I thank God I'm alive  
  
[Chorus]
