First came the winter  
And then came the morning  
Bright coral branches that pass you again  
Down from the meadow and onto the seashore  
Came the vast checkerboard kingdom of men  
Sun radiates gold infrarays  
Time to prepare for the fall  
Harvest the corn, watch for the storm  
Soon we will hear winter call  
Ice on the pond, won't stay too long  
Too thin to walk it today  
Ice on the pond, something went wrong  
Frost must be lost on the way  
Evening is falling  
The tree is a silhouette  
As seen by the teddy bear  
Watching his den  
Spring came so quickly  
That I did not see her  
Just turn around  
And she's coming again  
Wind chimes along, rising at dawn  
Seasons in circles too match  
Each comes along, singing his song  
Burying thoughts of the past
