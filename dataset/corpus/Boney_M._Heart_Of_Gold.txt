I want to live,  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold  
All these expressions I never give  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
I want to live  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold  
All these expressions I never give  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
I've been to Hollywood  
I've been to Redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
Been a miner for a heart of gold  
Crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old
