You know I can't stand to be around you cause you know I'm still in love with
you  
And my arms keep reaching to do what my thoughts do all the time  
I just can't keep my hands off of you  
Cause it's like looking at heaven while I'm standing in hell  
We shared something precious for a while  
You look just like a baby in a cradle to me I just can't keep my hands off of
you  
Woman you've got the man inside my body trembling the way only you know how to  
And I guess that's just one of a million reasons I just can't keep my hands
off of you  
Cause it's like looking at heaven...
