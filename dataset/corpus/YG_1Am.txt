It was 1 in the morning and I was up yawning  
Moms asked where I'm going, to the hood if you ain't knowing  
Pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me  
I was out the house ASAP Rocky  
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us  
We wasn't babies, she just wanted to hold us  
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'  
About how she was a bad mama, mama said "fuck 'em then"  
I was in the streets styling, nobody could tell me nothing  
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin  
I was buzzin'  
Fucking all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothing  
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy  
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed  
  
But now I'm rolling on dubs  
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?  
Now I'm rolling on dubs  
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?  
All these hoes showing love  
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?  
All these hoes showing love  
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?  
  
SKKKRRRT, I was on a mission  
On a mission to the money, sun down 'til it sunny  
Know my family love me  
Riding in the car with 2 niggas and a pistol  
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up  
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand  
I already know the plan, hop out and get on your mans  
And take what he got  
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots  
This a stick-up  
Phone ring, it's my mama in the middle of some drama  
So I don't pick up thinking I gotta get my shit up  
I gotta pick my bitch up  
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us  
So we left with a thousand dollars cash  
It was me and my nigga so you know I went half  
Shit get real when niggas get greedy  
Pop, pop, pop, pow, that's where he leave me
