Oh Yeah  
Roxy Music  
Brian Ferry  
  
Some expression in your eyes  
Overtook me by surprise  
Where was I how was I to know'  
How can we drive to a movie show  
When the music is here in my car  
There's a band playing on the radio  
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars  
They playing Oh Yeah on the radio  
And so came to be our song  
  
And so on through all summer long  
Day and night drifting into love  
Driving you home from a movie show  
So in tune to the sounds in my car  
There's a band playing on the radio  
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars  
They playing Oh Yeah on the radio  
It's some time since we said goodbye  
And now we lead our separate lives  
But where am I where can I go'  
  
Driving alone to a movie show  
So I turn to the sounds in my car  
There's a band playing on the radio  
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars  
There's a band playing on the radio  
And it's drowning the sound of my tears  
They're playing Oh Yeah on the radio
