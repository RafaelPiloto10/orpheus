Oh, If I could live April again  
If only I could live April again  
  
How happy I would be again  
Oh, If I could live April again  
If only I could live April again  
How happy I would be again  
  
The early morning rain, falling on my window  
Makes me think of you again  
I pretend that you're here with me  
And tho' it seems like April again  
  
It's not the same  
It's not the same  
  
Oh, if I could live April again  
If only I could live April again  
How happy I would be again  
  
Flowers that we saved, pressed between the pages  
Of the book have turned to gray  
But still I close my eyes and hold them  
And know that it's not April again  
  
It seems that way  
It seems that way  
  
Oh, if I could live April again  
If only I could live April again  
How happy I would be again  
  
Oh, if I could live April again  
If only I could live April again
