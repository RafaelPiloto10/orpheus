Oh please release me, let me go  
For I just don't love you anymore  
To waste our lives would be a sin  
Release me and let me love again  
  
I have found a new love dear  
And I will always want her near  
Her lips are warm while yours are cold  
Oh release me, my darling let me go  
  
Please release me, let me go  
For I just don't love you anymore  
To waste our lives would be a sin  
Release me and let me love again  
  
Let me go, oh release me, my darling  
Let me go
