He's not guilty  
What are you doing  
He's the son of God  
He's the son of God  
Stop beating him  
He's our savior  
He's not guilty  
Get your hands of him  
Let him go  
Stop beating him  
He's our savior

Father this pain  
It's too much

But I must do this  
My love requires it

No my son  
crying
