Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
  
Used to sit and hold your hand, baby  
Begging you, not today  
  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Yeah, and I'm new alone again, darlin'  
You was out somewhere with your other man  
  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
  
Nothing I ever do pleases you, darlin'  
Or I just can't get along with you
