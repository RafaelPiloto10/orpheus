Judy I feel weary now older than a man of thirty-three  
The gates of hell just opened after twenty years the warden says I'm free  
Revenge was all I wanted when I killed the man that took your life that day  
I've had my satisfaction but the price was more than love should have to pay  
Lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame  
And the way you teased the menfolk  
The jury all agreed you knew no shame knew no shame  
  
Well I'm glad that you can't see me now  
You'd probably say that I do not look my best  
Those lawyers took my money that Louisiana road gang took the rest  
And Judy I can't even conjure up your picture in my mind today  
Lately I've been thinkin' what a fool I was to love you anyway  
Lords knows you weren't no lady and the witnesses all swore you was to blame  
And the way you teased the menfolk the jury all agreed you knew no shame  
Well it all seems kinda useless as I place these flowers on your grave today  
I don't know what I'm doin' here I've forgotten all the things I came to say
