There are places I remember  
All my life  
Though some have changed  
Some forever not for better  
Some have gone  
And some remain  
Though I know I'll never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life  
I loved you more  
Though the music is sweet  
But the song ain't complete  
Now in my life  
Boy, in my life  
Somethin' is missing  
It's a tune, yes it's true  
Still there's no me and you  
Here in my life  
Boy, in my life  
Somethin' is missing  
In my life  
There ain't no melody, oh no  
In my life  
There ain't no harmony  
To help me sing a song  
Oh the music is sweet  
(There are places I remember)  
But the song ain't complete  
Now in my life  
(All my life)  
Somethin' is missing  
(Though some have changed)  
It's a tune, yes it's true  
(Some forever, not for better)  
Still there's no me and you  
(And some have gone)  
Here in my life  
Somethin' is missing  
(And some remain)  
In my life there ain't no melody oh no  
(All these places have their moments)  
(With lovers and friends)  
(I still can recall)  
In my life there ain't no harmony  
(Some are dead and some are living)  
To help me sing this song  
(In my life)  
(I loved them all)  
All I need is a cue  
Well, I'm waiting for you  
Here in my life  
(But of all these friends and lovers)  
Boy in my life  
(There is no one compares with you)  
You are the melody (melody)  
'Cause in my life  
(In my life)  
(I know I'll often stop and think about them)  
You are the song-ac
