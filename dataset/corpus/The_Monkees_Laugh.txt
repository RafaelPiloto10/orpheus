Ev'ry face that I see is all wrapped up in frowns,  
And unfortunately, it kind of gets me down.  
Laugh,  
'Cause the music is funny  
Yeah, the bass sounds off-beat.  
Ain't that neat.  
Laugh,  
When you lose all your money,  
Or you can't find your shoes  
To cover your feet.  
  
It's not so hard to see exactly what I'm after.  
Sometimes a tear should fall, but I require giggles and chuckles  
Laugh,  
When you're keepin' a secret  
And it seems to be known  
By the rest of the world.  
Laugh,  
When you go to a party,  
And you can't tell the boys  
From the girls.  
  
Every face that I see is all wrapped up in frowns  
And unfortunately, it kind of gets me down.  
Laugh,  
At the things that are wrong.  
If you thinks it's this song,  
Then laugh.  
Then laugh.  
Then laugh.
