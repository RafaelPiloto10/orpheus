I tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen  
Pour myself a cup of ambition  
And yawn and stretch ,trying to come to life  
I jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping  
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumping  
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5  
  
[Chorus]  
Workin 9 to 5,what a way to make a livin  
Barley gettin by, it's all takin and no givin  
They just use your mind and they never give you credit  
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it  
  
they let you dream just to watch'em shatter  
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder  
But you've got dreams he'll never take away  
You're in the same boat with a lot of your friends  
Waiting for the day your ship'll come in  
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away  
  
[Chorus]
