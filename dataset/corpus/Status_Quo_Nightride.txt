Dreamin', goin' on a night ride, hopin', it's gonna be the right ride  
Feelin' so well, I'm in tune, can't you tell that I'm groovin'?  
Can't you tell I'm in tune and I'm movin' so much closer to you?  
Leanin', hopin' for a straight line, meanin', hopin' for the right rhyme  
I'm in tune to the room, 'cos my head just went boom and I'm movin'  
Can't you tell I'm in tune and I'm movin' so much closer to you?  
Can't you tell I'm in tune and I'm movin' so much closer to you?  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
Scheming, thinking of the right place, beamin', laughin' at my own face  
We've got a long way to go 'cos you make like you're so disapproving  
But can't you tell I'm in tune and I'm movin' so much closer to you?  
Can't you tell I'm in tune and I'm movin' so much closer to you?  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
You, you, you, you, you move me  
...
