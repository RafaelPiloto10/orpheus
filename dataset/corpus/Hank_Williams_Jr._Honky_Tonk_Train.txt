I've been riding this train a long time  
And I'm still trying to unwind  
All my rowdy friends have settled down  
I'm out on the road just looking around  
For that engineer of love to set me free  
'Cause I'm locked up in this world of misery  
  
And we ride on the honky tonk train  
Everynight life in the fast lane  
There's a woman on the dancefloor, she's messing with my brain  
Well here goes my heart, pour on the cold honky tonk train  
  
Everybody's got problems that's no lie  
Everybody's got somebody on their mind  
They wanna get on board and just leave their problems behind  
And their engines are burning hard for honky tonk wine  
So I take my guitar and make that little string moan  
And they're moving on down the line like Casey Jones  
  
Yeah we ride on the honky tonk train  
Everynight life in the fast lane  
There's a woman on the dancefloor, she's messing with my brain  
Here goes my heart, pour on the cold honky tonk train  
  
Yeah we ride on the honky tonk train  
Everynight life in the fast lane  
There's a woman on the dancefloor, she's messing with my brain  
Here goes my heart, pour on the cold honky tonk train  
  
Can I ever get off this honky tonk train  
Everynight I'm living a hard driving fast lane  
Hard driving fast land  
Riding the honky tonk train  
Riding the honly tonk train
