Verse 1:  
Put your pictures away,  
Anything that might bring up,  
Memories of the days and the nights we spent in love,  
You were my favorite song,  
Baby tell me why we had to turn the radio off  
  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
You hardly ever even cross my mind  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
Chorus:  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
  
Verse 2:  
Saw you out yesterday  
And I knew that you saw me  
You was with your new man  
And I was with some random peeps  
Suddenly we caught eyes  
And I looked away before it got too hard to breathe  
  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
You hardly ever even cross my mind  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
Chorus (2x):  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
I don't even think about you babe  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
  
I'm dying...  
Girl you're killing me...  
Dying on the inside...  
Dying on the inside...  
Killing me, killing me babe
