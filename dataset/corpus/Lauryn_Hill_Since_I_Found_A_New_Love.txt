You're everything I want and more  
Oh I adore your mystery  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
I can't complain no more  
That's how its supposed to be  
I'm not in pain no more ... yeah  
Cause he's so close to me  
It doesn't matter what they say  
I'll be a fool for you  
But is it possible to say?  
Oh if they can't be cool with you  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
I don't get it wrong at all  
I'm in no empty conversations  
I can't be strong at all  
Oh with that vain imagination  
Oh I won't even tolerate  
None of their insane expectations  
What you've given me already  
Oh has me free from obligation ... hey ... hey  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
See it don't bother me at all  
because I'm free from obligation  
Oh I don't even entertain  
None of their insane expectations  
See what you've given me already  
Oh its enough to satisfy  
See you've forgiven me for getting  
All of the pride I had inside  
See now our living can begin  
Because all that's been left behind  
See now our living can begin  
Because that chance has left and I .. I .. I  
And now I just belong to you  
There's no one else to satisfy  
Oh baby I'll be strong for you  
Until they come to realize ... realize ... realize that  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
I have no fear at all  
No fear at all  
I have no fear at all  
No fear at all  
I have no ... fear at all  
I have no ... fear at all  
I have no fear ... at all  
I have no fear ... at all
