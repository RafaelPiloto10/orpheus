When you pack your clothes tonight don't pack up all the blame.  
Your not the first to walk away and leave someone in pain.  
I know how much its hurting you, hurting me this way.  
Believe me I've been in your shoes and I know you can't stay.  
  
  
I've been on both sides of goodbye. I know there ain't no easy side. I've
loved and I've been loved but not at the same time. I've been on both sides of
goodbye.  
  
  
Don't feel so bad for doing what you've got to do.  
You can't make your heart love me if it don't want to.  
When love just don't work both ways and someones got to go.  
So close that door and don't look back, believe me girl I know.  
  
  
I've been on both sides of goodbye and I know there ain't no easy ride. I've
loved and I've been loved but not at the same time. I've been on both sides of
goodbye.  
I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time I've been on both
sides of goodbye,  
goodbye!
