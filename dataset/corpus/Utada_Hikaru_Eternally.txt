Right before me, you glimmer slightly I can't see anything else  
Where are we ?  
Don't disappear into the background beginning to stir  
With commotion just yet, I can't hear anything anymore.  
But I can feel you breathe  
A little unlike myself I'm expecting something  
From a surprisingly coincidental development.  
I wanna be here eternally  
I want to gaze at you just like this  
I can feel you close to me  
I can't be by your side forever  
Only this moment will last forever.  
I want to be with you on my break before I go to war.  
We'll leave the promise until next we meet.  
Can you hear me breathe?  
Everyone has times when they are moved by not so surprising  
Developments.  
I wanna be here eternally  
In a place no one will find us  
I can see you're all I need  
I don't need help getting to tomorrow  
Even this moment is surely just a fantasy  
I can feel you close to me  
Even if we can't go back to that place,  
At least this feeling will last forever  
I wanna be here eternally  
I can see you are all I need  
Only this moment will last forever.
