Warning, this is the chief of police speaking  
Do not steal police hate competition  
Where we gonna run, where we gonna hide?  
You've got the right to remain silent  
But forever they were brought here to protect us  
They were brought here not to hurt  
But now they hurt us everyday  
You see, police have joined  
Forces with criminals  
Don't steal, police hate competition  
We can't sit down, something must be done  
Catching the bad guys in real life  
Is not as easy as it is in the movies  
We see James Bond  
(007)  
Eddie Murphy  
(Beverly Hills Cop)  
Chasing bad guys all the time  
But police in real life have joined  
Forces with criminals  
Don't steal, police hate competition  
We can't sit down something must be done  
Our life has got to be like  
Life in the movies  
Where the good guys always  
Win in the end  
Life in the movies  
How can we expect them  
To serve and protect the community?  
If they themselves are the bad guys  
Police have joined forces with criminals  
Stand up and fight, no one is safe  
Life in the movies  
Life in the movies  
Life in the movies  
...
