When I drove into that parking lot  
For the first time peepers round was on the dot  
By the stink of that cop, ain't got a lot  
Well we were lookin' for a place to play  
We high-tailed over to one-eyed Jack  
With a cheap guitar strung over my back  
Well I looked pretty nervous, I can't turn back  
This guy was everything the driver said, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
Well lazy Jack, doesn't move too well  
Play it back real loud, a real rebel yell  
Buy a rock and roll record and make it sell  
I'm gonna make it to the top today  
Now I got pulled in some big demand  
And they all keep telling me be a one-man band  
Unless I get big stuff and a real cool band  
And boy you gotta hear me play, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
Well they heard some sounds in the songs we wrote  
Welcome back by paying you note for note  
Been a long time playin' that rock and roll  
Not a thing's gonna touch me now  
Gonna rock your town if anybody could  
Drive a big limousine down to Hollywood  
Even bought a nice home in your neighborhood  
But we have to keep the curtains drawn  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's got her jeans too tight  
We were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight, rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight
