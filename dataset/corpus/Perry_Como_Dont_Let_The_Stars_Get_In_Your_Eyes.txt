(Pa pa pa pia, pa pa pa pia, pia, pia...)  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart!  
Love blooms at night  
In daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return  
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love!  
  
Too many nights! (Too many nights!)  
Too many stars! (Too many stars!)  
Too many moons could change your mind!  
(don't let the moon change your mind!)  
  
If I'm gone too long  
Don't forget where you belong  
When the stars come out remember you are mine!  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart!  
Love blooms at night  
In daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return  
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love!  
  
(Don't let the stars get in your eyes...don't let the moon break your heart!)  
  
(Pa pa pa pia, pa pa pa pia...)  
Too many miles! (Too many miles!)  
Too many days! (Too many days!)  
Too many nights to be alone! (Too many nights all alone!)  
Oh! please keep your heart, while we are apart  
Don't you linger in the moonlight when I'm gone! (While I'm gone!)  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart!  
(Don't let the moon break your heart!)  
Love blooms at night  
In daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return  
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love!  
(I'll ever love!) I'll ever love!  
  
You're the only one! (you're the only one!)  
I'll ever love!
