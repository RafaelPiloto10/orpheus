Who are we to say who we must obey  
to get much better, ooh to get much better,  
Who are we to say there's only one way to read the letter,  
A decision to make and here I must be sure  
it will not break me,  
Not a friend in the place to say to my face  
if I'm right or if I'm wrong.  
  
Who are we to say what we must throw away,  
it doesn't matter, ooh it doesn't matter  
This is for me, this is for you,  
it's not inspiring it's not the right thing  
I can't accept some things,  
irrespective of how long you tell me  
You can make me give in but that's because  
I'm stronger than I should be.  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't believe you, I don't believe the things you say  
There's another way, I can choose to take  
There's another way and it's for me to make  
  
When there's a voice to tell you the choice,  
you will remember, ooh you will remember  
Know what to take, what decisions to make without thinking  
I can't accept some things,  
I never will say yes when I don't mean to,  
You am make me give in but that's because  
I'm happy when I'm with you.  
  
[Chorus]
