Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldn't you love to love her?  
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover?  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
  
She is like a cat in the dark and then  
She is the darkness  
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when  
The sky is starless  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
Will you ever win?

She rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldn't you love to love her?  
She rules her life like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover?  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
Will you ever win?

Taken by the sky

Love's a state of mind
