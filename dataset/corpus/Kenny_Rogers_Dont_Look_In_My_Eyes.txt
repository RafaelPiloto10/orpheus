All my memory is safely packed  
And my dreams are neatly folded away  
I've got nothing to show  
To a love that might have told okay  
All the tables and chairs  
They're standing empty and bare  
And there isn't any sign  
You were here  
So just walk out of the door  
Try not to get too near  
  
You might look in my eyes  
And see all the pain  
And sadness deep inside  
Don't look in my eyes  
That's where I keep the tears I can't hide  
If you've just gone, it'll be alright  
I know I'll get through the night  
And I even smile  
As we say our goodbyes  
Just don't look in my eyes  
  
All our photographs are stored away  
And our letters are there burned in the fire  
There's nothing left here  
That make me believer  
We had nights of tender love and desire  
If this seems to be gray  
I'd like to hide away  
There's nothing to remind me of you  
When you walk out of the door  
Just be sure whatever you do  
  
Don't look in my eyes  
And see all the pains  
And sadness deep inside  
Don't look in my eyes  
That's where I keep the tears I can't hide  
If you've just gone, it'll be alright  
I know I'll make it through the night  
And I even smile  
As we say our goodbyes  
Just don't look in my eyes
