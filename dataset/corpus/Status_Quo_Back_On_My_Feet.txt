I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
When we're up there flying  
And it all seems fine  
Half the time we're trying  
Trying hard what a fool  
Saying anything to raze it all  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
It is down to timing  
Get it right first time  
'cause it's so exiting  
Keeping on with the flow  
Giving everybody such a show  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again I'm riding high  
Worried 'bout anything that passes by  
It's not a nightmare or a dream  
It's not the first time that it's been  
I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
So it's time to work out  
What is going on  
So you'd best not freak out  
Lose your mind lose your cool  
It's the quickest way to end it all  
But I'm back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die  
Out on the street again I'm riding high  
Worried 'bout anything that passes by  
Back on my feet again I'm flying high  
Watching my back again or I could die
