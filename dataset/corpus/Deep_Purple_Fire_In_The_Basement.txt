I came 'round to your front door, your back door was locked  
Pushed your button, rang your bell, you didn't hear me knock  
I saw your window open wide, so I crawled inside  
I ran to the top floor, but you were on the ground  
I was on my way up and you were going down  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up, scream and shout  
There's fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out  
  
This strange sensation that I'm going through  
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you  
I know what it takes to be a man, you understand  
'Cause when the sparks start flying you'll never be the same  
You know I'll hate to leave you girl but I'm so glad I came  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up, scream and shout  
Fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out  
  
Smoky eyes burning bright  
Innocence lost, satisfy my appetite  
Surrender to the flame, what's your name  
Let's get down to business, how can you refuse  
Give this boy a helping hand, come on light my fuse
