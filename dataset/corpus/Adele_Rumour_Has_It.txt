She, she ain't real,  
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,  
She is a stranger,  
You and I have history,  
Or don't you remember  
Sure, she's got it all,  
But, baby, is that really what you want  
  
Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds,  
You made a fool out of you,  
And, boy, she's bringing you down,  
She made your heart melt,  
But you're cold to the core,  
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore  
  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh  
  
She is half your age,  
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed,  
I heard you've been missing me,  
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,  
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,  
Haven't you heard the rumors  
  
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,  
You made a fool out of me,  
And, boy, you're bringing me down,  
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,  
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,  
  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh  
  
All of these words whispered in my ear,  
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,  
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,  
People say crazy things,  
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,  
Just 'cause you heard it  
  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh,  
Rumor has it, ooh  
  
But rumor has it he's the one I'm leaving you for.
