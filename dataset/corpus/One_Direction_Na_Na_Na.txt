We've got a bit of love hate  
Take me to the edge then you hit the breaks  
I say it's over one day  
Then I'm crawling back begging you to stay  
  
Makeup then we breakup all the time  
  
Say that I hate a song  
Then you go request it the whole night long  
Some people say it's so wrong  
But even when we fight girl you turn me on  
  
Makeup then we breakup all the time

'Cause when we think we got it right
