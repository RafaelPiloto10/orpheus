It's been a long time, baby  
It's been a long time comin'  
I don't like it  
It's been on my mind, baby  
It's not the same anymore  
Let's face it, we've changed, yeah yeah  
  
Don't stand there laughin'  
'cause I'm here cryin'  
Don't have no pity, baby  
'cause my sun's never shinin'  
  
And don't think I ever think about you with another man  
And don't think I care about you, honey  
You just don't understand  
That's why I say  
  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop lovin' you baby  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
  
It's been a long time, baby  
It's been a long time comin'  
I don't like it  
It's been on my mind, baby  
It's not the same anymore  
Let's face it, we've changed, yeah yeah  
  
Here comes that feelin'  
That feelin' never stops  
From the first time that I met you  
Till the last time that we talked  
  
And some days I don't think I'll make it through  
I'd feel better if you felt it too  
But don't have no pity, pity baby  
You just don't understand  
That's why I say  
  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop lovin' you baby  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
  
It's been a long time, baby  
It's been a long time, baby  
I don't like it  
It's been on my mind, baby  
It's not the same anymore  
Let's face it, we've changed, yeah yeah
