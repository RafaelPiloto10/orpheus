[Chorus]  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than death valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
The way I feel, can't explain  
So much passion turned to pain  
The sun still shines most of the time  
Did you know the sun shines when it rains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been cussed and I've been praised  
And I've been nothing these days  
But I'll come back, time will see  
If I'm wrong about you, right about me  
  
[Chorus]
