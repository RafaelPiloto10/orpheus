Love, love is a verb  
Love is a doing word  
Feathers on my breath  
Gentle impulsion  
Shakes me makes me lighter  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my....(x2)  
  
Water is my eye  
Most faithful mirror  
Fearless on my breath  
Teardrop on the fire of a confession  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my....  
  
You know you're not a strong man  
You're just about to cry  
Hang on.. Hang on  
It's no fun..  
  
You worry about the future  
The sign said "yoga class for cats"  
It's okay.. It's okay  
It's no fun..  
  
You're frustrated by the cracks  
In the pavement  
And every mother's back  
Once again  
Caaaarnival closed down  
But if this world would ever turn around  
  
Oh.. You'll be there..  
  
And the dynamite is waiting  
Cause they bankrupted the sky  
It's okay.. It's okay  
It's no fun..  
  
You're frustrated by the cracks  
In the pavement  
And every mother's back  
Once again  
Caaaaaaaaaarnival closed down  
  
Everybody's sane  
Ohh everyone is sane (x2)  
You'll be there (x7)  
You'll be there.... Oh..  
  
Are you worry about the future? (x3)
