I was walking along in the sun  
Taking pictures of everyone  
And there's something on the tip of my tongue  
Oh  
  
Well it's easy to see from afar  
And it's easy to be on your guard  
But it's harder just to be who you are  
Oh  
  
When all these  
People who will lead you down the back of the track  
They're on your back  
They will try and tear you apart  
But believe and you will see that there's no reason to doubt  
Then you will find  
You can do much better than that  
If you think of all the things that you feel  
All the voices in your head that you hear  
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on  
  
When all these  
People who will lead you down the back of the track  
They're on your back  
They will try and tear you apart  
But believe and you will see that there's no reason to doubt  
And you will find  
You can do much better than that  
  
If you see me hit the ground  
Don't come near don't make a sound  
  
I was walking along in the sun  
Taking pictures of everyone  
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
