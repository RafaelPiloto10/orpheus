If you're gonna break my heart  
Go ahead on  
Guess you think you're kinda smart  
Go ahead on  
(Well you've got another girl)  
And you're having fun  
(Got her head in a whirl)  
See what you've done  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
I said go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
You never call me on the 'phone  
Make me so sad  
Sittin' all alone  
Feelin' bad  
(Tired of being your fool)  
'Cause you told me lies  
(I can't take no more)  
Of no alibi  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
For a little while  
We had a good thing goin'  
Everything was peaches and cream  
But the devil in you started showin'  
Do you understand now  
What I mean?  
  
You put me down  
Every night  
If you want to be a clown  
That's all right  
(When it's all too late)  
Then you'll see  
(She's done the same to you)  
Like you did it to me  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
You put me down  
Every night  
If you want to be a clown  
That's all right  
(When it's all too late)  
Baby you'll see  
(She's done the same to you)  
Like you did it to me  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
  
Git, git, git  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
You'd better pack your bag  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on  
(Go ahead on)  
Bye, bye, bye  
(Go ahead on)  
Go ahead on
