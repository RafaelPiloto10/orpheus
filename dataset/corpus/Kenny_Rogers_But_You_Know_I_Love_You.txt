When the morning sun streaks across my room  
And I've waken up from another dream of you  
Yes I'm on the road, once again it seems  
All I've left behind, is a chain of broken dream  
  
But you know I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you  
  
How I wish that love, is all we need to live  
What a life we'd live, 'cause I've got so much to give  
And it seems so wrong, deep inside my heart  
That the dollar sign could be keeping us apart  
When you know I love  
Yes I love you  
  
And if I could only find my way back to the time  
When the problems of this life of mine didn't cross our minds  
All the answers were found in children's nursery rhymes  
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you  
  
But you know we can't live on dreams alone  
Just to pay the rent, I must leave you all alone  
But you know I made me choice many years ago  
And this traveling life is the only one I know  
  
But you know, I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you  
But you know, I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you  
  
But you know, I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you  
But you know, I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you  
  
But you know, I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you  
But you know, I love you  
Yes I love you, oh I love you
