When they tell you I'm dating  
With somebody new  
Don't you know that I'm playing a part  
Forgetting you  
I still want you to want me  
Though you said we're through  
Can't you see that I don't want to start  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I don't want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Don't you know that it's breaking my heart  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
'Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I don't want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Don't you know that it's busting my heart  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you
