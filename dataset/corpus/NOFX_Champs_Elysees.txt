I was walking on the avenue  
(Strolling)  
The heart opened to the unknown  
I wanted to say hello to anyone  
Anyone and that was you, I told you anything  
Just hadda talk to you, to tame you  
(Win over)  
  
On the Champs Elysees, on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun, under the rain, at midday or midnight  
There's whatever you want on the Champs Elysees  
  
You said I have rendezvous in a basement  
(Underground)  
With mad guys who live with guitar in the hand  
(Crazy)  
From evening til' morning  
  
So, I've accompanied you  
(Came with you)  
We sang, we danced  
And we even not thought about kissin'  
(Embracin')  
  
On the Champs Elysees, on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun, under the rain, at midday or midnight  
There's whatever you want on the Champs Elysees
