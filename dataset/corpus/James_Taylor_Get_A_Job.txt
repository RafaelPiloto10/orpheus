(Get a job)  
  
Every morning about this time, my baby's on me and she cryin'  
About a job  
At breakfast every day, she throws the want ads my way  
She never fails to say, get yourself a job  
  
(Get a job)  
  
And when I read the paper, I read it through and through  
And my girl never fails to see if there is any work for me  
And when I get back to the house, I hear that woman's mouth  
Preaching and a cryin', tellin' me I'm lyin' about a job  
That I never could find  
  
(Get a job)  
  
And when I read the paper, I read it through and through  
And my girl never fails to see if there is any work for me  
And when I get back to the house I hear that woman's mouth  
Preaching and a cryin', tellin' me I'm lyin' about a job  
That I never could find  
  
Walking on eggs  
Sneaking in the back  
(Get yourself a job)
