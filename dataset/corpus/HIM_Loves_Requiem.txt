Confusion writhes around our hearts impatiently  
It drains the faith that lights the dark and sets us free  
From the chains of our war and the pain we once called love  
The poison of doubt enslaves our minds and we bleed  
We abandon the trust that kept us blind and disappear  
Under the crimson wings of hate where the lost are safe  
Until they love again  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
We pray to the serpent of delight desperately  
The questions are answered and we try not to weep  
Until we are sure we're suffering for love  
In the dungeon of our dreams we're so weak  
The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep  
We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again  
  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
The salvation we seek will be waiting us there  
In the heart of darkness lonely and scared  
With a promise of death for our love  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song  
Hold me until we're one and sing me your beautiful song  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song  
Hold me until we're one and sing me your beautiful song...
