For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chicks steady gas your ass  
Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash  
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes  
She said, "I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night  
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve  
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze  
Do you believe?  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties, off the post  
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game  
She sayin', "Nah, he good", I mean  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
For no amount of dough, franchise this man  
Give him all the things you can  
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans  
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
Cause she know what's better for her  
Toppin' in the peckin' order  
Fluid like the runnin' water, nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta  
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter  
I get it  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing  
Game time's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute  
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact  
She's out the park, and comin' back  
She sayin'  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all  
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call  
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls  
This is why you can't trade me  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
You can put your money on a sure thing  
Certain profits will they bring  
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing  
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring  
Do you wanna trade?  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
Cause in the end as a teammate  
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball  
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score  
Pep-talks in the locker-room  
This is why you sing this tune  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out  
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out  
I train for the pressure and come out fresher  
Equipped for the game, you know my name  
It makes me better  
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing  
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting  
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting  
As you say  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
The physical ability, with mental capability  
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity  
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community  
I'm stayin' here  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"  
  
I'm glad that you feel this way  
Here's where I like to play  
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, "Ole"  
Wait a minute, "Andele"?  
I dunno, well, anyway  
"I wouldn't trade it for nothing"
