The midnight hour approaches  
The killing chill takes over him  
His victims will not know  
When he appears  
  
The lust of death's possession  
Will over take his psycho mind  
He won't be happy  
Till he smells the fear  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
Addicted to the madness  
The taste of death that lives within  
He loves it when he  
Tastes their final breath  
  
Stalking gives him pleasure  
Killing is the final act  
He takes no pity  
With his lust for death  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
Playing in his twilight zone  
He knows that he's the best  
Tripping through the streets alone  
Till he finds his victim next  
  
Killing gives him pleasure  
Sleeping gives him pain  
The only time he's feeling good  
Is when he's killed and killed again  
  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
Watch out  
  
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)  
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer
