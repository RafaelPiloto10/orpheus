I can't hold you down  
If you want to fly  
Can't you see I'm all broke up inside  
Well just you use your two X Ray eyes  
  
Hurt like Kryptonite  
Put me on my knees  
Now that I've found out just what you're doing  
With your secret identities  
  
That's really super Supergirl  
How you saved yourself in seconds flat  
And your friends are going to say  
That's really super Supergirl  
How you're changing all the world's weather  
But you couldn't put us back together  
Now I feel like I'm tethered deep  
Inside your Fortress of Solitude  
Don't mean to be rude  
But I don't feel super  
Supergirl  
  
I won't call again  
Even in a jam  
Now I realise you could be on a mission  
Saving some other man  
  
That's really super Supergirl  
How you saved yourself in seconds flat  
And your friends are going to say  
That's really super Supergirl  
How you stopped the universe from dying  
But you're never going to stop me crying  
And I feel like you're trying hard  
To sweep me like dirt underneath your cape  
Well I might be an ape  
But I used to feel super  
Supergirl  
  
That's really super Supergirl  
How you saved yourself in seconds flat  
And your friends are going to say  
That's really super Supergirl  
How you're changing all the world's weather  
But you couldn't put us back together  
Super Supergirl  
How you stopped the universe from dying  
But you're never going to stop me crying  
Super Supergirl  
I'm here in your Fortress of Solitude  
Don't mean to be rude  
But I don't feel super
