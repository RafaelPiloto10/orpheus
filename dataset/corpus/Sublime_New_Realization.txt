The time has come to reach a new realization 'tween me and you  
Time to clear the rumors sensations and things that just are untrue.  
Well I thought I heard you behind me  
With a knife straight for my back.  
It's quite clear that I'm back in the swing of living  
Although I might not be on the right track.  
  
Oh thought I might drown but its hard to be givin'.  
Downtown's where's you'll find me do some and got a hand.  
Although I never listen girl, I damn well understand.  
And you think, I'm so damn feeble.  
I can't see through your lies, you're just a crock of shit,  
With a pretty smile, and I refuse to compromise.  
  
Oh, don't give me such a heavy, heavy, heavy load  
  
You may hold some vision of truth, if truth can found in a lie.  
Maybe some grain of inspiration, for song that's deep inside.  
  
Oh, tears running down your face,  
Just screaming look me in the eye.  
Well I'm licking straight at your twisted face,  
And it's enough to make me cry.  
  
Oh, I payed the price of loving you,  
In more ways than one.  
Wrapped around your finger but I think my time has come,  
But I never can be too sure 'cause I like to have a little fun.  
  
Oh, what fun it would be to blow my mind and fall into the sun.  
A mind is a precious thing to taste.
