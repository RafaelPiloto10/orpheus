Far across the deep blue water lives an old captain's daughter  
On the banks of the old river Rhine  
Where I loved her and I left her and now I can't forget her  
'Cause she is my pretty Fraulein  
  
Fraulein, Fraulein walk down by the river  
Each night when the stars began to shine  
By these same stars above you I swear that I love you  
You are my pretty Fraulein  
  
When my memory start to wander  
Each day I grow fonder of the sweetheart that I left behind  
In a moment of my glory her face comes before me  
The face of my pretty Fraulein  
  
Fraulein, Fraulein look up toward the heaven  
Pretend that your hand is holdin' mine  
By the same stars above you I swear I still love you  
And I always will my Fraulein
