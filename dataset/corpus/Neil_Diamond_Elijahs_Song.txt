Got a rock and roll ditty  
From the heart of the city  
To a country lane far away  
Drums are beatin'  
And the bass repeatin'  
And it rocks you to sleep just the same  
  
Sleep, safe and warm  
Dream cares be gone  
You know that it won't take long  
We'll be singin' Elijah's song  
Singin' Elijah's song  
  
Ya' got a rock and roll daddy  
And you make him so glad  
He's got a smile  
A mile across his face  
Movie star mom  
Gonna keep you safe from harm  
And she'll do it with style and grace  
  
Sleep, safe and warm  
Dream cares be gone  
You know that it won't be long  
We'll be singing Elijah's song  
Singin' Elijah's song  
  
Little bitty child when you laugh  
I smile  
It's a feelin' I won't ever forget  
Far from now  
When you're wanderin' 'round  
Here's a song that I left in your head  
Dream, that's what you do  
Dream, 'cause dreams come true  
Someday when you're big and strong  
You'll remember Elijah's song  
Remember Elijah's song  
Remember Elijah's song  
Remember Elijah's song
