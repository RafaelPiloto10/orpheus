This time we almost  
Made the pieces fit  
Didn't we, love?  
This time we almost  
Made some sense of it  
Didn't we, love?  
  
This time I had the answer  
Right here in my hand  
Then I touched it  
And it had turned to sand  
  
This time we almost  
Sang our song in tune  
Didn't we, love?  
This time we almost  
Made it, made it to the moon  
Oh, didn't we, love?  
  
This time we almost  
Made our poem rhyme  
This time we almost  
Made that long hard climb  
  
Didn't we almost make it?  
Didn't we almost make it?  
Didn't we almost make it  
This time?
