Change the mood I'm in  
For a little while  
Let me see that grin  
Let me see you smile  
  
No soulful tales that fret and frown  
No woeful wails that get me down  
No rights or wrongs  
Sing no sad songs for me  
  
I only want to laugh  
No time for crying  
I only want to laugh  
No time for tears  
  
I only want to sing  
A song that's happy  
That's why I only want to walk a street that's sunny  
I only want to see the side that's funny  
  
I'm saving all of my tears until tomorrow  
'Cause crying all my tears  
Just ain't my style  
I'm acting like a clown  
But let me be  
'Cause even though I know  
The joke's on me  
I only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
  
I'm saving all of my tears until tomorrow  
'Cause crying all my tears  
Baby, just ain't my style  
I'm acting like a clown  
But let me be  
'Cause even though the joke's on me, oh  
Tell the girls goodbye  
'Cause I don't want to cry  
Hey  
I only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh
