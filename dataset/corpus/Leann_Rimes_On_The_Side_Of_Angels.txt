I've never been so certain,  
I've never been so sure.  
We're on the side of angels,  
If we believe this love is pure.  
  
Is it so hard to trust it,  
'Cause we've been wrong before?  
There comes a time in every life,  
We find the heart we're waiting for.  
  
After all the might-have-beens,  
The close and distant calls  
After all the try-agains,  
Don't be afraid to fall  
We're on the side of angels after all.  
  
Every time you touch me,  
Don't you feel it too?  
The gentle hand that's guiding us  
You to me, me to you  
  
After all the might-have-beens,  
The close and distant calls  
After all the try-agains,  
Don't be afraid to fall  
We're on the side of angels after all.  
  
Heaven only knows  
Why this took so long  
But only Heaven knows  
A love is right or wrong  
  
After all the might-have-beens,  
The close and distant calls  
After all the try-agains,  
Don't be afraid to fall  
We're on the side of angels,  
On the side of angels  
  
We're on the side of angels  
After all,  
Oh, yeah  
On the side of Angels  
Oh
