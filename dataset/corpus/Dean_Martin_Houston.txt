Well it's lonesome in this old town  
Everybody puts me down  
I'm a face without a name  
Just walking in the rain  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
I got holes in both of my shoes  
Well I'm a walking case of the blues  
Saw a dollar yesterday  
But the wind blew it away  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
I haven't eaten in about a week  
I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak  
Nobody calls me friend  
It's sad the shape I'm in  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
I got a girl waiting there for me  
Well at least she said she'd be  
I got a home and a big warm bed  
And a feather pillow for my head  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston  
  
Well it's lonesome in this old town  
Everybody put me down  
I'm a face without a name  
Just walking in the rain  
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
