In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
Find a new address  
Stood before I sink  
In a neon wilderness  
Spill my last drink  
Yeah, he was restless  
Say good-bye to my new friends  
Escape from loneliness  
I found a new address  
In the last room  
I hear a boom  
Someone else's distress  
In a neon wilderness  
Someone else's distress  
In a neon wilderness  
And I hear a boom  
  
In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
For a new address  
  
In a neon wilderness  
He was restless  
Escape loneliness  
For a new address
