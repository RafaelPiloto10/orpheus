When I met you, oh  
You know at first you had me so confused  
I used to lay awake at night  
Just copin' with the feelings I so long refused  
  
Well, I surrendered my love  
I saw you turn your heart stone-cold to ice, darlin'  
I put my heart on the line for you  
Oh, I did, I put my heart on the line, yeah  
First you take me to the highest ground  
Then you keep me hanging like some foolish clown  
  
[Chorus]  
It's such a fools' game, yeah  
It's such a fools' game  
I keep playing such a fools' game, yeah (forever)  
I keep on playin', keep on playin' this fools' game  
Yeah, this fools' game  
  
I can't take another sleepless night  
It's time to light the fire down inside of you  
I don't mind: I have the sun on my back  
  
To get a feeling that you never knew  
You never knew  
Got the secret in the palm of your hands  
Will you keep it, woman?  
Will you break this man?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl, I know you're playin' full time  
But it may be too late when you make up your mind  
  
You keep me in this fools' game  
Forever in your fools' game  
You got me caught up in this fools' game  
Such a fools' game, oh no, a fools' game  
How long will you keep me in this fools' game?
