Together we'll go all the way  
  
Tell me what you want from me  
Give me what I need from you  
Anything you want to do  
I'm gonna need to follow through  
  
Everything I have is yours  
I pray you understand because  
Whatever you want to do  
I'm gonna be with you  
  
Together's amazing  
Together we're blazing  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Together, I'll cry with you  
Together, I'll die with you  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Now my heart is beating fast  
Time is short, the die is cast  
I can keep a secret  
If you can really mean it and  
  
Feel the luck beside us  
And so much love inside us  
Whatever we have to do  
I'm gonna be with you  
  
Together's amazing  
Together we're blazing  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Together, I'll cry with you  
Together, I'll die with you  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Everything's easy  
In this state of mind  
The world starts to fade  
As we leave it behind  
  
Together's amazing  
Together we're blazing  
Together we'll go all the way  
  
Together, I'll cry with you  
Together, I'll die with you  
Together we'll go all the way  
Together we'll go all the way
