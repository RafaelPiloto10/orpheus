[Verse 1: J Cole]  
Yeah grew up with killers, I didn't know they was killers  
We was just together man, playing mega-man on sega man  
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni  
Yeah real black queen  
If I had a genie, I wish that she ain't struggle no more  
Yall wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor  
You told me when you came to my house  
This shit was like a timeout from reality  
One night you asked me what I'm crying about  
'Cuz you was staying over for the weekend  
I woke up from out my sleep  
When I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'  
I don't know if he been drinkin'  
But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling  
And rolling on the ground  
Could never get used to that sound  
My mama saying get off me  
My tears is tumbling now  
I wish that you never saw me  
'Cuz I, felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12  
I wish I would'be bust through that door my fucking self  
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf  
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless  
There goes two of my wishes  
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart  
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are  
Fast-forward to our older years  
Two different paths  
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last  
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?  
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way  
Too proud to fold  
You're demise  
One day to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body
twice your size  
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride  
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn  
Not my nigga  
The same one that told me that things always get better  
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga  
The news call him a killa, but he my nigga  
Sad shit  
Ay yo genie last wish, free my nigga
