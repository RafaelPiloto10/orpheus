She stepped out of the Taxi, with a suitcase in her hand  
And a hand bag too full for her to hold  
I felt her body tremble as I took her in my arms  
And she whispered, don't ever let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
The I watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door  
And I watched her put her satin things away  
Somehow now I know she won't be leaving anymore  
I do believe forever's here to stay  
  
It's good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall  
Lord, I wondered would I hear those sounds again  
We're picking up the pieces, and putting away the past  
We've got a lot of broken dreams to mend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I do believe forever's here to stay
