Full moon in a dirty sky  
That's all we can hope for, yeah  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
Don't be surprised  
By the way it is  
I've broken bones for less, yes  
  
I took a voyage (took a voyage)  
On the deep blue sea (deep blue sea)  
But I had to swim away  
I swam away that day  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
I took a voyage  
On the deep blue sea (won't come back)  
  
Innocence is what we want  
Now even children think that way, yeah  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon in a dirty sky  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
I took a voyage, yeah  
On the deep blue sea  
  
I took a voyage, yeah  
On the deep blue sea
