I was lying in a coma  
By the side of some damn road  
My fucking heart was pounding  
Like I thought it would explode  
I had no protection  
No family  
No friends  
I had nothing really  
But a will to make this end  
Go for the throat  
Go for the throat  
Go for the throat  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
I'm so fucked up  
It isn't very nice  
What I do to make end's meet  
It isn't very pretty when you hate  
The folks you meet  
It's a shame to feel hurt and angry everyday  
It's a shame to take it out  
On whoever's in the way  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Man I'm so fucked up  
I'm fucked up  
I'm fucked up  
I'm fucked up  
I'm fucked up  
Man I'm so fucked up  
Poor little girl  
I hurt her really bad  
I haven't been the same since I lost my mom and dad  
Where is the justice ?  
Well I really don't know  
When everybody is singing  
Like a fucking so and so  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up  
Yeah I'm so fucked up  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
They took away my freedom  
They took away my games  
They took away my innocence  
And gave me shitty fame  
There's nothing left to stop me  
There's nothing left to feel  
There's nothing left inside me  
But a low down dirty deal  
Go for the throat  
Go for the throat  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up baby  
Go for the throat  
I'm fucked up baby  
I'm so fucked up baby  
I'm so fucked up  
Oh I'm fucked up  
I'm so fucked up  
Oh I'm fucked up  
I'm so fucked up  
Oh I'm fucked up  
Go for the throat
