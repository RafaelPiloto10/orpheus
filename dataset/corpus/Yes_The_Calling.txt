Feel the calling of a miracle  
In the presence of the word  
Now we hold the right to rearrange  
How the stories can be heard  
  
In the beginning is the future  
And the future is at hand  
I'll be calling voices of Africa  
Be the rhythm to the plan  
  
From the Congo to Lenasia  
Be the writing on the wall  
I'll be calling the colors of India  
See the Asian life explode  
  
[Chorus]  
Head into the headlight  
Don't turn from the rain  
There's a fire raging somewhere near  
like a longtime friend who's  
Seen it darker than ebony  
Take off on the turnpike  
(Asking for the first call)  
Give me more of the same  
(Asking for a song)  
There's a fire burning in my heart again  
  
I'll be calling the dragons of China  
See the dancers of the Nile  
See the wings of change are on display  
This revelation mine  
  
Feel the calling of the miracle  
In the presence of the word  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel the calling of a miracle  
The revelation mine
