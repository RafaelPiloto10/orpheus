State of life, may I live? May I love?  
Coming out the sky, I name me a name  
  
Coming out-silver word-what it is  
It is the very nature of the sound the game  
Siamese, Indionese. To Tibet treat the life  
As a game, if you please  
  
(Hey)  
  
Coming up, Carabi, this sense of freedom  
Derives from a mediative state  
  
Movin' on, 'believe' that's it, call it magic  
Third world, it is, I only guessed it  
  
Shablam idi shablam ida  
Shablam idi shablam ida  
Shablam idi shablam ida  
  
Shot to the soul-the flame of Oroladin  
The essence of the word  
The 'state of independence'  
  
Sounds like a signal from you  
Bring me to meet your sound  
And I will bring you to my heart  
  
Love like a signal you call  
Touching my body, my soul  
Bring to me, you to meet me here  
  
Home be the temple of your heart  
Home be the body of your love  
Just like holy water to my lips  
  
(hey, hey)  
Yes I do know how I survive  
(yes I do know) know why I'm alive  
To love and be with you  
Day by day by day by day  
  
(hey, hey)  
Say-aye yaya oh  
(yayah yaya oh)  
'be the sound of higher love' today  
  
(yayah)  
(hey, hey)  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all-in his wisdom-hear  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all-in his wisdom-hear  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be
