I put on, I put on, I put on, I put on  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
  
When they see me off in traffic, they say "Jeezy on some other shit"  
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership  
Me I'm in my spaceship, thats right I work for N.a.s.a  
This 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard  
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard  
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security  
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate  
If you want it come and get it, you know I stay super straight  
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' Out the Super 8  
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate  
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake  
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
Put on (east side) Put on (south side) Put on (west side) Put on  
  
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]  
Half bag, top back,  
Ain't nothin' but a young thug  
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club  
Big wheels, big straps,  
You know I like it super sized  
Passenger's a red-bone,  
Her Weave look like some curly fries  
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce  
Pocket full of celery,  
Imagine what she tellin' me  
Blowin' on asparagus,  
The realest shit I ever smoked  
Ridin' to that Trap or Die,  
The realest shit I ever wrote  
They know I got that broccoli,  
So I keep that glock on me  
Don't get caught without one,  
Comin' from where I'm from  
Call me Jeezy Hamilton,  
Flyin' down Campbellton  
So fresh, so clean,  
On my way to Charlene  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I put on, I put on, I put on  
I put on for my city, I put on for my  
I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on  
  
I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks  
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex  
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress  
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best  
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit  
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit  
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace  
Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on  
I let my nightmares go I put on,  
Everybody that I knew from the go  
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke  
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more  
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me  
You can ask big homie, man the top so lonely  
I ain't lyin', so lonely I ain't lyin'  
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)  
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)  
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)  
Cause every night (every night) I put on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)  
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)  
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)  
Cause every night (every night)  
Let me see what we have tonight  
I'm high as a satellite  
I see those flashin' lights
