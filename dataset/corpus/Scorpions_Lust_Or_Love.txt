The innocence is gone  
But still I'm holding on  
Searchin' for love that lasts forever  
Lookin' for a place  
Where love can hide away  
Takin' a chance it's now or never  
  
Maybe it's time to draw the line  
There's just one thing that's on my mind  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Whatever it is I can't get enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
Is it love  
  
Lovers come and go  
Sometimes it's hard to know  
If this will be a night to treasure  
When the damage has been done  
And the hurting has begun  
You'll justify a moment's pleasure  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Whatever it is I can't get enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
Is it love  
Lust or love  
  
Maybe it's time to draw the line  
There's just one thing that's on my mind  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Whatever it is I can't get enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Still lookin' for more, it's never enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
  
Is it love, is it love, is it love  
Is it love, is it love
