I got the invitation that you sent me,  
You wanted me to see you change your name  
I couldn't stand to see you wed another  
But dear I hope you're happy just the same  
  
I planned a little cottage in the valley,  
I even bought that little band of gold  
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger,  
But now the future looks so dark and cold  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking  
Those wedding bells with never ring for me  
  
Darling, let's turn back the years  
And go back to yesterday  
Let's pretend that time has stopped  
And I didn't go away  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
Love wasn't meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So, darling, let's turn back the years  
  
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses  
A blossom from and orange tree in your hair  
While the organ plays "I Love You Truly,"  
Just let me pretend that I am there  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
