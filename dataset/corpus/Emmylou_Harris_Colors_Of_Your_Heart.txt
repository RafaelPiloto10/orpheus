Colors of your heart  
Like the colors on a pinwheel  
Spinning around, turning away  
Colors of your eyes  
Tell me you're changing  
Tell me your leaving  
And that it's too late to try  
Colors of your heart  
Like the places you're going  
There's no way of knowing  
What did I do so wrong  
Diamonds and sand  
Slide through your hands  
Like you've done through mine  
Did I look away  
Or did I never say  
How I needed you  
Colors of your eyes  
Like the blues in a bottle  
Taking you down  
Let them wash you away
