I can't sleep tonight  
Everybody's saying everything is alright  
Still I can't close my eyes  
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all of these lights  
Sunny days, where have you gone?  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Even when the sun is shinning I can't avoid the lightning  
  
I can't stand myself  
I'm being held up by invisible men  
Still life on a shelf when  
I've got my mind on something else  
Sunny days, oh where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Even when the sun is shinning I can't avoid the lightning  
  
Middle eight  
Oh where did the blue sky go?  
Oh why is it raining so?  
It's so cold  
  
I can't sleep tonight  
Everybody's saying everything is alright  
Still I can't close my eyes  
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all of these lights  
Sunny days, where have you gone?  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Even when the sun is shinning I can't avoid the lightning  
  
Oh where did the blue sky go? oh why is it raining so?  
It's so cold  
  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Even when the sun is shinning I can't avoid the lightning  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Why does it always rain on
