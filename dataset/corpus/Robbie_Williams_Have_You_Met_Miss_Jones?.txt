"Have you met Miss Jones?"  
Someone said as we shook hands  
She was just Miss Jones to me  
And then I said "Miss Jones,  
  
You're a girl who understands,  
I'm a man who must be free."  
And all at once I lost my breath,  
And all at once was scared to death  
  
And all at once, I owned the earth and sky  
But now I've met Miss Jones  
And we'll keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I  
  
And all at once I lost my breath,  
And all at once was scared to death  
And all at once I owned the earth and sky  
And now I've met Miss Jones  
  
And we'll keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I  
Miss Jones and I  
Miss Jones and I
