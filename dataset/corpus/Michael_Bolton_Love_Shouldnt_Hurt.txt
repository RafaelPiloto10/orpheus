Born in pure innocence  
Born without fear  
  
She says "mommy what did I do wrong,  
To make you cry your angry tears? "  
  
Feeling dirty and ashamed  
Keeps making up excuses  
She's learned how to hide the pain  
But she can't hide the bruises anymore  
  
There's no light behind her eyes  
She's tryin' to find love in a strangers touch  
14 years old and so alone  
Desperate for what she needs so much  
  
(Michael) She cries herself to sleep at night  
And prays she won't wake up...  
Love shouldn't hurt  
Love shouldn't scar  
But sometimes we can be so blind  
To the way things really are  
Love can be so unkind  
Truth is that hearts get broken every day  
But love should never hurt this way...  
  
Children having children  
And growing up too fast  
  
If you've never been shown love  
How can you give love back?  
  
Her newborn baby's cryin'  
It's more than she can stand  
  
She doesn't see the tragedy  
When she raises her own hand  
  
There's no light behind her eyes  
She doesn't realize what she has done  
Didn't think she was being so rough  
  
Little one won't you please wake up?  
  
Chorus X2  
  
... But love should never hurt this way...
