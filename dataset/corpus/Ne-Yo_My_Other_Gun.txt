Ohh  
Hold me down with a thousand pounds on her shoulder  
Lift me up despite the stones, rocks, boulders  
Soft and strong, right and wrong, anxious, patient  
In her eyes ride or die ain't just a statement no  
  
So much more than ride or die  
She'll get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive  
And I know if situations go arise  
Then she's right there in the holster by my side  
  
That's my other gun  
That's my other eye  
That's who got my back  
When the world ain't on my side  
She my other gun  
Should I go to war  
Holding me down  
That's what she there for  
  
She my other gun, yeah, yeah  
She my other gun  
  
Put me first even when I'm on my moment  
Knows me well can't front her she see right through me  
You rub my hand hold me when this world is troubling  
Settle for that long you'll never want or need for nothing girl  
  
So much more than ride or die  
She'll get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive  
And I know if situations go arise  
Then she's right there in the holster by my side  
  
That's my other gun  
That's my other eye  
That's who got my back  
When the world ain't on my side  
She my other gun  
Should I go to war  
Holding me down  
That's what she's there for  
  
She's always locked and loaded  
Ready for anything  
She got me fully covered  
I'm glad she's on my team  
Custom grip perfect fit  
All she spits is heat  
Her and me, all I need  
Makes us hard to beat, oh  
My other gun, oh  
  
That's my other gun  
That's my other eye  
That's who got my back  
When the world ain't on my side  
Said she my other gun  
Should I go to war  
Holding me down  
That's what she's there for  
She my other gun, oh  
  
Said she my other gun  
And I love you, said I love you baby  
Said I love said, I love you baby
