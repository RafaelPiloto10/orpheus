My head hits the pillow, starts to snore  
I don't wanna talk to you no more  
I can smell a rat, I don't need to see  
So don't try to pull the wool down on me  
They call me the rhino when I get this way  
You can call me again, maybe some othe day  
Ohh, oh yeah!  
  
I'm deep in a dream, deep in the trees  
I'm doing my thing with the chimpanzees  
There's somebody watching you everywhere  
Except in your dreams, they can't see you in there  
At least not yet, though someday they will try  
And on that day they'll see the rhino can fly
