Sometimes I try so hard to resist, you say you will and I say you won't.  
Sometimes I think that you don't exsist and sometimes you don't.  
Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.  
Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.  
You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.  
Count 10 and then down again.  
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Doing everything they say shouldn't be done,  
More fun than you can have with your clothes on.  
Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.  
Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.  
You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
The less I see of you, the more I care.  
The less I see of you, the more I care.
