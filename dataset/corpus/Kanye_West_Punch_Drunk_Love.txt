Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Come on girl, let's go  
  
Hey baby am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?  
You said maybe, well you crazy because I know I'm too fly  
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly  
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like  
  
Right now I'm off the wine, wine  
We can take our time, time  
So much I want to fronts  
Feel the bump when we grind  
  
My uh in is your body, my uh is in your mind  
Check my dictionary that ass is so divine  
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs  
I knocked and I knocked uh, can I come inside?  
I knocked and I knocked girl, can I come inside?  
  
I feel like it's home when I'm in between your thighs  
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain  
What make it feel so good that type of stuff you can't explain  
I do what I do to do to make it rain  
  
You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad you came  
'Cause you the type that danger we gain in yo  
Mic check like the way I begin my show

You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly  
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly  
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like  
  
Some call me Com, Com, some call me The Red, Red  
You can call me daddy, I'ma put you to bed  
An appetite for seduction and it gotta be fed  
The sexual eruption got you hitting your head  
  
On the board and knock and screaming, oh Lord  
We exchange like students 'cause I study abroad  
And listen to your body and low key party  
And I keep pushing and pushing, you 'bout to volley em' up  
  
We the type to make lovin' and we up  
We take a ride down south 'cause you need to re-up  
Girl you call me Big Bank like I was saving it up

Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly  
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like

We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
