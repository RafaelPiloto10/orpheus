I've been romanced and dined and danced  
Crazy nights and wild times  
But life has lost it's mystery  
And love is blind, cannot find me  
I'm blowin' away -- and shadows take my love and leave  
I'm blowin' away -- these shadows keep takin' my love and leavin' me  
I have cast aside my foolish pride  
I'm goin' down for the last time  
I have searched this earth and sailed these seas  
But love is blind, cannot find me  
I'm blowin' away -- and shadows take my love and leave  
I'm blowin' away -- these shadows keep takin' my love and leavin' me  
(Repeat last two lines)
