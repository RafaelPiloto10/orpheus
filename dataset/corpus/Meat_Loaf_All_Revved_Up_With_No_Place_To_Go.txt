I was nothing but a lonely boy  
Looking for something new  
And you were nothing but a lonely girl  
But you were something  
Something like a dream come true  
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block  
When I played my guitar  
I made the canyons rock but  
Every Saturday night  
I felt the fever grow  
Do ya know what it's like  
All revved up with no place to go  
Do ya know what it's like  
All revved up with no place to go  
  
In the middle of a steaming night  
I'm tossing in my sleep  
And in the middle of a red-eyed dream  
I see you coming  
Coming on to give it to me  
  
I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track  
And like a son of a jackal  
I'm a leader of the pack but  
Every Saturday night  
I felt the fever grow  
Do ya know what it's like  
All revved up with no place to go  
Do ya know what it's like  
All revved up with no place to go  
  
Oh, baby, I'm a hunter in the dark of the forest  
I've been stalking you and tracking you down  
Cruising up and down the main drag all night long  
We could be standing at the top of the world  
Instead of sinking further down in the mud  
You and me 'round about midnight  
You and me 'round about midnight  
Someone's got to draw first  
  
Draw first  
Someone's got to draw first blood  
Someone's got to draw first blood  
Oh I got to draw first blood  
Oh I got to draw first blood  
  
I was out on the prowl down by the edge of the track  
And like a son of a jackal I'm a leader of the pack but  
Every Saturday night  
I felt the fever grow  
Do ya know what it's like  
All revved up with no place to go  
Do ya know what it's like  
All revved up with no place to go  
  
I was nothing but a lonely all-American boy  
Looking out for something to do  
And you were nothing but a lonely all-American girl  
But you were something like a dream come true  
I was a varsity tackle and a hell of a block  
And when I played my guitar I made the canyons rock  
But every Saturday night  
I felt the fever grow  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go  
All revved up with no place to go
