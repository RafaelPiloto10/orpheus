There's a place where the sun breaks through  
And the wind bites cold and hard  
Stings my ears and  
Tears my eyes  
When the day starts to shout out loud  
  
Stand tall  
And glide  
When you're all alone in the crowd  
Don't fall  
Don't hide  
When you walk above the clouds  
When you walk above the clouds  
  
When the light is against your face  
And your smile is soft and sound  
That's when you tell me all your fears  
And all your dreams  
So proud  
  
Stand tall  
And glide  
When you're all alone in the crowd  
Don't fall  
Don't hide  
When you walk above the clouds  
When you walk above the clouds  
  
I try and tell you  
To keep your head upright  
Don't swing your sword and shield against the night  
Don't block your blessings, boy  
You don't have to fight  
You don't have to fight  
Stand tall  
And glide  
When you're all alone in the crowd  
Don't fall  
Don't hide  
When you walk above the clouds  
  
When you walk above the clouds
