You must be wondering how,  
The boy next door turned out,  
Have a care,  
But don't stare,  
Because he's still there  
Lamenting policewomen policemen silly women taxmen,  
Uniformed whores,  
They who wish to hurt you, Work within the law  
This world is full,  
So full of crashing bores,  
And I must be one,  
'Cos no one ever turns to me to say  
Take me in your arms,  
Take me in your arms,  
And love me  
  
You must be wondering how,  
The boy next door turned out,  
Have a care,  
And say a prayer,  
Because he's still there  
  
Lamenting policewomen policemen silly women taxmen,  
Uniformed whores,  
Educated criminals,  
Work within the law  
This world is full,  
Oh oh,  
So full of crashing bores,  
And I must be one, 'cause no one ever turns to me to say  
Take me in your arms,  
Take me in your arms,  
And love me,  
And love me  
  
What really lies,  
Beyond the constraints of my mind,  
Could it be the sea,  
With fate mooning back at me  
No it's just more lock jawed pop stars,  
Thicker than pig shit,  
Nothing to convey  
They're so scared to show intelligence,  
It might smear their lovely career  
  
This world, I am afraid,  
Is designed for crashing bores,  
I am not one, I am not one  
You don't understand,  
You don't understand,  
And yet you can,  
Take me in your arms and love me,  
Love me,  
And love me  
  
Take me in your arms and love me,  
Love me, love me,  
Take me in your arms and love me,  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Would you do,  
Would you do,  
What you should do,  
Oh oh oh, oh oh
