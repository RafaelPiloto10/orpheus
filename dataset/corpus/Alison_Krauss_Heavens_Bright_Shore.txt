Out on the hills of glory land  
So happy and free at God's right hand  
They tell of a place of marvelous grace  
On heaven's bright shore  
Pilgrims on earth someday will go  
To live in that home forever more  
Trusting in Him who died for sin,  
And rose from the grave  
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),  
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)  
Not one little grave (not one little grave),  
In all that fair land (that wonderful land).  
Not even a tear will dim the eye,  
And no one up there will say goodbye  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)  
When I must cross that rolling tide,  
There'll be someone on the other side  
Welcoming me to that fair land, made perfect by love  
When I walk up the milky white way,  
I'll see that home coming in a ray  
How great it must be for angels to see  
A pilgrim reach home  
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),  
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)  
Not one little grave (not one little grave),  
In all that fair land (that wonderful land)  
Not even a tear will dim the eye,  
And no one up there will say goodbye  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heaven's bright shore  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heaven's bright shore
