Lonfellow serenade  
Such were the plans I'd made  
For she was a lady  
And I was a dreamer  
With only words to trade  
You know that I was born for a night like this  
Warmed by a stolen kiss  
For I was lonely  
And she was lonely  
  
Ride, come on baby, ride  
Let me make your dreams come true  
I'll sing my song  
Let me make it warm for you  
  
I'll weave his web of rhyme  
Upon the summer night  
We'll leave this worldly time  
On his winged flight  
  
Then come, and as we lay  
Beside this sleepy glade  
There I will sing to you  
My Longfellow serenade  
  
Longfellow serenade  
Such were the plans I made  
But she was a lady  
As deep as a river  
And through the night, we stayed  
  
And in my way, I loved her as none before  
Loved her with words and more  
For she was lonely  
And I was lonely  
  
Ride, come on baby, ride  
Let me make you dreams come true  
I'll sing my song  
Let me sing my song  
Let me make it warm for you  
  
I'll weave this web of rhyme  
Upon the summer night  
We'll leave this worldly time  
On his winged flight  
  
Then come, and as we lay  
Beside this sleepy glade  
There I will sing to you  
My Longfellow serenade
