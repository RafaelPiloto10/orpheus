Time to burn it all away, time to think of what to say  
Time to go right back to yesterday.  
Time for movements in the past, time for something that won't last.  
Not just fire quick and die off fast.  
Things are never what they seem,  
I'm stuck inside of someone else's dream.  
Problems never go away...  
I'm sick of being caught in yesterday.  
Every day it's still the same, different faces, different names,  
But still stuck here playing these stupid games.  
Maybe soon I'll figure out what giving up is all about  
My heart is filled so full of doubt.  
Don't turn around, don't look ahead  
I won't listen to all the lies I'm fed.  
Don't have to listen to you  
So don't you fucking tell me what to do.
