I've been searching a long time  
For someone exactly like you  
I've been traveling all around the world  
Waiting for you to come through  
  
Someone like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
  
I've been travelin' a hard road baby  
Lookin for someone exactly like you now  
I've been carryin a heavy load  
Waiting for the light to come shining through  
  
Someone like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you, Someone exactly like you  
  
I've been doin' some soul searching  
To find out where you're at  
I've been up and down the highway  
In all kinds of foreign lands  
  
I've been all around the world uh  
Marching to the beat of a different drum  
And just lately I've realized uh  
Baby the best is yet to come  
  
Someone like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you makes it all worthwhile  
Someone like you now keeps me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
  
Exactly like you  
Yeah, Someone exactly like you now  
Ohm baby the best is yet to come  
Baby, the best is yet to come  
Exactly like you now
