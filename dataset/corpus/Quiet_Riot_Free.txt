[Verse 1:]  
You criticize the way I talk, You can?t know how I feel, yeah yeah yeah.  
I sympathize with your dark nature, you don?t know what that takes no no no  
It?s a matter of time now can?t you see  
Before I turn to your dark enemy  
I hear a voice that?s telling me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I?m free, free of the drama, free from the karma, free of the beast  
Free, out of my head free of the dread, the moment we met  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You can?t invade your tired old demons I won?t commiserate no no no  
You suck the life out of every room how much can I take I don?t know  
Like a flower that burns you to the touch  
It?s so beautiful but takes so much  
Of the life inside of me
