Ma' dear, Ma' dear, she told me one day  
That I'd meet my true love and take her away  
She said I'd be happy and to be good and true  
I'd never be lonely, broken hearted or blue  
  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, just like you said  
I met my true love one and we are to wed  
Ma' dear, she's an angel and I'm goin' to be true  
Or else I may lose her, I don't want to lose her to somebody new  
  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, I was not untrue  
I tried hard to please her, but she's gone and I'm blue  
Ma' dear, I'm so lonesome, broken hearted, too  
Ma' dear, Ma' dear, oh, Ma' dear, what must I do?
