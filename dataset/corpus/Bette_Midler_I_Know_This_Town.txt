I know these streets and these backyards,  
This barn that's falling down.  
We come to where they're building now  
And ride our bikes around.  
  
And you think I'm just a little kid,  
Some troubles on the way.  
Well, I knew this place before you did  
Is all I've got to say.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
  
We come home through these fields at night  
About a million times.  
I'd walk the road with my eyes closed  
And all the paths besides.  
  
And I know the boy who broke this fence,  
And I know his brother, too.  
And they'd never give me half a chance  
If I let on to you.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
  
We dam the streams, we raid the shacks,  
And hide in boxcars on the tracks.  
We know these quarries in our sleep  
And where they're cold and where they're deep.  
  
I'll go down to the bowling alley  
And buy smokes and Dentyne.  
I find some loose change every day  
Under that Coke machine.  
  
You check me out as you drive by  
Like there was some big deal.  
Well I know so much you'll never find  
From there behind the wheel.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.
