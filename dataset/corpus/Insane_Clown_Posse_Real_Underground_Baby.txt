Real underground baby

This clown don't smile and honk your nose.  
This clown don't wear green goofy clothes.  
And this clown don't mind your hatred for me.  
He'll get turned into a dead corpse right before me.

And the preacher man said, "Hellalujah, me and the  
Witch gonna go right to ya. ".

My motto, eat a dick up and swallow,  
Only motto I follow be da Jim Beam Bottle,  
And I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall,  
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall.  
Full throttle, punchin' in an Eldorado,  
Full bottle, I care about no tomorrow, and  
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall,  
I'ma kick a fuckin' hole in the wall.  
  
Who can paint their face up?  
(who can paint their face up?)  
And wear a Ninja suit?  
(and wear a Ninja suit?)  
Floatin' through some backyards,  
Drop-kick your niece head backwards,  
I'm outtie wit a poof! And, ain't  
That shit the truth.  
  
My days are long and lonely.  
Black rain is right before me.  
(Real underground baby)  
My brain does nothin' for me.  
Hey-ey! This pain will be my story.  
(This pain will be my story)

Put it in the fridge? (Shaggy 2 Dope did)

Underground baby. Real underground baby.  
  
I'm hiding under the floor, like Saddam, but I'm  
Doin it because I love it, and I'm underground baby,  
Real underground baby!  
I'm hiding under the floor, like Saddam, but I'm  
Doin it because I love it, and I'm underground baby,  
Real underground baby!  
I'm hiding under the floor, like Saddam, but I'm  
Doin it because I love it, and I'm underground baby,  
Real underground baby!  
I'm hiding under the floor, like Saddam, but I'm  
Doin it because I love it, and I'm underground baby,  
Real underground baby!  
  
(Laughter, Barking)  
  
Underground baby. Real underground baby.  
Underground baby. Real underground baby.
