Somebody's screaming  
Looking at the ceiling  
Everything's so funny  
I don't have any money  
People don't even know me  
But they know how to show me  
  
Why can't you be nicer to me?  
  
My pride is dying  
I think I'm all done lying  
Nobody's sharing  
So I stop caring  
All alone and walking  
Nobody's talking  
  
Why can't you be nicer to me?  
  
Well the wind is blowing  
Where am I going  
Off a bridge and falling  
Nobody's calling  
On the ground and laying  
Nobody's praying  
  
Why can't you be nicer to me?
