I've got the world on a string  
I'm sittin' on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love  
  
I've got a song that I sing  
I can make the rain go  
Any time I move my finger  
Look at me, can't you see, I'm in love?  
  
Life is a beautiful thing  
As long as I hold the string  
I'd be a silly so-and-so  
If I should ever let you go  
  
I've got the world on a string  
I'm sittin' on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love  
  
Life is a beautiful thing  
As long as I hold the string  
I'd be a silly so-and-so  
If I should ever let you go, yes  
  
I've got the world on a string  
I'm sittin' on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world,  
And this is the life, hey now  
I'm so in love!
