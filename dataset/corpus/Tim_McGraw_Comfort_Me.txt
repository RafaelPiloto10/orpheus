Wake me my lady don't let me sleep  
Open my eyes to the wonders you keep  
Let me look at you see how you shine  
I'll fall in love like I've done every time  
  
Lay me in soft green grass  
Down where the river runs  
Under the mountain caps  
Gold with the setting sun  
  
Walk me along the bay  
Beyond the verdant trees  
Carry me with your grace  
Forever comfort me  
  
You walk on water searching the east  
The souls of the masses pass at your feet  
Looking up at you with tears in their eyes  
Fathers of fathers of fathers gone by  
  
[Chorus]  
Walk me down old main streets  
Ride me down rusty rails  
Fields full of summer wheat  
Peppered with rounded bales  
Steeples where church bells ring  
Lighthouses by the sea  
Reach out through gathered storms  
Faithfully comfort me  
  
I am your tired I am your poor in spirit  
Yearning to breathe, breathe free  
Breathe free  
  
Lay me in soft green grass  
Down where the river runs  
Under the mountain caps  
Gold with the setting sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Comfort Me
