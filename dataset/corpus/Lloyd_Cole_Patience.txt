Early in the morning, just by the break of day  
Well that's when my patience went away  
She took her bags but she left all her clothes  
She took her keys and left me out in the cold  
  
Wearing a plastic coat  
And the pressures of life through lack of patience  
I get the pressures of her  
Patience is a girl that I hate to love the way I do, but I do  
  
She wakes me up in the morning through squeaking in my dreams  
She took her bags but she left all her clothes  
She took her keys and left me out in the cold  
All because of patience  
  
I get the pressures of life through lack of patience  
I get the pressures of her  
She beat me up and left me out in the pouring rain  
Without no keys, without no reason to go back again  
  
She left me empty-handed, she left me empty-hearted  
Not no money, not nothing but the blues  
All because of patience  
I get the pressures of life through lack of patience  
  
I get the pressures of her  
She said the one thing that she needs is happiness  
I don't believe that she's happy 'til she sees that I'm in distress  
No, all because of patience  
  
I get the pressures of life through lack of patience  
I get the pressures of her  
And I swoon
