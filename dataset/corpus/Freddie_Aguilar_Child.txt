When you were born into this world  
Your mom and dad saw a dream fulfilled  
Dream come true  
The answer to their prayers  
  
You were to them a special child  
Gave 'em joy every time you smiled  
Each time you cried  
They're at your side to care  
  
Child, you don't know  
You'll never know how far they'd go  
To give you all their love can give  
To see you through and God it's true  
They'd die for you, if they must, to see you here  
  
How many seasons came and went  
So many years have now been spent  
For time ran fast  
And now at last you're strong  
  
Now what has gotten over you  
You seem to hate your parents too  
Do speak out your mind  
Why do you find them wrong  
  
Child you don't know  
You'll never know how far they'd go  
To give you all their love can give  
To see you through and God it's true  
They'd die for you, if they must, to see you live  
  
And now your path has gone astray  
Child you ain't sure what to do or say  
You're so alone  
No friends are on your side  
  
And child you now break down in tears  
Let them drive away your fears  
Where must you go  
Their arms stay open wide  
  
Child you don't know  
You'll never know how far they'd go  
To give you all their love can give  
To see you through and God it's true  
They'd die for you, if they must, to see you live  
  
Child you don't know  
You'll never know how far they'd go  
To give you all their love can give  
To see you through and God it's true  
They'd die for you, if they must, to see you live
