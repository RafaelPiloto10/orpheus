Don't eat green meat it ain't good for you  
You know it killed your brother, killed your sister too  
Even fresh fried chicken on new-mown sand  
Can't beat red beans eaten outa your hand  
Oh Mabel, Mabel! You know I love you gal but I'm not able  
Mabel, oh Mabel, please get off the kitchen table  
Don't slice no onions, don't peel no grape  
Dream about banana slice nor sniff around short cake  
And if on a winter's day you find your sundial's wrong  
You'll know the weather is what's brought it on  
Oh Mabel, Mabel! You know I love you gal but I'm not able  
Mabel, oh Mabel, please get off the kitchen table  
Put the peas in the pot, put the pot on the hot  
In the cellar lies my wife, in my wife there's a knife  
So tote that hammer, lift that pick  
And banish inhibition with a pogo stick  
Oh Mabel, Mabel! You know I love you gal but I'm not able  
Mabel, oh Mabel, please get off the kitchen table
