Here comes the doo doo, flying up the street  
Running like the fire burning on his feet  
Casting his eye left to the right  
Looking for a place he can duck out of sight  
  
Here come the goomba goomba, rumbling up the road  
Looking for somebody to fill up the load  
A big fat cat he had, get off the bag  
Scooping up the striker, lest given him a whack  
  
Come on boy, jump inside  
Come on, boy, we gonna take you for a ride  
It's an excursion, where you don't have to pay  
At the end of the line you'll find a place to stay  
  
(Kwela, kwela)  
You better listen to the man  
(Kwela, kwela)  
Everybody jump in the van  
  
(Kwela-la, kwela-la, oh, kwela-la)  
You better listen to the man  
(And we're shouting kwela-la, kwela-la)  
Everybody jump in the van  
  
Now, doo doo, he doin', doin' pretty well  
He got a private room at the the Blue Hotel  
Everyday he gets a complimentary meal  
Maybe check out soon if can make a deal  
  
He wanna play music out on the street  
I'm sure you got your Nike's tight on your feet  
Better make sure that you stay outta sight  
For the Chakalas when he got a big appetite  
  
Come on boy, jump inside  
Come on, boy, we gotta take you for a ride
