We talked up all night  
And still came to no conclusion  
We started a fight  
That ended in silent confusion  
  
And as we sat stuck  
You could hear the trash truck  
Making its way through the neighborhood  
  
Picking up the thrown out  
Different from house to house  
We get to decide what we think is no good  
  
We're sculpted from youth  
The chipping away makes me weary  
And as for the truth  
It seems like we just pick a theory  
  
Ah it's the one that justifies  
Our daily lives  
And backs us with quiver and arrows  
  
To protect openings  
Cause when the warring begins  
How quickly the wide open narrows  
  
Into the smallness of  
Our deconstruction of love  
We thought it was changing  
But it never was  
It's just the same as it ever was  
  
A family of foxes  
Came to my yard and dug in  
So I looked in a book  
To see what this could possibly mean  
  
Yeah cause there's fate in the breeze  
Signs in the trees  
And possible tragic events  
  
When forces collide  
With the damage strewn wide  
And holes blasted straight through the fence  
  
Oh the sky starts to crash  
(into the smallness of)  
The rain on the roof starts to drumming  
(our)  
And laid up like cash  
(deconstruction of love)  
Your take on my list of shortcommings  
  
And now the show starts to close  
(the show)  
I know how this goes  
(starts to close)  
The plots a predicatable showing  
  
And though it seems grand  
We're just one speck of sand  
And back to the hourglass we're going  
  
Back to the smallness of  
(into the smallness of)  
Our deconstruction of love  
(our deconstruction of love)  
We thought it was changing  
But it never was  
  
We're still in the smallness of  
(into the smallness of)  
Our deconstruction of love  
(our deconstruction)  
We thought it was changing but it never was  
  
Our deconstruction of love  
  
Our deconstruction of love
