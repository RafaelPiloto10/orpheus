My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine,  
You make me smile with my heart.  
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable.  
Yet, you're my fav'rite work of art.  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
  
When you open it to speak, are you smart?  
But don't change on hair for me, not if you care for me.  
Stay little Valentine, sty! Each day is Valentine's day.  
Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little wek?  
When you open it to speak, are you smart?  
But please, don't change on hair for me, not if you care for me.  
Stay little Valentine, stay! Each day is Valentine's day.
