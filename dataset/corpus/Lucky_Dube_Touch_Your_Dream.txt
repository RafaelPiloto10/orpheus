Have you ever seen a dream walking?  
Have you ever heard a dream talking?  
You are the master of your dreams  
If you pull the right strings  
It could be talking to you  
If you pull the right strings  
It could be walking to you.  
  
You are the one to make it happen  
You're the only one that knows what is  
You are holding the key to your dreams  
Don't hestitate grab the chance  
Before it's too late.  
  
Chorus  
Reach out and touch your dreams.  
  
Don't let them tell you it is impossible  
That is what they told all heroes before  
In a hero's mind the word does not exist  
When you're 80 years old  
Thinking about your past  
Regretting every minute of your life  
That you've lost  
You will wonder where the time went  
If you do the right thing  
It could be talking to you  
Don't hesitate, grab the chance  
Before it's too late.  
  
Chorus  
Reach out and touch your drea.
