The wheel of fortune,  
Goes spinnin' around.  
Will the arrow point my way.  
Will this be my day.  
  
Oh, wheel of fortune,  
Please don't pass me by,  
Let me know the magic of,  
A kiss and a sigh.  
  
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning,  
I'll not dream of winning fortune or fame.  
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning,  
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame.  
  
Oh, wheel of fortune,  
I'm hopin', somehow,  
If you ever smile on me,  
Please let it be now.  
  
While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning,  
I'll not dream of winning fortune or even fame.  
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning,  
I'll be yearning, yearning for love's precious flame.  
  
Oh, wheel of fortune,  
I'm hopin', somehow,  
If you ever smile on me,  
Please let it be now.
