Persistent mystic faults my vision  
Its like always this point of collision  
  
Its raining in my cranium  
My head feels like a stadium  
  
Three pound of love  
About to burst  
Inside my three pound  
Universe  
  
Its raining in my cranium  
My head feels like a stadium  
  
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind  
Symbols I've been given to express my goal  
Always come up short  
You know they just don't get that low  
  
Its raining in my cranium  
My head feels like a stadium  
  
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind  
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision  
Bio organic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation  
  
Cleaner than light  
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000  
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers  
Of suffering succotash  
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,  
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation  
I wait  
I wait  
For the waaaaaave to break.
