What can I say to you, Bonita, what magic words would capture you  
Like a soft evasive mist you are, Bonita, you fly away when love is new  
What do you ask of me, Bonita, what part do you want me to play,  
Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita, I will be anything you say.  
Bonita, don't run away, Bonita.  
Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me,  
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita.  
If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita.  
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita.  
If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita.
