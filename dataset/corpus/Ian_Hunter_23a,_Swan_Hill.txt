Wrote this poem called, 'The Floods Roll On'  
He said, this ain't yours  
Where?d you get it from?  
You must have stole it from a book, oh yeah  
You must have stole it from a book.  
?Cause you ain't frail  
You ain't beautiful  
And I don't fancy you at all  
you'd be a ruin  
If looks could kill  
23A, Swan Hill  
Stiff with rage, screaming at the sky  
Innocence breaks  
Says she wants to die  
I'm assuming I'm alive, oh yeah  
I'm assuming I'm alive  
She pushes and she pulls  
My legs go weak  
In fascinating terror  
The whole world moves  
And I'm standing still  
In 23A Swan Hill  
And it?s always raining  
And you never ask why  
You never give yourself a shot  
You just sit and watch your life go by  
Kicking stones at a still life  
Want to pull it down, slash it, slash it  
There must be some way out here  
There must be some way out here  
This ain't right, there must be more to life  
Than breaking and entering  
Doing people?s heads in alcohol, nicotine  
Thinking what I might have been  
You would be a ruin  
If looks could kill  
23A, Swan Hill  
And the whole world moves  
And I'm standing still  
In 23A, Swan Hill  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will  
In 23A, Swan Hill  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will  
In 23A, Swan Hill  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will  
And I will  
In 23A, Swan Hill
