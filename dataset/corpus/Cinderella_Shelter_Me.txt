Everybody needs a little place they can hide  
Somewhere to call their own  
Don't let nobody inside  
Every now and then we all need to let go  
For some it's the doctor  
For me it's rock and roll  
For some it's a bottle  
For some it's a pill  
Some people wave the Bible  
Cause it's giving them a thrill  
Others point their finger  
If they don't like what they see  
If you live in a glass house  
Don't be throwing rocks at me  
  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper to get us by  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper ooo, and it'll be alright  
  
Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie  
But when the doors are closed  
There ain't nothin' he won't try  
Meanwhine Mr. Medicine's  
treating his best friend's wife  
Tipper lead the war against the record industry  
She said she saw the devil on her MTV  
To look into the cabinet  
It takes more than a key  
Just like Jimmy's skeletons  
And his ministry  
  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper to get us by  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper ooo, and it'll be alright  
  
Hit it now  
  
For some it's the needle  
For some it's the kill  
Some people wave the Bible  
'Cause it's giving them a thrill  
You can spend your money  
Before you get your pay  
With a toss of the dice  
You can piss it all away  
  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper to get us by  
We all need a little shelter  
Just a little helper ooo, and it'll be alright
