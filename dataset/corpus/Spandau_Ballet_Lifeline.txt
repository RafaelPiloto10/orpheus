Changing her colours she's off to the shore  
She rides the soul train and he fight the law  
There's a power in his voice and it makes her feel so sure  
So live and live in love  
One day he'll build a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
This subterfuge he never really planned  
Now you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing  
So live and let live in love  
Exchanging their letters their exits begun  
With deathless precision he's aiming his gun  
A democracy of sorts that justifies the sun  
So live and let live in love  
Neither has the ghost of a chance  
Those decisions only can be made once  
You never really know just what you're giving  
Till you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing  
He could have built a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
You never really know just what you're giving  
Till you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing to you  
But I'm not living
