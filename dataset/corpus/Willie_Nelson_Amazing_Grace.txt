Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relived  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hours I first believed  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Now when we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
That when we first begun  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see
