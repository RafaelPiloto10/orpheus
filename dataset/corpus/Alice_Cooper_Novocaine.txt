When I was 10, fell out of bed  
Got three stitches in my head  
It hurt like hell  
I saw the blood, I felt the pain  
I'd like to feel it once again  
'Cause I don't feel it  
  
Then I got stung, right on the face  
I screamed and ran around the place  
It hurt like hell  
I swoll right up, I burned for days  
I'd like to feel it once again  
  
Cause when you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel anything  
When you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
It's just like Novocaine  
  
I remember every cut and scrape  
I've been numb so long  
Something's wrong  
So I'll take anything  
  
I slap my face, I pull my hair  
Just to see if something's there  
It should hurt like hell  
I miss the pinch, I miss the pain  
That shock sensation in my brain  
  
Cause when you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel anything  
When you touch me  
When you hold me  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel anything  
  
When you touch me (when you touch me)  
When you hold me (when you hold me)  
When you kiss me  
I don't feel it  
When you touch me (when you touch me)  
When you hold me (when you hold me)  
When you kiss me  
It's just like Novocaine  
I don't feel anything  
I don't feel it  
I don't feel it  
I don't feel it  
Well, I don't feel it  
No, I don't feel it  
I don't feel it
