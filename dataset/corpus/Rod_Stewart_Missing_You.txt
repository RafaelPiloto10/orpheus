Missing you, missing you, missing you  
Missing you, missing you, missing you  
  
Every time I think of you  
I always catch my breath  
And I'm still standing here and you're miles away  
And I'm wonderin' why you left  
  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
I hear your name in certain circles  
And it always makes me smile  
  
I spend my time thinkin' about you  
And it's almost driving me wild  
And there's a heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what I might say  
  
There's a message in the wire  
And I'm sending you this signal tonight  
You don't know how desperate I've become  
And it looks like I'm losing this fight  
  
In your world I have no meaning  
Though I'm trying hard to understand  
And it's my heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what my friend's missing  
  
And there's a message that I'm sending out  
Like a telegraph to your soul  
And if I can't bridge this distance  
Stop this heartbreak overload  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what my friend's missing  
  
I ain't missing you and there's a storm  
That's raging through my frozen heart tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what my friend's missing  
  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I can't lie to myself  
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you, I'm lying to myself  
  
Oh yes, 'cause I ain't missing you  
Missing you, missing you, missing you, oh yeah  
I ain't missing you at all
