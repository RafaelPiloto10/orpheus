Congratulations!  
Oh, seems like you've done it again,  
And  
I ain't had such misery since  
I don't know when,  
Oh, and I don't know when,  
Oh, and I don't know when.  
  
I notice so many people slippin' away,  
And many more waiting in the lines  
In the courtrooms today,  
Oh, in the courtrooms today.  
  
Love is not a game,  
Love is not a toy,  
Love's no romance.  
Love will do you in, and love will wash you out,  
And needless to say you won't stand a chance,  
And you won't stand a chance.  
  
I'm hungry for learnin',  
Won't you answer me, please.  
Can a man and a woman live together in peace,  
Oh, live together in peace?
