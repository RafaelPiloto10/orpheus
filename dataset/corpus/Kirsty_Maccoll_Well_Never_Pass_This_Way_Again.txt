Darling  
While the firelight is low  
I'm disappearing  
Like the last day of the snow  
And really, it's better this way  
We both know it's over  
And we'll never pass this way again  
Sunshine and the desert call to me  
And you know moonshine  
Makes you blind so you can't see at all  
But whatever you feel  
It may not be real  
And baby we'll never pass this way again  
I'm not the only love you'll ever know  
Look to your stars above and wish it so  
Let me go  
Darling  
If I stay too long you'll tire of me  
'cause darling, that's the way we are designed to be  
So, hard as it is to say  
We had the night and we had our day  
We'll never pass this way again
