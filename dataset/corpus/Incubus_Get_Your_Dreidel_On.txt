Yo, it's Hanukkah time right about now [?]  
We be dreidlein'  
We bout to set it  
Baby go get your dreidle on  
Uh uh uh uh  
Get your dreidle on  
  
All of my homies in Santa Monica celebrate Hanukkah  
And my peeps in the streets are [?] for every one of those  
8 nights of lights  
And a menorah of  
Muthafuckin fantasy of fun, all rolled into one  
  
See the thing is, I'm not really Jewish  
But Mike said, Kil, won't you come down  
So I hopped up to do this  
Through this time of 8 days  
We all come together and celebrate  
We grub lots of manzos [?] and latkes, A. K. A. Potato pancakes  
  
3, 2, 1  
Hanukkah, Hanukkah, Hanukkah  
Oh, what a lotta fun  
Here I go again, once again  
No I don't mean to offend  
I grub all my gefilte fish, mmm, as quick as I can  
Then I light a candle and ouch  
Whoops, I just burned my hand  
Don't really matter though, cuz I gotta go  
And down some Manischewitz wine  
Yeah, now I'm feelin just fiiiiiine  
  
Yo, Mikey in the temple, all up on the beamer, eatin  
Challah, challah  
You know I'll be cleaner than a shiny silver platter of chocolate chip
macaroons  
My afro leavin Mike shadows as I step in the room  
  
You heard Hanukkah was comin and it's comin correct  
Lightin candles, open presents, showin family respect  
To the creator of the earth and of the fruit of the vine Manischewitz flowin
large, like it ain't got the time, yo  
  
Cuz we be eatin challah, challah  
With salt and butta  
  
That's right  
Hanukkah 2001, y'all  
We be dreidlein  
We're outta here  
Shalom for sheezy my neezy
