Empty room, empty room  
How am I gonna fill U?  
How am I gonna fill this empty room?  
  
Love is strong, however long  
We should've been 4ever  
How am I ever gonna fill this empty room?  
  
Found a strand of your hair  
By the bathroom window  
How am I ever gonna get U off my mind?  
  
In my bed, in my head  
Every word U've spoken  
Now how am I gonna fill this empty room?  
  
Lonely hearts, worlds apart  
Why should they be broken?  
When we could be somewhere makin' love  
  
Love is strong, however long  
We should've been 4ever  
Baby, why did U leave me all alone?  
Why'd U do it?  
  
Barren walls, tears fall  
What's the use in cryin'?  
I gotta find a way, find a way 2 fill this empty room
