When I was you we walked to school  
And I carried your books 'cause even then I was a fool  
But you grew up and said goodbye  
I still remember the things that made me cry  
  
For all too soon my story ends  
I found a love, now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
  
I held your hand and I told you things  
And I made you believe, believe in fairy tales  
And diamond rings  
  
Hen all too soon my story ends  
I found a love ,now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
Ah...
