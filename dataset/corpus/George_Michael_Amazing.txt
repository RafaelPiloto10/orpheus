I was mixed up when you came to me  
Too broke to fix said 'daddy you gone, I'm missing my baby'  
Still missing my baby  
  
I was stitched up by the hands of fate  
Said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?  
Maybe luck is a lady  
  
I was going down for the third time  
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions  
I had so many questions  
That you just kissed away  
  
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise  
The day you walked in and changed my life  
I think it's amazing  
The way that love can you set you free  
  
So now I walk in the midday sun  
I never thought that my savior would come  
I think it's amazing  
I think it's amazing  
  
I think you're amazing  
  
You tried to save me from myself  
Said 'darling, kiss as many as you want!  
My love's still available  
And I now you're insatiable'  
  
We're like victims of the same disease  
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom  
And your mom, was always acting crazy  
  
I was going down for the third time  
My heart was broken, I though that loving you was out of the  
  
Question  
Then I say my reflection  
Saying please don't let this go  
  
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise  
The day you walked in and changed my life  
I think it's amazing  
The way that love can you set you free  
  
So now I walk in the midday sun  
I never thought that my savior would come  
I think it's amazing  
I think you're amazing  
  
Celebrate the love of the one you're with  
  
Celebrate, this life with you baby  
I think you should celebrate yeah  
Don't put your love in chains baby  
No no, walk in the midday sun  
I thought I was dreaming  
I think it's amazing  
I think you're amazing  
  
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with  
  
As this life gets colder  
And the devil inside  
Tells you to give up
