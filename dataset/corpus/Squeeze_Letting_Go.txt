She plaits her hair, I bite my nails  
We balance love on the scales  
I wind the clock and go to bed  
Our love is hanging on a thread  
She gets undressed, I undress too  
The draft is cold in my bedroom  
We cuddle up and say goodnight  
It's all the love there is tonight.  
I can't be brave enough  
She cannot say what we're feeling  
Day after day  
We're going through the motions  
We find it hard to let each other go  
  
She boils the eggs, I make the tea  
Outside the sun shines on the street  
We're at that point here love has gone  
The fuse is lit, it won't be long  
I take a walk, she cleans the house  
This is the end, I'm in no doubt  
But neither one of us can show  
The slightest sign of letting go
