Thank God that it's Friday night and I  
Just-just-just-just-just got paid  
Yea, Oh  
  
Just got paid Friday night  
  
[Chorus]  
Just got paid, Friday night  
Party's hoppin', place is right  
Booties shaking, all around  
Pump that jam, while I'm getting down  
  
Check the mirror, I'm lookin' fly  
Round up the posse, jump in my ride  
Radio rockin', smooth jams  
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound  
I'm feelin' good don't you know I'm grooving  
To the beat  
I'm groovin', yea, grooving, oh oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some say my solo is impossible  
But when I get up on the mic, I'm unstoppable  
And it's probably when you hear our voices laid down  
You'll be bopping your head to this ill tight sound  
  
Now I know you probably thought ya had me  
Played (played)  
But the check is in my hand and I got it made(made)  
And you'll notice my smile is like cool-aid  
Cause I just(just) got(got) paid(paid)  
  
On the floor bumping to the beat  
All ways sure looks sweet  
Fine young lady, standin' by  
Come on baby, sweet like delight
