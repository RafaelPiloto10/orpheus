Thing's ain't so bad  
They sure could be better  
Thing's ain't so good  
But I'm sure it won't last  
Storm clouds above  
But I got my umbrella  
I would if I could  
I can't change the past  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm on the up  
My futures tomorrow  
Why should I worry  
All I've got to find  
Is another sad someone  
Who'll happily give me  
Must enough loving  
For their peace of mind  
  
Things are a drag  
But I'll get it together  
Things make you strange  
But that's how it goes  
I always say sorry  
So no one remembers  
I caused the pain  
When I struck the first blows  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Things ain't so good  
But I'm not complaining  
Things could be worse  
I don't need to tell you  
Hang out your washing  
It's gonna start raining  
Thunder clouds burst  
So tell me what's new  
  
[Chorus:]
