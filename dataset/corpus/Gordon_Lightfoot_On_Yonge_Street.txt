See the people walkin' up and down  
See the people movin' all around  
On the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
Longest street in the world they say  
Summertime soon slips away  
I hope I'll see you one fine day on Yonge Street  
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake  
Back there in the flow you may give a hand a shake  
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello  
Even late at night on the freshly fallen snow  
See the children jumpin' all around  
See the parents looking up and down  
Upon the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
It's a mean street if you choose  
It's a lean street when you loose  
An' in between street when you cruise along Yonge Street  
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake  
You'll be sure and find it's a case of give and take  
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello  
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow  
It's the longest street in the world  
With the most feet in the world  
Another street where boy meets girl on Yonge Street  
See the people walkin' up and down  
See the people movin' all around  
Those are the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
Everywhere you walk people almost say hello  
Even late at night when the streets are all aglow  
On Yonge Street  
On Yonge Street
