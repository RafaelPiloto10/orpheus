On the street it never changes  
There's a chill in the air  
Icy people, empty faces  
Not a word, not a soul who cares  
Do you give up  
Have you given in to the lie that a heart never changes  
Don't be fooled by what you see there  
Another man with another case of  
Chorus:  
One restless heart  
Who never could find love  
Too many hurts  
To reach out again  
How can he know  
Love still wants to find him  
One restless shell of a man  
  
Don't look away  
In a moment his life could be new  
Just a moment and love could break through  
Oh finally some place to start  
For a man with a restless heart  
  
Why the fear then, why the worry  
Why the walls holding love inside  
When you're needed in the fury  
In the fighting to save men's lives  
Don't you give up  
Don't be giving in to the lie that a heart never changes  
If you reach out God'll reach in  
Bring an end to another case of  
  
Chorus  
  
One restless heart, one restless heart  
One restless heart, one restless heart  
He's got to know that love still can find him  
Love can reach any man  
  
Don't look away  
In a moment his life could be new  
Just a moment and love could break through  
Oh finally some place to start  
For a man with a restless heart  
  
Tag:  
Don't you look away  
Oh never a stranger again  
Love has saved a restless man  
Finally some place to start  
For a man with a restless heart  
  
Tag
