Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes.  
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train.  
Switch on summer from a slot machine.  
Get what you want to if you want,  
Cause you can get anything.  
  
I know we've come a long way,  
We're changin' day to day,  
But tell me,  
Where do the children play?  
  
Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass.  
For your lorryloads pumping petrol gas.  
And you make them long, and you make them tough.  
But they just go on and on,  
And it seems you can't get off.  
  
Oh, I know we've come a long way,  
We're changin' day to day,  
But tell me,  
Where do the children play?  
  
When you crack the sky, scrapers fill the air.  
Will you keep on building higher  
Til there's no more room up there?  
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?  
Will you tell us when to live?  
Will you tell us when to die?  
  
I know we've come a long way,  
We're changin' day to day,  
But tell me,  
Where do the children play?
