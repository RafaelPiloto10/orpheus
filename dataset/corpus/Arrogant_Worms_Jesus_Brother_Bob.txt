If you haven't heard of me  
I wouldn't be surprised  
I bet you know my relatives  
Their names will never die  
My mother is a saint  
And my brother is a god  
But all I am is Jesus' brother Bob  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
I have to pay the ferry  
To cross the Galilee  
But not my brother  
No not him  
He walks across for free  
I finally get to work  
'Bout a quarter after nine  
Already he's turning water into wine  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
One day when I was home  
I heard a mighty r oar  
There were a thousand people  
Right outside the door  
Help us, Jesus, help us!  
Came the cheering from the mob  
But then they got a look at me  
Oh nuts, it's only Bob  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
He died upon the cross  
I thought that I was free  
Finally people would get to know  
Me for me  
(Hi Bob, Hi Judas!)  
This was my big chance  
To finally get ahead  
The next thing you know  
He's rising from the dead  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
Everybody!  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
ahhhahhhhahhh-Bob
