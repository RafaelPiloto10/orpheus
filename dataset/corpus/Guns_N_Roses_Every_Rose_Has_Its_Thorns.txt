We both lie silently still  
In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
Chorus:  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Just like every night has it's dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the dj say loves a game  
Of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know you'd be here right now  
If I could have let you know somehow  
I guess  
  
Chorus  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar remains  
  
I know I could have saved our love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
But now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
To hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife  
I guess  
  
Chorus
