(feat. The Stooges)  
  
But I am your crazy driver  
Honey I'm sure to steer you ' round  
I am dying in any story (?)  
I'm only living and (when I) sing this song  
(just the same, baby...)  
  
  
I need somebody, baby  
I need somebody, too  
I need somebody, baby  
just like you  
  
  
But I'm losing a lot of my feelings  
and I'm running out of friends  
you know you lied to me in the beginning  
tried to bring me to the end  
  
  
I need somebody etc.  
  
Well I was trying to leave this signal  
in a fury an (it) is too strong  
Yea I got my reputation  
write me anyway, not too long  
  
I need somebody etc
