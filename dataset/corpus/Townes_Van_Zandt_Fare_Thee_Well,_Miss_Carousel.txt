The drunken clown's still hanging round  
But it plain the laughter's all died down  
The tears you tried so hard to hide  
Are flowin'  
A blind man with his knife in hand  
Has convinced himself that he understands  
I wish him well, Miss Carousel  
But I gotta be a-goin'  
  
Won't you come and get me when  
You're sure that you don't need me then  
I stand outside your window  
And proudly call your name  
  
The ladies been told that all of gold  
Is worth so much it can't be sold  
No time to weep she'll need her sleep  
Tomorrow  
When she carries her face to the market place  
And bets it on the opening race  
She can ring her bells, Miss Carousel,  
But her singing brings me sorrow  
  
It's always done every mother's son  
Is shown that grown men never run  
And so they fight with all the might  
Inside them  
When the battle's been fought and they all been taught  
That the trick is just not being caught  
Will you give them hell, Miss Carousel,  
When they're begging you to hide them  
  
When the need arose your eyes fell closed  
You clamped your fingers round your nose  
Would you say that's any way  
To judge him  
You haven't got the authority  
To kill him in the first degree  
But would you feel compelled, Miss Carousel,  
If you have something to begrudge him  
  
On a velvet beach far beneath the reach  
Of those that come to pray and preach  
The natural man who tries to stand  
Is fallin  
How long will it be before he sees  
You own his legs but his mind is free  
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel,  
How long will he be crawling?  
  
The castle walls has grown so tall  
Seem there ain't no hope at all  
To reach the top even though you stop  
For breathin'  
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry  
The tear drops couldn't find your eye  
It's all been swell, Miss Carousel,  
But the time has come for leavin'
