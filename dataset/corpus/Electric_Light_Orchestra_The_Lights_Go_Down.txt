One day,I gotta get out of here,  
I gotta make everything clear  
I gotta see you.  
I know,the way that I feel is wrong,so wrong.  
But I gotta carry on, when you ain't around.  
  
I believe things are going wrong,  
And the night goes on and on,  
All your dreams have flown away,  
And the sun won't shine today  
  
[Chorus]  
The lights go down,  
The lights go down,  
The lights go down, and there's no one around.  
  
I know,you're waiting so close to me,  
But how will you ever see, as time rolls away,  
Lonely, but tryin' to be so proud,  
And just as I turn around, the lights go down.  
  
I believe things are going wrong,  
And the night goes on and on,  
All your dreams have flown away,  
And the sun won't shine today  
  
[Chorus]
