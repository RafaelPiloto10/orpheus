The way it was in the past  
A long, long time ago  
Before staff levels dropped  
They used to listen to the radio  
And listen to the DJ's talk  
About the songs they didn't know  
As if it really mattered  
  
Hit-pick or phone-in show  
I don't want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just don't need the rest tonight  
Once I couldn't care at all  
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight  
And 20 years ago  
No-one seemed to care  
The people must have known  
The DJ's role was only there  
To fill in space between the songs  
That talk of love and other things  
As if they didn't matter  
  
Automatic stations came  
And sent them all away  
And now I'm left alone  
I haven't got a word to say  
And you're the one who makes the choice  
To turn me on or turn me off  
But now it really matters  
  
Hit-pick or phone-in show  
I don't want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just don't need the rest tonight  
Once I couldn't care at all  
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight  
  
Hit-pick or phone-in show  
I don't want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just don't need the rest tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight
