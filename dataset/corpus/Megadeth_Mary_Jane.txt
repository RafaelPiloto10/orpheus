Forgive me father for I have sinned  
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind  
And I'm still wide awake... Mary Jane  
From the earth up through the trees  
I can here her calling me  
Her voice rides on the breeze  
Oh, it's haunting me  
No, I can't get away  
No, there's no escape  
If I know I'm going crazy  
I must not be insane  
Beware my friends as you pass by  
As you are now so once was I  
As I am now so you must be  
Prepare my friends to follow me  
Forgive me father for I have sinned  
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind  
Fingers gripped around my brain  
No control, my mind is lame  
I'm in the astral plane and I'll never be the same  
Never, never... never  
Beware my friends as you pass by  
As you are now so once was I  
As I am now so you must be  
Prepare my friends to follow me  
It hurts so bad I can't breathe  
Prepare to follow me
