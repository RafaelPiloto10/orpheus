Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in many ways.  
But I never thought I'd be here,  
Be here with you, my pretty one.  
  
Well, I've searched the whole world through.  
To find someone who,  
Would make this dream come true.  
It's you and only you, my pretty one.  
  
[Chorus]  
Pretty one, I long to hold you.  
Through the night, I want to hold you.  
Pretty one, has no one told you,  
I love you.  
Any day and you will find me,  
Full of joy when you're beside me.  
In a moment like this,  
Could it be what I've missed all my life.  
  
Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in so many ways.  
But nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you, my pretty one.  
  
Well, I love your smile.  
And I love your eyes.  
And the way you talk, makes me feel so nice.  
Nothing can compare with the way you are.  
And I need you now, as I write this song.  
Did I hear you say you're the only woman,  
From a lonely prayer I am in the air.  
  
Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in so many ways.  
But nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you my pretty one.  
But I never thought I'd be here,  
Be here with you my pretty one.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I've dreamed about today.  
The same dream in so many ways.  
But nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you my pretty one.  
No nothing can compare with,  
Compare with you my pretty one.
