Got to make a sense yeah  
Everything affects ya  
You're turning up the pressure  
But can you keep it on?  
Well it's only time  
It's only time that makes you  
Well it's only time  
It's only time that breaks you  
  
There gonna make ya  
Pay for the crime  
Put you up in cages  
Treat you unkind  
  
All your plans are made now  
Just like they told you  
So what becomes of Monday  
Now that Sunday's gone  
All you ever wanted  
Will come to you one day  
Just when you taste it  
You turn and walk away
