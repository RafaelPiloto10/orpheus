There will be no more confusion  
There will be no more ball and chain  
I will cease with the illusions  
And I will ask of you the same  
  
When you love someone  
It's gonna take some time  
  
Come on and save me, save me  
Pull me from deep water  
Give the kiss of life  
Now is the moment treasured  
Breathe the kiss of life  
Into the words we speak, into the words we speak  
  
And coming across the meadow  
Like a slow moving train  
Long determination  
Will forever remain  
  
When you love someone  
It's gonna take some time  
  
Come on and save me, save me  
Pull me from deep water  
Give the kiss of life  
Now is the moment treasured  
Breathe the kiss of life  
Into the words we speak, into the words we speak  
  
Give the kiss, give the kiss of life  
Give the kiss, give the kiss of life  
Save me ...
