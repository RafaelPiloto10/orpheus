I found the pieces in my hand  
They were always there  
It just took some time for me to understand  
You gave me words I just can't say  
So if nothing else  
I'll just hold on while you drift away  
  
Cause everything you wanted me to hide  
Is everything that makes me feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
The cities grow the rivers flow  
Where you are I'll never know  
But I'm still here  
If you were right and I was wrong  
Why are you the one who's gone  
And I'm still here  
  
I'm still here  
  
You've seen the ashes in my heart  
You smile the widest when I cry inside and my insides blow apart  
I try to wear another face  
Just to make you proud  
Just to make you put me in my place  
  
But everything you wanted from me  
Is everything that I could never be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe tonight it's gonna be alright  
I will get better  
Maybe today it's gonna be okay  
I will remember  
  
I held the pieces of my soul  
I was shattered  
And I wanted you to come and make me whole  
Then I saw you yesterday  
But you didn't notice  
You just walked away  
  
Cause everything you wanted me to hide  
Is everything that makes me feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The lights go out the bridges burn  
Once you go you can't return  
But I'm still here  
Remember how you used to say  
I'd be the one to run away  
But I'm still here  
  
I'm still here
