Sometimes in the morning  
When I wake up I see your face  
But you are in a new life  
In a new love, in a new place  
Oh, the heart holds many hands  
My dear, it's time I let yours go  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I'm fine now, it just took time now  
You can see how much I've grow  
Made room love, for a new love  
Now my feet won't walk alone  
Oh, the heart holds many hands  
My love it's time I let yours go  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Everybody, everybody wants to love  
Everybody, everybody wants to be loved  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
