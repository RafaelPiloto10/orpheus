Right or wrong I'll be with you  
I'll do what you ask me to  
For I believe that I belong  
By your side, right or wrong  
  
Right or wrong it's got to be  
Always you, always me  
Won't you take me along  
To be with you right or wrong?  
  
If it's right for me to love you  
It can't be wrong for me to care  
If you will say you love me  
My life with you I'll share  
  
Right or wrong, day by day  
All my love, all the way  
For I believe that I belong  
By your side, right or wrong
