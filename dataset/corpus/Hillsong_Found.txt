Amazing love  
Now what else shall I need  
Your name brings life  
Its more than the air I breath  
  
My world was changed  
When your life you gave for me  
My purpose found  
And all that you want for me  
  
And Ive found myself in you  
And Ive found myself in you  
  
Take me to a place  
Where I can see you face to face  
And all I want to do  
All I want to do  
Is worship you
