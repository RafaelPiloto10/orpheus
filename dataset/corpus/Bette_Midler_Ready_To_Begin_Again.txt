When my teeth are rinsed in a glass by my bed,  
And my hair lies somewhere in a drawer,  
You know, the world doesn't seem like a very nice place,  
Not a very nice place anymore.  
  
But I put in my teeth, and I slap on my hair  
And a strange thing occurs when I do,  
My teeth start to feel like my very own teeth  
And my hair like my very own too.  
  
And I'm ready to begin again.  
Ready to begin again.  
Reachin' for the soap,  
My heart is full o' hope  
Again, again.  
  
Ready to begin again!  
Looking fresh and bright I trust.  
Ready to begin again,  
As everybody must.
