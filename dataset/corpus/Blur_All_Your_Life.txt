Put a new T-shirt on, wash my face in beer  
Fall through the crowd and disappear  
In the teenage magazines and shopping malls  
Walk through the wildlife for miles and miles  
  
Hold my breath and count a hundred and ten  
And back up the hill to start again  
Watching spiders on the bedroom ceiling  
They got big plans so they're not breathing  
  
Feel the frisson of tomorrow today  
I could get up but it won't go away  
Do nothing to impress my friends  
Just rub my eyes for hours on end  
  
Oh England, my love, you lost me, made me look a fool  
I need someone to tell me everything'll be alright  
I need someone who'll hold me when the day turns to night  
I need someone who loves me more than you do  
  
Oh we say that's not true  
And you and me in line as double bill  
Surrogate heroes on TV and films  
I've never met anyone like you  
  
I've never done the things you like to do
