Main street U.S.A boarded up and dry  
Knowin' what once was here just makes me want to cry  
Used to be the favorite place  
Now what remains are memories even time cannot erase  
Old man Johnson's store, where we grew up too fast  
All that remains today are echoes from the past  
Used to be a boomin' town  
All that's left is either broken up or broken down  
Singing, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh  
Where we used to belong  
There ain't nobody home  
Said, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh  
You can knock all you want  
But, ain't nobody home  
Packed up, moved away, runnin' from the past  
Leaving behind the dusty dreams and broken glass  
Used to be a busy town  
Now, everybody passes through, but they don't stick around  
  
(Chorus)  
Was a newsstand on the corner  
Right next to the barber shop  
And down the street there  
That's where all the kids would stop  
And they would tease the neighbor's bulldog  
Laugh and run away  
Now, there's no one left who knows the truth in what you say  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Final Chorus)
