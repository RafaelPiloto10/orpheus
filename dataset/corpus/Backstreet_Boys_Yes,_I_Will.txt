I open my eyes  
I see your face  
I cannot hide, I can't erase  
The way you make me feel inside  
You complete me  
Girl that's why  
  
Somethin' about you makes me feel  
Baby my heart wants to reveal  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm asking you  
These three words I want to hear from you  
  
[Chorus]  
Yes I will  
Take your hand and walk with you  
Yes I will  
It's these three words that promise to  
Yes I will  
Give you everything you need  
And someday start a family with you  
Yes I will  
Take your hand and walk with you  
Yes I will  
Baby I promise you  
Yes I will  
Give you everything you need  
And someday start a family with you (a family)  
Oh yes I will (oh baby)  
  
This is no ordinary love  
And I can never have enough (I can't enough of)  
Of all the things you've given to me  
You're my heart, my soul, my everything  
  
Every night I thank you lord (I thank you lord)  
For giving me the strength  
To love her more and more  
Each day I promise her  
As long as I hear those three words  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I stand beside you  
In everything you do (yes I do)  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Baby I'll be there  
Oh baby I'll be there (I'll be there for you)  
  
As God as my witness (God as my witness)  
I will carry this through (I will carry this through)  
To kept to what's promised  
What's promised to you  
(I promised you)  
  
Yes I will  
Take your hand and walk with you  
Yes I will  
Baby baby baby I promise you  
Yes I will  
Give you everything you need  
And start a family with you (oh I will)  
Yes I will (oh yeah)  
Yes I will (oh yeah)  
Yes I will  
I promise you  
That everything's gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)  
I will
