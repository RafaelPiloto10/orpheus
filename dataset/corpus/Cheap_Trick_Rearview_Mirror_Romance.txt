I'm movin' I'm feeling like I'm rollin' on my own (what could be better)  
Then somewhere drivin' my car the radio turn it on (what could be better)  
I check around in traffic from my point of view (what could be better)  
Then I saw her in the mirror  
Maybe the same thing has happened to you  
It was  
  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didn't know her but it didn't matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight  
It's a rear view romance tonight  
  
She pulled up close first glance I saw here eyes (what could be better)  
I couldn't stop starin' at her she didn't realize (what could be better)  
Then looked up in the mirror smile on her faace  
There she goes heaven knows  
Maybe the same thing has happened to you  
  
It was  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didn't know her but it didn't matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight  
It's a rear view romance tonight  
  
There she goes heaven knows  
I want to meet her all alone  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Romance after just one look  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
I didn't know her but it didn't matter  
Romance in a rear view mirror  
Just by chance I still can't believe that it's true love reflected sight  
  
It's a rear view romance tonight
