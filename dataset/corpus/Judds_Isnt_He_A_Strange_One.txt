I want to tell 'bout my lover  
And I want to tell you 'bout my best friend  
Compared to all the others  
He's a little bit different  
A friend saw him on the town  
Said he was turnin' all the pretty girls down  
She said, "You really should be proud of him."  
  
[Chorus]  
Isn't he a strange one?  
He thinks comin' on to me is a whole lot of fun  
He doesn't want anybody else but me  
Isn't he a strange one?  
He thinks I hung the moon  
He's pretty sure I was the one  
And I'm glad he'll never be  
  
A stranger to me  
I know he's one in a million  
When he says I'm the one that he's dreamin' of  
I hope he doesn't wake up anytime soon  
From this honeymoon  
My girlfriends are turnin' green with envy  
They want to know are there anymore at home like him  
Cupid must be really watchin' over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I' m glad he'll never be  
A stranger to me  
Isn't he a strange one?  
Isn't he a strange one?
