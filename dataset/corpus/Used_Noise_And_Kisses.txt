Look in my eyes  
I'm jaded now whatever that means  
By sharing these things  
I rip my heart out  
It's worth my time  
Whatever that means  
Hard to see up  
My neck feels stiff until I wake up  
The orange I choked  
And back to my neck  
It's worth my time  
Whatever that means, so  
  
Share with me  
Cause I need it right now  
Let me see your insides  
Or write me off  
Cause I'd rather stop now  
If you won't open up  
  
Give it to me  
Give me all, whatever you want  
It's never been me  
To want this much from you  
I can see  
It tears me up
