Mama's revolution has all gone into black  
Sin through seven deadly holes, lines up behind your back  
I do enjoy your company, we travel in a pack  
Bloodstains and scars the badges of the green and black  
  
You and me  
Eternity  
You and me  
Forever we... Fly  
  
Hey maybe you're a minute away  
You can't get her with nothing to say  
And Once you're in, you're never going back  
Hey maybe you just don't care  
You can't get here and you can't get there  
Once you're gone, you're never going back  
The green and black  
  
Filthy, little secrets, hide inside your head  
Right behind your values, kept until you're dead  
I do enjoy the language, nor understand what's said  
I fill the holes with madness, green and black and red  
  
Shock  
We get to slipping away  
You get the breakdown  
We get the joke of the day  
You get the shakedown  
Shock, blind, run and  
Give it a play  
Load ten ton and  
Slipping away  
We get the slipping away  
But you get the meltdown  
Come on slipping away  
Give me the breakdown  
Slipping away
