Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the sea  
Flowing in and out of me  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the day  
First it comes, then it rolls away  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the wind  
Blowing hard on everything  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the rain  
Beating on your window brain  
Maya Love, Maya Love,  
Maya Love is like the stream  
Flowing through this cosmic dream
