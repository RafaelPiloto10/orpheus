(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.  
  
Yes, we had it all, had the key gripped in our hands.  
We could see the fall as a martyr understands.  
When the chorus calls there's no room for hope inside.  
Lose it all when the scream subsides.  
  
(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.  
  
Yes, we took the role of the lovers and the friends,  
And we played the parts 'til the words came to an end.  
But the tongues were tied in the passion and the pride.  
Wasted all when the scream subsides.  
  
(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.
