I can't kiss the telephone, I can't hug your picture  
And these postcards just remind me how far away you are  
There's two thousand miles of highway lyin' between us  
But the way I feel tonight it doesn't seem like all that far  
  
'Cause when I get home  
I know the first thing we're gonna do  
When I get home  
I'm gonna turn my body loose on you  
It's been so long, I've been so true  
I want you when I get home  
  
If I could I'd order you for breakfast every morning  
There'd be a headline story about you in my USA Today  
Every in-flight movie'd feature you and all your glory  
And into your friendly skies, this airplane would carry me away  
  
'Cause when I get home  
I know the first thing we're gonna do  
  
Now you could move and leave no forwarding address  
You could be living on the moon  
But I know just where you are, I don't have to guess  
You're waiting up for me and praying that I'll be home safe and soon  
  
'Cus when I get home  
I know the first thing we're gonna do
