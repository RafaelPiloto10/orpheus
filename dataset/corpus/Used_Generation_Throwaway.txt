Whoa  
Generation throwaway  
Whoa  
Generation throwaway  
  
Get caught as we dig in the dirt  
While the pretty ones climb the trees with the keys to the gate  
Get caught as we're making it worse  
As we break our backs, we barely notice the pain  
  
Yeah, we're taking it back  
  
We're only moments away  
Brave enough to break these barricades  
It starts today  
We're not generation throwaway  
Everything is fine  
We're not, not afraid of glory  
Moments away  
We're not generation throwaway  
  
Throw back what we're trying to change  
While the pretty ones climb the trees, we're not willing to beg  
Play dead as we're digging a hole  
Then they're never gonna realize until the day we've escaped  
  
Yeah, we're taking it back  
  
We're only moments away  
Brave enough to break these barricades  
It starts today  
We're not generation throwaway  
Everything is fine  
We're not, not afraid of glory  
Moments away  
We're not generation throwaway  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
  
You can tell that we're taking it back  
You can tell that we're taking it back  
You can tell that we're taking it back  
That we're taking it back, taking it back  
  
You can tell that we're taking it back  
You can tell that we're taking it back  
You can tell that we're taking it back  
That we're taking it back, taking it back  
  
We're only moments away  
Brave enough to break these barricades  
It starts today  
We're not generation throwaway  
Everything is fine  
We're not, not afraid of glory  
Moments away  
We're not generation throwaway  
  
Whoa  
Generation throwaway  
Whoa  
Generation throwaway
