I admire you from afar  
You've changed the way I see  
I used to think that I  
Should make you be like me  
But after this short time  
Watching what you do  
I realize that I  
Should strive to be like you  
Whenever I am near you  
I tread so awkwardly  
Afraid someone may steal you  
I guard you jealously  
  
Then sing the world your praises  
Let everybody know  
That I just saw the future  
A place I want to go

But after this short time  
Watching what you do  
I realize that I  
Should strive to be like you  
  
I hear you when you're talking  
Untouched simplicity  
Alive with expectations  
In search of what might be
