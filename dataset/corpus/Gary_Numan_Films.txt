I don't like the film  
I don't like the film  
Play it all back  
Play it all back  
  
And I don't like the scenery  
And I don't like the set so  
Pull it all down  
Pull it all down  
  
But I like the actors  
And I like the show  
  
We're so exposed  
We're so exposed  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen  
  
Don't let them see  
Don't let them know  
And you wonder why  
And you wonder why  
  
Turn off the lights  
And turn off the sound
