Captain midnight and Captain cruise  
Out on the ocean  
Like a storm of bad news  
It took three monkeys in a plastic mac  
To fit inside a paper sack  
And they're cooking up an alibi  
Cooking up some steam  
Out in the madness  
Somewhere in Orleans  
They had a plan,  
They had a plot  
Beggars and blues was all they got  
Black cold coffee  
Black Irish soup  
Cold on a silver spoon  
She's dancing through hoops  
Baby's wishing on a wishing well  
She's moving up  
And ringing her bell  
Can't fly to heaven  
On a persian rug  
So put some coins in the old sailor mug  
They travelled up together  
From the coast  
East of Aldgate  
Silently like ghosts  
They had a scam,  
They had a scheme  
For drunks and bums counting beans  
Black cold coffee  
Black Irish soup  
Cold on a silver spoon  
She's dancing through hoops  
Solo  
Black cold coffee  
Black Irish soup  
Cold on a silver spoon  
She's dancing through hoops
