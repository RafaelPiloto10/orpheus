Well it's rainin' down in Houston  
And I got holes in both my shoes  
Baby's put me on the street  
She says "I'm through with you"  
  
She thinks I'm gonna miss her  
Someone tell her that she's wrong  
I'm goin' back to Oklahoma, boys  
'Cause that's where I belong  
  
I need one good ride  
I'll be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
She'll be comin' into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
Well now I don't need no Texas girl  
Doggin' me around  
I may be a Okie, son  
But I've still been to town  
  
Well those Oklahoma city girls  
They always treat you right  
Well tell mama that I'm comin' home (not sure of this line...)  
And I'm leavin' out tonight  
  
I need one good ride  
I'll be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
She'll be comin' into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
So with two bucks in my pocket  
And my thumb stuck in the wind  
When I cross Red River, boys  
I won't be back again  
  
Give me old back roads and truck stops  
And 18 wheels that whine  
And some good ol' boy to take me  
To that Oklahoma line  
  
I need one good ride  
I'll be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
She'll be comin' into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
I caught one good ride  
She's comin' into sight  
Hello Oklahoma borderline
