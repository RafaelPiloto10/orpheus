I can't believe it's true, I can't believe that you  
Don't want me anymore  
You're with him and you don't even know  
  
That I've been dying all day long  
And singing sad, sad songs  
And wishing you were gone  
  
Ha, is this love?  
Oh, is this love?  
Is this love?  
Or should I close the door?  
  
Yea, my eyes are burning in my head  
And seeing only red  
And wishing you were dead  
  
Is this love?  
Oh, is this love?  
Is this love?  
Oh, no is this love? I don't thing so  
Is this love?  
Or should I  
Or should I, should I  
Should I close the door?  
Should I close the door? Aah, I fooled myself  
Yea, alright, okay  
  
Is this love? Tell me  
Is this love? I don't thing so  
(Is this love?)  
Is this love?  
Oh, no is this love?  
Is this love?  
Or should I  
Or should I  
Or should I, should I  
Should I close the door?
