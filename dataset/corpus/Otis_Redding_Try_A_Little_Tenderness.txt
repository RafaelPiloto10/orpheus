(This is for you) Ooh she may be weary  
And them young girls they do get weary  
Wearing that same old shaggy dress  
But when they get weary  
(You gotta) Try a little tenderness  
  
(Tell you, might not believe it, but)  
You know she's waiting  
Just anticipating  
The thing that she'll never, never, possess,no,no  
But while (all the time) she's without it  
Go to her and try just a little bit of tenderness  
(That's all you gentlemen gotta do)  
  
Oh, but its one thing  
It might be a bit sentimental yeah, yeah  
She has - her grieves and care  
But the soft words (they) are spoken so gentle  
Yeah  
But, oh, that makes it, makes it easier to bear, yeah  
  
You won't regret it  
No no,  
Them young girls they don't forget it  
(Cause) Love is their whole, whole happiness yes, yes, yeah  
  
And its all so easy  
Come on and try  
Try a little tenderness  
Yeah try  
Just keep on trying  
  
You've got to love her  
Squeeze her  
Don't tease her make love (Get to her)  
Hold her tight  
Just, just try a little tenderness  
That's all you gotta do  
You've gotta hold her tight  
  
One more time  
You've got to love her  
Hold her, don't tease her  
Never leave her  
Make love to her  
Hold her, man  
  
Try a little tenderness  
(Just one time) God have mercy now  
  
All you've gotta do  
Love her  
You've gotta hold her  
Don't squeeze her  
Never leave her why  
You gotta now,now,now  
  
Watch it, tell everybody

You gotta make love  
Don't tease her  
Never leave her  
Rub her down  
Smooth her, soothe her  
Move her

Try some tenderness
