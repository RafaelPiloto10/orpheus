Resident mockery give us an hour for magic  
We of the purple glove  
We of the starling flight and velvet hour  
We of Arabic pleasure's breed  
We of sundome and the night  
  
Give us creed to believe nights of lust  
Give us trust in The Night  
Give of color hundred hues a rich mandala for me and for you  
And for your silky pillowed house a head, wisdom  
And a bed  
Troubled decree resident mockery has claimed thee  
  
We used to believe in the good old days  
We still receive In little ways  
The things of Kindness  
And unsporting brow  
Forget and allow
