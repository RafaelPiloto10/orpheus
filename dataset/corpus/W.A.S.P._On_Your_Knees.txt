Dancing with danger right until dawn  
The sin that you buy and you sell  
Mom and daddy said "the life that you've led,  
You'll party you're way straight to hell"  
  
On Your knees,You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
And I need you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
  
Playing with fire, lust in you burns  
Reflecting the flames in your eyes  
Sex and pain insane, they're really the same  
Misused and confused, bound and tied  
  
On Your knees,You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
And I need you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
  
On your knees that's where you all shall be  
Well I bid you come taste your first deadly sin  
Riding the wild wind and the door to submission  
Will open and you shall fall in  
  
On Your knees,You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
And I need you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
  
On your kneesOn your knees  
On your knees  
On your knees
