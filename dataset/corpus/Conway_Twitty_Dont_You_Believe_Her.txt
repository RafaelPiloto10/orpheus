She can give you a reason to live if she wants to  
She can make you forget other loves that you've known  
She has two lips and two arms that thrill you as bad if you do  
And if you want her to give them to you she will  
  
Don't you believe her I did and soon she'll be leaving me  
Don't you believe her I did and soon she'll be leaving you  
  
She can tell you a lie you'll believe if she has to  
And you'll trust her till time and tie both stands still  
She can cry on your shoulder and swear to the things that she won't do  
Ah but be careful cause when you're not looking she will  
Don't you believe her  
Don't you believe her
