(Tiffany, J. Brooks)  
Scarlet red  
Drips from my veins  
What's wrong with me  
That I imagine such things  
And if only for a moment  
Let there be peace  
And how can I  
Live with this pain  
I don't have the strength  
To conquer this shame  
And if only for a moment  
Let there be peace  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
If only  
Tell me why  
I'm left here alone  
I search for your voice  
But I should've known  
That if only for a moment  
You'd be with me  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
If only I could change the way  
You were torn away from me  
I would never let you go  
I'd burn away the plans we made  
Pretending to believe  
That I am not afraid  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
If only
