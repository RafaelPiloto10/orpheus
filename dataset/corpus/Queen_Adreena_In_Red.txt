i wreck your bed  
the colour is honey  
your finger prints marking my wall  
in red  
i take a light plex  
put it around your kneck  
i turn it on a choking blue  
fire in your eyes  
in red  
make me confess  
shut your mouth  
rip my dress  
don't ever protest that you don't  
want this mess  
don't even pretend that i  
could be your friend  
i climb the walls  
knuckles are bleeding  
throw me down  
push my face into the fire  
you liar  
your crossed the line  
you're tripping on guilty  
i undermine  
your girlfriend and you in the pyre  
you liar
