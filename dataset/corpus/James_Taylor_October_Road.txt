Well I'm a going back down  
Maybe one more time,  
Deep down home,  
October road.  
And I might like to see  
That little friend of mine  
That I left behind  
Once upon a time.  
Oh, promised land  
And me still standing,  
It's a test of time,  
It's a real good sign.  
  
Let the sun run down  
Right behind the hill,  
I know how to stand there  
Still till the moon rise up  
Right behind the pine,  
Oh, Lord,  
October road.  
  
Let the sun run down  
Right behind the hill,  
I know how to stand there  
Still till the moon rise up  
Right behind the pine,  
Oh, Lord,  
October road.  
  
It's the big time life  
That I can't abide,  
Raise my rent,  
Tan my hide.  
Sweet call of  
The countryside,  
Go down slow, open wide  
I did my time  
And it changed my mind,  
I'm satisfied, oh.  
I got so low down,  
Fed up, my God,  
I could hardly move.  
Won't you come on, my brother,  
Get on up  
And help me find my groove.  
  
Keep me walking,  
October road.  
Keep me walking  
In the sunshine, yeah  
A little friend of mine,  
October road.  
Keep me walking,  
October road.  
Keep me walking  
In the sunshine, yeah.  
A little friend of mine,  
October road,  
Help me now.
