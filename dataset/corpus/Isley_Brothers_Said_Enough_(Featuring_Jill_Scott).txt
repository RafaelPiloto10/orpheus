[Jill:]  
There's so many things I want to say baby  
So many words, oh (well well well)  
Oh, you know what I mean?  
(oh I know, I know)  
  
Loving you is easy  
Loving you is like breathing  
Winter winter spring natural food  
Ever loose ya  
Loving you is righteous  
Ever green light just  
Shines bright (oh yeah)  
When I'm with you  
Ooh there's so much I want to say  
Baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
[B:] Said enough  
[J:] I just want you to know  
[B:] Said enough  
[J:] So much I want to say  
[B:] Said enough  
[J:] I love  
[B:] Said enough  
  
[Ron:]  
Loving you, loving you is like  
Sweeter than candy  
Feels like I'm in heaven  
Sweet like a morning kiss, oh  
Loving you is so beautiful, baby  
Loving you is food for my soul  
Baby you know, you know, you know  
Oh what I'm trying to say girl  
I gotta let you know just what I feel  
  
[Both:] Said enough  
Repeat above while:  
  
[R:] Gotta let you know what I feel  
[J:] Gotta let you know my heart, baby  
[R:] Gotta let you know what's in my heart  
[J:] I want you to know just what I'm thinking  
[R:] Oh, you know what I'm thinking  
[J:] I want you to know  
[R:] Oh, I think I said  
[J:] I got to let you know  
[R:] Gotta let you know, you know babe  
[J:] Your love, your love  
[R:] My baby, my baby  
[J:] So so in love  
[R:] So good, you're so good baby  
[J:] Baby what I'm thinking, there's nothing  
[R:] Nothing in this world  
[J:] In this world that could take what we have away  
[R:] That would take what we have away  
[R:] Oh no no  
[J:] Nothing  
[R:] Nothing  
[J:] Nothing  
[R:] Nothing  
[J:] Nothing left to say  
[R:] Nothing left to say  
[J:] I said  
[R:] You said  
[J:] Nothing left to say  
[R:] No no no no no, nothing baby  
Said enough  
You said and I said and we said  
Oh you said  
All I need to know girl  
That's all I need to know baby  
No no no no no no no no  
  
[Jill:]  
You know what I'm talking about  
I might just shut my mouth  
  
[Chorus till fade]
