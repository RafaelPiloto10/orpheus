Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
The moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
'Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
And I only have eyes for you  
  
Yeah, are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
Babe, the moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
'Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
Oh, baby, I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
  
Maybe a million people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
Yes, mama, I only have eyes for you
