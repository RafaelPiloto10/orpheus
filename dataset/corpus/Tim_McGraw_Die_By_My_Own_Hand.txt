Sex and the city and Indian food,  
I never tried 'em, not until you,  
But lord it's lookin' like you left me with some habits I can't break.  
I feel kinda guilty whenever I cuss  
I lay in bed at night and I think about us  
Maybe it's because of all the love you taught me how to make  
  
You changed me, baby  
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin' to love a music man  
Don't worry, honey  
I understand why you went runnin' from me  
I guess, I really should have seen it comin'  
I'll always die by my own hand  
  
Ran into your daddy last Saturday night  
I had to admit it he might have been right  
Oh, all the times he told me that you're just too good for me  
  
You changed me, baby  
And given enough time, girl, you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin' to love a music man  
Don't worry, honey  
I understand why you went runnin' from me  
I guess, I really should have seen it comin'  
I'll always die by my own hand

Girl, I don't blame you for nothin'  
I'll always die by my own hand
