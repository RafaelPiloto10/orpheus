Not everybody knows which way the river flows  
Not everybody sees the sun up in the sky  
Maybe you and I should not try to plan our lives  
If only what we could see what we hold in our hands  
  
Love hurts 'cause you can't let it go  
Love hurts 'cause you need it so  
Love hurts yes it hurts, but it's good for fools  
Love hurts every night and day  
Love feelings never go away  
Real love, it is here to stay with you  
Yes it's true  
  
Everybody cries until the day they die  
And everybody feels like they're the only one  
Maybe you and I should not try to plan our lives  
If only we could see what's in front of our eyes, yeah  
  
Love hurts 'cause you can't let it go  
Love hurts 'cause you need it so  
Love hurts yes it hurts, ooh yeah  
Love hurts every night and day  
Love feelings never go away  
Real love, it is here to stay with you  
Yes it's true  
  
Maybe you and I should not try to plan our lives  
If only we could see what's in front of our eyes  
  
Love hurts 'cause you can't let it go  
Love hurts 'cause you need it so  
Love hurts yes it hurts, but it's good for fools  
Love hurts every night and day  
Love feelings never go away  
Real love, it is here to stay with you  
Yes it's true  
  
I guess it's useless to say, love hurts  
Why won't this pain go away, love hurts  
Love hurts  
  
Love hurts 'cause you can't let it go  
Love hurts 'cause you need it so  
Love hurts yes it hurts, ooh yeah  
Love hurts every night and day  
Love feelings never go away  
Real love, it is here to stay with you
