[Chorus]  
It takes a little time sometimes  
To get your feet back on the ground  
It takes a little time sometimes  
To get the titanic turned back around  
It takes a little time sometimes  
But baby you're not going down  
It takes more than you've got right now  
Give it time  
  
What's this walking through' my door  
I know I've seen the look before  
Sometimes in faces on the street  
Sometimes in the mirror looking back at me  
You can't fix this pain with money  
You can't rush a weary soul  
You can't sweep it under the rug, now honey  
It don't take a lot to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it may not be over by morning  
But Rome wasn't built in a day  
You can name this thing a thousand times  
But it won't make it go away  
Let me put my arms around you  
And hold you while you weep  
We've been talking and talking  
I'm sick of this talk  
And it's nothing that won't keep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No you can't fix this pain with money  
You can't rush a weary soul  
You can't sweep it under the rug now honey  
It don't take a lot to know  
  
[Chorus]
