So many tech-heads  
Recent invasion  
I stretch out my long legs  
And I kick away the mouse pad, baby  
  
Amazon, eBay, Oracle, he say  
He promise a freebee  
But he's such a pokey little guy  
Wait, I hear big footsteps  
  
Thud, thumping out of the past  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
Cyberman lights up  
  
But mostly he floppy  
Computer man crashes  
He's so humpty dumpty, baby  
Now he tries this experiment  
  
Though he knows it's so low-tech  
He tries patting his forehead  
While he's rub, rub, rubbing my stomach, baby  
But he can't do it, can he?  
  
No, no he can't do that at all  
But wait, I hear big footsteps  
Thud, thumbing out of the past  
Sure enough, that big dumb guy  
  
Is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
Big papa bear  
Maybe you can remember  
  
It wasn't that long ago  
When you dialed a number  
You got a living, breathing human being  
On the telephone  
  
Don't want nothing to do  
But just study the skin on your face  
I want to look up at the sky  
And watch the sunset  
  
With someone like you  
Wait, I hear big footsteps  
Thud, thumbing out of the past  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here, he's here  
In fact he's brought his  
Big raccoon coat with him  
  
And he doesn't even know it's  
Politically incorrect  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
I see him now walking torward me  
  
Let's get it on with your big bad self  
Get it on babe, Get it on babe  
Get it on babe, Get it on babe  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
  
Big, big, big, big, big  
Big dumb guy  
Oh, ha - smartest guy  
I ever knew yeah  
  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
Kiss me, kiss me now  
If feels so good  
I don't want to have to go into those chat rooms anymore  
  
I don't want to see that pinwheel go round  
And around and around  
Every time I try to open any window  
Hold me, you big dumb guy  
You smart guy
