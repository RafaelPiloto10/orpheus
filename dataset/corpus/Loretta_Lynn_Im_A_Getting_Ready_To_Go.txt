I get down on my knees everyday and I pray  
These tears I'm a cryin' are tears of joy cause it wash my sins away  
I'm a livin' for the Lord and I want everybody to know  
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go  
Yeah I'm a gettin' ready to go to a place called heaven  
I'm gonna praise my Saviour's name everyday that I'm livin'  
Glory hallelujah I'm not ashamed to let the salvation show  
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go  
[ piano ]  
I'm gonna walkin' there with Jesus and my God  
I wanna know everything'sa gonna be alright when they lay me under to sod  
When he gathers his sheep I wanna be as white as snow  
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go  
Yeah I'm a gettin' ready to go...  
This old world's just my dressin' room and I'm a gettin' ready to go
