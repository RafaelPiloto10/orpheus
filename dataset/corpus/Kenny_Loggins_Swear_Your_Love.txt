I got a letter from my love, It said exactly what I'm thinking of  
no words can say, Well darling I'll find away  
You see your diamond ring, I' here to say that doesn't mean a thing  
Without your love, And if that's all we got then take it off take it off  
  
Swear your love say you don't need no diamond baby  
If some piece of papers keepin us together I ain't buyin it baby  
Swear your love all your really got after it's said and done  
is what you tell each other when it's one on one  
Darlin won't you swear your love  
  
I know a lady in spokane, She thought that happiness would find her when she  
caught a man, security second-hand  
She got her diamond ring It's sad to say that was the only thing  
I guess she forgot, you gotta believe enough to swear your love  
  
Swear your love say your're with me forever baby  
No legal paper pressure from your friends will ever keep us together  
Swear your love thats the way to hold on babe  
Promise me you'll be my only lady, Darling won't you swear your love  
  
This ain't no ticket out , Is that what you think our love is about?  
Think twice before you call, Girl get it straight or don't get it at all  
Swear your love swear you love
