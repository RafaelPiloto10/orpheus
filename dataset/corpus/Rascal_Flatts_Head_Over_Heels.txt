Sitting here with you  
You ask me why my tongue is tied  
I've tried to make some since of all these things I feel inside  
I've been searching for the perfect words to say  
They've been said a thousand times  
But they mean more today  
  
'Cause I'm head over heels for you  
And all of the things you do  
The heavens and earth have moved  
I'm falling head over heels for you  
  
So baby there it is I've let it go and now you know  
It's funny how a feeling starts so small and starts to grow  
I had every line rehearsed I'd say to you today  
Then you looked into my eyes and they just slipped away  
  
'Cause I'm head over heels for you  
And all of the things you do  
The heavens and earth have moved  
I'm falling, head over heels for you  
  
Head over heels heart over mind you've got me body and soul  
I've never dreamed in a million years I'd lose complete control  
  
I'm head over heels for you  
And all of the things you do  
The heavens and earth have moved  
I'm falling head over heels for you  
Head over heels for you  
I'm falling head over heels for you  
Oooo ohh I'm falling  
Mmmm I'm falling
