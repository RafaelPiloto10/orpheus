I thought I had a girl  
I know because I seen her.  
Her hair was golden brown  
Blowin' free like a cornfield.  
  
She was far away  
I found it hard to reach her.  
She told me you can try  
But it's impossible to find her.  
  
In my dreams everything was all right  
In your schemes you can only try.  
  
I thought I had a girl  
I know because I seen her.  
Her hair was golden brown Yea  
Blowin' free like a cornfield.
