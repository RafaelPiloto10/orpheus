With stocking face I bought a gun  
The plan was set the plan was done  
Looked at my watch and started for the door  
Now the food here ain't so good no more  
And they closed the package store  
  
[Chorus]  
Love your mama, love your brother  
Love 'em till they run for cover  
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on  
Cry a jag on me  
  
Oh Michael Oh Jesus you know I'm not to blame  
You know my reputation for playing a good clean game  
Oh Michael Oh Jesus I'll keep my promise when  
You turn that heartbeat over again  
  
My poison's named you know my brand  
So please make mine a double, Sam  
Stir it up nice I'll eat it right here  
This highway runs from Paraguay  
And I've just come all the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We warned the corpse of William Wright  
Not to cuss and drink all night  
Ticket in hand I saw him laid to rest  
But zombie see and zombie do  
He's here with me and you  
  
[Chorus]
