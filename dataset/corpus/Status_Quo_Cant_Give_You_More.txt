Now you know this ain't the kind of life for you  
It's not the way you thought that it would be  
If I could change my way to you  
If I could change, it wouldn't be me  
And you see  
  
I know I never tried the things I should have done  
Oh and time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When I'm so low, when I'm so high  
Yet you cry when I say I can't give you more  
  
First you said you'd never try to slow me down  
That ev'rything would work out really fine  
But as those walls closed in on us  
Your words just fell right out of line  
And behind  
  
I know I never tried the things I should have done  
And time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When I'm so low, when I'm so high  
Yet you cry when I say I can't give you more  
  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
Can't give any more  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
Ain't got any more  
  
Did you figure ours would be an easy thing  
Like lazy days of lying in the sun  
I told you if you wanted me  
That ev'ry day just wouldn't be fun  
Now it's done  
  
I know I never tried the thing I should have done  
And time is always passing by  
I want to do the things I never done before  
So I do try not to tell a lie  
When I'm so low, when I'm so high  
Yet you cry when I say I can't give you more  
  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
Can't give you more  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
I ain't got any more  
Oh, oh, oh, I ain't got any more  
I ain't got any more  
Oh, oh, oh, can't give you more  
I ain't got any more
