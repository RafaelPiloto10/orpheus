Blue Spanish eyes  
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes  
Please, please don't cry  
  
This is just adios and not goodbye  
Soon I'll return  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si, si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
  
Blue Spanish eyes  
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico  
True Spanish eyes  
  
Please smile at me once more before I go  
Soon I'll return  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si, si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
