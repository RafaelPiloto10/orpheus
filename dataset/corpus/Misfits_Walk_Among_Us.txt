They'll find pieces of you  
Scattered on the ground  
I am the mad man in your dreams  
We are the evil ones  
  
We need the planet to demonstrate  
We want your body to incubate  
Begin the breeding of an alien superior race  
That in which will ultimately dominate  
  
Give into what you cannot fight  
Walk among us  
Whoa-oh  
Walk among us  
  
The abductions have already begun  
All around us we've infected someone you love  
Initiate the start of an alien war  
We've already won  
  
Give into what you cannot fight  
Walk among us  
Whoa-oh  
Walk among us  
Whoa-oh  
Walk among us  
Whoa-oh  
Walk among us
