you think you know just what it means to be alone you think you've suffered
for your cause you're wrong i don't really need to know what makes you tick or
what you think is right i don't want to know the reason you believe right now
you're like the others your thoughts are not your own try thinking for
yourself and act on what you know still you try to defend these things you
were taught you've got to try to change the way you learn sometimes it feels
just like i've burned every single bridge that i have ever crossed i always
try to learn from all of these mistakes mistakes that i have made but pride is
a worthy adversary in the struggle for yourself
