Hey come old Blackeye  
He's looking for me again  
He's got a hard head  
He's always stinkin' of gin  
If he thinks he owns me  
He better think again  
He likes to hurt me  
He don't love me at all  
He never phones me  
He's never there when I call  
He's a low down dirty dog  
It's time I leave him that's all  
Bye bye Blackeye  
He's a low down dirty dog  
I don't need him at all  
(Hey watch what I'm saying man!?)  
Hey where you goin' Blackeye ?  
When will you win?  
You still got your shoulder holster  
You still packin' yo' little friend  
Well one thing's for certain  
You're never gonna wipe that smile off my face again  
Oh yeah
