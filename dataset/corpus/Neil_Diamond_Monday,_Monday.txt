Monday, Monday  
So good to me  
Monday morning,  
It was all I hoped it would be  
  
Oh, Monday morning  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Monday, Monday  
Can't trust that day  
Monday, Monday  
Sometimes it just turns out that way  
  
Oh, Monday morning  
You gave me no warning  
Of what was to be  
Oh, Monday, Monday  
  
How could you leave and not take me  
Every other day  
Every other day,  
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying all of the time  
Monday, Monday  
  
So good to me  
Monday morning  
It was all I hoped it would be  
Oh, Monday morning  
  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying all of the time  
Monday, Monday  
  
Can't trust that day  
Monday, Monday  
Turns out that way  
Monday, Monday
