Well I chased her down the alley  
And over the hill to steal her will  
She was as hot as Georgia asphalt  
When the A crowd came to adore her brain  
  
So leave Virginia alone  
Leave Virginia alone  
She's not like you and me  
She's not like you and me  
  
You should've seen her back in the city  
Poetry and jewels, broke all the rules  
She was as high as a Georgia pine tree  
Makeup and pills, overdue bills  
  
So leave Virginia alone  
Leave Virginia alone  
She's not like you and me  
She's not like you and me  
  
Some sunny day when the hands of time  
Have had their way  
You'll understand why it was so hard to run away  
  
She's a loser she's a forgiver  
But she still finds good where no one could  
You ought to want her more than money  
Cadillacs and rust diamonds and dust  
So leave Virginia alone  
  
Leave Virginia alone  
She's not like you and me  
She's not like you and me  
So leave Virginia alone  
  
Leave Virginia alone  
She's not like you and me  
She's not like you and me
