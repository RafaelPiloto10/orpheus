I'm not the same man  
I was a while ago  
I've learned some new things,  
I hope that it shows.  
  
I'm free to give my love,  
But you're not the one  
I'm thinking of,  
So for me  
The wheels are turning  
Got to keep  
The homefires burning.  
  
I'll walk these borders  
In search of a line,  
Between young lovers  
Who live separate lives.  
  
How long can this go on?  
I can hear another song,  
Late at night  
When I've been drinking  
Substitute comes at me winking.
