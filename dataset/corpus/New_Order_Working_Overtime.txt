Who's that over there  
Looks like he don't care  
Almost lost his mind  
Too much working overtime  
  
Gotta get out every night  
City gates are open wide  
Gotta get away from here  
Take that car and push that gear  
  
He don't need no one  
He's the rising sun  
He won't shed no tears  
Got no time to break down here  
  
Hey  
  
He's going nowhere fast  
Just a piece of dirty trash  
All alone, by his self  
He don't need nobody else  
  
Walking down the street  
So much going on  
People everywhere  
Look at him but they don't care  
  
See that world out there  
Make it go away  
You can't change his mind  
Too much working overtime  
  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime  
  
He crossed that picket line  
In trouble all the time  
Where did it all go wrong  
House music all night long  
  
All those girls out there  
Looking for the one  
Do they really care  
Could they just be having fun  
  
He did all he could  
Tried to get it right  
Somewhere he went wrong  
Too much working overtime  
  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime
