On an' on, the road goes on,  
An' it'll go on forever,  
Time will show if you and I  
Will walk that road together  
Through fire an' water, ice an' snow,  
Heaven above us, an' hell below,  
Holding on, trying to walk the line  
With sweet temptation running close behind  
  
I'm talking 'bout love  
Ooh, love  
  
Like a fire forever burning,  
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more  
A love to keep us warm  
On the wings of the storm  
  
Everyday an' every night  
I keep hoping it'll be all right,  
Trying to leave the past behind,  
Still looking for some peace of mind  
But, destiny brought us together  
An' promised us a time that would last forever  
Tho' it's all been said before  
It's the kind of love worth fighting for  
  
I'm talking about love  
Ooh, love  
  
Like a fire forever burning,  
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more  
A love to keep you warm  
On the wings of the storm  
  
On an' on, the road goes on,  
An' it'll go on forever,  
Time will show if you and I  
Will walk that road together  
  
I'm talking about love  
Ooh, love  
  
Like a fire forever burning,  
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more  
A love to keep us warm  
On the wings of the storm  
My love will keep you warm  
On the wings of the storm
