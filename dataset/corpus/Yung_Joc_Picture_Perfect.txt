[Background] Uhhhhhyeeaaah  
[Joc's Dad] Everything that glitters ain't gold baby  
[Yung Joc] I hear ya Daddy  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
I'm choppin 24's  
Blowin good dro  
Yeah, I got plenty Hoes  
Life ain't picture perfect  
Yeah ya see the ice  
And I dress nice  
Make 'em look twice  
Life ain't picture perfect  
  
Yeah I'm blowin on some good lime  
Skatin on two 85's  
Wouldn't believe half the shit that's skatin through a niggas mind  
745 complimented with leather and wood  
Chickens on my dick 'cause a nigga fresh and smellin good  
Jack boys plottin on my stacks on deck  
Wanna put the Tec to my chest for the ice on my neck  
Oh yeah it's easy to attain it all  
Harder to maintain it all  
If you want a perfect picture only god can paint it dog  
Niggas in these videos with multi-platinum projects  
Can't even get credit cards  
And they Momma stay in projects  
How is that? Scratch my head  
Somethin don't seem right  
Ya teeth full of ice  
So when ya smile I seen lights  
Seems like I'm hatin I'm just statin the facts  
I ain't feelin' to smile in ya face and put a blade in your back  
Now try not to get caught up on the way shit looks  
'Cause everything ain't picture perfect, just listen to the hook  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Yeah I'm off in magic city  
Trickin them ass and titties  
Bitches blowin me kisses makin me wanna hit it  
I must admit, got a good chick and she been holdin me down  
But I ain't fuckin around 'cause there is too much shit goin around  
Like the rims on my pickup  
Scared to get my dick sucked  
Nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup  
Pick up the pieces from the fuckin puzzle  
I'm affiliated with niggas who murder, rob and hustle  
Plus you think I'm ballin 'cause I'm poppin Crys and spendin G's  
I'm just tryin to drink away the pain that killed my nigga steve  
Nigga please, I ain't shit  
Cookies and cream  
Feelin like Marvin it make me wanna holla and scream  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Now half the shit ya doin already been done  
And that's why half my niggas dead, locked up or on the run  
That dope money ain't sufficient it don't last all ways  
Niggas trap all night in project hallways  
All day long niggas front like stars  
On them big ass rims that most than they cars  
Spent 300 on a outfit a hundred on some nikes  
But his baby needs wopes, diapers and pedialite  
And you prolly' got a cousin, brother or a friend  
And this song sound like it from begging to end  
Then again it might be me  
And I'm tired of the nonsense  
Can't sleep at night cause I got a guilty conscience  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
[Background:] can't you see? [over and over until it fades out]
