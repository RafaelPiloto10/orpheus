With the choir of angels singing,  
And the realm of heavenly hosts  
As those elders humbly bow,  
I'd love to come to Your throne with a simple song  
  
With the little creatures speaking,  
Praise and praise and praise again  
With the company of heaven,  
I'd love to come to Your throne with a song of love  
  
Hallelujah, Jesus, hallelujah, hallelu  
Hallelujah, Jesus, pouring out my heart to You  
  
I would bring this praise like insense  
Rising to Your throne above  
Fill the air with heart-filled songs  
Harmony and melody for the One I Love  
  
Who can tell the adoration  
That will rise up to Your throne  
Every knee that day shall bow  
To the King of kings, the Holy One, the only One  
We'll all be singing...
