I remember last christmas eve  
Something happened that I couldn't believe  
I went for a walk while the snow came down  
And when it stopped, I was in a different town  
And the sign said have no fear, your not lost your here  
  
Chorus:  
  
Walkin this christmas  
Down santa claus lane  
No need to wonder  
No need explain  
Just have some faith in what you see  
Your right here where you wanna be  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane.  
Down santa claus lane  
  
Elves were standing in the street  
Snowmen and reindeer came out to greet  
Silver bells chimed from far away  
As Santa rode by in an open sleigh  
And he told me have no fear  
Your not lost your here  
  
Chorus:  
Walkin this christmas  
Down santa claus lane  
No need to wonder  
No need to explian  
Just have some faith in what you see  
Your right here where you wanna be  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane  
Down santa claus lane  
  
I don't know how  
I don't know when  
But one day i'll be back again  
  
And he told me have no fear  
Your not lost your here....  
  
Chorus:  
  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane  
No need to wonder  
No need to explain  
Just have some faith in what you see  
Your right here where you want to be  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane  
(santa claus lane)  
Down santa claus lane  
Down santa claus lane  
(santa claus lane)  
Down santa claus lane
