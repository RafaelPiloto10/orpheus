[Hook:] x 2  
My juice is 900 proof,  
Only message to the youth  
I'm reckless in the booth  
  
I tell you no lies, please recognize  
I'll tear your monkey ass, to pieces and prize  
Niggas realize, it's not a disguise  
This hardcore shit will make your home girl strip  
Make you wanna take a sip of that red cup,  
Guess what, rest up, don't give a fuck  
Never did, small shit is irrelevant  
Heaven knows only live for the hell of it  
Know the elephant, hate anything celibate  
Don't really give a damn, what I tell a bitch  
Home going to the moon might see you soon  
Try to get that outlaw out the saloon  
Hear the click clack first then you hear the boom  
Get the fuck off my clap, mushroom  
Get out my face before I drop you  
Don't try to gamble, with Earl Campbell  
I scramble your eggs boy  
Replace your arms with your motherfucking legs boy  
They call me Dexter, David Hester, Clyde Drexler  
Mma, you's a wrestler  
  
[Hook:] x 2  
My juice is 900 proof,  
Only message to the youth  
I'm reckless in the booth  
  
I don't know why these suckers is fronting  
Like they ain't running and ducking  
With my team start that bucking and fucking  
That's what happen when you get something from nothing  
Any motherfuckers that wanna kick it done out in public  
No I'm g motherfucker and it's good to be home  
And I say sorry for the wait but I was burning the throne  
It's time to take shit, got no time for the hate bitch  
They talk shit, cause they ain't shit  
It's that rise of the ape shit,  
With no cesar, catch me rocking the pro  
Like I'm on that number 8 shit  
Niggas in the back wit their traps upon their hats  
And they guess they pack all black  
They'll take your racks on racks on racks nigga  
Thank god the gangster's back  
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap  
Oh my goodness, ong and I'm reckless in the booth  
And I ain't never been less than the truth, motherfucker!
