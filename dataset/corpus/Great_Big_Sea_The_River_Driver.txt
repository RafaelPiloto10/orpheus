I was just the age of sixteen  
When I first went on the drive  
After six months hard labor  
At home I did arrive  
I courted with a pretty girl  
T'was her caused me to roam  
Now I'm just a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll eat when I am hungry  
And I'll drink when I am dry  
Get drunk whenever I'm ready  
Get sober by and by  
And if this river don't drown me  
It's down I'll mean to roam  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
I'll build a lonesome castle  
Upon some mountain high  
Where she can sit and view me  
As I go passing by  
Where she can sit and view me  
As I go marching on  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I am old and feeble  
And in my sickness lie  
Just wrap me up in a blanket  
And lay me down to die  
Just get a little bluebird  
To sing for me alone  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
For I'm a river driver  
And I'm far away from home
