I see you across the room  
Search for some happiness ain't anytime soon  
Turmoil has turned you inside  
Sift through your pages of miracles you wish to find  
  
[Chorus]  
When you're too numb to cry  
And you're just left wondering why  
When you're too numb to cry  
And you're just left wondering why  
  
To change in the blink of an eye  
If you could you surely would wave yourself goodbye  
I try and I try and I try  
Get a hold on your suffering  
Peace in which you don't wish to buy
