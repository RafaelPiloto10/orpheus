He beat on me He cheat on me  
He's mean to me ooo but he could be so sweet to me  
My friends say I should give him up  
But ohhhh I need him I need him a lot  
That's why I'm gonna take it (take it take it) take what he's got  
  
He disowns me He's going to sleep  
But when we're alone he tells me "I'm his very own"  
Yes, he's got what I need but ohh I need what he's got  
That's why I'm gonna take it (take it take it) take what he's got  
  
Ohhh my friends say he's no good  
He's not worth the time of day  
For he could be an ice man, trash man, a junk man any kind of man  
But nothing can drive me away ohhhh  
  
He cause me pain, you make me wait sometimes out in the rain  
You can make me feel ashamed but I never dress the same  
And I love him so much nothing can make me stop  
  
That's why I'm gonna take it (take it take it) take what he's got x2  
  
Oooohhhh give it up give it up right now I'm gonna take it baby  
(Take it take it) Take what he's got
