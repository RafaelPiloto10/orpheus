All the leaves are brown  
And the sky is grey  
I went for a walk  
On a winters day  
Id be safe and warm  
If I was in L. A.  
California dreamin  
On such a winters day  
  
I stopped into a church (stopped into a church)  
I passed along the way (passed along the way)  
You know, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)  
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)  
Oh, the preacher likes the cold (preacher likes the cold)  
He knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)  
Oh, california dreamin (california dreamin)  
On such a winters day  
  
All the leaves are brown (the leaves are brown)  
And the sky is grey (and the sky is grey)  
I went for a walk (I went for a walk)  
On a winters day (on a winters day)  
If I didn't tell her (if I didn't tell her)  
I could leave today (I could leave today)  
  
Oh, california dreamin (california dreamin)  
On such a winters day (california dreamin)  
On such a winters day (california dreamin)  
On such a winters day (california dreamin)
