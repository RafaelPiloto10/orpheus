Some enchanted evening  
You may see a stranger,  
You may see a stranger  
Across a crowded room  
And somehow you know,  
You know even then  
That somewhere you'll see her  
Again and again.  
  
Some enchanted evening  
Someone may be laughin',  
You may hear her laughin'  
Across a crowded room  
And night after night,  
As strange as it seems  
The sound of her laughter  
Will sing in your dreams.  
  
Who can explain it?  
Who can tell you why?  
Fools give you reasons,  
Wise men never try.  
  
Some enchanted evening  
When you find your true love,  
When you feel her call you  
Across a crowded room,  
Then fly to her side,  
And make her your own  
For all through your life you  
May dream all alone.  
  
Once you have found her,  
Never let her go.  
Once you have found her,  
Never let her go!
