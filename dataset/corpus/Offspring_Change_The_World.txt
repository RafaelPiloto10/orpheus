I see the way the salesmen stare into the sun  
I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one  
And everyone's so blind  
They're not to help mankind  
  
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull another one  
You don't want to change the world  
Like you say  
You're in it for yourself  
  
No one else  
You're ready  
Saving yourself  
You're gonna change the world  
  
You're ready  
Saving yourself  
You're gonna change the world  
Now when the day is set they'll line up all the same
