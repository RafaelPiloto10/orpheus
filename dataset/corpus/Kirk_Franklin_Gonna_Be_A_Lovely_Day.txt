When I wake up in the morning love  
And my heart is filled with pain  
The smile I had upon my face is gone  
Can't see the sunshine from the rain  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
Jesus you're the lover of my soul  
The fire that burns deep within  
You are the joy this world can't take away  
The spirit tells me this will never end  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
I know you going through some stuf now  
Feeling ruff now, feel like givin' up now  
But how can you learn if you don't fall  
But how can you walk if first you don't crawl  
But through it all you keep blessing me  
While people keep on pressin' me and stressin' me  
Because they never hear a preacher flow  
Let's come together with one heart, one mind  
Until we see the sunshine  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
A lovely day yeah
