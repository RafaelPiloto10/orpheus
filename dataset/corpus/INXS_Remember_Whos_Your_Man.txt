Sugar, I want to know you, know you inside out  
Mystery surrounds you, got to figure it out  
Driving downtown to your house,  
your lights are never on  
You got me hooked, I wanna drown  
Without your hand I'm going down  
  
And I can't stop, don't help me out, so lonely and I'm bleeding from the
inside  
Oh no no, no no  
I need you, you need to remember, remember, remember who's your man  
  
Met you on the corner not so long ago  
You asked me where I was going,  
I said I don't know  
Tell me how is it you came into  
my life so damn fast  
You blew my mind, left me behind and now I'm living in your past  
  
And I can't stop, blow me out, I'm so lonely, got me bleeding from the inside  
I need you, and you need to remember,  
remember, can't you remember who's your man?  
  
Who's your man?  
  
You knocked me out, so lonely,  
got me bleeding from the inside  
'Cause I need you, and you need to remember  
I said, 'cause I need you,  
and you need to remember  
Can you do that? 'Cause I'm so high  
Remember, can't you remember,  
oh baby, remember who's your man  
  
Who's your man? Who's your man? Who's your man?
