What's goin' on with the sun and the moon  
'Cause one's goin' down to early, one's comin' up to soon  
The hands on my old clock tell me once again that I'm fallin' behind  
There's too much to do and not enough time  
  
Keepin' up I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck  
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up  
  
There's no such thing for me as a nine to five  
It takes more sweat than that just to get us by  
It's like I'm chasin' my own tail  
'Cause Monday mornin' starts another stressed out week  
  
The world is breathing down my neck I can feel the heat  
Keepin' up I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck  
  
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up  
By the time we make ends meet  
There's not much left for you and me  
And no job security  
  
It sure makes it tough  
Keepin' up  
Keepin' up  
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck  
  
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up  
I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
Keepin' up  
  
I can't stop  
Keepin' up like it or not  
Keepin' up I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
  
Keepin' up  
I can't stop  
Keepin' up like it or not  
Keepin' up
