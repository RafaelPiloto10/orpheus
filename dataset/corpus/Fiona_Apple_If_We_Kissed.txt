Electricity, eye to eye.  
Hey don't I know you? I can't speak.  
Stripped my senses on the spot,  
I've never been defenseless,  
I can't even make sense of this.  
You speak and I don't hear a word.  
  
What would happen if we kissed?  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust,  
Spontaneously combust  
  
The room is spinning out of control.  
You act like you didn't notice, brushed my hand.  
Forbidden fruit, ring on my finger.  
You're such a moral mortal man.  
Would you throw it away? No question.  
Will I pretend I'm innocent?  
  
What would happen if we kissed?  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust,  
Spontaneously combust  
What would happen if we kissed?  
  
Ahhhh...  
Oh  
Ahhhh...  
  
I struggle with myself again  
Quickly the wall, I'm crumbling  
Don't know if I can turn away  
  
What would happen if we kissed?  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth.  
If we kissed,  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth.  
If we kissed.  
Oehh-oh  
If we kissed.  
Oehh-oh...
