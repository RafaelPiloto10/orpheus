Whoa, whoa  
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
Stayed there 'till the air was clear  
I was bored and out of tears, then I saw you washed up on the shore  
I offered you my coat, thank godess love can float  
Crazy how that shipwreck met my ship was comin' in  
We talked 'till the sun went down  
Love on the Pugit Sound  
My treasure map was on your skin  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
'Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Shocks, screams with envy they wonder what you see in me  
Funny thoughts sometimes can't help but wonder that as well  
Now life is a holiday, making up for the years I paid  
The way to this heavenly bay, it went through hell  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Rescued you by the Banu tree, all the girl fish in the sea  
Puttin' a candle to you, they don't have a handle on you, they don't have a
scandal on you  
Holler back will save you  
Saving me was B-I-G, all the boy fish in the sea  
They all wish that they could be me  
  
Can't swim so I took a boat, to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
  
Beauty in the water, angel on the beach  
Ocean's daughter, I thought love was out of reach  
'Till I got her, had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two, for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa, just like you, whoa  
  
Whoa, just like you, whoa(Rescued you by the Banu tree, all the girl fish in
the sea)  
Just like you, whoa
