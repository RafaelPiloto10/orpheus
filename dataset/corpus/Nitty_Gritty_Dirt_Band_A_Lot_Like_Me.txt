High up on a rocky ledge  
Holdin' all she's got  
It ain't much except  
The shattered dream and broken heart  
  
He used her up  
Made her old before her time  
She's gonna take that final step  
And leave her pain behind  
  
All the sins that men commit before their done  
Her lover had one lying silver tongue  
She won't speak his name, it's too much to bear  
But I saw his face as he left her there  
  
Wooh oh ohoh  
Sure looked a lot like me (sure looked a lot like me)  
Wooh ahahah wooh  
Sure looked a lot like me  
  
He was just a boy barely 17  
Feelin' drunk and talkin' tough  
But he wasn't really mean  
Bumped into this sidewinder  
Should have backed way  
Gave him some lip  
Turned out they were  
The last words he would say  
  
All the sins that men commit before their done  
His killer backed into one smokin' silver gun  
No one asked his name, nobody cared  
But I saw his face as the blue smoke cleared  
  
Chorus  
  
Devil came and said, Sinner finally you are mine  
But pardon me Mr. Devil but I think I need more time,  
I've got a lot of mendin' up in life to do  
The Devil said, You should have thought of that,  
Before I came for you  
  
Take this rope and wind it once for every lie  
Once for every thoughtless act  
And twice for tears they cried  
Walk 50 miles naked in the desert sun  
Praying for the souls that you have ruined, one by one  
  
No one knew his name, nobody cared  
But I saw his face as he was hangin' there  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
He sure looked a lot like me
