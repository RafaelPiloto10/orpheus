I'm obnoxious and no one's home  
In My Head  
In My Head  
Cardboard boxes filled with hate  
In My Head  
They're In My Head  
Nest of termites, glowin' red  
In My Head  
They're In My Head  
  
Look behind the mask  
Try to find peace of mind  
And you'll find  
Just look behind the man  
And lead me by the hand  
  
Faded smiles behind dark shades  
In My Head  
In My Head  
Plastic icons, glowin' red  
In My Head  
They're In My Head  
I experiment with myself  
In My Head  
In My Head  
  
Look behind the glass  
Try to find peace of mind  
And you'll find  
Just look behind the man  
And lead me  
  
Look behind the glass  
Try to find peace of mind  
And you'll find  
Just look behind the man  
And lead me  
  
Look behind the man  
Look behind the glass  
Look behind the mask
