Oh daddy  
  
Oh daddy  
You know you make me cry  
How can you love me  
I don't understand why  
Oh daddy  
If I could make you see  
If there's been a fool around  
It's got to be me  
Yes it's got to be me  
  
Oh daddy  
You soothe me with your smile  
You're letting me know  
You're the best thing in my life  
  
Oh daddy  
If I could make you see  
If there's been a fool around  
It's got to be me  
Yes it's got to be me  
Why are you right when I'm so wrong  
I'm so weak but you're so strong  
Everything you do is just alright  
And I can't walk away from you  
Baby if I tried  
  
Oh daddy  
You soothe me with your smile  
You're letting me know  
You're the best thing in my life  
  
Oh daddy  
If I could make you see  
If there's been a fool around  
It's got to be me  
Yes it's got to be me
