Flames  
I see electric flames ya'll  
They, are, burning all over  
All over me  
Voodoo, Voodoo  
That's what they call it now  
And you best better  
Go on and let it be  
But I always been a gamblin' man  
So you know I'm gonna, gonna, gonna  
Gonna take a chance  
Here's my? electric flame  
Do a dance grew up with me  
Cause I'm  
Yes I am  
I'm a mojo man  
And I'm from, let me tell you  
I'm a kuju man  
  
Mojo man  
I'm a fly away man  
And to change anything ya'll, anything  
With just my hand  
And maybe, every maybe  
Just take a little kuju  
Cause you knew it too  
I will lay back  
In Fiji land  
With what I told  
In the palm of my hand  
Bubbles, troubles, witches brew  
Every girl you meet  
Hips, smacks  
And old black cats  
A comfort  
So you know I wasn't alone  
Mojo man  
From a far away land  
And to change anything ya'll, anything  
With just my hand  
Maybe, ever you want to be  
Just take a little muju, ingenuity  
Mojo, Mojo, Mojo, Mojo, Mojo  
Mojo man now  
I'm a mojo man  
I'm a mojo man  
I'm a mojo man  
I'm a mojo, mojo
