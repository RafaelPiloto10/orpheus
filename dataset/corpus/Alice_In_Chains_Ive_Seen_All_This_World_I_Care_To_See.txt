I close my eyes and watch the darkness  
Drawn to my world of make belive  
This world is filled with so much sorrow  
And I've seen all this world I care to see...  
  
I watch as castles fall around me  
Ungrumbled ruins of my home  
This world is filled with much unhappiness  
So many people so long  
  
Seeds that thrive in loveless gardens  
Fruits of such will bitter be  
Fields of hate and greed surround me  
And I've seen all this world I care to see...  
  
Care to see...  
Care to see...  
  
Seeds that thrive in loveless gardens  
Fruits of such will bitter be  
Fields of hate and greed surround me  
And I've seen all this world I care to see...
