Another time it might have been so different  
If only we could do it all again  
But now it's just another fading memory  
Out of focus, though the outline still remains  
  
Far away, away, fading distant lights  
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world  
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember  
  
Like the story that we wish was never ending  
We know sometime we must reach the final page  
Still we carry on just pretending  
That there'll always be another day to go  
  
Far away, away, fading distant lights  
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world  
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember  
  
Another chance hello, another goodbye  
And so many things we'll never see again  
Days of life that seemed so unimportant  
Seem to matter and to count much later on  
  
Far away, away, fading distant lights  
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world  
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember
