There's a steam beat  
And it's comin' after you  
You can take it  
If you only let your feelings through  
Refrain  
So D.J. spin the sounds  
There ain't no way that your gonna  
Let us down  
Gonna dance gonna burn this disco out  
  
[Chorus]  
Groove all night  
Keep the boogie alright  
Get that sound  
Everybody just get on down  
  
Got a hot foot  
Better freak across the floor  
Join the party  
And we'll keep you movin', that's for sure  
  
So D.J. spin the sounds  
There ain't no way that your gonna  
Sit us down  
Gonna dance 'til we burn this disco out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Once you get the beat inside your feet  
There ain't no way to stop you movin' good  
Now the weekend's come it's time for fun  
You got to groove just like you know you should  
  
People now  
Are you ready  
Won't you rock across the room  
Got a feelin'  
That we're gonna raise the roof off soon  
  
So D.J. spin the sounds  
There ain't no way that your gonna  
Sit us down  
Gonna dance 'til we burn this disco out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So D.J. spin the sounds  
There ain't no way that your gonna  
Sit us down  
Gonna dance 'til we burn this disco out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chant]  
Gonna dance, gonna shout  
Gonna burn this disco out  
Gonna dance, gonna shout  
Gonna burn this disco out  
Gonna dance, gonna shout  
Gonna burn this disco out
