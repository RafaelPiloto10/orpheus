Arguing your point about which race is best  
Think you've got some insight well it's just prejudice  
And the more that you argue the more mad you get  
Well I don't want to fill myself with hate like that  
You're prejudice just look at you  
You're prejudiced and you're gonna be judged too  
You've taken your stance, you've split us apart  
Let's see how many bad feelings you can start  
Trying to make hatred seem real cool  
Keep talking those facts you come off the fool  
You're prejudice just look at you  
You're prejudiced and you're gonna be judged too  
Unite the race what listen  
We may be the same race but we're not the same [ PREJUDICE ]  
You're cowards looking for someone else to blame  
And you're just a few cause most are too smart  
To listen to all the shit that you start
