Something crossed my mind again and you were in my eyes  
It was somewhere I've already been  
Tellin' all those lies  
But I've been there and you've been there and there ain't no mistake  
We could take it anyway  
But there one thing you can say  
There's just two ways to play  
Just two ways to play  
I don't want to stay  
There's just two ways to play and I want to play it right this time  
  
There's always the easy numbers there's those hard ways too  
there's those cheaters numbers  
Its either one of two  
But fortune tellin's mesmerizin' and the game of chance  
Rollin' dice ain't sympathizin' when you play romance  
There's just two ways to play  
Just two ways to play  
I don't want to stay  
There's just two ways to play  
  
I can't control the numbers can't control your sexy ways  
I can't control my inner thunder it makes me wander round for days  
  
Two ways to play  
There's just two ways to play  
There's just two ways to play  
There's just two ways to play, I'm gonna play it right this time  
There's two ways to play  
There's just two ways to play  
Two ways to play  
There's just two ways to play  
  
And I don't want to stay  
There's just two ways to play
