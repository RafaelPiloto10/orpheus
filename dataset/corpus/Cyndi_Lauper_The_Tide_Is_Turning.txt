I used to think the world was flat  
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd  
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning  
Used to look in on the children at night  
In the glow of their donald duck light  
And I frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Satellites buzzing through the endless night  
Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights  
Jesus christ, imagine what it must be earning  
Who is the strongest  
Who is the best  
Who holds the aces  
The east  
Or the west  
This is the crap our children are learning  
And oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning  
  
Now the satellite's confused  
'cos on saturday night  
The airwaves were full of compassion and light  
And his silicon heart warmed  
To the sight of a billion candles burning  
But, I'm not saying that the battle is won  
But on saturday night all those kids in the sun  
Wrested technology's sword from the hand of the war lords  
Oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, the tide is turning  
Oh, the tide is turning  
(repeated)
