All around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away  
  
Fare the well cold winter  
And fare the well cold frost  
But nothing have I gain  
But my own true love I've lost  
I'll sing and I'll be merry  
When occasion I do see  
She's a false deluded young girl  
Let here go farewell she  
  
And all around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away  
  
The other night she brought me  
A fine diamond ring but,  
She tought to have deprive me  
Of a far better thing  
But I being careful  
As lovers ought to be  
She's a false deluded young girl  
Let her go farewell she  
  
And all around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away  
  
All around my hat  
I will wear the green willow  
And all around my hat  
For a twelwe month and a day  
And if anyone should ask me  
The reason why I'm wearing it  
It's all for my true love  
Who's far far away
