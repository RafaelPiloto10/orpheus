Every moment we decide  
What to open, what to hide  
Every moment we decide  
How to live our lives  
  
Every moment we can learn  
How to better understand  
Who to follow, where to turn  
How to find a friend  
  
I' ll wrap it with love  
Every day and night  
Wrap it up with love  
Watch it fill with light  
Wrap it up with love  
Every way is right.  
  
Wrap it up with love, love, love..  
  
Every moment we grow old  
Trust in no one, so were told  
I won' t live my life in fear  
Rather disappear  
  
Wrap it up with love  
Every day and night  
Wrap it up with love  
Watch it fill with light  
Wrap it up with love  
Every way is right  
  
Wrap it up with love, love, love..
