Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is  
And now that I feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed  
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain  
He thought he was king creole  
Until he found out, until he found out  
  
He sits upon a throne  
He lives a sleazy lie  
But he's all alone again, again  
  
I can see a liar, sitting by the fire  
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought  
Coming as he goes into overdose  
I wonder what he thinks of me?
