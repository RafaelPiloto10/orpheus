Yeah, yanahmean?  
Just something for all my niggas in the hood  
They always ask me, what I got to say to the youths and  
Yanahmean when I do these interviews  
Just want to let em know (we ballin)  
You gotta strap up cause niggas'll test you  
Whenever you feel that pressure  
You let em know everyday of your life is, check it  
  
For real we still killin' 'em and, each one of 'em  
You know the flow like caine, look it's numbin 'em  
Look what I done to them, they want run wit 'em  
I let 'em stay few nights but then I'm done wit 'em  
Mami you rollin', get your clothin'  
You know one sight of the mansion will get 'em open  
I back out my garage wit, new Ferrari  
Cause I been pimpin this game since Atari  
You hardly, ever see me loving a hoe  
I tell a bitch, I'm in love wit my doe  
Cause I'm pimping and, niggas is bitchin' and  
We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions  
Think I'm slippin', like I don't grip again  
Go 'head trip it ain't nothing to drop a clip again  
Got my dogs to catch me when I'm fallin'  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Nigga we ballin', ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
We ballin', ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
  
Yeah, I take a sip of that henny I load that tec up  
I hit the block wit the medicine give 'em check ups  
You see I'm vest up, I'm ballin' at war  
These niggas want to see me off, they don't want to see me on but  
Proof I'm ballin', I put a eighth  
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin'  
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night  
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life  
And you youngn's in the hood want to be like P  
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P  
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit  
You know how dudes "This Proof ain't for that bullshit"  
And these hoes want to roll wit a G  
But once I hit 'em wit that G, I have totin' the P, cause!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo I hear 'em callin, and every city I travel  
Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin'  
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood  
Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me  
We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)  
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)  
Who want war? hoes they tellin' me "E's you ain't right"  
Like this year I'm goin' go South Pole  
This for them haters think I'm slippin', I ain't  
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin' like weight  
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin' my point  
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point  
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game  
I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same  
But I see he hard headed, told em stay in his lane  
Cause them OG's home and they layin wit K's cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nigga, pass the weed and hennessy I hear it callin'  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
We ballin', ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
We ballin', pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
We ballin', ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy, I hear it callin'  
We ballin', ready for war and
