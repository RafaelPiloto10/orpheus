My daddy was an honest man, just a redneck Georgia farm boy  
My momma spent her short life, raisin' kids and bailin' hay  
And I was just fifteen when I ached inside to wonder  
So I hoped a freight in Waycross and I rode it to L.A.  
  
Well, I met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Maybel Joy  
Destitution's child, born on a L.A. street called Shane  
And sleep came and left this little Waycross Georgia country boy  
Maybel Joy was gone, Lord, I'd never see her again  
  
Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Maybel Joy  
Laughter found our morning's, brought new meaning to my life  
I woke up one day, Lord to find that I was by myself  
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine  
  
Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door  
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor  
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine  
Who said, "Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green"  
  
Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison  
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy  
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy  
  
Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy  
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came  
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen  
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train  
  
Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door  
With a bullet in my side I cried, "Have you seen Maybel Joy?"  
Stunned and shaken someone said, "Son, she don't live here no more"  
She left this town ten years ago, I heard she's looking for  
Some Georgia farm boy"
