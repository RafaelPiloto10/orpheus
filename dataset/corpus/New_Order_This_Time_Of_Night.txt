We all feel the same  
All pleasure nothing to gain  
I've known you from the start  
I've grown used to your wooden heart  
Now you know my name  
You search your empty brain in vain  
If you don't change your ways  
You'll end up here with me unraised  
Without you they'll never know  
Without you my life won't flow  
Without you they'll never show  
Without you the night won't go  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you I lay in pain  
Without you I've gone insane  
  
Now you must decide  
What good's a lie when you've nothing to hide  
Maps they'll never show  
They're dumb like you, they never know  
It's time we said goodbye  
Bury your head and silence your cry  
Know the feel of pain  
Join our world and play our game  
  
Without you they'll never know  
Without you my life won't grow  
Without you they'll never show  
Without you the night won't go  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you my life's a waste  
Just for you I wrap my face  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you I live in pain  
Without you I've gone insane  
  
Whatever you may think of me  
Don't ever take my dignity (x4)  
Whatever you may do to me  
Don't crucify my dignity
