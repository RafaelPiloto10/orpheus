[Verse 1]  
I miss the taste of a sweeter life,  
I miss the conversation.  
I'm searching for a song tonight,  
I'm changing all of the stations.  
I like to think that we had it all,  
We drew a map to a better place.  
But on that road, I took a fall,  
Oh baby, why did you run away?  
  
[Bridge]  
I was there for you, in your darkest times,  
I was there for you, in your darkest nights.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst , down on my knees,  
And you said you had my back.  
So I wonder where were you  
When all the roads you took , came back to me,  
So I'm following the map that leads to you.  
  
Chorus]  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following to you.  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do,  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I hear your voice in my sleep at night,  
Hard to resist temptation.  
'Cause something strange has come over me,  
And now I can't get over you.  
No, I just can't get over you!  
  
[Bridge]  
I was there for you, in your darkest times,  
I was there for you, in your darkest nights.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I wonder where were you  
When I was at my worst, down on my knees,  
And you said you had my back.  
So I wonder where were you?  
When all the roads you took, came back to me,  
So I'm following the map that leads to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following to you.  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do,  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Ah ah ah  
  
[Hook]  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest time,  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest night,  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest time,  
Oh I was there for you, oh in your darkest night!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I wonder where were you,  
When I was at my worst, down on my knees,  
And you said you had my back.  
So I wonder where were you?  
When all the roads you took, came back to me,  
So I'm following the map that leads to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following to you.  
The map that leads to you,  
Ain't nothing I can do.  
The map that leads to you,  
Following, following, following.
