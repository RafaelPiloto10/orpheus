Like to have you 'round  
With all the lies that you make  
The things or darkness and you  
Some people say, have just a taste  
Right or wrong, you might get burned  
What you gain is what you learn  
  
Got one too many women  
Don't know quite which way to go  
They're all gettin' so expensive  
When they walk by themselves  
Right or wrong, don't regret  
What you went for is what you get  
  
No point in bitter tears  
When someone else has cut you down  
'Cause there's a time for leavin'  
And there's a time for stickin' around, hey  
Right or wrong, you've got to live  
So what you collect is what you give
