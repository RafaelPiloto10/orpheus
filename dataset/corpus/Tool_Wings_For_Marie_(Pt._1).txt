You believed  
You believed in moments not conceived  
You believed in me  
  
A patient in spirit  
Uncompromise  
Without us in your heart  
A light in your eyes that  
Ends all lies  
  
Vacant, broken  
Fell at the hands of  
Those moments that I wouldn't see  
Cause you, you pray for me too  
What have I done to be a son to an angel  
What have I done to be worthy  
  
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence  
Difficult to see with this light  
Please forgive this selfish question, but  
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight  
She never told a lie  
Well might of told a lie  
But never lived one  
Didn't have a life  
Didn't have a life  
But surely saved one  
Alright, now it's time for us to let you go
