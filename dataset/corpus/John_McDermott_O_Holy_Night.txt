O holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night  
Of the dear saviour's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
'til he appeared  
And the soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn'  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine, o night, o night divine  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts  
By his cradle we stand  
So led by the light  
Of a star sweetly gleaming  
There came the wise men  
From orient land  
The king of kings lay  
Thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials  
Born to be our friend  
He knows our need  
He guardeth us from danger  
Behold your king  
Before him lowly bend  
Behold you king  
Before him lowly bend
