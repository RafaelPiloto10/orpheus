(Come on. Let me tell you)  
  
Maybe I just want to touch you for your warm inside again  
Maybe I just want to let you the sweetest pleasure is me  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like  
  
Are you coming to the moment  
When you know your heart can break  
I'm inside you  
I'm around you  
  
Just want to hear you cry again  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why but it just makes me feel like  
  
You don't know how much it hurts when you fall asleep in my arms  
Before the morning comes  
I want to run away, I want to run away  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like  
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry  
I don't know why why but it just makes me feel like
