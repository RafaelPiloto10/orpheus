Here I come to save the day  
  
A little boy inside a dream just the other day  
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away  
A hand came out and happened to pin that bag on his chest  
It said get out there man and a do your best  
  
And he's called the astro man  
And he's flyin' higher than  
That old faggot superman  
Ever could  
  
Oh, they call him cosmic nut  
And he's twice as dense as Donald Duck  
And he'll try his best to screw you up  
The rest of your mind  
Oh, look out, my guitars  
  
Astro man, flyin' across the sky  
Two times higher than  
That old faggot superman  
Ever, ever could  
Ever could  
  
There he goes, there he goes  
Where he stops, no one knows  
There he goes, there he goes, uh  
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind  
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind  
Talkin' about lookin' for peace of mind  
Astro man will leave it in pieces  
Have you put our trouble behind him  
Make you fly around in pieces  
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind  
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind  
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind  
Ooo-hoo  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Blow out the rest of of your mind
