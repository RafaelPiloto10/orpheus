I came upon a butcher,  
He was slaughtering a lamb,  
I accused him there  
With his tortured lamb.  
  
He said, Listen to me, child,  
I am what I am and you, you are my only son.  
Well, I found a silver needle,  
I put it into my arm.  
  
It did some good,  
Did some harm.  
But the nights were cold  
And it almost kept me warm,  
How come the night is long?  
I saw some flowers growing up  
Where that lamb fell down  
  
Was I supposed to praise my Lord,  
Make some kind of joyful sound?  
He said, Listen, listen to me now,  
I go round and round  
And you, you are my only child.  
  
Do not leave me now,  
Do not leave me now,  
I'm broken down  
From a recent fall.  
  
Blood upon my body  
And ice upon my soul,  
Lead on, my son, it is your world.
