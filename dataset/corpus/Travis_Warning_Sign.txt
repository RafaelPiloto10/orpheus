In the middle of the night I hear you  
Talking in your sleep the same old story  
All I know it's not me, you've been talking to  
All the wishes, all the joy and wonder  
Sleeping with the fishes six feet under  
All I want  
Can't be done,  
Locked without a key  
Ohhh, where you going now?  
  
Don't let your heart run out on me  
Don't set the horses free  
We never laid it on the line  
No time  
No warning sign  
  
In the middle of the day I find you  
Turning round the tables and turning  
Off your mind in rewind  
You can't find a silent night  
All the paper lying on the ground  
Burning pages and those spinning heads  
Is something wrong  
In their lives?  
We need paradise  
Oohh, where you going wrong?  
  
Don't let your heart run out on me  
Don't set the horses free  
We never laid it on the line  
No time  
No warning sign  
  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going wrong?  
Where you going?  
  
Don't let your heart run out on me  
Don't set the horses free  
We never laid it on the line  
No time  
No warning sign
