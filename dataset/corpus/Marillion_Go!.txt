Turn your life upside down  
Take a car into town  
Wait until the world's asleep  
And tear it up and never stop again  
  
Take a train to the sea  
Stay up all night ..and be  
It only takes a fraction of a second  
To turn your life upside down  
  
Take a train to the sea  
Be anyone you want to be  
A little spark of light inside your mind  
Safe and sound off the ground upside down  
  
Wide awake on the edge of the world
