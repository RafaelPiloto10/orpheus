Baby, can I talk to you?  
I know something's wrong  
Things just ain't the same  
But deep down inside  
I know you still care  
So tell me what to do  
To get things back  
The way they used to be  
  
If your words had meaning  
If you really cared about me  
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart  
If you were my lover  
A constant friend to me  
Tell me why  
Would you turn away from my love  
  
[Chorus]  
So darlin'  
Tell me what to do to make things right  
Darlin'  
Tell me what to do to make things right  
Darlin'  
Tell me what to do to make things right for love  
Tell me what to do to make things right for love (for love)  
  
If your words have reason  
When they won't turn away from me  
They're trying hard to hide all truth they might say  
If you listen to me girl  
If you know how I'm feeling inside  
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Can't you see?  
All I'm asking for  
Is a chance to let me love you  
Can't you see?  
Girl, you know with me  
Is where you should be  
And if by chance we should find  
That it can be for you and I  
Then girl I'll try  
I'll try  
Oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl, you should know how I feel by now  
There's so many ways to love  
So just open your heart  
And I'll find the way  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
