Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.  
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.  
My luck is changing, it's gotten from  
simply rotten to something worse  
Who knows, some day I will win too.  
I'll begin to reach my prime.  
  
Now though I see what our end is,  
All I can spend is just my time.  
  
I can't give you anything but love, baby.  
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.  
  
Dream awhile, scheme awhile  
We're sure to find  
  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things you've always pined for.  
  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.  
  
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.  
  
Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.  
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.  
But I am willing to wait, dear,  
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.  
  
You have a lifetime before you.  
I'll adore you, come what may.  
  
Please don't be blue for the present,  
When it's so pleasant to hear you say  
  
I can't give you anything but love, baby.  
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.  
  
Dream awhile, scheme awhile  
We're sure to find  
  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things you've always pined for.  
  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.  
  
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.
