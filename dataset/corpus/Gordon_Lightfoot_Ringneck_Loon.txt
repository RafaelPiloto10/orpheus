Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound, he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck Loon, he knows best  
He's a loon and he don't care less  
Ringneck loon, away off shore  
How could anybody ask for more  
Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound, he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck loon, he can't rest  
He's a loon and he don't care less  
Ringneck loon around the bend  
Been a loon since he don't know when  
Hear the call of the ringneck loon  
City life is what I see  
City life is the life for me  
Ringneck loon, he knows best  
He's a loon and he don't care less  
Hear the cry of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon  
Ringneck loon, you can't rest  
You're a loonie and you don't care less  
Ringneck loon, my old friend  
Been a loon since he don't know when  
Hear the cry of the ringneck loon  
Hear the sound, he will be home soon  
Hear the cry in the afternoon
