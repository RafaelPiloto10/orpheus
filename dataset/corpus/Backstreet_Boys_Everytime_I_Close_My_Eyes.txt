Listen girl, I don't know where to start  
Cause every word I say is straight from the heart  
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you  
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through  
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance,  
Cause I want you back again  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I close my eyes,I see your face and I wonder  
When you close your eyes do you think about me?  
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're all that I see.  
  
You and I we shared enough together  
Each other was all we'd ever need  
I thought that you would stay with me forever  
But I took for granted the love you gave to me  
But I'll keep on trying, till the end  
Baby I need you back with me  
I need you back,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And girl I'm going out of my mind  
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do  
Please say its just a matter of time,  
Until I feel your touch,  
Until you let me come back to you  
  
I think about you girl every time at night  
I'm in love, and it feels so right  
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain  
I was just caught up in the lying game  
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways  
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days  
Until you let me come back,  
Until you let me start  
To find a new way to get back into your heart.  
  
[Chorus]
