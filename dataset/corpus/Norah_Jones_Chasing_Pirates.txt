In your message you said, you were goin' to bed,  
But I'm not done with the night.  
So I stayed up and read, but your words in my head,  
Got me mixed up so I turned out the light.  
  
And I, don't know how, to slow it down.  
My mind's racing from chasing pirates.  
  
Well the man in there swings while the silliest things,  
Floppin' around in my brain.  
And I try not to dream but them possible schemes,  
Swim around, wanna drown me insane.  
  
And I, don't know how, to slow it down.  
Oh my mind's racing from chasing pirates.  
  
And I, don't know how, to slow it down.  
Oh my mind's racing from chasing pirates.  
  
My mind's racin' from chasing pirates.  
My mind's racin' from chasing pirates.
