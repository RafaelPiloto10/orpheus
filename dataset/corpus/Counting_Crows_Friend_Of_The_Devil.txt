I lit out from Reno,  
I was trailed by twenty hounds  
Didn't get to sleep that night  
'Till the morning came around.  
  
Set out runnin' but I take my time  
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine  
If I get home before daylight,  
I just might get some sleep tonight.  
  
Ran into the devil, babe,  
He loaned me twenty bills  
I spent the night in Utah  
In a cave up in the hills.  
  
Set out runnin' but I take my time,  
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,  
If I get home before daylight,  
I just might get some sleep tonight.  
  
I ran down to the levee  
But the devil caught me there  
He took my twenty dollar bill  
And vanished in the air.  
  
Set out runnin' but I take my time  
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine  
If I get home before daylight,  
I just might get some sleep tonight.  
  
Got two reasons why I cry  
Away each lonely night,  
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,  
And she's my hearts delight.  
The second one is prison, baby,  
The sheriff's on my trail,  
And if he catches up with me,  
I'll spend my life in jail.  
  
Got a wife in Chino, babe,  
And one in Cherokee  
The first one says she's got my child,  
But it don't look like me.  
Set out runnin' but I take my time,  
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,  
If I get home before daylight,  
I just might get some sleep tonight.  
  
You can borrow from the devil  
You can borrow from a friend  
The devil'll loan ya twenty  
But your friend got only ten
