Baby, sometimes I feel like dying  
Driving while I'm closing my eyes  
Moving in and out of hiding  
Trying to catch some thruth in my life  
Wathing your stars and your moonlight  
Come tumbling down from the sky  
Take it now.  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I wanna find you  
In everything that I do  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna count on you  
I'm gonna follow  
Baby, what else can I do?  
  
Sunday morning my town is sleeping  
Lying all alone in my bed  
There's not a sound, I can't help but listening  
Wishing I was somewhere else instead  
But sometimes they are too hard to handle  
Those voices inside my head  
Listen now.  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I wanna find you  
In everything that I do  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna count on you  
I'm gonna follow  
Baby, what else can I do?  
  
Take a walk inside my dream: A church, a lonely road  
All the people come and go and come and go.  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
Do it now!  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I'm gonna follow  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I wanna find you  
In everything that I do  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna count on you  
I'm gonna follow  
Baby, what else can I do?  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
Baby, what else can I do?
