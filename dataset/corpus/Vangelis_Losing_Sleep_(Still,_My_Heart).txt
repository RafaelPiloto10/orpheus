Losing sleep  
In a waking dream  
  
A recurring face I see  
Comes to pass my way  
  
Still, my heart  
Will you please be still, my heart  
In this world of change  
You keep turning me 'round again  
  
In my mind  
Could it be that I'm just a fool for love?  
Is blind to danger  
  
Is this faith?  
Then why should I  
Hesitate when love would dance with a stranger?  
  
Shout it loud from the rooftop high  
Let it burn inside  
And try only to fade and die  
  
If I knew all there was to learn  
Every twist and turn  
Why do I still try?
