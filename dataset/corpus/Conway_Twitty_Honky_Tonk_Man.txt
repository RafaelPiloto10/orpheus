Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop  
Yeah I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old jukebox  
But when my moneys all gone I'm on the telephone  
A hollerin' hey hey mama can your daddy come home  
  
It takes a purty little gal and a jug of wine  
That's what it takes to make a honky tonk mind  
With the jukebox a moanin' honky tonk sound  
That's when I want to lay my money down  
Cause I'm a honky tonk man  
  
Well I'm living fast and dangerously but I've got plenty of company  
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down  
That's when I want to see the lights of town  
Cause I'm a honky tonk man
