Old lion's dying, got left behind  
Cut your teeth, lose your meat  
And man it's just a matter of time  
Key's to the cuffs, you might be king  
That's it, that's all, that's everything  
  
Skeletons come here to dance  
Where barrooms beat their brothers  
Into a bloody trance  
What's the deal? what did I do?  
Who cops all the cops is all I asked of you  
  
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down  
Something's up, taking time to get around  
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown  
It's just a matter of trickle down  
  
Twenty miles before the crash  
That's the style for a while  
And man I think it's gonna last  
"hit the brakes" is all you can say  
Conductor says we'll save them  
For another rainy day
