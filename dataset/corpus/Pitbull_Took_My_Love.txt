Red Foo, Mr. Worldwide  
Mr. Vain, Rush  
  
You took my love, I thought I was the only one  
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one  
You took my love, took my love  
  
Loquita, I don't play, you know what time it is with me  
You want my heart, you got to work  
And show me that you'd ride it there for me  
I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do  
You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you  
  
Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that  
Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at  
I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't play by the rules  
Oh baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love  
  
You took my love, I thought I was the only one  
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one  
You took my love, took my love  
  
Yaoh, I'm in the club, and the place is poppin'  
Sip-sippin' bub and the bass is knockin'  
Times are great, 'cause I'm with my crew  
But my smile is fake, 'cause I'm missing you  
Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson  
Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection  
And when I see you later with that other guy  
Keep telling myself a player ain't suppose to cry  
  
You took my love, I thought I was the only one  
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one  
You took my love, took my love  
  
She took my love, and played me for a sucker  
But it don't even matter, 'cause you know I still love her  
She took my heart, and threw it on the ground  
But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around  
  
She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker  
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart breaker  
But a great love maker, all in a sheet  
She made my heart skip a beat  
But for now she's as cold as they come  
Not mags, no life and no guns  
She took my love  
  
You took my love, I thought I was the only one  
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one  
You took my love, took my love  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Love
