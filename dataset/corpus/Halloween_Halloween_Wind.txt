The wind is gonna be scary,  
Scary this Halloween.  
It'll sound just like a thousand ghosts and goblins  
When they scream.  
  
You can hear it howling,  
Shrieking in the sky.  
It'll make your mamma hide her head  
And make your daddy cry.  
  
And it starts down low.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
Goes back low.  
Gets a little bit higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
  
The wind will make you nervous,...  
  
And it starts down low.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
Goes back low.  
Gets a little bit higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
  
The wind is gonna be chilly...  
  
And it starts down low.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
Goes back low.  
Gets a little bit higher.  
Gets a little higher.  
Gets really high.  
  
The wind is gonna be scary...
