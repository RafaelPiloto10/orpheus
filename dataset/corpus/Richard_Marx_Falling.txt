I've got a secret  
That I think I'm ready to share  
It may bring us closer  
It may be a burden to bear  
  
It's precious and it's real  
And all that I can feel  
  
Is that I'm falling  
As deep as any ocean  
In ways that can't be spoken  
I am falling  
For the millionth and the first time  
Ever and eternally for you  
  
You are a beacon  
Revealing the places I hide  
You've given freedom  
To so much that I kept inside  
  
And with one look in my eyes  
It can't be a surprise  
  
That I am falling  
As deep as any ocean  
In ways that can't be spoken  
I am falling  
For the millionth and the first time  
Ever and eternally for you  
  
Now there's no darkness  
My truth laid open and bare  
It's in my flesh and bones  
Yeah it's everywhere  
  
That I am falling  
As deep as any ocean  
In ways that can't be spoken  
I am falling  
Like rays that come from heaven  
Bathed in your affection  
I am falling  
For the millionth and the first time  
Ever and eternally for you
