I love the way you talk  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Speaking little, saying a lot.  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I love the way you walk  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Look like you're dancin when you're not.  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I love the way you love  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
You give it everything you've got.  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)

I'm in love with you  
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)  
Now tell me baby

2nd verse  
Every time I knock-knock-knock  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I hear you say "Come in."  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
My heart goes a-boom-boom  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Just to hold you again.  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I hear bells ding-a-ling  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
'Cause you the living end  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
3rd verse!  
I bet you wouldn't think a dance  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Could start a real romance  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I bet you wouldn't think a kiss  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Could turn me on like this  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Well let me tell you how it was  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Yes it did, Yes it was
