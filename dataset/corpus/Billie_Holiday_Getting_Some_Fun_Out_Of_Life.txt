When we want to love, we love  
When we want to kiss, we kiss  
With a little petting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life  
When we want to work. we work  
When we want to play, we play  
In a happy setting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life  
Maybe we do the right things  
Maybe we do the wrong  
Spending each day  
Just wending our way along  
When we want to sing, we sing  
When we want to dance, we dance  
You can do your betting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life  
  
Maybe we do the right things  
Maybe we do the wrong  
Spending each day  
Just wending our way along  
But when we want to sing, we sing  
When we want to dance, we dance  
You can do your betting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life
