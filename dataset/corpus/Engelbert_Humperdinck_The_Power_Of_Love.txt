The whispers in the morning  
Of lovers sleeping tight  
Are rolling like thunder now  
As I look in your eyes  
  
I hold on to your body  
And feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender  
A love that I could not forsake  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're heading for something  
Somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened  
But I'm ready to learn  
Of the power of love  
  
'Cause you're my lady  
And I am your man  
Whenever you reach for me  
I'll do all that I can  
  
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms  
When the world outside's too  
Much to take  
That all ends when I'm with you  
  
Even though there may be times  
It seems I'm far away  
Never wonder where I am  
'Cause I am always by your side  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The sound of your heart beating  
Made it clear  
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on  
Is light years away  
  
[Chorus:]
