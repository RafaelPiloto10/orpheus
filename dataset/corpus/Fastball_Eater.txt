Watch me, make you  
Let me, take you  
Follow down, I will penetrate you baby  
Run you to the ground  
I will make you hate you baby  
  
I'm an eater, I'm an eater, I'm an eater  
Your cheeks are red and rosy  
I'll keep you safe and sound  
I'll keep you warm and cozy  
Fatten you up to wolf you down  
  
Your cheeks are red and rosy (Watch me)  
I'll keep you safe and sound (Make you)  
I'll keep you warm and cozy (Let me)  
Fatten you up to wolf you down (Take you)  
  
I'm an eater, I'm an eater, I'm an eater  
And there's one thing that I know is true  
I'll just make a meal of you  
I'll leave the bones and hair to rot  
I don't really care a lot  
  
Follow down (Watch me)  
I will penetrate you baby (Make you)  
Run you into the ground (Let me)  
I will make you hate you baby  
  
I'm an eater, I'm an eater, I'm an eater
