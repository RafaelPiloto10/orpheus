I came to town  
To search for gold  
And I brought with me  
A memory  
And I seemed to hear  
The night wind cry  
Go hang your dreams on the hanging tree  
Your dreams of love that could never be  
Hang your faded dreams on the hanging tree  
  
I searched for gold (at the hanging tree)  
And I found my gold (at the hanging tree)  
And I found a girl (and I found a girl)  
Who loved just me (and she loved just me)  
And I wished that I could love her too  
But I'd left my heart on the hanging tree  
I'd left my heart with a memory  
And a faded dream on the hanging tree  
  
Now there were men  
Who craved my gold  
And they meant to take my gold from me  
When a man is gone  
He needs no gold  
So they carried me to the hanging tree  
To join my dreams and a memory  
Yes they carried me to-o the hanging tree  
  
To really live you must almost die  
And it happened just that way with me  
They took the gold and they set me free  
And I walked away from the hanging tree  
I walked away from the hanging tree  
  
And my own true love  
Oh yes, she walked with me  
That's when I knew that the hanging tree  
Was a tree of life, new life for me  
A tree of hope, new hope for me  
A tree of love, new love for me  
  
The hanging tree  
The hanging tree  
The hanging tree
