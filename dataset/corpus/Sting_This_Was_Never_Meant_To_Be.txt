This was never meant to be  
All the signs were there to see  
From the first moment that we met I knew  
This was never meant to be  
  
This was always doomed to fail  
From the moment we set sail  
All our instincts told us we were wrong  
This was never meant to be  
  
But soon we were enraptured in love's dance  
When the dance ended I found  
I couldn't live without you  
And now one of my dreams is sad embers  
Here in the cold of December  
And now you're in the arms of someone else  
I always knew that  
  
This was always second best  
Our love would fall at the first test  
Common sense would tell us we were wrong  
This was never meant to be  
  
This was never meant to last  
We drank our cup of love too fast  
From the first moment that we met I knew  
Now Miss, from our first kiss  
I tell you, this was never meant to be
