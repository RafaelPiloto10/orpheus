Boy, you gotta carry that weight  
Carry that weight a long time  
Boy, you gonna carry that weight  
Carry that weight a long time  
  
I never give you my pillow  
I only send you my invitation  
And in the middle of the celebrations  
I break down  
  
Boy, you gotta carry that weight  
Carry that weight a long time  
Boy, you gotta carry that weight  
You're gonna carry that weight along time
