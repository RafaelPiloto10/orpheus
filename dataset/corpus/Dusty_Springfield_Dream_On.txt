I surround myself with superficial things  
Somethin' to toy with  
They don't mean a thing  
I got my share of secrets  
A long time overdue  
I got a world inside me  
I'd better keep on running to  
  
I dream on  
I dream on  
A fantasy to guide me  
And hope to see me through  
I dream on  
I dream on  
Do you want to be a dreamer?  
Be a dreamer  
If you want to be a dreamer  
Be a dreamer  
Come on, baby, be a dreamer, be a dreamer, oh, oh  
  
Now, my friends all say I'm crazy  
And I'm blowing every chance  
'Til until I hear your sweet, sweet music  
Nothin's gonna make me dance  
'Cause I'm a dreamer and my eyes give me away  
Oh, they're always sayin'  
All the things I'd never say  
  
I dream on  
I dream on  
A fantasy to guide me  
And hope to see me through  
I dream on  
I dream on  
Do you want to be a dreamer?  
Be a dreamer  
If you want to be a dreamer  
(Be a dreamer)  
Come on, baby, be a dreamer, be a dreamer, oh  
Do you want to be a dreamer?  
(Be a dreamer)  
If you want to be a dreamer  
(Be a dreamer)  
Come on, baby, be a dreamer,  
(Be a dreamer), oh, oh  
  
I believe in magic  
And in wishes coming true  
Somethin' tells me, baby  
That you believe it, too  
  
I dream on  
I dream on  
A fantasy to guide me  
And hope to see me through  
I dream on  
I dream on  
Do you want to be a dreamer?  
(Be a dreamer)  
If you want to be a dreamer  
(Be a dreamer)  
Come on, baby, be a dreamer  
(Be a dreamer)  
Ooh, hoo  
If you want to be a dreamer  
Be a dreamer  
Be a dreamer  
Oh, yeah  
Do you want to?  
Do you want to be a dreamer?  
Ah, ha, be a dreamer  
Yeah, be a dreamer, oh, ho  
Do you want to be a dreamer?
