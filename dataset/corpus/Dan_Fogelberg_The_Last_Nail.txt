I saw you running ahead of the crowd  
I chased but never thought I'd catch you  
You said you loved me but you had to be free and I let you  
Why did I let you  
We walked together through the gardens and graves  
I watched you grow to be a woman  
Living on promises that nobody gave to no one  
They were given to no one  
I started listening to the wind and the rain  
You strained your ears but could hear nothing  
One night I thought I heard them whisper my name  
And I went running  
I left a trail of footprints deep in the snow  
I swore one day I would retrace them  
But when I turned around I found that the wind had erased them  
Now I'll never replace them  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly away, my sweet bird, over the land  
Take life for all the freedom you can  
But if you ever should need a man  
Well, the offer still stands  
I hear you've taken on a husband and child  
And live somewhere in Pennsylvania  
I never thought you'd ever sever the string but I can't blame you none  
So let the ashes fall and lay where they will  
Just say that once you used to know me  
One last time sing that old song we used to know  
But this time sing  
But this time sing a little more slowly  
  
[Chorus]
