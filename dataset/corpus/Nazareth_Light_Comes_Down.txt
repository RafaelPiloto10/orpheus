When the light comes down  
We're gonna cuddle up close  
Gonna paint this town  
We're gonna rub their noses  
Hey mama -want to know  
Why I'm never lonely?  
want to know  
Why I'm never sad?  
  
When the night comes out  
And the sandman rides  
We're gonna sing and shout  
I'm gonna take you places  
Hey mamma then I'll show you  
Why you'll never be lonely  
Then you'll know  
How you'll never be sad  
  
On your marks with the sun still pouring in  
Hold steady 'till we're ready for the evening  
Gettin' set, for a ride all around the town  
Then you take me where you want to go  
  
On your mark with the sun still pouring in  
Hold steady 'till we're ready for the evening  
Gettin' set, take a ride all around the town  
Then you tell me where you want to go  
  
When the light comes down  
We're gonna button up tight  
And lose this daytime frown  
We're gonna smile all night long  
Hey mamma and I know  
That you'll never be lonely  
want to show you  
That you'll never be sad  
  
When the light comes down  
We're gonna cuddle up close  
We're gonna paint this town  
We're gonna rub their noses  
  
Baby when the light comes down  
Yes when the light comes down  
Baby when the light comes down  
Yes when the light comes down  
Yes when the lights come down  
When the light comes down
