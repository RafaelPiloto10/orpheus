K.C.  
Take another sip-o-wine  
You gotta get her off your mind  
You can talk about your heartbreak to me  
Ok, K.C. I wish it could be easy  
Just another lesson of the heart  
K.C.  
We were feelin' out of place  
So we made our own escape  
In that New York cafe place to be  
Outsider, traveler you and me  
We were laughing about it  
Kept us out of reach  
I won't forget that night  
I won't forget that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with all your pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake  
You said we'll still be sitting  
Here again someday,  
Laughing at ourselves this way  
After time has healed and made it right  
We'll still be looking in each other's eyes  
And through it all  
It's friends who will survive  
I won't forget that night  
I won't forget that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake  
I won't forget that night  
I won't forge that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with all your pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake
