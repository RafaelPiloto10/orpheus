Oooo (x5)  
Verse 1:  
Its been so many days  
So many hours  
Since we went our separate ways  
And I'm still here missing you  
What am I supposed to do?  
When there's  
So many things  
That remind me of  
That times that we shared  
Just the two of us  
I can't understand it..  
Why does it have to be this way..  
Tell me what..  
Chorus:  
Baby..what do I do..  
When im..so in love with you  
I could never..never ever  
Love this way again say...  
Ooooo(5x)  
Verse 2:  
Lying in the bed..  
We used to share..  
The only thing missing..  
Is your not here..  
I Reminisce on the love we made  
You used to drive me crazy  
When you said my name  
And when you kissed me there  
Ohh baby..ohhh wee baby..  
Tell me what do I say?  
What do I do..  
When I'm still in love with you  
Chorus (x2)  
oooo (x5)  
Bridge:  
What did I do to deserve this  
All I ever wanted was to make you happy  
Baby tell me where did we go wrong  
I need to know..where is the love (x2)
