She never knew the meaning of the word  
Or ever heard or felt of freedom  
All she knew was looking out from windows  
Streaked with her own tears and her own shadows  
Within a cage, tried to escape  
The silent rage  
Cause no one ever listened  
Behind her back, she's both wings tied  
She will break free  
She will not be denied  
  
And so she  
She flies alone  
High into the great unknown  
And no one there to tell her where to go  
So she flies  
Sweet butterfly  
  
Counting every second, minutes turn to hours  
Seems like years  
The wait's eternal  
Finally passed the point of all lost hope  
She will break free  
She will not be denied, oh no  
  
And so she  
She flies alone  
High into the great unknown  
And no one there to tell her where to go  
So she flies  
Like a butterfly, oh  
Yeah  
  
Within a cage  
Tried to escape the silent rage  
But no one ever listened  
Behind her back  
She's both wings tied  
She will break free  
She will not be denied  
  
So she  
She flies alone  
High into the great unknown  
She don't need me to tell her where to go  
Sweet little butterfly  
  
So she  
She flies alone  
Up into the great unknown  
She don't need me to tell her where she goes  
So she flies  
  
Within a cage  
Tried to escape the silent rage  
Where no one ever listened  
Behind her back  
She's both wings tied  
She will break free  
She will break free  
Sweet butterfly
