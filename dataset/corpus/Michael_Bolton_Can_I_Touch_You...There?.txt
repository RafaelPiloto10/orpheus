Baby, show me what you feel  
Come to me, show me somethin' real  
I need to know, I need you completely  
Closer baby closer, come on let's begin  
Love is takin' over, gotta let it in  
Ooh I need to feel the heart of you  
Need to reach the very deepest part of you  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I touch you there, touch you deep inside  
Can I touch your heart, the way you're touchin' mine  
Can I touch you there, touch you deep within  
Can I touch you there, can I touch you...there  
  
Baby tell me with your eyes, tell me every secret darlin'  
Every deep desire, till you and I are makin' love completely  
Closer baby closer, can't be close enough  
I can't help the way I hold you  
I just hunger for your love  
Ooh and I need to feel the heart of you  
Need to reach the very deepest part of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I want to do is touch ya baby  
Touch the very soul inside of you  
Ooh and I need to feel the heart of you  
Need to reach the very deepest part of you  
Let me be the one to show you just what love can do  
  
[Chorus]
