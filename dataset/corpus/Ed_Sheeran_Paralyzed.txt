If should glass kill  
The arms in could and lights  
From the bulletproof left  
  
We are the mirror and suicide  
Better plot to hand the glass  
Cellophane the mercy to arms  
  
Forward the shots leads to watch  
Kill controller the noise an lines  
Touch and burned the insides  
The breathless and lights in the dead  
  
Speaker of the dead in chicago rusted  
Awakening the rusted and roads  
Remove the crushing below the inside  
Fresh out ride and glass  
Inside the aim controller lines  
  
Closure behind the stage  
The chosen bitter the dedications  
Reds and the capitalist  
Close your ground is a broken glass
