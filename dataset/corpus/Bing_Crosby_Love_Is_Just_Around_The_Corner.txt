Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,  
Can't you see? Oh, you have captured me!  
Being so glamorous, now can't you be amorous just with me,  
Make it soon, Cop a look at that moon.  
  
Love is just around the corner,  
Any cozy little corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
When I'm around you.  
  
I'm a sentimental mourner,  
And I couldn't be forlorner,  
When you keep me on that corner,  
Just waiting for you.  
  
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,  
But strictly between us,  
You are cuter than Venus,  
And what's more you've got arms!  
  
Let's go cuddle in a corner,  
Any cozy little corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
And I'm around you.  
  
Love is just around the corner,  
Any cozy corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
When I'm around you.  
  
I'm ten times as faithful,  
As all your other men,  
They all are true to no one but you,  
But me I'm true to ten.  
  
Oh, let's go cuddle in a cozy corner,  
Any cozy little corner,  
Love is just around the corner,  
And I'm around you.
