How 'bout a tear for the year of 1960  
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall  
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall  
How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble  
That was brewing in the Asian way  
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A.  
In the city of the lost and found  
It's hard to get a break  
Hard to stop from getting turned around  
And make the same mistakes  
My reputation's on the line  
The final day of '59  
But like the sun, just watch me shine  
Today  
How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso  
I practiced 61 minutes a day  
I could never reach the keys  
But it was all OK  
How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother  
That could brighten up the darkest nights  
It's just another sign of love  
Whenever we would fight  
It's all the same twenty years ago  
As it is right now  
Like a tour at the closing show  
When I take my bow  
My reputation's on the line  
At the start of '79  
But like the sun, just watch me shine  
Today  
I've played this part so many times  
Since the end of '59  
But like the sun, just watch me shine  
Today
