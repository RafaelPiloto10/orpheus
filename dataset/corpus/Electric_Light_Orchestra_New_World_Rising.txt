New dawn, smiling down the old blue world  
Can you feel it like the first of spring?  
The bells are ringing out a little tune for you  
  
Daylight, everyone hears the sound  
Hey, goodmornin', how you doin'? Well, I'm doin' fine  
It's nearly nine, I must be gone  
  
I see no sorrow now  
Nobody has a care  
  
Hey there, why don't you join me? I'll be glad to know you  
Take some time out, would you like to work or play  
Or wander slowly through this bright new day?  
  
Everyone laughs, can't believe what's goin' on 'round here  
New world risin', everybody kicked their blues away  
Not for today but evermore  
  
I see no sorrow now  
Nobody has a care  
  
New day, smiling down on the world  
Can you feel it like the first of spring?  
The bells are ringing out a little tune for you
