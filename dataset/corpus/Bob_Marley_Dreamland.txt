There's a land that I have heard about  
  
So far across the sea (repeat)  
  
To have you all, my dreamland  
  
Would be like heaven to me (repeat)  
  
  
  
We'll get our breakfast from the tree  
  
We'll get our honey from the bees  
  
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls  
  
And all the glories, we'll have them all  
  
  
  
And we'll live together on that dreamland  
  
And have so much fun (repeat)  
  
Oh, what a time that will be  
  
Oh yes, we'll wait, wait, wait and see  
  
We'll count the stars up in the sky...  
  
  
  
...And surely we'll never die
