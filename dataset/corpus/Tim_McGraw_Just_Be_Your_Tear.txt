Don't know why he does what he does, playin' lost and found with your love  
Tryin' to confuse you use you girl he gonna lose you sure enough  
Don't know why he says all those things, always shootin' down all your dreams  
He oughta know better than that, he oughta be watchin' his back, cause you
know, you know  
  
Girl I love the shine in your eyes, if only just for a moment girl I'd be
satisfied  
If I could only touch your cheek, maybe that's all I need to make my life
complete  
'Cause girl I can make you smile  
If you knew that I was here, wishin' I could just be your tear  
  
I don't know why he can't find the words, sayin' all those things you deserve  
Girl if it was me there, I swear, you know you wouldn't have to feel so unsure  
About what tomorrow might bring, girl you know I'd give everything  
If I could just hold you like him, if I could be more than just friends,
'cause you know, you know  
  
Girl I love the shine in your eyes, if only just for a moment girl I'd be
satisfied  
If I could only touch your cheek, maybe that's all I need, to make my life
complete  
'Cause girl I can make you smile  
If you knew that I was here, wishin' I could just be your tear  
  
Girl I love the shine in your eyes, if only just for a moment girl I'd be
satisfied  
If I could only touch your cheek, maybe that's all I need to make my life
complete  
'Cause girl I can make you smile  
If you knew that I was here, wishin' I could just be your tear  
  
Your tear, your tear, wishin' I could just be your tear, your tear, your tear,
