Come all you fair and tender ladies  
Take warning how you court your men  
There like a star on a summer morning  
They first appear and then there gone  
  
They'll tell to you some loving story  
Then they make you think that they love you well  
Then away they'll go to court some other  
And leave you there in grief to dwell  
  
(mandolin break)  
  
I wish I was on some tall mountain  
Where the ivy rocks are black as ink  
I'd write a letter to my false true lover  
Whose cheeks are like the morning dew  
  
(dorbo and fiddle solo)  
  
Oh love is handsome love is charming  
And love is pretty while it's new  
But love grows cold as love grows old  
And fades away like morning dew  
  
(repeat chours)
