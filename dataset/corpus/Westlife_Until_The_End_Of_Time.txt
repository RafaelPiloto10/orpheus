  
  
  
  
Until the end of time  
  
I'm longing for you  
  
And if you feel the same  
  
Then show me your love  
  
I'll give you everything that money can't buy  
  
And I'll promise I'll be right by you side  
  
  
I imagine being wrapped up in your  
  
And feeling your heartbeat  
  
And I find myself longing to hold you close  
  
It's how I feel  
  
'Cause I've been through a lot of these years  
  
And I have lost the count of my tears  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
Until the end of time  
  
I'm longing for you  
  
And if you feel the same  
  
Then show me your love  
  
I'll give you everything that money can't buy..(can't buy)  
  
And I'll promise I'll be right by you side..(til the end of time)  
  
  
If only you could tell me what's on your mind  
  
And show how you feel  
  
And I wonder where you are heading this time  
  
And where you belong  
  
'Cause I know that if you would be here  
  
I'll do anything 'cause my love is real  
  
Even though moments are sad  
  
I look into your eyes and  
  
I know this will last  
  
CHORUS x2  
  
Things that money can't buy x3
