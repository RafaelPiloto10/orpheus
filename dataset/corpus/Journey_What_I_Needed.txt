Missing something in my life  
Searching for it day and night  
Couldn't seem to get it right  
'Til you walked my way  
Leaving lovers one by one  
Didn't like who I'd become  
Couldn't face myself, I turn and run  
Made me see that I could change  
  
Out of my darkness  
As I step into the light  
We get a new day  
Taking one step at a time  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
You made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Girl, you were my rescue  
All I needed was you  
  
I used to always get my way  
Told me that you wouldn't stay  
Had to face it, what you had to say  
If I wanted you  
You tell me when I did you wrong  
I guess I've known it all along  
Cared enough and you stood strong  
I believed in you  
  
In my frustrations  
Tried to become someone else  
The years I've wasted  
I'd been lying to myself  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
You made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Hear me calling  
What I needed  
What I needed was you  
  
In you I found shelter  
How you believed in me, stood strong  
You were there through my darkest hour  
You lifted my spirit up  
Brought out the best in me  
And now I'll stand before you with all my love  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
But you made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Girl you were my rescue  
What I needed was you
