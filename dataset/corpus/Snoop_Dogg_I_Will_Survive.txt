[Technique]  
By dawn's early light  
I shine brighter than the stars in the night  
And 'bout ready for a fight  
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice  
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon  
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun  
I'm torching hot and all the same  
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein  
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown  
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome  
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me  
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey  
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]  
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now?  
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow  
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step  
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck  
High profile, but my style low-pro  
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O.  
And I blow the best indo, that you know of  
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love  
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now  
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle  
[Technique]  
They say, what's a rapper? Well nigga, what's an emcee?  
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me  
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof  
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth  
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last?  
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash  
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now  
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle  
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]  
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang  
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game  
He so sprung, on top of that he young  
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold  
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees  
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies  
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game  
Now they 'bout to take him out the game  
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go  
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll ??  
[Chorus]: Kurupt,(Snoop),  
I'd rather not get shot  
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots  
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all DPG (DPG)  
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy  
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive  
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family, it's all DPG (DPG)  
[Technique]  
(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted  
But I'm unlisted in the books  
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW!  
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard 'til I win  
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, 'til the end  
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green  
And all my life I got advice from a superior team  
I gotta stay away from the casket  
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted  
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso-  
Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e  
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]  
Snoop Dogg, smooth and imperial  
Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials  
Time's getting drastic, man I'm a flas it  
Dogg Pound Gangstas' choking off that boombastic  
Have you ever heard?  
I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof  
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft  
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash,  
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash  
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime  
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime?  
Sometimes I used to pack, one time I got jacked by some sacs  
But you know I got mine, you know about the Don Corleone  
I'm-a survive and thank God for Lil' Spanky B. and Bone  
[Chorus]: Kurupt,(Snoop),
