I'm tired enough ooh I'm tired  
And I feel so weighed down  
I don't want failure while my whole life  
Waits around  
I need a love just like the rest  
And I've waited now so long  
I don't take what I can  
So I don't find love within  
Ooh give me a chance to show some affection  
Let something show  
I'm the one that said it I'm the one that needs you now  
  
Ooh give me love  
Give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
Give me love, give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
  
I'm with you now and that's all right  
But I need some more than your touch  
Show me where vour heart lies  
Now I feel like letting loose  
I could fall so easy for you  
And I wouldn't even try  
Your love lies lost in me  
Keep on kissing mine goodbye  
Ooh say the words say get lonely  
Just let me know  
You never will regret it  
And you'll never be lonely again  
  
Ooh give me love  
Give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
Give me love, give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
  
Love don't take it away  
Don't throw it away  
On somebody I know there's no one else  
Who needs you more than me  
  
Ooh give me love  
Give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter  
Give me love, give me love and laughter  
Give me love, love, love and laughter
