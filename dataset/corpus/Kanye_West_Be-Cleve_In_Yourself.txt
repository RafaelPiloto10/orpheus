I know what it's like to feel down little girl  
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up  
No, I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown  
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan  
No plan, a lost man, raisin my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham  
My quest success, but my life was a mess  
Poor Kenny West, no zest, antidepressed  
Not dressed to impress  
Matter fact more stressed  
Than John Mayer waiting on his aids test  
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large  
Took me out of my car  
Now I'm in his garage  
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration  
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian  
My game was timid now my flow much bolder  
Got a chubby brown angel sittin on my shoulder, sayin  
(Girl singing)  
You know, it don't matter what you do  
Cuz I'll always be there for you  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Grow a mustache  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Slap your wife's ass  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Never smoke grass  
Be-Cleve in yourself  
[Cleveland:] Really pass gas  
Be-Cleve in yourself! Goodnight!
