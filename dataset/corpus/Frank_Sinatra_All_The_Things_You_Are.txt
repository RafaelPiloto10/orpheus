Time and again I've longed for adventure  
Something to make my heart beat much faster  
What did I long for, I never really knew.  
Finding your love, I found my adventure,  
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster  
All that I want in all of this world is you.  
  
You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.  
You are the angel glow that lights the star,  
The dearest things I know are what you are.  
Someday my happy arms will hold you,  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine.
