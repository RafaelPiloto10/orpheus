Turn the TV off  
Turn me on  
Disbelief confidence is gone  
You can take all this from me  
Stands my integrity (now)  
I'm so sick of mother fuckers  
Crooked wars that they wage  
  
Should I sit and count the seconds till were all blown away?  
Sex, tyrants, violence on the news everyday  
Ignorance turned anger into hate  
  
Turn away  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
  
Revolution  
Now you're gone and it's forever  
Nothing is the same  
Right to wrong we'll come together  
Time to make a change  
  
Turn the TV off  
Turn me on  
Disbelief confidence is gone  
You can take all this from me  
Stands my integrity (now)  
And these wars that we wage  
  
Why?  
An eye for an eye  
So I lock, load, engage  
Casualty high supply  
We'll be missing all our friends who die to get us by  
Courage facing fear  
Hate increase decline  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
Strength in diversity, unity, and evolution  
  
Revolution  
Turn the TV off  
Turn me on  
Disbelief confidence is gone  
If you take all of this from me  
Then all of you can (come together)  
  
[Chorus]
