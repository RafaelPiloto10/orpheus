All she ever wanted  
When the day turned indigo,  
Was to leave her grubby life behind her  
To the buzzing streets below  
  
Tainted passion and temptation  
Led her down a trail of lust  
Now the fate of Faye Delroy  
Is written in the dust  
Written in the dust  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh my rockin' chair  
Rock me tender in the night air  
Oh my rockin' chair  
Rock me back and make me be there  
  
She said her head don't move the same way  
That their hand usually does  
That she's got memory bubble  
Almost like the rest of us  
And ADD salamanders  
Cannot figure what to wear  
And they'll be standing in the closet  
And every dress is Savoir faire  
Every dress is Savoir faire  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Rock me here rock me there  
Rock me in my rockin' chair  
  
My oh my, rock me tender in the night air  
  
Za va ba, za ba bi ya. ca va pas? za ba bi ya  
Romeo Boys, they'll b dancing with the Cha Cha Girlz  
  
[Chorus: x2]
