Chorus:  
  
Sometimes Alleluia,  
Sometimes Praise The Lord  
Sometimes Gently Singing,  
Our Hearts In One Accord  
  
Oh let us lift our voices,  
Look toward the sky and start to sing  
Oh let us now return His love,  
Just let our voices ring  
Oh let us feel His presence,  
Let the sound of praises fill the air  
Oh let us sing the song of Jesus' love,  
To people everywhere.  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh let our joy be unconfined,  
Let us sing with freedom unrestrained  
Let's take this feeling that we're feeling now,  
Outside these walls and let it rain.  
Oh let the Spirit overflow,  
As we are filled from head to toe.  
We love you Father, Son and Holy Ghost,  
And we want this world to know.  
  
Chorus
