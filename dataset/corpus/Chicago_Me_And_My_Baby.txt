Roxie.  
Look at my baby my baby and me..  
  
Me and my baby  
My baby and me  
We're 'bout as happy as babies can be  
What if I find  
That I'm causght in a storm?  
I don't care  
My baby's there  
And baby's bound to keep me warm  
We're sticking together  
And ain't we got fun  
So much together  
You'd count us as one  
Tell old man worry to go climb a tree  
'cause I've got my baby  
I'm with my baby  
Look at my baby and me  
  
Looka my baby  
My baby and me  
A dream of a duo  
Now don't you agree  
Why keep it mum  
When there's nothing to hid?  
And what I feel  
I must reveal  
It's more that I can keep inside  
And I can assure you  
It won't go away  
Let me assur you  
It grow every day  
I was a one once  
But now I' a 'we'  
'cause I got my baby  
My dear little baby  
Looka my baby and me  
  
Roxie and boys.  
Looka my baby  
My baby and me  
Facing the world  
Optimistically  
Nothing can stop us  
So nobody try  
'cause baby's rough  
And full of stuff  
And incidentally, so am I  
Get out of our way, folks  
And give us some room  
Watch how we bubble  
And blossom and bloom  
Life was a prison  
But we got the key  
Me and my baby  
My dear little baby  
My cute little baby  
My sweet little baby  
My fat little baby  
My soft little baby  
My pink little baby  
My bald little baby  
Looka my baby  
  
Roxie.  
And me...
