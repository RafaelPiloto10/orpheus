Lit up like the 4th I'm a happy drunk come to papa big momma 'cause your  
Daddy's drunk I want to pump pump pump it up like the Goodyear blimp make  
You high for a dollar that's the way I pimp gold links and minks and shrimp  
Dinners on the bayou them is all of the things that ain't gonna by you it's  
Like one of them freak things hit it every kinda week things I got no love  
I got no riches I don't roll vogues and I ain't got switches, I got no game,  
I can't reward you, but if you want a long one  
  
I got one for ya'  
This is your shot  
Uh-huh, check it  
  
People always talkin' what they gonna do, they must want their face to maybe  
Taste my shoe, I can't understand all the push and shove, and what the fuck  
Happened to the peace and love?, who planted that glove? Man I don't care I'm  
Too busy running fingers through your momma's hair, I got no time for the  
Fakes and the phonies, the crooks and the cops and the cronies, am I the only  
One on my side? Test my pride and I bet you'd run and hide, you think I'm  
Weak so your looking for the kill, but there's 16 shots in my 9 mil and  
  
I got one for ya'  
This is your shot  
Jimmy a jimmy jimmy jimmy, I like that  
Yeah, lay it down brother, oh well  
  
Record companies stressin' that they all want hits, and yeah I'm body body,  
So I make 'em like this, they say "hey there boy all we need is one song."  
"Shorten up that hook, we don't need it that long." Don't want to hear me cuss  
Don't want to hear me brag, so I'm grabbing on my thingy while I let my pants  
Sag. Now a bit what I'm writin' what I'm doin', they say they like my records  
But they still boo-hooin', my joint's always tight, my rhymes will floor ya',  
Hey fly you want money?  
  
I got one for ya' bite that ass  
I got one for ya' here it is  
This is your shot-uh-huh  
We got one for ya, baby, me and Kid Rock

Gonna rock and gonna roll and gonna rock and roll  
I like that
