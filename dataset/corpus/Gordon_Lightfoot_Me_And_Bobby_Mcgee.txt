Busted flat in Baton Rouge  
Waiting for a train,  
When I's feelin' as fadded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down  
Just before it rained  
It rode us all the way from New Orleans  
  
I pulled my harpoon out my dirty red bandanna  
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues  
Winsheild wipers slappin' time  
I's holdin' Bobby's hand in mine  
And we sang every song that driver knew  
  
Freedom's just another word  
For nothing left to loose  
Well nothing ain't nothing hun if it ain't free (da da)  
And feeling good was easy lord when he sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me (da da)  
Good enough ffor me and my Bobby mcgee  
  
From the Kentucky cold mines  
To the California Sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Through all kinds of weather,  
Through everything we'd done  
My Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold  
One day a misleading lord  
I let him slip away  
He's looking for that home  
And I hope he finds it  
Well I'd trade enough tomorrows for one single yesterday  
To be holding Bobby's body next to mine  
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to loose  
Now nothing, well that's all that Bobby left me  
Well feeling good was easy lord when he sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me mm hmm and my Bobby
mcgee la da da da da (ect) my Bobby Mcgee la da da da da ect  
Hey don't boss my Bobby mcgee  
Oh I call him my lover, I call him my man, I'll call him my lover, do the best
I can c'mon and my Bobby oh and my Bobby, Bobby Mcgee lo la lola lo  
Hey hey hey Bobby Mcgee
