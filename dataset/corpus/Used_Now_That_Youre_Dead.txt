"I began to spoke, my brain's holding the grip of a giant vice  
It was all very good  
Floating higher and higher, a wonderful feeling"  
  
Die! Die! Die!  
  
I'm watching closely just to see  
So I can rest in peace  
I put my face close, make sure you're not breathing  
You look so nice, so pretty dress  
You're painted skin can say the rest  
Until they bury you, I won't believe it  
  
Breathing! Not breathing! Breathing! Not breathing!  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
  
Breathing! Not breathing! Breathing!  
  
I see that nothing in your eyes  
Could turn me cold as ice  
I steal a kiss to make sure you're not breathing  
We picked you out a pretty cage  
Scribbled some bullshit on the grave  
Until they bury you I won't believe it  
  
Breathing! Not breathing! Breathing! Not breathing!  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
  
Life, as precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
As precious as it is, I've waited for this day  
I've waited for your death, for you to fade away  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
  
How can it feel so right when it's so right?  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on  
You're not like Jesus Christ, you're just gone  
Now that you're dead, it's gonna turn me on
