This is a truth adjust  
Has to be told, it must  
We spread amongst us so the world can hear it  
We got to get it right  
This time, if we just fight  
Innocence starts tonight  
If we can heal it  
  
[Bridge]  
We look to our leaders with the lies they try to feed us  
Like a knife they try to bleed us  
And they cut us real slow  
  
[Chorus]  
So go,  
Just go  
Just go  
You hide behind your mask of desperation  
Go  
Just go  
Just go  
I won't surrender to the last temptation  
  
You have no dignity  
I have no sympathy  
You are my enemy  
But I can't see you  
  
No matter where you run  
Thy kingdom will be done  
A rocket to the sun  
Is where I see you  
  
Endless senses get ecstatic  
Overflow is automatic  
Feel the need to feel erratic  
Don't deny it let it flow  
  
So go,  
Just go  
Just go  
You hide behind your mask of desperation  
Go  
Just go  
Just go  
I won't surrender to this fake salvation  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
