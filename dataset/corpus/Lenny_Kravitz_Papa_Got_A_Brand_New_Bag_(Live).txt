James Brown  
Come here sister  
Papa's in the swing  
He ain't too hip  
About that new breed babe  
  
Lenny Kravitz  
He ain't no drag  
Papa's got a brand new bag  
  
Lenny Kravitz  
Come here mama  
And dig this crazy scene  
He's not too fancy  
But his line is pretty clean  
  
James Brown  
He ain't no drag  
He's got a brand new bag, ha!  
  
Lenny Kravitz  
He's doing the Jerk  
The Fly  
  
James Brown  
Don't play him cheap  
'Cause you know he ain't shy  
  
Lenny Kravitz  
He's doing the Monkey  
  
James Brown
