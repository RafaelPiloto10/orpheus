A sea of smile and a river of tears  
A flood of memories  
Imagination will take me back  
I'll be with you  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
A summer's night, the stars aglow  
Did more than light the sky  
With fortune, fantasy, and fate  
We dream on an old park bench  
I take your hand in my hand  
You hold my soul in yours  
One touch becomes eternal  
When falling in love  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
I see her still and she is beautiful  
I see her beautiful face  
And her beautiful eyes  
And her beautiful ways  
And her beautiful soul  
And this love lifts me higher  
I search her eyes and see the skies  
The heavens of her life  
Just one more glimpse into her soul  
Is all I ask  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
A sea of smiles and a river of tears  
A flood of memories  
And now she's gone  
On an Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench  
Old Park Bench
