Take away,  
these hands of darkness.  
Reaching for my soul.  
Now, the cold wind  
blows out my candles.  
Feeling,  
only fear,  
without any hope.  
  
A thousand dark moons.  
A thousand winters long.  
A million fallen stars,  
the candle burns in the womb  
  
We try not to forget,  
they live through us.  
Slowly they die away at every candle's end  
  
A thousand dark moons,  
A thousand winters long.  
A million fallen stars,  
the candle burns in the womb.  
  
We try not to forget,  
They live through us  
Slowly they die away at every candle's end.
