Everywhere I look I see her smile  
Her absent-minded eyes  
And she has kept me wondering for so long  
How this thing could go wrong  
It seems to me that we are both the same  
Playing the same game  
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart  
Into a riddle of her heart.  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt ("the one" alternately with "someone") I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Days like these no one should be alone  
No heart should hide away  
Her touch is gently conquering my mind  
There's nothing words can say  
She's colored all the secrets of my soul  
I've whispered all my dreams  
But just as nightime falls this vision falls apart  
Into a riddle of her heart, yea  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt the one I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Don't hide your eyes...  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt someone I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt the one I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
She's so vulnerable...
