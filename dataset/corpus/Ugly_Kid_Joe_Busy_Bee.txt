Everybody's alright with me  
Possibly you'll disagree  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
  
Everybody's alright with me  
That's just the way I choose to be  
Everybody's on my mind  
Can't sit aside and watch this world go by  
That ain't me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
  
Everybody does their time  
The people walk in crooked lines  
Everybody's got their choice  
But often we don't use our voice  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
How could you be so blind?  
Some people they just ain't satisfied  
Watch the world go by  
  
I always hear the school bell ring  
Let the children dance and sing  
Just let us find what's been lost  
So many people get torn and tossed away  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
World go bye  
World go bye  
World go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
  
Nice ending bit  
Everybody's alright with me
