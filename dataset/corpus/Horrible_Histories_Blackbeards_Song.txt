[Verse 1]  
When I was a nipper  
I boarded a clipper  
Sailed the seas as a goods importer, oh!  
  
[Verse 2]  
Edward Teach is my name  
But I earned my fame  
As Blackbeard the pirate of the water, oh!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Was a jolly chap  
With a jaunty cap  
Always gave my crew good quarter, oh!  
But I'm best known for  
Blood and guts and gore  
And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Best known for  
Blood and guts and gore  
And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!  
  
[Verse 5]  
Left my home in Bristol  
With a sword and pistol  
Bid a fond farewell  
To old Blighty, oh!  
  
[Verse 6]  
What my enemies feared  
Was my thick, black beard  
Which I always enjoyed  
Setting light to, oh!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Once I had a thing  
For a captive's lovely ring  
That shone like a jewel in the nighty, oh!  
When the man said no  
I just said 'Oh! '  
And chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio! '  
  
[Hook]  
Man said no  
He said 'Oh! '  
Chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio! '  
  
[Verse 8]  
Oh, I love to sail the ocean  
With my flag that inspired emotion  
With it's smiling pile of skull and bones  
Smashing hearts with a violent stabbing motion  
  
[Verse 9]  
And I love to escape detection  
And to win my crew's affection  
Which was nothing to do with the twelve guns he wore  
On his belt that were for protection  
  
[Verse 10]  
I was awfully nice  
But I had the odd vice  
Which occasionally caused a commotion  
The thing that I'd do  
Was shoot members of my crew  
If they didn't show enough devotion  
  
[Bridge]  
The thing he'd do  
Was shoot members of the crew  
If they didn't show enough devotion  
  
[Verse 11]  
Once when very irate  
I shot my first mate, Israel Hans  
For a bit of pleasure, oh!  
And when my debt's grew  
Killed half of my crew  
To increase my share of the treasure, oh!  
  
[Verse 12]  
Was doing well then  
Seemed to run out of men  
My captives boarded at their leisure, oh!  
Smoted me dead  
Then cut off my head  
And displayed it on my mast for good measure, oh!  
  
[Outro]  
Smoted him dead  
Chopped off his head  
Displayed it on the mast for good measure, oh!
