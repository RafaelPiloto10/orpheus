Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!  
Girl was so kind.  
Kind of love I'd never seen  
Only last summer, it's not so long ago...  
Just last summer, now musk winds blow...  
  
Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!  
Girl was so kind.  
Kind of love I'd never seen  
Only last summer, it's not so long ago...  
Just last summer, now musk winds blow...  
  
Chalk underfoot, life I should prove  
Dancing in heat, our love and you...  
  
Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!  
Girl was so kind.  
Kind of love I'd never seen  
Only last summer, it's not so long ago...  
Just last summer, now musk winds blow...
