Zwei drei vier one two three  
Its easy to see  
But its not that I don't care so  
Cause I hear it all the time  
But they never let you know  
On the TV and the radio  
She was young her heart was pure  
But every night is bright she got  
She said sugar is sweet  
She come rappin' to the beat  
Then I knew that she was hot  
  
She was singin  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
You're in his eye  
And you'll know why  
The more you live  
The faster you will die  
  
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?  
  
She said babe you know  
I miss Jill and Joe  
And all my funky friends  
But my street understanding  
was just enough to know what she really meant  
And I got to thinking while she was talking  
That I know she told the story  
Of those special places that she goes  
When she rides with the others in the subway  
  
Singin'  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
And if he talks to you  
And you don't know why  
You say your life  
Is gonna make you die...  
  
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?  
  
Well we meet Jill and Joe  
And brother Herr  
And the whole cool gang (and oh)  
They're rappin' here they're rappin' there  
But she's climbin' on the wall  
Its a clear case, Herr Kommissar  
Cause all the children know  
They're all slidin' down into the valley  
They're all slipping on the same snow  
  
Hear the children  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
He's got the power  
And you're so weak  
And you're frustration will not let you speak  
  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
And if he talks to you  
Then you'll know why  
The more you live  
The faster you will die  
  
Don't turn around, oh oh  
Der Kommissar's in town, oh oh  
(repeat x5)
