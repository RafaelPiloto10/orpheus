Our generations  
Sees the world not the same as before  
We might as well just throw it all  
And live like there's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow  
  
We are the ones  
Who are living under the gun everyday  
You might be gone before you know  
So live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
  
Believe it  
The official view of the world has changed  
In a whole new way  
Live fast cause if you don't take it  
You'll never make it  
  
So if you understand me  
And if you feel the same  
Then you will know what nitro means  
You'll live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
There's no tomorrow
