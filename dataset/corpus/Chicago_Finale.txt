Thank you. Roxie and I would just like to thank you - for  
You faith and your belief in our innocence.  
  
Roxie:  
Yes, it was letters, telegrams, and words of encouragement  
That helped see us through this terrible ordeal of ours.  
  
Velma:  
You know, a lot of people has lost faith in America.  
  
Roxie:  
And for what America stands for.  
  
Velma:  
But we are the living examples of what a wonderful country this is.  
  
Roxie:  
So we'd just like to say thank you and God Bless you.  
  
Velma and Roxie:  
God bless you.  
Thank you and God bless you... Chorus:  
God be with you. No,  
God walk with you always. I'm no one's wife  
God bless you. But, oh,  
God bless you. I love my life...
