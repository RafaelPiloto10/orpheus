There'll come a time when all of this is over  
Something else will grow and take it's place  
The brand new car:scrap metal in a junkyard  
The children playing will grow up and leave home  
  
Put it away this dream you can't stop dreaming  
Put it away this anger and desire  
The open road is infinitely hopeful  
Take all those memories and throw them in the fire  
  
And don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself anymore  
  
There's old man on a warm and sunny island  
No job, no money, just a smile to call his own  
Know what he says?. "The past will only haunt you.  
Live for today. Each day's an open door  
  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself anymore  
  
Nothing to lose is nothing to fight over  
The shining stars!  
They've seen it all before.  
  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself anymore  
  
Dust keeps coming. Rust keeps coming. Weeds keep growing. Seeds keep growing  
Where you going?
