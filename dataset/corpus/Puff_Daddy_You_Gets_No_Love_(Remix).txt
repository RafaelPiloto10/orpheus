[Intro: Faith Evans (P. Diddy)]  
Uh, uh-uh, (There's another one)  
What-what (And another one)  
This is the remix (There's another one) Ha ha  
I know it's not too ghetto (And another one, Bad Boy)  
I know it's not too ghetto  
Pedigree (Pedigree baby) I said I know it's not to ghetto  
Donaway (Faith, Faithfully, the remix)  
You better, check yourself respect yourself  
You better go for self because I flow for self  
  
[Verse 1: Faith Evans]  
I'll tell you why there's no love, simply you're not cool enough  
For what we had between us, don't you know you lost my trust  
People ask me where you've been (Where you've been)  
And I tell them were just friends (Tell them we're just friends)  
Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us  
No no oh no (No)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Played with my emotions (Played)  
You gets no devotion (And you gets no love, gets no love)  
You can't get no love from me  
You can't even be my friend (Be my friend)  
And you gets no love again  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch  
(You gets no love from me)  
  
[Verse 2: Faith Evans]  
Tell you why we can't hook up (You gets no love)  
Cause I had about enough (You gets no love)  
Hearin all the lies you tell (You gets no love)  
Boy I thought I knew you well  
People think that your my man (People think that your my man)  
They don't even understand (They don't even understand)  
Just because I let you get some that don't make you the one  
We ain't even in love (You know you played with my....)  
  
[Chorus: Faith Evans]  
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion  
You gets no love, you can get no love from me  
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)  
And you gets no love again  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch  
  
([P. Diddy:] Yo! Faith let 'em know!!)  
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit  
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit  
I know y'all sick of this Bad Boy diva  
That blows and plus got flows ridiculous  
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit  
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit  
It's the chick from the bricks that got the hot shit  
Left you sick from the single now check the remix  
Boy you had a clue, thought we had a cool relationship  
But you couldn't handle it (You couldn't handle it)  
  
[Verse 3: G. Dep (P. Diddy)]  
Yo! At the end of the day what a playa 'gon do? (Badboy)  
You got love for me, It's how supposed to be  
Same love I'm a land on you (Come on)  
Right back at you it's only natural  
So what I'm gon' do? Me  
Everything love ain't always lovely  
Leave it all up to me, I'll be livin in luxury, sucker free  
Without no lies without no ties to those that patronize  
That's why I don't socialize  
I eat, shit, even sleep with open eyes  
Just, give me that gasoline  
I'll move in the jag few bags of green  
Couple ads in the magazine  
All freezy and I'm easy G Deezy one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch  
You can't even be my friend, cause you gets no love again  
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again  
  
[Outro:]  
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion  
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again  
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion  
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again  
  
[Chorus: Faith Evans]  
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion  
You gets no love, you can get no love from me  
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)  
And you gets no love again  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
