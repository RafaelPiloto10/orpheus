There's gonna be some trouble  
A whole house will need re-building  
And everyone I love in the house  
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite soon  
Your father cracks a joke  
And in the usual way  
Empties the room  
  
Tell all of my friends  
I don't have too many  
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers  
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt  
Rush to danger  
Wind up nowhere  
Patric Doonan, raised to wait  
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just can't explain  
So I won't even try to  
  
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt  
Every jammy Stressford poet  
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists  
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists  
Underact, express depression  
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you  
I was tired again  
I've tried again, and  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just can't explain  
So I won't even try to  
  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Oh  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just can't explain  
So so  
So so so so so
