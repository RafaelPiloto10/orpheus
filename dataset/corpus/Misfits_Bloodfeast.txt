When they pull out her tongue  
Pull off her face, pluck out her eyes  
Well, the blood runs cold for  
  
When it drips from the mouth  
Be forewarned, be prepared  
For a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
And that blood's so real  
Because I just can't fake it  
And that blood's so real  
Because I just can't fake it  
  
When you think of severed heads  
Think of my face, think that you're alive  
Well, I guess I fooled you  
  
When you think of my face  
Think of your blood, think that you're dead  
'Cause it's a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
I'm possessing your death  
Possessing your blood  
Possessing your head  
'Cause it's a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
I'm possessing your heart  
Possessing your tongue  
Possessing your blood  
'Cause it just won't fake you  
  
And that blood's so real  
Because I just can't fake it  
And that blood's so real  
Because I just can't fake it  
And that blood, and that blood  
  
I'm possessing your death  
Possessing your blood  
Possessing your demise  
For a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
I'm possessing your heart  
Possessing your tongue  
Possessing your blood  
'Cause it just won't fake you  
  
And that blood's so real  
Because I just can't fake it  
And that blood's so real  
Because I just can't fake it  
And that blood, and that blood
