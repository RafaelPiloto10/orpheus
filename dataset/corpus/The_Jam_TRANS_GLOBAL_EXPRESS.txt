Ordinary people don't get time to think  
Not that it's their fault  
'cause you have to hustle and bustle about your work  
Just to make sure the food gets bought  
Goverments threaten you with recession  
Then they threaten you with war  
How the other side wants to take away  
All the things you ain't got no more  
Keep us divided with their greed and hate  
Keep you struggling to put the food on your plate.  
Imagine if tomorrow the workers went on strike  
Not just British Leyland but the whole world  
Who would earn their profits?  
Who would make their bombs?  
You'd see the hands of oppression fumble  
And their systems crash to the ground  
And you men in uniform will have to learn the lesson too  
Not to turn against your own kind  
Whenever governments tell you to.  
  
Get the trans-global express moving  
And see our marvelous leaders quiver  
They know that if it happens  
Their lazy days are over  
The day the working people join together  
We'll all rest much more easy  
The responsibility you must bear  
When it's your own future in your hands  
Maybe a hard one to face up to  
But at least you will own yourself!
