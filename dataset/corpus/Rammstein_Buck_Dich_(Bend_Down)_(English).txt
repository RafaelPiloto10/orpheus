Bend down, I command you  
Turn your face away from me  
Your face means nothing to me  
Bend down  
  
A human on all fours  
I take him on a walk  
Ambling along the corridor  
I am disappointed  
  
Now he comes backwards towards me  
Honey stays stuck on the garter  
I am disappointed, totally disappointed  
  
Bend down...  
Your face doesn't interest me  
  
The human has bent down  
And moved into a good light  
I show him what you can do  
And I start to cry  
  
The human stammers a prayer  
Out of fear because it goes worse for me  
He tried to bend down even more  
Tears run up the back  
  
Bend down...  
  
Bend down, I command you  
Turn your face away from me  
Your face means nothing to me  
Bend down once more  
  
Bend down...
