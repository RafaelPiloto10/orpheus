I walked you to your doorstep  
Believin' we could make a little love  
And I let you have my heart  
I was as certain as the stars above  
  
Looked here and there  
Every everywhere  
I even searched beyond the dawn  
But you were nowhere to be found  
And I was going round and round  
Lost like I'd never been born  
  
Time after time  
I've lost my love for a rhyme  
A reason seemed good enough  
You always put me down  
While you made me run around  
I can't take anymore of that stuff  
  
Time after time  
I've lost my love for a rhyme  
And my reason  
Seemed good enough  
You always put me down  
And you make me run around  
I can't take anymore of that stuff
