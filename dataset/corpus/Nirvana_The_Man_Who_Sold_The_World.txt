We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when  
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend  
Which came as a surprise I spoke into his eyes  
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago  
  
Oh no, not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world  
  
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home  
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed  
I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here  
We must have died along, a long long time ago  
  
Who knows? Not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world  
  
Who knows? Not me  
We never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world
