You can't see what you mean to me  
I just can't get you out of my head  
You move me more than I've ever been  
Like a wild supersonic jet  
But I can't see your love drifting away  
And I don't want your love d-d-d-drifting away  
  
I got told by a friend of mine  
That you don't want me anymore  
Now my friend's got a broken nose  
Sure, and I got a broken jaw  
So don't push me around, I'm coming your way  
And I don't want your love d-d-d-drifting away  
  
Don't you know what I'm living for?  
Don't you know what I'm trying to say?  
Don't try to shove me outta that door  
'Cause you're mine and it's staying that way  
I'm giving you my love, don't throw it away  
But I can see your love d-d-d-drifting away  
Oh, drifting away, you got me drifting away  
Oh, drifting away
