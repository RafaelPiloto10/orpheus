You slept your night now it's morning time  
That's the time to rise and shine  
Don't you cry and don't be blue  
Wakin' up is hard to do  
Just brush your teeth and then get dressed  
When you comb your hair you'll look the best  
Now you know it's really true  
Wakin' up is hard to do  
They say that wakin' up is hard to do  
Wear a smile don't you be blue  
Just wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Instead of going back to bed  
You got to stretch and face the day  
Just listen to the birdies sing  
And the flowers that await the spring  
Rise and shine, you're dreaming's through  
Wakin' up is hard to do  
They say that wakin' up is hard to do  
Wear a smile don't you be blue  
Just wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Instead of going back to bed  
You got to stretch and face the day  
Just listen to the birdies sing  
And the flowers that await the spring  
Rise and shine, you're dreaming's through  
Wakin' up is hard to do
