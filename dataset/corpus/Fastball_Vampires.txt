She will bring a little box of moonlight  
To light my way on such a very dark night  
Dreams so real they grow wild on the vine  
Until sundown, when she comes  
She comes just like a daydream  
  
And the sun surrenders to the evening  
I've waited all day long to be with you girl  
We'll burn like falling stars tonight  
And hide like vampires from the daylight  
Until sundown  
  
Dreams so real they grow wild on the vine  
We'll burn like falling stars tonight  
And hide like vampires from the daylight  
Our world comes alive at night  
And like the stars, they shine so bright  
  
As long as you are mine  
As long as you are mine  
As long as you are mine
