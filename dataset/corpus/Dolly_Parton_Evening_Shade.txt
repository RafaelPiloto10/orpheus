(Dolly Parton)  
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter  
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores  
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell  
In the water being used to scrub the floors  
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home  
She believed in lots of work with little play  
And we laughed till we bent double  
Though we knew we'd get in trouble  
But trouble's all we had at evening shade  
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding  
To teach you love and keep you off the streets  
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem  
Juvenile delinquents so to speak  
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger  
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate  
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared  
But they cared even less at evening shade  
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed  
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death  
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this  
And so I started talking plans with the older kids  
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene  
And I would get some matches when nobody seen  
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside  
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye  
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day  
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway  
Now that its all over and the sun is going down  
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground
