You look so sad like you lost your only friend.  
Don't feel so bad  
You can always try again.  
So don't hide  
Go seek  
Don't let the grass grow under your feet.  
Get out  
Get up  
Get on  
Get moving out  
  
Don't surrender  
Don't give up the fight.  
You give a little bit more  
If you want her back it's a full attack  
  
You give a little bit more.  
If you want to win  
You don't give in  
You give a little bit more.  
When you think you're through what you got to do is give a little bit more.  
She said good-bye  
So you tell yourself that's all.  
But your hands ain't tied why you make yourself so small.  
  
So don't hide  
Go seek  
Don't let the grass grow under your feet. . . .  
Don't give up the fight  
Got to keep on going with all your might  
  
Try hard  
Don't stop. Got to keep on giving it all you got.  
Never give up  
Never give up  
Never say die.  
Believe in I  
  
You can reach the top  
Got to give it a shot.  
Don't say no  
Got to get in the flow.  
So don't hide  
Go seek  
Don't crawl away  
  
Get back on your feet.  
Get out  
Get up  
Get on  
Get moving out.  
  
Don't surrender  
Don't give up the fight.  
You give a little bit more.  
And if you want her back it's a full attack  
You give a little bit more.  
If you want to win you don't give in  
You give a little bit more.  
When you think you're through what you got to do is give a little bit more  
You give a little bit more  
You give a little bit more
