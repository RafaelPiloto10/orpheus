Well I know that no one is to blame  
But do you feel my strength when you call my name  
'Cause I feel yours inside  
How could this be more right  
  
And I have travelled through my mind  
I've given all my dreams up to time  
Tell me what else can I do  
Well I'm nothing wothout you  
  
But you, you just don't know what to do  
I guess I'll have to lose my love for you  
These feelings cannot stay  
'Cause I'm withering away  
  
I'm withering away  
Withering away  
  
And teardrops are all that I can give  
But do you really know what true love is  
Don't let it slip away  
  
This doesn't happen everyday  
  
And you'd have no problems without me  
So take this song as my apology  
But you have closed my eyes  
's light shall never rise  
rise on me  
Shall never rise  
It shall never rise  
  
And I'm scared I'll never hold you again  
But I know that no one is to blame
