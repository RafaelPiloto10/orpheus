Take the world  
Shake and Stir  
And that's what I got goin' on  
  
I throw my cares  
Up in the air  
And I don't think they're coming down  
Yeah, I love how it feels right now  
  
Chorus  
This is the life  
Hold on tight  
And this is the dream  
It's all I need  
You never know where you'll find it  
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah  
I'm still gettin' it right  
This is the life.  
  
Takin' in  
A whole new scene  
And I'm swimming with a new crowd  
  
Breakin' down  
The old four walls  
And I'm building them up from the ground  
Yeah, I love how it feels right now  
  
Chorus  
  
Gonna follow my own lead, yeah  
Kick back and feel the breeze  
Nothing but the blue sky  
As far as I can see  
  
Chorus 2x
