Words and music by Freddie Mercury  
  
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry (so lonely)  
Nowhere to go nothing to do with my time  
I get lonely so lonely living on my own  
  
Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast  
And everything is coming down on me down on me  
I go crazy oh so crazy living on my own  
  
Dee do de de dee do de de  
I don't have no time for no monkey business  
Dee do de de dee do de de  
I get so lonely lonely lonely lonely yeah  
Got to be some good times ahead  
  
Sometimes I feel nobody gives me no warning  
Find my head is always up in the clouds in a dreamworld  
Its not easy living on my own  
  
Dee do de de dee do de de  
I don't have no time for no monkey business  
Dee do de de dee do de de  
I get so lonely lonely lonely lonely yeah  
Got to be some good times ahead  
  
Dee do de de dee do de de  
I don't have no time for no monkey business  
Dee do de de dee do de de  
I get so lonely lonely lonely lonely yeah  
Got to be some good times ahead
