This feeling never leaves you alone  
You pull the trigger on your own  
You're hiding in your safe place  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
On the way to the hospital  
  
Not will you ever rest your head  
You end up feeling mostly dead  
Pretending you're the last one  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
On the way to the hospital  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
  
It never used to hurt before  
It isn't funny anymore  
You're feeling so alone now  
Funny how you wish some way that you could die at the hospital  
  
You're quiet on the car ride home  
You're waiting for your head to explode  
You're hiding in your safe place  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
All the way to the hospital  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
(Before I close my)  
Before I close my eyes  
I hope to give it up  
(Take off my)  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
And leave the lies to the liars  
  
He thinks he fooled them all  
(Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray)  
He thinks he fooled them all  
(Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray)  
(Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray)  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
(Before I close my)  
Before I close my eyes  
I'm gonna give it up  
(Take off my mask)  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey, hey, hey
