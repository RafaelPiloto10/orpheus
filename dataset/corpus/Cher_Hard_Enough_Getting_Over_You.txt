For the first time, in such a long time  
I've been feelin' there's some reason  
To hold on through the night  
And for the first time since you broke this heart of mine  
I find myself believin'  
It's really gonna be alright  
Now you're askin' me to let you walk back into my life  
Something I can't bring myself to do  
  
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end  
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
I don't think that I could say goodbye again  
I could trust you, but it's out of my hands  
  
I once believed your promises  
Believed in every word you said  
I still love you but my heart won't take the chance  
That all the pain I've left behind me  
Might be waiting for me up ahead  
Just remember it was you who walked right out of my life  
  
No you don't know what I've been through  
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end  
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
I don't think that I could say goodbye  
  
I made a promise to myself  
And this one I'm not gonna break  
  
I've made it without you, and I'm not about to  
Just turn around and make the same mistake  
'Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end  
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you  
  
I don't think that I could say goodbye  
I don't think I could say goodbye  
I know that I can't say goodbye again
