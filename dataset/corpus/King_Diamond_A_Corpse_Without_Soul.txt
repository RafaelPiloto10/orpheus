Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He taken his toll  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll  
I was walking down among the graves  
I heard a cry, my shadow is gone  
Emptiness in my body, life in the cold  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones  
I saw my soul in a magical haze  
It was all dressed up as corpse in a wedding dress  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now hear my prayer  
Begging for mercy  
I'm just living to die  
Well, I was walking down among the graves  
I heard a cry my shadow is gone  
Emptiness in my body, life in the cold  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones  
I saw my soul, in a magical haze  
It was all dressed up as a corpse in a wedding dress  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll
