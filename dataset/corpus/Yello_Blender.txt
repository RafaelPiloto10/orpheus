My ladies, please come closer, my name is Random Tox.  
I have the great honor and pleasure to present to you Turnex  
The son of Durex, the blender for the next milennium.  
This is a revolution for your kitchen.  
Smashed potatoes, sliced tomatoes, apple juice, blueberry, raspberry, cherries
and peaches in a fraction of a second!  
Turnex, the son of Durex  
The only blender which can be turned into the most powerful vacuum cleaner!  
  
Blenders for sale  
And I am selling to girls  
They always know who I am, what I do  
She gave me no wink  
Just a smile of her hips  
And a sip of my glass  
And let's go  
  
She looked in my eyes  
No need for this ride  
She's a queen  
She's pristine  
And a slave  
  
With a smile of her hips  
She was changing my life  
We are heading downtown in her car  
Her ride is too smooth  
No line [light?] for a stop  
My blenders are flying too far  
  
She looked in my eyes  
No mate [not made] for this ride  
She's Christine  
She's sixteen  
I'm her slave  
  
She is calling me Jake  
She keeps me awake  
Oh boy I was ready to go
