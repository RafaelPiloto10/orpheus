Start spreadin' the news, I'm leavin' today  
I want to be a part of it  
New York, New York  
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray  
Right through the very heart of it  
New York, New York  
  
I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps  
And find I'm king of the hill  
Top of the heap  
  
These little town blues, are melting away  
I'll make a brand new start of it  
In old New York  
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere  
It's up to you, New York.. New York  
  
New York... New York  
I want to wake up, in a city that never sleeps  
And find I'm A number one, top of the list  
King of the hill, A number one....  
  
These little town blues, are melting away  
I'll make a brand new start of it  
In old New York  
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
