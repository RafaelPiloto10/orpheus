Fly like an eagle,  
An outlaw of the sun,  
Stealing 'round your bedroom door  
A case of hit 'n run.  
Sinner, sinner,  
I'm no angel you can see.  
  
So I will tell you now  
And I won't say it again,  
Don't mess with me  
Oh baby, don't mess with me.  
  
Ride like a demon,  
The devil's only son.  
A whiskey drinking son of a bitch,  
I've only just begun.  
Sinner, sinner,  
I'm no angel you can see.  
  
I told you once before  
And I won't say it again,  
Don't mess with me,  
Don't mess with me.  
  
Soothe me baby like I soothe you,  
Treat me baby like I treat you.  
Soothe me baby like I soothe you,  
Treat me baby like I  
  
Fly like an eagle  
An outlaw of the sun,  
Never take what sleeps around  
But, always get your fun.  
Sinner, sinner,  
You're no angel I can see.  
  
I told you once before  
And I won't say it again,  
Don't mess with me,  
Don't mess with me.  
'cause I'm a sinner  
  
And sinners ain't the loving kind.
