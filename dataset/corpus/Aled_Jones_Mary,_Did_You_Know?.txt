Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has come to make you knew?  
And this child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you  
  
Oh, Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?  
And when you kiss your little baby  
You've kissed the face of God  
  
The blind will see  
The deaf will hear  
The dead will live again  
Oh, the lame will leap  
The dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb  
  
Oh, Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
This sleeping child you're holding  
Is the Great I am  
  
The Great I am  
The Great I am  
The Great I am
