As the twilight shadows deepen  
Where the weeping willow waves,  
All alone in tears I'm kneeling  
O'er my sweetheart's lonely grave.  
  
Chorus:  
I am asking God's forgiveness,  
For you're waiting there I know,  
Out beyond that blue horizon  
Just across the bridge of gold.  
  
I regret those words I've spoken  
Every yesterday of tears  
That I caused you little darling  
As we wandered through the years  
  
Chorus  
  
If I'd only read your letter  
Saying you were in despair  
That your weary heart was broken  
And in pain was lying there.  
  
Chorus  
  
I tonight would not be weeping  
O'er the roses on your grave.  
But instead dear I'd be happy  
And this sorrow I'd have saved.  
  
Chorus  
  
If I only would have listened  
When you told me not to stray  
But I said I loved another  
Left you there and went away.  
  
Chorus  
  
Now my life is sad and lonely  
Down life's path I trudge along  
But I'll meet you up in heaven  
When from this old world I've gone.  
  
Chorus
