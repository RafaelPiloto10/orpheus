(nick feldman)  
Baby ben really likes to swing  
Baby ben really feels like a king  
As the wail of the horns make his body sway  
Peggy sue likes to rock and roll  
Peggy sue gonna lose control  
As electric guitars play all her fears away  
Chorus:  
You gotta swing down tonight  
Swing it real tight  
Swing with your baby tonight  
You gotta swing down tonight  
It's gotta feel right  
Swing with your baby tonight  
Swing tight with your baby tonight  
Swing down, swing down tonight, swing!  
Baby ben knows just where it's at  
Baby ben wears a pork pie hat  
Feeling so cool, he draws his baby in  
Peggy sue don't care for no rules  
'coz peggy sue is his queen of cool  
Locked in the groove they surrender to the swing  
Repeat chorus  
Swing, swing, swing, swing  
Whether it's rock or it's swing  
The groove is the thing  
Gather the night around you  
'coz the world belongs to you  
Swing with your baby tonight - swing tight  
With your baby tonight
