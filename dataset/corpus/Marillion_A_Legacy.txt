When I leave you  
I will leave you  
Things that might not help you  
Things that might  
Problems that I never solved  
Dreams to keep you up at night  
  
As I leave you  
I will leave you  
Things that stick for ever  
Things that slide  
Mysteries I swallowed whole  
  
Happiness I couldn't share I will leave you  
Promises I never kept I will leave you  
Stories that I never told  
Principles betrayed or sold  
  
Love I tried to spread too wide I will leave you  
Muscles you can grow in hate I will leave you  
Summer darkness  
Winter light  
Young mans shame and  
Old mans pride  
  
When I leave you  
I will hate to leave you  
That's the heat that grows  
With growing old  
  
So never let me leave you  
Never let me leave you  
Cold
