The last verse was the hardest the hardest to get through  
This verse for old lost lovers this song I wrote for you  
She's at the point of no return there's no more candles left to burn  
She's broken every chain that bound her to your soul  
She doesn't care what's right or wrong you've been her victim for too long  
She knows you're too weak to be strong you'll lose control  
Nothing seems to bother her she's as cool as cool has ever been  
She knows she can handle you you've been her fool since God knows when  
[ sax ]  
There's no more chances left to take you're just another heart she'll break  
You're not the first one or the last to come along  
She knows exactly how you feel you think you got a dirty deal  
You left your heart where she could steal it for a song  
[ sax - banjo ]
