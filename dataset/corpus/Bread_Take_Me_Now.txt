I need, baby I need your love right now  
And I want, baby I wanna show you how  
C'mon, you know that we've waited long enough  
And now it's time  
Time to be lovers.  
  
I tried, tried to be only one with you  
And it's hard but baby it's worth it all for you  
And it hurts, makin' me wait for you this way,  
I can't go on.  
So c'mon and...  
  
Chorus:  
Take me now, take my love  
Make come true the feelings I've been dreamin' of  
Take me now, take me fast  
You can trust in me,  
Our love will ever last.  
  
I know we haven't known each other long  
But still something so right just can't be wrong  
Besides, it ought to be up to  
Me and you.  
  
When it's time, time for each other.  
I live, live for the day we're made as one  
Look back, back over all the things we've done  
But now, baby I need your love right now,  
I can't go on.  
So c'mon and...  
  
Chorus:  
Take me now, take my love  
Make come true the feelings I've been dreamin' of  
Take me now, take me fast  
You can trust in me,  
Our love will ever last.  
  
Take me now, take my love  
Make come true the feelings I've been dreamin' of  
Take me now, take me fast  
You can trust in me,  
Our love will ever last.
