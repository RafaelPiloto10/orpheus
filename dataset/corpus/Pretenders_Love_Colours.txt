The sun goes down  
The sky turns black  
I can hardly wait for you  
I can't believe the madness  
In everything you do  
I used to dream in black and white  
Now I see the world in a different light  
  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Oh oh  
Now come in to me  
Fill me and fill me  
Show me your colors baby  
Your love colors  
  
I slept in fear  
And woke in pain  
Till you came in close to me  
I was cold  
Like frozen rain  
Your kiss melted me  
You speak your mind just like a child  
Won't be defined by when you smile  
  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Your love colors, colors everything  
Oh oh  
Now come in to me  
Fill me and fill me  
Show me your colors baby  
Your love colors  
  
Your love colors everything  
Your love colors everything  
Your love colors everything  
Your love colors everything
