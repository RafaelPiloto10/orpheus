You touched me. you took me away.  
You left me confused when you said you couldn't stay.  
But now I know what you were trying to say.  
I can understand that I'm not the only one.  
But I believe our time is gonna come.  
  
I dream of you through every night,  
But you're not risin' with me, so I don't wanna see the light.  
Even if you can't come over, and I hoping that you might  
'cause when you're not here nothing's any fun.  
But I believe our time is gonna come.  
  
I believe our time is gonna come  
I believe our time is gonna come  
I believe our time is gonna  
I believe our time is gonna come
