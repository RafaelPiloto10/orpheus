I got to get a message through,  
I don't know where we're going.  
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders,  
take cover for the night.  
I see you in the morning rain,  
oh step inside and lay beside me.  
Tender can you close my eyes and blind me,  
oh give me just a smile...  
  
Before I fade to silver,  
Silver Blue for you.  
Before I fade to silver,  
Silver Blue for you  
  
I've turned into The Broken One  
who lost the inspiration.  
I want to give you all my love  
like water to a blood red rose.  
The Passion, I can't deal with her.  
The Pain, well I can do without him.  
And this is like the milky way,  
an ocean that only grows and grows  
  
And babe I fade to silver,  
Silver Blue for you.  
I turn and fade to silver,  
Silver Blue for you  
  
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders,  
take cover for the night.
