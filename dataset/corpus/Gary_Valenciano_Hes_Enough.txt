So just throw your hands in the air  
And wave them from side to side  
And if you confess that Jesus Christ is Lord  
Somebody scream "alright"  
Let me see, let me see  
Nothing can compare to his grace  
And his glory, end of story  
He's enough for me and should be enough for you  
So act like you know 'coz if you don't here's a clue  
From the beginning to the middle til the end  
He'll always be your friend  
Every time you take him into battle with you, you win  
That's on the real knock, brother, there is no other  
So never put your faith in another  
Yeah you know that Jesus is enough  
Yeah you know that Jesus is enough  
So many people in the world try to lie and deceive us  
You know full well that they need Jesus  
You deadly mistaken if you waste your time  
And follow Satan  
He don't love you, he's just fakin'  
Satan's always tryin' to make us be untrue  
So listen to me now it's what you gotta do  
Put on your full armor  
Don't let him be a charmer  
Say, "Satan, get behind me!" he can never harm me  
Yeah you know that Jesus is enough  
Yeah you know that Jesus is enough  
So what you out there tryin' to discover  
Tell me can you tell me can you find something better  
From the beginning to the middle to the end  
He'll always be your friend  
Everytime you take him into battle with you, you win  
That's on the real knock, brother, there is no other  
So never put your faith in another  
When times get rough you just gotta hang tough  
I'm here to let you know Jesus Christ is enough  
When times get rough you just gotta hang tough  
Take my advice, Jesus Christ is enough  
Yeah you know that Jesus is enough
