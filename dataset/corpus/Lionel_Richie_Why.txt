It's been this many years  
It's been that many years  
And still have to ask the same question  
Why?  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Funny me, funny you  
Don't have nothing lft in common  
You wanted me to have your heart  
Now you want it back  
What about the promise you made to me  
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason  
And suddenly we're flying high  
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast  
You're trying to get lost  
I'm trying to pull up  
And damn I can't say  
You said you didn't need me  
I really didn't think that you would leave me  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Now the kids are looking at me like I'm to blame  
No longer got their respect for me  
Don't want to hear what I'm saying  
I know how it feels to be ashamed  
Cause when I was young I felt that pain too  
And I can't say nothing that would cause you to make a change  
And that's the reason that we're going our separate ways  
Then who am I fooling  
What am I doing thinking you love me  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
You would think by this time I would get it right  
Know the schemes and the things that make it be right  
When you said you could stay no longer  
I thought I had just a little more daylight  
LIke when we use to turn a fight into a good night  
I know the things I use to do to make you feel right  
I would give anything the fortune I made  
To bring back the days that the feeling was so right  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why the dreams we had we threw them all away  
Why the dreams we had we let them slip away
