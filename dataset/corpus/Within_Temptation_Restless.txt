She embraced with a smile  
As she opened the door  
A cold wind blows  
It puts a chill into her heart  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my love I gave to you  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my love I gave to you
