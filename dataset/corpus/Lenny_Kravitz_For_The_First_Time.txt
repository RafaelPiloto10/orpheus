I want to fall in love again  
For the first time  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
I want to press your lips on mine  
  
For the first time  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
Love is something  
You can't get in a five and dime  
  
And love is the question of more time  
And love is something  
That's really hard to find  
Love makes a strong man  
  
Get down on his knees in the crowd  
Just lay your hand  
On mine  
Yeah, for the first time  
  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
And I wonder If you'll ever really be mine
