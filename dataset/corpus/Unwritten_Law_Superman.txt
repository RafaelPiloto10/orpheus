You've been on my mind  
And I don't think I have the time  
To listen to your voice  
I've heard it all before  
It's been seeping through the floor  
Shut behind closed doors  
But I can see right through you now  
Yeah  
  
The beneficial lies  
Are told to keep us with closed eyes  
Shading what's in store  
I guess it's up to me  
To find the lock and turn the key  
And open up theses doors  
But I can see right through now  
Yeah  
  
Oh yeah I'm superman  
A three piece suit and a master plan  
Here I come to save the day  
Oh yeah I'm superman  
A three piece suit and a master plan  
Here I come to save the day  
  
Well you've been on my mind  
And I don't think I have the time  
To listen to your voice  
I've heard it all before  
It's been seeping through the floor  
Shut behind closed doors  
But I can see right through you now  
Yeah  
  
Oh yeah I'm superman  
A three piece suit and a master plan  
Here I come to save the day  
Oh yeah I'm superman  
A three piece suit and a master plan  
Here I come to save the day  
  
I don't want to follow (whoa)  
You can't make me follow (whoa)  
I don't want to follow (whoa)  
You can't make me follow now  
  
Oh yeah I'm superman  
A three piece suit and a master plan  
Here I come to save the day  
Oh yeah I'm superman  
A three piece suit and a master plan  
Here I come to save the day
