Darling, you gotta let me know  
Should I stay or should I go?  
If you say that you are mine  
I'll be there till the end of time  
So you gotta let me know  
Should I stay or should I go?  
  
It's always tease, tease, tease  
You're happy when I'm on my knees  
One day is fine and the next is black  
So if you want me off your back  
Well, come on and let me know  
Should I stay or should I go?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Should I stay or should I go now?  
Should I stay or should I go now?  
If I go there will be trouble  
And if I stay it will be double  
So come on and let me know  
  
This indecision's bugging me  
(Esta indecision me molesta)  
If you don't want me set me free  
(Si no quieres librame)  
Exactly who I'm supposed to be  
(Digame que tengo ser)  
Don't you know which clothes even fits me?  
(Sabes que ropa me queda)  
Come on and let me know  
(Me tienes que decir)  
Should I cool it or should I blow?  
(Me debo ir o quedarme)  
  
[Chorus: Repeat]
