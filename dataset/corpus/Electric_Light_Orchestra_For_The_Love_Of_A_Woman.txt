No one can say  
How she caught my eyes  
To this day  
I don't know why  
Oh well, her eyes  
So much like diamonds  
And her heart  
So much like gold  
I knew that I'd win her in time  
When I felt her heart beat close to mine  
And once in her arms  
Then I knew anything I would do  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
I prayed that I'd never have to walk alone  
I have a love of my own  
I thank my stars  
I found an angel  
Never again  
Will I walk alone  
She brought a light  
Into my heart  
Like the brightest star  
That's ever shone  
Money and gold to a king  
When you're alone, don't mean a thing  
And once in her arms  
Then I knew anything I would do  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
I prayed that I'd never have to walk alone  
I have a love of my own  
I could paint a masterpiece  
I could walk through fire  
I could shout it from the roof  
From the smallest flame to a fire this love has grown  
Just for the love of a woman  
Money and gold mean nothin'  
Never again will I have to walk alone  
Since I have a love of my own  
Now I have a love of my own  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone
