The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A murderous desire for love  
How can they look into my eyes  
And still they don't believe me?  
How can they hear me say those words  
Still they don't believe me?  
And if they don't believe me now  
Will they ever believe me?  
And if they don't believe me now  
Will they ever, they ever, believe me?  
Oh  
  
The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A plundering desire for love  
How can they see the Love in our eyes  
And still they don't believe us?  
And after all this time  
They don't want to believe us  
And if they don't believe us now  
Will they ever believe us?  
And when you want to live  
How do you start?  
Where do you go?  
Who do you need to know?  
  
Oh  
Oh no  
Oh  
La
