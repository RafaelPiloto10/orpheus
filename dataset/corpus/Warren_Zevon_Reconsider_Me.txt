If you're all alone  
And you need someone  
Call me up  
And I'll come running  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
  
If it's still the past  
That makes you doubt  
Darlin', that was then  
And this is now  
  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
And I'll never make you sad again  
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then  
And I promise that I'll never make you cry  
  
Let's let bygones  
Be forgotten  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
You can go and be  
What you want to be  
And it'll be alright  
  
If we disagree  
I'm the one who cares  
And I hope you'll see  
That I'm the one who loves you  
Reconsider me  
  
Let's let bygones  
Be forgotten  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
And I'll never make you sad again  
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then  
  
And I'll never make you sorry if you'll try  
And I'll never make you sad again  
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then  
And I promise that I'll never make you cry
