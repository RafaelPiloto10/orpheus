There's a side of you, could bring on homicide  
But livin' in a cell changes my view  
Maybe your automobile could lose its right front wheel  
It happens every day, it could be you  
  
Look back over your shoulder, when you think you're alone, you're not  
Each noise, every shadow, look out!  
  
[Chorus]  
Accidents can happen, it's always in the news  
Accidents can happen to you  
You read it in the paper, you see it on the tube  
Accidents can happen  
  
To you  
  
A little Haitian doll, that looks a lot like you do  
A little powdered poison in your tea  
Electricity, invisible to see, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. E  
  
A malfunction, who would notice, machines and things get hot  
A permanent vacation can be bought  
  
[Chorus]  
Look out!  
  
Accidents can happen, accidents can happen, accidents can happen to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Accidents can happen, accidents can happen, look out!
