I'm a girl, and by me that's only great!  
I am proud that my silhouette is curvy,  
That I walk with a sweet and girlish gait  
With my hips kind of swivelly and swervy.  
  
I adore being dressed in something frilly  
When my date comes to get me at my place.  
Out I go with my Joe or John or Billy,  
Like a filly who is ready for the race!  
  
When I have a brand new hairdo  
With my eyelashes all in curl,  
I float as the clouds on air do,  
I enjoy being a girl!  
  
When men say I'm cute and funny  
And my teeth aren't teeth, but pearl,  
I just lap it up like honey  
I enjoy being a girl!  
  
I flip when a fellow sends me flowers,  
I drool over dresses made of lace,  
I talk on the telephone for hours  
With a pound and a half of cream upon my face!  
  
I'm strictly a female female  
And my future I hope will be  
In the home of a brave and free male  
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... Like... Me.  
  
When men say I'm sweet as candy  
As around in a dance we whirl,  
It goes to my head like brandy,  
I enjoy being a girl!  
  
When someone with eyes that smoulder  
Says he loves ev'ry silken curl  
That falls on my iv'ry shoulder,  
I enjoy being a girl!  
  
When I hear the compliment'ry whistle  
That greets my bikini by the sea,  
I turn and I glower and I bristle,  
But I happy to know the whistle's meant for me!  
  
I'm strictly a female female  
And my future I hope will be  
In the home of a brave and free male  
Who'll enjoy being a guy having a girl... Like... Me.
