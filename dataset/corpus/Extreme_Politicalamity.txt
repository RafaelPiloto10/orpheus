Wars and rumors  
Of wars no one knows what for  
Toys and soldiers  
Deployed on some foreign shore  
Lords and rulers  
Destroy diplomatic rapport  
Communists, dictatorships  
Democracies, hypocrisies  
Ask not what your country can do  
To a one world governmental zoo?  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
It's anarchy  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
Rich and poor  
Salute your country's colors  
Less is more  
When one oppresses the other  
Pride and power  
Decorated upon collars  
Donkeys, bears and elephants  
All paper trained on parliament  
I said, "Ask not what your country can do  
To a one world governmental zoo?"  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
It's anarchy  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
Ask not what your country can do  
To a one world governmental zoo?  
Ask not what your country can do  
To a one world governmental zoo?  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
It's anarchy  
Political, political  
Politicalamity, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
It's anarchy  
Well I say we got trouble, trouble, trouble  
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble  
We saw that was coming  
[Incomprehensible]
