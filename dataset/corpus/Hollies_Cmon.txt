Tell me tell me how I'm doing tonight  
I could take this forever  
The more I get the better all right  
C'mon and spoil me  
Let me be the apple of your eye  
I could take this forever  
The more I get the better all right  
  
This ain't my first time but  
It's never been like this before  
Can this be magic  
I can't keep my feet on the floor  
  
Love c'mon and cast your spell on me  
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon  
Love c'mon and cast your spell on me  
  
Tell me tell me how I'm doing tonight  
I could take this forever  
The more I get the better all right  
C'mon and spoil me  
Let me be the apple of your eye  
I could take this forever  
The more I get the better all right
