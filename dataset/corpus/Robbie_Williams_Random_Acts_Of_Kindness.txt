For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you  
For those of us who live in fear  
Of Happy Christmas and New Year  
I raise a toast to you  
  
And if it hurts to be so blind  
Why don't you try being kind  
  
They've decided to become  
A little more proactive  
Creep upon you while you sleep  
And make you less attractive  
  
Born without a spine  
Why don't you try being kind  
  
For those out drinking their mother's wake  
You'll find a way to soldier on  
For those whose love evaporates  
I pray you find where you belong  
  
Oh the words I have repressed  
Are coming out today I guess  
It's justice not respect I'm after  
And that just leaves comtempt  
For you all  
  
I am just a simple man  
With simple expectations  
With deep regrets they're seldom met  
God speed my generation  
  
And with Crowley on my mind  
I should try being kind  
  
For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you  
For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you
