I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles  
Write a melody so sweet, make a tear turn into a smile  
I can see the color of spring I can even feel the weather change  
And soon the leaves fall and winter calls,  
'Cause nothing ever stays the same  
When I think of where I've been, what I've done and all I own  
How I think I know everything, like I made it here on my own  
And like the wind that blows, like a flower that grows  
Still with all I can do  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
I admit that sometimes pride tries to hide my view  
And even this gift that you gave me, I forget it's for You  
And all the many days and many ways Your grace I've abused  
Still you were patient and Your love loved me through  
But the wind still blows and the flower still grows and one thing is still
true.  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal  
Without You, nothing in this world is for real  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
Can't live, can't see Your will for me  
Can't do anything  
Anything  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal  
Without You, nothing in this world is for real  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
Without You, we're like a bride with no groom  
Without You, it's like seeing no sunshine in June  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
We wouldn't be here today  
Without You, Jesus my life would be lost.  
Without You, I'll never know what it cost  
To see You, lay Your life down for me  
From my past now I'm free  
Tell me where would I be without You.  
Tell me where would I be without You  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles
