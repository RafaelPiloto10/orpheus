Blinded by the vision  
I turn and face my back to the wall  
Cause I'm locked up in a rhythm  
The prism of a big glitter ball  
  
Wrapped around your finger  
I'm caught up in the middle with you baby  
With some laughter and drinking  
There's very little else I can do  
  
Then I go and drop a bombshell upon you  
I've been making eyes at somebody else  
You're no longer number one  
  
She loves the night  
And all that glitters  
Her name in lights  
Around the city  
Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl  
  
You're rushing down  
Like a rollercoaster  
Night on the town  
Gonna make the most of  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning girl  
  
You're pushing and a-shoving me baby  
Like a bitch to the wall  
But you're driving me crazy  
Right up to fever pitch I could fall  
  
When you shine down your love light  
I'm getting blinded by the sights and sounds  
  
She loves the night  
And all that glitters  
Her name in lights  
Around the city  
Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl  
  
I will see you  
I will get you  
I will see you  
I will get you  
I will see you  
I will get you  
Then I go and drop a bombshell upon you  
I've been making eyes at somebody baby  
You're no longer number one  
  
She loves the night  
And all that glitters  
Her name in lights  
Around the city  
Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl  
  
You're rushing down  
Like a rollercoaster  
Night on the town  
Gonna make the most of  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning girl
