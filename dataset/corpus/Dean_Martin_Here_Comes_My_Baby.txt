Here comes more tears to cry  
Here comes more heartaches by  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
Here comes more misery  
Here comes old memories  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
My arms are open wide  
To let more hurt inside  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
He's sorry once again  
Once more I'll understand  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
Here comes my baby back again  
My arms are open wide  
To let more hurt inside  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
He's sorry once again  
Once more I'll understand  
Here comes my baby back again  
Here comes my baby back again
