Told you once about your friends  
And neighbors  
They were always seeking  
But they'll never find it  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
Where to go and where to see  
It's always been this way  
And it can never be  
  
It's alright, it's alright  
Give it all and ask for no return  
And very soon you'll see  
And you'll begin to learn  
  
That's it's alright, it's alright  
Don't you know that it's so good for you  
You can be making love and  
See it all go through  
  
But it's alright, it's alright  
Told you once about your friends  
And neighbors  
They were always seeking  
  
But they'll never find it  
It's alright, it's alright
