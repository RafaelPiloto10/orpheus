Mamacita, oh my God I think you're on fire  
Do you want me to get you water?  
You make me want to be your baby father  
Cause the dance you do is getting hotter

Hey girl!  
  
Let's go finish at mi casa  
Trust me, it'd be proper  
I got muchos negros on my lache with the choppers  
If they suspect us, someone trespasa  
All you hear is brrrat and then scream, Kukaracha!  
Trust me, P is no pimp  
See I got heavy pockets, so I walk with a limp  
One night with he, and I'll make ya scream  
You'll wake up, like it's a dream  
Call downstairs, tell em to make us pjs  
Right after that, dry cycle our pjs  
Right after that, book us a pj  
What you mean how? When you got money, it's easy  
This ain't dookie, ma, I'm not Green Day  
Wake up, you're about to miss your damn dream day  
Now everybody just sing what the screen say  
It goes..
