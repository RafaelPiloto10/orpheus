Baby, we've been in and out of love so many times  
We keep reaching the end of the line and giving up on each other  
And, darling, I don't think we can survive one more goodbye  
Can't cry one more tear or lie one more lie  
We got one last chance to make it  
But that's all we need if we just take it  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, we gotta stand up for love, gotta hold on  
'Cause I know what we got is worth fighting for  
And I know for sure, right or wrong, this is where we belong  
Baby, this time we gotta stand up for love, stand together  
Can't settle for less than forever  
I know there's nothing we can't rise above  
If we just stand up for love  
  
Baby, after everything we put each other through  
And no matter what damage we do, we still need one another  
And sometimes when I hold you in my arms, somehow I see  
As bad as we've been that's how good we can be  
But we can't just say we want it  
Gotta lay all our tomorrows on it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For all the dues we've paid  
The magic we two have made  
For all we've meant to one another  
Once and for all we've gotta stand up for each other  
  
Baby, we gotta stand up for love, gotta hold on  
'Cause we know what we got is worth fighting for  
And we know for sure, right or wrong  
Baby, this time we gotta stand up for love, now or never  
Can't settle for less than forever  
I know there's nothing we can't rise above  
If we just stand up for love
