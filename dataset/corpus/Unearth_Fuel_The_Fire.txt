Lies.  
Under the eyes of suspicion.  
A time and place to cause destruction.  
Losing respect from the nations.  
  
Our own allies disapproval.  
Fuel the fire.  
Our own fathers shelter lies.  
Fuel the fire.  
  
Abusive power crushing lives.  
Fuel the fire.  
Our innocence betrayed.  
Bow to the presses of ability.  
  
Led times of anger to the grave.  
Show times of prosper.  
But who is saved?  
Under the hand of damnation.  
  
Many have lost faith.  
Lost all respect from the nations.  
Our own allies disapproval.  
Fire has gone on too long.  
  
Shadows are cast from our rule.  
Fire has gone on too long.  
Shadows are cast  
Now end the lies.  
Forced on me the casualties.  
  
Never will I believe.  
Kneel along the protective wrong.  
Never will I believe.  
Never will I believe in your destructive wrong.  
  
These eyes have wandered on.  
From the disgusting harm that cause so many to bleed  
And leave us with questioning ears.  
False informing our belief is serer.  
  
I'll always walk on.
