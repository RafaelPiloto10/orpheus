I was alone on a shelf  
In a world by myself  
Oh, where could my prince  
But a man came along  
Made my life like a song  
And tought me these words of ecstasy  
Tenderly  
  
I want some huggin'  
And some squeezin'  
And some muggin'  
And some teasin'  
And some stuff like that there  
I want some pettin'  
And some spoonin'  
And some happy honeymoonin'  
And some stuff like that there  
  
I used to think that love was just a lotta rubbish  
A mess o' cabbage  
A mess o' cabbage  
But now my attitude is only lovey dovish  
And baby, you, you've done it  
  
Ooh  
  
I used to think romance was bunk  
A double-mickey for the ickey  
But all at once my heart was sunk  
And baby, you, you've done it  
  
I want some huggin' and some teasin'  
And some muggin' and some squeezin'  
And some stuff like that there  
  
I want some weepin' and some chasin'  
And some sweepin' and some pacin'  
And some stuff like that there  
  
And when I get a certain feelin' I confess it  
I really only know one expression to express it  
I want some huggin', squeezin', muggin', teasin'  
And some stuff  
I want some stuff like that there
