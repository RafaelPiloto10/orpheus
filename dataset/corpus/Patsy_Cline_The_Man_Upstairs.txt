Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
'Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He will always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Now don't you run and hide  
'Cause if you ever need a friend  
He'll be there by your side  
Just turn your eyes to Heaven  
And say a simple prayer  
Through the clouds of lace  
You'll see his face  
No matter when or where  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
'Cause he wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He will always see you through  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He wants to hear from you  
Have you talked to the man upstairs?  
He's always see you through  
And this trouble ever troubles you  
Well don't you run and hide  
'Cause if you ever need a friend  
He'll be there by your side  
If you talk to the man upstairs
