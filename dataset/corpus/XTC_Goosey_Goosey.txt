Hey goosey goosey  
I believe it's for having fun  
Hey goosey goosey  
I believe it's for everyone.  
  
One red morning  
With no warning  
Life comes crashing in  
To wake you early with its golden din.  
  
One blue evening  
Cruelly leaving  
It goes breezing out  
The very second that you figure it out  
What it's all for.  
  
Everybody has a magic lantern  
Everybody has an inner eye  
Everybody has a magic carpet  
Seems a shame if you don't let it fly  
Tell you why  
  
Hey goosey goosey  
  
Some bright daytime  
Worker's playtime  
You get country-bound  
Pick your girl up  
Throw your oil-can down  
  
Some dark nighttime  
Final frighttime  
As the reaper knocks  
The wisdom of the ancients in a box  
But it's too late  
  
Everybody has a magic lantern  
  
Hey goosey goosey  
  
Yes I do  
  
Goosey goosey gander  
Wither do you wander?
