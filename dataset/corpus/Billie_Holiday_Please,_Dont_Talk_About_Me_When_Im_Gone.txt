Please don't talk about me when I'm gone  
Though our friendship ceases from now on  
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice  
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice  
We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do  
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you  
Makes no difference how I carry on  
Just don't you talk about me when I'm gone  
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Just don't talk, please don't talk  
Don't you talk about me when I'm gone
