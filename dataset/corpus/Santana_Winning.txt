One day I was on the ground  
When I needed a hand  
Then it couldn't be found  
I was so far down that I couldn't get up  
You know and one day I was one of life's losers  
Even my friends were my accusers  
In my head I lost before I begun  
  
I had a dream but it turned to dust  
And what I thought was love  
That must have been lust  
I was living in style  
When the walls fell in  
And when I played my hand  
I looked like a joker  
Turn around fate must have woke her  
Cause lady luck she was waiting outside the door  
  
I'm winning  
I'm winning  
I'm winning  
I'm winning and I don't intend losing again  
  
Too bad it belonged to me  
It was the wrong time and not meant to be  
It took a long time and I'm new born now  
I can see the day that I bleed for  
If it's agreed that there's a need  
To play the game and to win again
