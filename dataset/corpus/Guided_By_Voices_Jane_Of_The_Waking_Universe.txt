Jane of the waking universe!  
A wrinkled rose snapped back  
And the flies on flowers spreading out  
To all sickness of humanity  
Listen to our queen as she is offering free samples  
Of her lovely garden spoils  
Jane of the waking universe  
And undulating always like the tide  
The devil's bride is calling all toward her skirt  
And in the loving folds there we will hide inside  
From any would be sneak attack  
Until it's safe to journey back  
Jane of waking universe
