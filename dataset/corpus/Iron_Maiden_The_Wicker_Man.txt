Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you  
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do  
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say  
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way  
  
You watch the world exploding every single night  
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light  
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death  
Hello to eternity and live for every breath  
  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come  
  
The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back  
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track  
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same  
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame  
  
You watch the world exploding every single night  
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light  
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain  
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again  
  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come  
  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come
