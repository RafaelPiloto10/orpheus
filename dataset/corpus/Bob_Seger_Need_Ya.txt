I used to be a very carefree man,  
A loving man of the world.  
Yeah, I would still be except for the time  
When I met ya, little girl.  
Say, I've tried and I've tried but I just can't.  
You sure got a hold on me.  
Ah, your good, good lovin' is makin' me faint,  
Mama, please don't set me free.  
Because I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya)  
Oh, need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya)  
You got that kinda air that drives me insane  
And sometime ya sure got me new.  
Ah, sometimes I feel like knockin' you down,  
But I would never pull that scene.  
Though I get tired, I know that you know  
That I'd never do you wrong.  
'Cause when it's late and I feel down, turn the lights on low  
And I will hold things in my soul.  
'Cause I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya)  
I'm gonna need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya)  
Yeah ... ooh yeah.  
Ah, need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya)  
You know I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya)  
Yeah, oh, oh, need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya)  
Oh yeah, need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
Oh, ... (Need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya )  
Oh, ... (Need ya, need ya, need ya , need ya)
