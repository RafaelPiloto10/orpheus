You're heard enough  
Of the blues and stuff  
You're pretty swell now  
'Cause you're pretty tough  
But I don't have to tell you  
How hard it can be to get by  
  
You never bothered  
About anyone else  
You're well educated  
With no common sense  
But love, that's one thing  
You really need to get by  
  
All your troubles  
Come from yourself  
Nobody hurts you  
They don't care  
Just as long as you show them  
  
A really good time  
All the things  
You used to do  
A trip to the movies  
A drink or two  
They don't satisfy you  
They don't tell you anything new  
  
You know I don't talk much  
Except to myself  
'Cause I've not much to say  
And there's nobody else  
Who's ready and willing  
And able to know me, I guess  
Listen to me  
I'm not finished yet  
There's something to tell you  
That I can't forget  
Just have a really good  
  
There's a girl  
I used to know  
Her face is her fortune  
She's got a heart of gold  
She never goes out much  
But boy, when she does  
  
Then you know  
She's got no money  
Well, maybe a dime  
But she knows what she's worth  
And that's reason why  
She's gonna make it  
  
She's got what it takes  
You'll appreciate that  
She's probably late  
But I know  
And you know  
We all know  
She'll have a really good time
