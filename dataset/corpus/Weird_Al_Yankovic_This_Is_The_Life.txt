I eat filet mignon seven times a day  
My bathtub's filled with Perrier  
What can I say?  
This is the life!  
  
I buy a dozen cars when I'm in the mood  
I hire somebody to chew my food  
I'm an upwardly mobile dude  
This is the life!  
  
They say that money corrupts you  
But I can't really tell  
I got the whole world at my feet  
And I think it's pretty swell  
  
I got women lined up outside my door  
They've been waitin' there since the week before  
Who could ask for more?  
This is the life!  
  
You're dead for a real long time  
You just can't prevent it  
So if money can't buy happiness  
I guess I'll have to rent it  
  
Yeah, every day I make the front page news  
No time to pay my dues  
I got a million pairs of shoes  
This is the life!  
  
I got a solid gold Cadillac  
I make a fortune while I sleep  
You can tell I'm a living legend  
Not some ordinary creep  
  
No way, I'm the boss  
The Big Cheese  
Yeah, I got this town on its knobby little knees  
I can do just what I please  
This is the life!  
  
That's right, I'm the king  
Number One  
I buy monogrammed Kleenex by the ton  
I pay the bills  
I call the shots  
I grease the palms  
I buy the yachts  
  
One thing I can guarantee  
The best things in life, they sure ain't free  
It's such a thrill just to be me  
This is the life!  
  
This is the life!
