Texas are you my friend, you live so close to the end  
Texas are you my friend, cause I'm afraid of you  
Hey Maine hey, you're a little too high for me  
And Fla you're just a little too low  
D.C. you could be the end of me  
I think I'm movin to Idaho  
I ain't afraid of you  
  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' in  
Mother Nature shakes, what then what then  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' through  
She'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do  
Oh, oh Carolina Brother's you make me crawl under the covers  
I just can't get myself to go, oh no  
Hey Joe I see your name too, but there is nothin' that they can do  
I think I'm movin' to Idaho  
I ain't afraid of you  
  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' in  
Mother Nature shakes, what then what then  
Oh, people on the outside lookin' through  
She'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do
