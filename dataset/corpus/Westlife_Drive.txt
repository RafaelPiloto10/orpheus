It's easy to fool around it's harder to keep the faith  
But I wanna settle down no matter what it takes  
If I ever break your heart if I ever do you wrong  
I hope I never give you 'cause to doubt where you belong  
If a million miles were between us  
I'd want you to know  
If I had to drive all day take that flight  
Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight  
Don't let it play on your mind  
'Cause my devotion is for all time  
Some people want it all some only want the fun  
But I'm here to let you know that I'm all about the love  
Some people let it show some people wait too long  
Well I'm gonna tell you now that you're always number one  
If a million miles were between us  
I'd want you to know  
If I had to drive all day take that flight  
Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight  
Don't let it play on your mind  
'Cause my devotion is for all time  
Drive all day take that flight  
Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight  
Don't let it play on your mind  
'Cause my devotion is for all time  
I got whole day to take that flight  
Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight  
Don't let it play on your mind  
'Cause my devotion is for all time  
My devotion is for all time
