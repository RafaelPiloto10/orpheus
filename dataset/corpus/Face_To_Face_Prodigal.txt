he's never going back refuses to be left behind he doesn't understand how they
so easily made up their minds you had it in your hands so how is it so hard to
find? you still don't understand the reason you've been treated so unkind
there's nowhere left for you to hide afraid and bound by your design if you
don't know what you're looking for what will you find? you need a little time
so you can get your head around your mind if you don't know what you're
looking for what will you find? something you don't like? you never get it
back so what's the point in killing time? you still don't understand the
reason you've been treated so unkind
