Down in the park  
Where the machmen  
Meet the machines  
And play 'Kill by numbers'  
Down in the park  
With a friend called 'Five'  
  
I was in a car crash  
Or was it the war  
But I've never been  
Quite the same  
Little white lies  
Like 'I was there'  
  
Come to 'Zom Zoms'  
A place to eat  
Like it was built  
In one day  
You can watch the humans  
Trying to run  
  
Oh look  
There's a rape machine  
I'd go outside  
If it looked the other way  
You wouldn't believe  
The things they do  
  
Down in the park  
Where the chant is  
'Death, death, death'  
Until the sun cries morning  
Down in the park  
With friends of mine  
  
We are not lovers  
We are not romantics  
'We are here to serve you'  
A different face  
But the words never change
