Now you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kind a mad  
I had lot's of luck but it's all been bad  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world a live.  
  
My fishin' pole's broke the creek is full of sand  
My woman run away with another man  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
A distant uncle passed away and left me quite a batch  
And I was livin'g high until that fatal day  
A lawyer proved I wasn't born  
I was only hatched.  
  
Ev'rything's agin' me and it's got me down  
If I jumped in the river I would prob'ly drown  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time  
Are full of holes and nails  
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime  
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails.  
  
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow  
'Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright nohow  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
I could buy a Sunday suit and it would leave me broke  
If it had two pair of pants I would burn the coat  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.  
  
If it was rainin' gold I wouldn't stand a chance  
I wouldn't have a pocket in my patched up pants  
No matter how I struggle and strive  
I'll never get out of this world alive.
