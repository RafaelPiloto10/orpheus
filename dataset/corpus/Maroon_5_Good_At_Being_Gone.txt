I've taken time  
To think about the words I've said and what they mean  
And I've realized that having you is just like having everything  
  
But when I see you dancing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
It's been so long  
It seems the only things I know are far from home  
Where did I go  
It seems sometimes I'm only good at being gone  
  
But when I see you dancing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
But when I see you standing there  
I get up and throw my hands in the air  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home  
Home, home  
When I've nowhere else to roam  
I slowly start to think about coming home
