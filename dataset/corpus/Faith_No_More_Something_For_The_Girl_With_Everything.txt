Something for the girl with everything  
See, the writings on the wall  
You bought the girl a wall  
Complete with matching ball-point pen  
  
You can breathe another day  
Secure in knowing she won't break you (yet)  
Something for the girl with everything  
Have another sweet my dear  
  
Don't try to talk my dear  
Your tiny little mouth is full  
Here's a flavour you ain't tried  
You shouldn't try to talk, your mouth is full  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Bearing gifts to aid amnesia  
  
She knows everything  
Yes yes everyting  
She knew way back when you weren't yourself  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Here's a really preatty car  
I hope it takes you far  
I hope it takes you fast and far  
Wow, the engines really loud  
  
Nobodys gonna hear a thing you say  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Where should they leave these imported gimmicks  
Leave them anywhere  
An-an-anywhere  
Make sure that there's a clear path to the door  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Here's a patridge in a tree,  
A gardener for the tree  
Complete with ornithologist  
Careful, careful with that crate  
  
You wouldn't want to dent Sinatra, no  
Something for the girl who has got everything,  
Yes, yes, everything  
Hey, come out and say hello  
  
Before you friends all go  
But say no more than just hello  
Ah, the little girl is shy  
You see of late she's been quite speechless,  
  
Very speechless  
She's got everything
