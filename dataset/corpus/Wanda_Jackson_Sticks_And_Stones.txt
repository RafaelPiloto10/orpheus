People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
Why don't they let us be  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But talk don't bother me  
  
People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
When they know I love you so  
I don't care what the people may say  
I'll never never let you go  
  
I've been abused  
In my heart and soul  
I've been abused  
Been abused, been abused, and I've been stoned  
  
People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
Man, scandalize my name  
They'll say anything just to make me feel bad  
Yes, anything to make me ashamed  
  
I've been abused  
In my heart and soul  
I've been abused  
Been abused, been abused, and I've been stoned  
  
People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
Man, scandalize my name  
They'll say anything just to make me feel bad  
Yes, anything to make me ashamed  
  
Oh, yes, I know  
Don't you know it, too  
Yes, I know it  
Don't you know it, too
