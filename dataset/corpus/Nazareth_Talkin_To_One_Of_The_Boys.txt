Everyone says connection is easy  
I look at my score, experience none  
Tossed a coin when I was seventeen  
I got the ice, you got the cream  
All that you see is stranger than fiction  
All that you do defies all description  
And you worry about your lack of existence  
  
Then by all means go crazy  
  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Makin' a lot of noise  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Makin' a lot of noise  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
  
One of the boys told me what was,  
Going on last night  
One of the boys said if I tried it,  
Everythin' would be alright.  
  
Talked to doctor scromaxy, mail order messiah  
His black book is gospel, his scripture unclean  
With mass consultation, a blind congregation  
His chapter, his verse, and his profit obscene  
Correspondence, the back of a sin rag  
If this is deliverance, life is a drag  
Searchin' salvation, your sight lines get hazy  
You got it right,go crazy.  
  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Makin' a lot of noise  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
Makin' a lot of noise  
Talkin' to one of the boys  
  
One of the boys told me what was,  
Going on last night  
One of the boys said if I tried it,  
Everythin' would be alright.  
Or maybe you'll go crazy.
