We need to have a conversation  
  
I made you, why would I play you?  
Trade home, base four, California angel  
Swinging a fast bitch, foul out, betray you  
When I won't even wanna hit it in a day or two  
Straight home I'd run, well, that's debatable  
I can't front, I hit a slump all players do  
But tough times are minor to a major dude  
We all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues  
Now you're searching all the clubs for what's available  
A year ago, my slot was unassailable  
My feast is a famine without you to cater to  
If these walls could talk, what would they say to you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!  
And it's like damn, how the hell we get here?  
No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!  
  
The dining room has an empty chair  
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair  
House full of company, but no one's here  
We singing cheers while we holding back tears  
To keep up appearances in front of our peers  
We play holiday card tricks every year  
Blackjack, poker, make the joker disappear  
The ace can't breathe when it's tension in the air  
Three clubs in one night, but nobody cares  
Cause it's still not a full house without a pair  
You tipped your hand, but the text wasn't clear  
You're dealing from the bottom queen of hearts, play fair!  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!  
And it's like damn, how the hell we get here?  
No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!  
  
Slip in the door, you hold my hopes so  
All I hear is love don't live here anymore  
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold  
We're sitting on a fence, so where you wanna go?  
You're the architect of your life, it's your show  
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow  
Before you burn the house down, think, take it slow  
Even arsonists need a shelter, let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!  
And it's like damn, how the hell we get here?  
No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!
