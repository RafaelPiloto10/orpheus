Seems like a dead man stickin' to you  
Seems like his last thoughts are stuck to your shoe  
Seem like a dead man stickin' to you  
Seems like a dead man stuck to your shoe  
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you  
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you  
Dead man hold me near with all that you hold dear  
I can shut my eyes down tight and make you disappear  
Then I fall down  
Seems like tomorrow is yesterdays news yeah  
Seems like you can't win, can't win for losing  
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you  
Seems like tomorrow is yesterdays news  
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you  
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you  
d-d-d dead man what got you here  
A little wrinkled little smeared  
I can shut my eyes down tight and make you disappear  
Then I fall down  
My eyes hang from their sockets  
I wear a ball and chain  
Can you hear the rockets  
Exploding in my brain  
They go  
I feel the insecurity  
I feel the sting of pain  
The upside of insanity  
I side with the insane  
They go  
They come across the black and white  
They ravage me with fear  
I can shut my eyes down tight and make them disappear  
Feel like a dead man  
Dead man
