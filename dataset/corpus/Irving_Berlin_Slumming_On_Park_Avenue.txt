Put on your slumming clothes and get your car  
Let's go sightseeing where the high-toned people are  
Come on, there's lots of fun in store for you  
See how the other half lives on park avenue  
  
Let's go slumming, take me slumming  
Let's go slumming on park avenue  
  
Let us hide behind a pair of fancy glasses  
And make faces when a member of the classes passes  
  
Let's go smelling where they're dwelling  
Sniffing ev'rything the way they do  
  
Let us go to it, they do it  
Why can't we do it too?  
Let's go slumming, nose thumbing, on park avenue  
  
  
[2nd chorus:]  
Let's go slumming, take me slumming  
Let's go slumming on park avenue  
  
Where the social hearts for broadway lights are throbbing  
And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobknobbing, snobbing  
  
Come let's eye them, pass right by them  
Looking down our noses as they do  
  
Let us go to it, they do it  
Why can't we do it too?  
Let's go slumming, crumb bumming, on park avenue
