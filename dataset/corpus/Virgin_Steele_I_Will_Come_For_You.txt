Under tortured skies from a land with no sun  
I will come for you  
From seven points of darkness  
Beyond the mountains and the ruins  
I will come for you  
Across the fields of rage and yearning  
With power in my hand  
I will return, I will return  
  
Once we had beauty our Sun blazcd in passion  
We lived alive  
Far from the reaching of closed minded preaching  
We lived and died  
  
Now all in darkness we wait for the end,  
Hunted by men of the cloth  
Murder and torture, they rape and they slaughter  
Claiming the way of the cross  
  
Cast out from Eden baptized inta treason  
With sighless eyes  
Lost clouds of reason, false hope burning season  
A godless lie  
  
Whose god is stronger, who's made by its hand  
Primitive blood stains the sand  
Murder and torture they're raping your daughter  
Drunk with the blood of the lamb  
  
Fair child of the desolation cry to me,  
Under stars that have died  
Under skies of pain we are born  
Yea we are born, forever we'll be  
Oh my love I'll defy death and meet on holy ground  
  
Under tortured skies from a land with no sun  
I will come for you  
From seven points of darkness  
Beyond the mountains and the ruins  
I will come for you  
Across the fields of rage and yearning  
With power in my hand  
I will return, I will return  
  
Now like the sun, like the wind and the rain  
I'll return like a storm, I will rise once again  
Across the oceans of time I am called by your voice  
I'll return, I will return!!
