There's got to be an alternate ending.  
There's got to be an easy way out.  
I've got to make a change to the messages I'm sending.  
It's all gone wrong, give me time.  
It's all my fault, could have told you.  
Before it's gone too far.  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
  
There's got to be an alternate ending.  
There's got be an easy way out.  
I've got to be the one to say I'm sorry for pretending.  
It's all gone wrong, will you wait?  
It's all my fault, will you listen... to me?  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
Stay with me awhile, all that we've done together.  
I've got no rights and I've got no style, but love is blind.
