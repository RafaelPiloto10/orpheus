If you knew Susie, like I know Susie  
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl  
There's none so classy  
As this fair lassie, oh, oh  
  
Holy Moses, what a chassis  
We went riding, she didn't balk  
Back from Yonkers  
I'm the one that had to walk  
  
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie  
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl  
She wears long tresses  
And nice tight dresses, oh, oh  
  
What a future she possesses  
Out in public, how she can yawn?  
In a parlor you would think  
The war was on  
  
If you knew Susie, like I know Susie  
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl
