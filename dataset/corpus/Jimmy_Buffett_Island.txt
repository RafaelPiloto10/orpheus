Island I see you in the distance  
I feel that your existence  
Is not unlike my own  
Island they say no man is like you  
They say you stand alone  
Sometimes I feel that way too  
  
Is it the need for love?  
Heart and soul accompaniment  
That seems to make me different from you  
  
Well I tried to book passage, but you have no ports  
And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters  
Tore my sails and broke my oars.  
  
Island I see you in the moonlight  
Silhouettes of ships in the night  
Just make me long that much more  
Island I see you in all of my dreams  
But I'm a man with no means to reach your distant shore  
  
When the need for love  
Heart and soul accompaniment  
That seems to make me different from you  
  
I've tried to build bridges  
But they all fell down  
I've taken to the air on wings of silver  
But always hit the ground  
  
Well I tried to book passage, but you have no ports  
And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters  
Tore my sails and broke my oars.  
  
Island I see you in the moonlight  
Silhouettes of ships in the night  
Just make me long that much more
