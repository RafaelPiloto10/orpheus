Beyond the temple  
There lies a tomb with a king from long ago  
A traveler from a distant planet  
Ten thousand years or so  
The legend tells of an agin' man  
Whose city he built alone  
Till the pirates of our western world  
Tore it down stone by stone  
  
The clouds are gettin' heavy  
As he points unto the sky  
But with the guidance of his finger  
He let the lightning fly  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
He gathered up his people  
And he took them underground  
To the caves of silvery water  
Where they never could be found  
  
The king came to the surface  
Could not believe what he had found  
The temple left in ruins  
His city knocked to the ground  
  
He went back to his people  
Sad news he had to tell  
The only justice for the king  
Was to put these men in hell  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
His face showing sorrow  
His heart full of grief  
His life's work in ruins  
Destroyed by a thief  
  
His people just sit around  
His children just cry  
The king's mind is all confused  
Just wonderin' why  
  
The temple split in half  
And scattered through the desert  
The dust had risen in the air  
The race of people had to live in devastation  
Why wasn't he even there?  
  
Message from the gods to gather up his people  
The kingdom couldn't lose them there  
That's when all the gods and all are livin' peaceful  
Just a galaxy away  
  
The king rose up from underground  
To light the darkened sky  
Red lights, green lights, blue lights flashing  
It seemed a mile high  
  
As it lifted from the ground  
And soared into the air  
The king looked at what might have been  
A world that needed care  
  
A storm had risen quickly  
Across the take of hope  
Now there's no trace of the king  
Just a memory carved in stone  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price
