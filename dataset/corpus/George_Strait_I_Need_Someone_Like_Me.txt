Your out there somewhere and your crying  
And I love you though we've never met  
Wait there for me, I'll recognize you  
Someone lonesome, someone hurtin', someone blue  
That'll be you  
  
We'll help each other start all over  
A tear for a tear  
A shoulder for a shoulder  
You'll be someone that's born to lose  
'Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too  
  
We'll help each other start all over  
A tear for a tear  
A shoulder for a shoulder  
You'll be someone that's born to lose  
'Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too  
  
'Cause I need someone like me  
To hold on too
