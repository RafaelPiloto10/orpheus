No, no, Mama, now Devil done do-si-do  
Two young boys lyin' dead by the side of the road  
And the coins in their eyes represent the money they owe  
No judge or jury ever gonna hear the story told  
  
Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again  
(Louisiana bayou) Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again  
Louisiana bayou  
  
Sweet girl, daddy done beat that girl like he's insane  
Brother can't watch him beat that girl down again  
So late one night cookin' up with a couple of friends  
Swears his daddy never gonna see another day  
  
Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again  
(Louisiana bayou) Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again

No, no, Mama, the Devil done do-si-do  
See two young boys lyin' dead by side of the road  
Shame shame  
  
Oh it's a shame to lose your way running wild  
Oh it's a shame to lose the light that shines (shame shame)  
Oh it's a shame to lose your way as a child  
Oh it's a shame to lose your  
  
Money on the bed, but you ain't got to go  
Sold your soul just tryin' to get over low  
No empty pocket gonna keep you from gettin' yours  
No judge or jury ever gonna hear the story told  
  
Down by the bayou  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Tryin' to play with the 'caine  
Same old story again
