There was a man, a lonely man  
Who lost his love through his indifference  
A heart that cared, that went unchecked  
Until it died in his silence  
  
And solitaire's the only game in town  
And every road that takes him, takes him down  
And by himself, it's easy to pretend  
He'll never love again  
  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing solitaire  
  
Another day, a lonely day  
So much to say that goes unspoken  
And through the night, his sleepless nights  
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken  
  
And solitaire's the only game in town  
And every road that takes him, takes him down  
And by himself it's easy to pretend  
She's coming back again  
  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing solitaire  
  
A little hope, goes up in smoke  
Just how it goes, goes without saying  
Solitaire  
And by himself it's easy to pretend  
He'll never love again  
Ohhh  
  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing solitaire  
Solitaire, solitaire
