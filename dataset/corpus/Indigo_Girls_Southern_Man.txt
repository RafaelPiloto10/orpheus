Southern man better keep your head  
Don't forget what your good book said  
Southern change gonna come as last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man  
  
I saw cotton  
I saw black  
Tall white fences  
Little shacks  
And southern man  
When will you pay them back  
I heard screaming  
Bull whips cracking  
How long how long  
How  
  
Southern man better keep your head  
Don't forget what your good book said  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man  
Southern man  
  
Lilly belle your hair is golden brown  
I've seen your black man coming round  
I swear by God I'm gonna cut him down  
I heard screaming  
Bull whips cracking  
How long how long  
How  
  
Southern man better keep your head  
Don't forget what your good book said  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man
