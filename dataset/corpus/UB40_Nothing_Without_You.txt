When I'm with you I'm valuable  
Original and fashionable  
I'm totally formidable  
When I'm with you  
  
When you're with me invincible  
I'm bullet-proof unsinkable  
A one off individual  
That's why you're with me  
  
When I caught you unmissable  
So lovable and kissable  
Completely irresistible  
That's why I caught you  
  
Without you I am miserable  
Unconfortable in principle  
I think that we're inseparable  
I'm nothing without you  
  
Now you got me reliable  
Flexible and pliable  
You see its undeniable  
That's where you got me  
  
I'm nothing without you  
A man without a goal  
The last one waiting  
A lost and lonely soul
