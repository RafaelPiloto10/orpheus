(Translation To: Spieluhr)  
  
A small human only pretends to die  
It wanted to be completely alone  
The small heart stood still for hours  
So they decided it was dead  
It is being buried in wet sand  
With a music box in its hand  
  
The first snow covers the grave  
It woke the child very softly  
In a cold winter night  
The small heart is awakened  
  
As the frost flew into the child  
It wound up the music box  
A melody in the wind  
And the child sings from the ground  
  
Up and down, rider!  
And no angel climbs down  
My heart does not beat anymore  
Only the rain cries on the grave  
Up and down, rider  
A melody in the wind  
My heart does not beat anymore  
And the child sings from the ground  
  
The cold moon, in full magnificence  
It hears the cries in the night  
And no angel climbs down  
Only the rain cries on the grave  
  
Between hard oak boards  
It will play with the music box  
A melody in the wind  
And the child sings from the ground  
  
Up and down, rider!  
And no angel climbs down  
My heart does not beat anymore  
Only the rain cries on the grave  
Up and down, rider  
A melody in the wind  
My heart does not beat anymore  
And the child sings from the ground  
  
Up and down, rider!  
My heart does not beat anymore  
  
On Dead Sunday they heard  
This melody from the graveyard  
Then they unearthed it  
They saved the small heart in the child  
  
Up and down, rider!  
A melody in the wind  
My heart does not beat anymore  
And the child sings on the ground  
  
Up and down, rider!  
And no angel climbs down  
My heart does not beat anymore  
Only the rain cries on the grave
