[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We fight by day, and when it's not so bright  
We're not so bright!  
  
[Verse 1]  
We like to beat, and chop and stab our wicked enemy  
But all the time we try to stick to rules of chivalry  
Rule one, we have to do brave deeds for some great lady fair  
I'd write poems, I would joust, and I would fight a bear  
(Well, maybe a teddy bear. Oh, I can't! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We charge ahead, but never left or right  
We're never right!  
  
[Verse 2]  
Rule two, we have to practise in the noble art of war  
Battle for our king and country, that's what knights are for  
And if there is no war to fight, a-hunting we will go  
We hunt for deer and rabbits too, so long as they are slow  
(Otherwise we can't catch them! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We are fighters and our armour's always tight  
And these swords aren't light!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Rule three, in war we aim to capture other knights alive  
Their families pay us lots of dosh so long as they survive  
We act like gentlemen, and only fight with other gents  
A real knight, he would never fight against peasants!  
(Anyway, peasants pong! Eurgh! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
When we ride to war we're such a splendid sight  
We are a sight!
