It's not the glow you feel  
When snow appears  
It's not the Christmas card  
You've sent for years  
Not the joyful sound  
When sleigh bells ring  
Or the merry songs  
Children sing  
  
That little gift you send  
On Christmas day  
Will not bring back the friend  
You've turned away  
So may I suggest the secret of Christmas  
It's not the things you do  
At Christmas time  
But the Christmas things you do  
All year through  
  
That little gift you send  
On Christmas day  
Will not bring back the friend  
You've turned away  
So may I suggest  
The secret of Christmas  
It's not the things you do  
At Christmas time  
But the Christmas things you do  
All year through
