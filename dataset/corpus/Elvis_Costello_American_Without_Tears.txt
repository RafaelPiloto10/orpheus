Outside in New Orleans the heat was almost frightening  
But my hotel room as usual was freezing and unkind  
On TV they prosecute anyone who's exciting  
So I put on my overcoat and went down to find  
  
In Revlon and Crimpelene they captured my heart  
To the strain of a piano and a cocktail murderess  
She was singing that "It's Too Late", I agreed with that part  
For two English girls who had changed their address  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it seems we've been crying for years and for years  
Now I don't speak any English, just American without tears  
Just American without tears  
  
One had been a beauty queen and the other was her friend  
They had known rogues and rascals and showbiz impresarios  
While the boys were licking Hitler they had something to defend  
From men armed with chewing gum and fine nylon hose  
By a bicycle factory as they sounded the siren  
And returned into the dance hall she knew he was the one  
Though he wasn't tall or handsome she laughed when he told her  
"I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham and this is Little John"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At a dock in Southampton full of tearful goodbyes  
Newsreel commentators said "Cheerio, G.I. brides"  
Soon they'll be finding the cold facts and lies  
New words for suspenders and young girls backsides  
  
Now I'm in America and running from you  
Like my grandfather before me walked the streets of New York  
And I think of all the women I pretend mean more than you  
When I open my mouth and I can't seem to talk  
  
Now it seems we've been crying for years and for years  
Now I don't speak any English just American without tears  
Just American without tears
