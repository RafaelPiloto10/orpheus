Where has my love gone?  
How can I go on?  
It seems dear love has gone away.  
Where is my spirit?  
I'm nowhere near it,  
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.  
But Ill blame it on the sun,  
The sun that didn't shine,  
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.  
Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,  
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,  
But, my heart blames it on me.  
Who poured the love out?  
What made this bitter doubt?  
Is peace not here for me to see?  
Wish I could tell you,  
But, words won't come for me to speak.  
But Ill blame it on the sun,  
That didn't fill the sky,  
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.  
Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,  
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,  
But, my heart blames it on me.  
(background)...yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh,  
Your heart blames it on you this time.
