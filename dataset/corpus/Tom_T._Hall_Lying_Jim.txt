Lying Jim, Lying Jim, one of our local brothers  
Hey there Lying Jim, come on tell us another  
Now ole Lying Jim got caught one time a stealin' a bunch of chickens  
The neighbor all got so upset that the law went out to get him  
Jim was sittin' there eatin' a leg and the law said, ?What have you done?  
Jim said, ?I was just passin' that house  
And these chickens followed me home?

Now ole Lying Jim got drunk one time he passed right out in church  
Fell right off the front row pew someone said, ?Lord, he's hurt?  
Next mornin' ole Jim sobered up out on the preacher's farm  
He said, ?Preacher, I was wrasslin' the devil and that rascal broke my arm?

Now ole Lying Jim was broke one time and he tried to borrow money  
Now some thought Jim was terrible some folks thought Jim was funny  
They said, ?Jim we'll give you thirty dollars, just for one more lie?  
Jim said, ?Boys, I ain't got time my old rich uncle just died?

Now Jim was seein' the neighbor's wife and the man came home from work  
Ole Jim grabbed his clothes to run but he only got his shirt  
Well round and round that house they went and Jim was just in the kitchen  
Jim said, ?I was just showin' your wife where I got bit by a kitten?
