Ooh, woman and a woman, them are silly games you play, yeah.  
(didn't you? didn't you?)  
Dealin' with your troubles drove me away.  
Ooh, well a sayin' that you're leavin', I don't want to hear that talk.  
Stare at disbelief in me when I just up and walk  
Outta love (outta love) again, (outta love) once again.  
Ooh, lovin' and a livin' and a treat me like a fool.  
(didn't you? didn't you?)  
You're doin' all you can to make me sad and blue.  
Didn't you?  
Ooh, well a sayin' that you're leavin', I don't want to hear that talk.  
Stare at disbelief in me when I just up and walk  
Outta love (outta love) again, (outta love) once again.  
A-g-g-g-g-gain.
