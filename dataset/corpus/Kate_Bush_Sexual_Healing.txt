Uuh, baby, I'm hot just like an oven  
I need some lovin'  
And baby, I can't hold it much longer  
It's getting stronger and stronger  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve my mind  
Sexual healing, baby  
Sexual healing is something  
That's good for me  
Whenever blue tear drops are falling  
And my emotional stability is leaving me  
There is something I can do  
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby  
And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me  
The love you give to me will free me  
If you don't know the things you're dealing  
Ooh, I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing  
Sexual healing  
Let's make love tonight  
'Cause you do it right  
Baby, I got sick this morning  
A sea was storming inside of me  
And baby, I think I'm capsizing  
The waves are rising and rising  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve your mind  
Sexual healing, baby  
Sexual healing is something  
That's good for me and it's good for me  
And it's so good to me, my baby  
Ooh, come take control  
Just grab a hold  
Of my body and mind  
Soon we'll be making it, we will doin' it fine  
You're my medicine  
Open up and let me in  
Darling, you're so great  
I can't wait for you to operate  
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing  
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing  
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing  
When I get that feeling  
Heal me, baby
