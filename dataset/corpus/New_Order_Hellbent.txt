Old friend, what you doin' out there?  
Come inside, sit yourself on that chair  
It's been a long time, since the last time  
Of many burdons have passed through our hands  
Not end today and day in to tonight  
  
Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry  
You're the star in the sea, your not just anybody  
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach  
Over head, in the sky, is it shining on me? is it shining on me?  
  
I've always knew, that you would not hang around  
You and me were like the thieves of the town  
Too many girlfriends, but not enough love  
Too many late nights, and not enough sleep  
Strung out and wasted, no good in shape for  
The life we tasted, there on the table  
  
Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry  
You're the star in the sea, your not just anybody  
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach  
Over head, in the sky, is it shining on me? is it shining on me?  
  
Open our heart, and deeds in our head, but most of the time, we stay in a
place  
If you go out there, your just up north,  
It's a calm cool world, I slapped that door.
