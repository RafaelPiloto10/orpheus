Love hurts,  
Love scars,  
Love wounds and marks  
Any heart not tough or strong enough  
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud, it holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
  
I'm young,  
I know,  
But even so  
I know a thing or two, I learned from you  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
  
Some fools think  
Of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves, I guess  
They're not foolin' me  
I know it isn't true I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie made too many blue  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
  
I know it isn't true  
I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie made too many blue  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
Ooo-oo, love hurts, Ooo-oo
