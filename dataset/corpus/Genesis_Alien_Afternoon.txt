Woke up in the morning staggered out of bed  
Thought about getting back again, but went downstairs instead  
Read the daily paper have to know the truth  
Slammed the door as I ran outside, looked at my watch and cried  
Gotta get to work on time  
Gotta get to work on time  
  
Then the sky turned a deeper blue  
Not a cloud as the sun shone through  
But all around rain kept falling to the ground  
The wind was blowing but the trees didn't make a sound  
Just another alien afternoon  
Just another alien afternoon  
  
Time that I was leaving while there's still a chance  
Before I start believing in what I see or hear  
Nothing here to keep me, nothing anywhere  
Gotta get out pack my bags before I go insane  
Gotta get away in time  
Gotta get away in time  
  
Then the sky turned from blue to green  
Took on colors I have never seen  
Then a sound started ringing in my ears  
I heard voices but in truth there's nobody there  
Just another alien afternoon  
Just another alien afternoon  
  
To be there back where I belong  
To feel again the wind upon my face  
To see again all that I took for granted  
All that I left and everything I knew  
  
We are home  
We are your home  
We are all your home  
  
Not another alien afternoon  
  
Never more to go wandering  
Never leaving my world behind  
  
There was never a reason  
To leave my heart and my home behind  
Where I was born is where I should be now  
I would never be lonely  
I would never be sad again  
  
I wanted to go anywhere  
I wanted to see how strange it all could be  
Nothing would ever take me away again  
Never more to go wandering  
Never leaving my world behind  
No, no, no, no  
Nothing will ever take me away again, away again  
No, no, no, no
