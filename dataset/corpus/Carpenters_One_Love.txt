One love in my young life  
Took me somewhere I had never been,  
And I want to live again, breath again  
In the shelter of his brightly woven love song.  
So long I have wanted love  
To be sitting just this near to me.  
Now my waiting here is free.  
  
Few are the choices we are given,  
The sand of time pass quickly by.  
  
One dream of my young life  
Now stands holding out his hand to me,  
Now I can't help but believe  
That my whole life will be spent in one love.
