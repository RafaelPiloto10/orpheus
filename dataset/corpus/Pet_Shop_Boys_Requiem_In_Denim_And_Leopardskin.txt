I thought it was like a film  
Reviewed but never seen  
Where everybody played themselves  
As a drama king or queen  
  
The music was overwhelming  
Glitter in and fiend  
Some are chavy like a requiem  
In Denim and Leopardskin  
  
I visualise the flashbacks  
School, home cross obsess  
Heart is too much of everything  
The cliches, the candles, the mess  
  
Lucy and I never seen with David  
Brian never talks  
Help me in policks and sense in Arnold  
Tell me all about Reddocks  
Ozzy's last collection  
Beavis closed himself  
A little more rouge and powder cheeks  
But the base is pay off  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
In ended with a motorbike  
A search for every dance  
Pouring over our photographs  
To make it all fake sense  
Glomorous in it's own way  
Shouting above the dead  
Some are chavy like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
Janice and Marlyn, Ronald Creepers  
Malcom's around the block  
Adam's in the jungle film  
But Luc has let it walk  
The Johnsons and the Jenkins  
Hail by keeping smile  
All you need to make it big  
It takes some style  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
Requiem in denim and leopardskin  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin  
  
This is our last chance for goodbye  
Let the music begin  
Shining and souring like a requiem  
In denim and leopardskin
