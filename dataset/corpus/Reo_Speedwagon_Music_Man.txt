Recently I've been thinkin about what I am and where my priorities lie  
Gettin it together on some future plan, decidin what I need to get by  
I tried workin and schoolin but there just not my plan, oh no  
Can't ya see I'll always be a music man  
  
Well I could be pickin bluegrass or singin the blues,  
It doesn't really matter to me  
As long as I'm playin the music I just can't lose,  
And noones gonna tell me differently  
Cause all I really care about is sittin right here in my hands,  
Oh yeah  
Can't ya see I'll always be a music man  
  
Well my momma sits and worries about me for days  
Even though she really likes the way the boy plays  
My daddy tells her I'm just goin through a phase  
But that's just what he always says  
I hear what they're sayin but I take it with a grain of sand, oh yeah  
Can't ya see I'll always be a music man  
Yeah

Well I've told you my story now here's what I've found  
To be happy you need only be real  
So don't let anyone try to turn your head around  
Just remember you are what you feel  
You see all of my life people been tryin to tell me what I am, oh yeah  
Can't ya see I'll always be a music man, oh yeah
