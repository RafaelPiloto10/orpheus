On sticks and sand, lost my money, lost my hands  
Blood on my brain, too much salt in my veins  
  
And I thought pain was clean  
And I thought hearts were strong  
But bones aren't sticks anymore  
And a day is far too long  
  
So many days never needing any grace  
Live for kicks and danger, there'd be beauty anyway  
  
And I thought pain was clean  
And I thought hearts were strong  
But bones aren't sticks anymore  
And a day is far too long x3
