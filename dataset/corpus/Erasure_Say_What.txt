Say what, make out  
Say what, make out  
  
It's a crazy situation  
Keeps my body hot  
I want infatuation  
Something you ain't got  
  
This fire inside  
A love so bright  
  
[Chorus]  
Say what the hell you think you've done?  
Drive me higher and higher  
Make out there ain't nothing's going on  
Oh you're such a liar  
  
I got no future  
What's the use in keeping tight?  
Always wrapped up in yourself  
Oh you're alright  
Why should I fall?  
No love at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama said you're as good as dead  
If you don't call the shots yourself  
  
Say what  
Love, love, love  
Love don't come easy  
Make out  
  
Why'd you try to fool me  
I see, got no heart  
Threw me tried to rue me  
Tore my head apart  
See you, lover move on  
Seen the right from wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama said you're as good as dead  
If you don't call the shots yourself  
  
[Chorus: x2]
