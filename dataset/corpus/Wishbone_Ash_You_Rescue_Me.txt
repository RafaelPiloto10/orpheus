Among the stars on this side of heaven  
I lay broken and destroyed.  
When people on the earth have cut you down  
The sky's the only place to hide.  
And as I floated in the moonlit night  
You arrived to take me home.  
I kissed your hand and I came back to life  
And all the wrong became all right.  
In all of my dreams  
You rescue me  
It always seems you rescue me.  
I was wandering down endless roads  
A fallen angel in the cold.  
You appeared before me like a vision  
To whisper love I used to know.  
So easily you gave to me secret promises  
Like only magic words can flow.  
In all of my dreams  
You rescue me  
It always seems you rescue me.
