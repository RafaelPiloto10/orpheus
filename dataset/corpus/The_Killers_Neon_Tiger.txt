Far from the evergreen of old Assam  
Far from the rainfall on the trails of old Saigon  
straight from the poster town of scorn and ritz  
To bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz  
  
But neon tiger there's a lot on your mind  
They promised just to pet you, but don't you let them get you  
Away, away, away  
Under the heat of the southwest sun  
  
Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring  
Came from the woodwork and the hopes they might  
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big  
  
But neon tiger there's a lot on your mind  
Strategize to maim you, but don't you let them tame you  
You're far too pure and bold  
To suffer the strain of the pain that's old.  
  
I don't wanna be kept, I don't wanna be caged, I don't wanna be damned oh hell  
I don't wanna be broke, I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be S.O.L.  
Give me rolling hills so tonight can be the night that I send them up a
thousand thrills  
Can you cut me some slack, Cause I don't wanna go back, I want the new day and
age  
  
Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!  
  
Run neon tiger there's a price on your head  
They'll put you down and cut you, I'll never let them touch you  
Away, away, away  
Oh I'm gonna need a neon tiger roar  
  
Under the heat of  
Under the heat of  
Under the heat of the southwest sun  
  
Neon tiger  
There's a lot on your mind
