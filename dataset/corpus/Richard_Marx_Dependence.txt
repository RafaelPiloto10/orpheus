What is this, all of my darkest fears?  
Why have they gathered here?  
To watch a fool go down.  
Go away. Why would you waste your time?  
Here where the sun wont shine.  
There's nothing left for you.  
  
Chorus:  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't want me.  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't need me.  
I can't go on this way  
When everything I do depends on you.  
Depends on you.  
  
I had it all. One of the sunny boys.  
Hear my pride and joy.  
You were always there by me.  
Funny how fast sunny times go by?  
And fall to a darkened sky.  
And lot of useless toys  
  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't want me.  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't need me.  
I can t go on this way  
When every step I take depends on you  
Depends on you.  
  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't want me.  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't need me.  
I can't go on this way  
When everything I do depends on you.  
Depends on you
