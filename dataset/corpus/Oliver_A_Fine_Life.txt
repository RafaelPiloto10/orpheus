Nancy: Small pleasures, small pleasures,  
Who would deny us these?  
Gin toddies -- large measures --  
No skimping if you please!  
I rough it. I love it.  
Life is a game of chance.  
I'll never tire of it --  
Leading this merry dance.  
If you don't mind having to go without things,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a Fine life!  
  
Nancy: And though it ain't all jolly old pleasure outings,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a Fine life!  
  
Nancy: When you've got someone to love,  
You forget your cares and strife.  
Let the prudes look down on us.  
Let the wide world frown on us.  
It's a fine, fine life!  
  
All: It's a fine, fine life  
  
Bet: Who cares if staight laces  
Sneer at us in the street  
Fine airs and fine graces,  
  
Nancy: Don't have to sin to eat  
  
Both: We wonder through London  
  
Nancy: Who knows what we may find  
  
Both: There's pockets left undone  
On many a behind  
  
Nancy: If you don't mind takin' it like it turns out,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a fine life!  
  
Nancy: And keep the candle burn until it's burned out  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a fine life!  
  
Nancy: Though you sometimes do come by  
The occasional black eye  
You can always cover one  
'Til he blacks the other one  
But you don't dare cry!  
  
Bet: No flounces, no feathers,  
No frills and furbelows.  
All winds and all weathers  
Ain't good for fancy clothes.  
  
Nancy: These trappings,  
  
Bet: These tatters,  
  
Bet and nancy: These we can just afford.  
  
Nancy: What future?  
  
Bet: What matters:  
  
Bet and nancy: We've got our bed and board.  
  
Nancy: If you don't mind having to deal with Fagin,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a Fine life!  
  
Nancy: And though diseased rats threaten to bring the plague in,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's fine life!  
  
Nancy: But the grass is green and dense  
On the right side of the fence.  
So we take good care of it  
That we get our share of it  
  
All: And we don't mean pence!  
  
Bet and nancy: If you don't mind having to like or lump it,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a Fine life!  
  
Nancy: Though there's no tea-sippin' and eatin' crumpet,  
It's a fine life!  
  
All: It's a Fine life!  
  
Nancy: Not for me, the happy home:  
Happy husband, happy wife.  
Though it sometimes touches me,  
For the likes of such as me,  
Mine's a fine.  
  
All: Fine life!
