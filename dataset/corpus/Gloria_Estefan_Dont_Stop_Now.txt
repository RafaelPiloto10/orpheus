Whispering those words that make my mind?  
? So fast that it'll find no ending  
I? To a feeling that I can't name love  
My eyes are closed but i? No use pretending  
Outside my head I see I feel? Don't mind  
The beating's getting strong  
And I don't stop now, baby  
Can you take me higher that i've never been  
Those things are all around and I don't stop,  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
Have my mind, can't help it, wonder why  
My body is aching for you all the time? Your love I'm?  
Oh so high I'm?  
You are? Me moving  
From your stop  
  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now
