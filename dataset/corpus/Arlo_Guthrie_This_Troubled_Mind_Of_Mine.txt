There's gonna be some changin' 'round  
Babe, when you come turn me down  
Trifled on me for your last time  
When I come home at night  
Why you always start a fight?  
Now, babe I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some dough  
When you gotta go, you gotta go  
Gonna leave you and ease  
This troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
Now baby I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some sense  
Gonna leave you to ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine
