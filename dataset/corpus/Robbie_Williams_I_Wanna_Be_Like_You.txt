Now I'm the king of the swingers  
Oh, the jungle VIP  
I've reached the top and had to stop  
And that's what botherin' me  
I wanna be a man, mancub  
And stroll right into town  
And be just like the other men  
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!  
  
Oh, oobee doo  
I wanna be like you  
I wanna walk like you  
Talk like you, too  
You'll see it's true  
An ape like me  
Can learn to be humen too  
  
Gee, cousin Louie  
You're doin' real good  
  
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz  
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire  
  
But I don't know how to make fire  
  
Now don't try to kid me, mancub  
I made a deal with you  
What I desire is man's red fire  
To make my dream come true  
Give me the secret, mancub  
Clue me what to do  
Give me the power of man's red flower  
So I can be like you  
  
You!  
I wanna be like you  
I wanna talk like you  
Walk like you, too  
You'll see it's true  
Someone like me  
Can learn to be  
Like someone like me  
Can learn to be  
Like someone like you  
Can learn to be  
Like someone like me!
