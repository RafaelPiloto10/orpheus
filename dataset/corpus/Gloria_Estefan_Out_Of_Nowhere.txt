Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
I don't know where all of this came from  
But I think I wanna get me some  
Did it happen when I looked away  
In just one day  
Suddenly you fell from up above  
And before I knew it, I found love  
Got lost on the way  
But I want to stay  
I just want to let you know tonight  
(All right)  
I can't sleep with all this on my mind  
Can you make it right  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
We can settle this in just one kiss  
Then we'll think of how to deal with this  
All the time it was in my best friend  
Didn't know it then  
But I'm ready for the consequence  
Didn't know this could be so intense  
Can't take it much longer  
This could change today  
I just want to let you know tonight  
(All right)  
I can't sleep with all this on my mind  
Can you make it right  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
I just want to let you know tonight  
(All right)  
I can't sleep with all this on my mind  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
Never knowing what I would find  
Out of a dream into my life  
Must've done something right this time  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
(Out of nowhere, I don't know where you came into my life)  
Out of a dream into my life  
(Baby, into my life, came into my life)  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
(You came into my life)  
Out of a dream into my life  
(Baby)  
Out of nowhere without a sign  
(Out of nowhere came into my life)  
Out of a dream into my life
