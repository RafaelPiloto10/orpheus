Talk that talk to me, yeah  
Talk that talk to me, yeah  
  
I be trying to chill, bitches wanna fuck me  
Every little city I go, fuck me  
Shawty must've heard, got the word, I move that D  
Had it by a bladder, she like "oh I gotta pee"  
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom  
Singer slash actress in my bedroom  
God I have the ticket for a walk through  
Everything that do is big  
I talk big money, I talk big homes  
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome  
Million dollar voice, came through the phone  
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on  
I'm flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza  
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefa  
Sex on the beach, left love speechless  
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up  
What's up  
  
[Chorus]  
One and two and a three and four  
Come on let me know if you want some more  
You know what I like, now get it right  
Boy talk that talk to me all night  
Yeah boy I like it, yeah boy I like it  
Love it when you talk that talk to me yeah  
Yeah that talk to me yeah  
Love it when you talk that talk to me, yeah  
  
Say what you want, say what you like  
Say what you want me to do and I got you  
Tell me how to love you, tell me how to hold you  
I'ma get it right on the first try for you  
'Cause you ain't never had a woman like me, yeah  
And you will never have another like me, yeah  
No, so I'ma give it to you baby  
  
[Chorus]
