Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high  
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm,  
Now all I need's the girl to go with 'em  
  
If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she'll say "My, darling, I'm yours"  
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed  
All I really need is the girl  
  
Got my tweed pressed, I got my best vest, all I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie, got my hopes 'way up high  
I got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I need's the girl to go with 'em  
  
Mm, if she'll just appear we'll take this, this great big town for a whirl  
And if, if she'll say "My, darlin', I'm yours"  
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed  
All I real, really need is the girl
