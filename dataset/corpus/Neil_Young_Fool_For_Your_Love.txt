All through the lonesome night  
I tossed and I turned  
Lost in these dreams of you  
Since the day I learned  
How could you give yourself  
To another man  
A fool for your love,  
Fool for your love.  
Fool for your love.  
  
Look how your eyes have changed,  
All the love has gone  
Where did I lose you babe,  
What did I do wrong  
How could you give yourself  
To another man  
I'm a fool for your love,  
Fool for your love.  
Fool for your love.  
  
Now you won't say goodbye,  
But you don't want to stay  
I never thought that I  
Would lose you this way.  
  
A fool for your love.  
  
All through the lonesome night  
I tossed and I turned  
Lost in these dreams of you  
Since the day I learned  
How could you give yourself  
To another man  
A fool for your love,  
Fool for your love.  
  
Fool for your love.  
A fool for your love,  
I hold on your love.  
I'm just a fool in love with you.  
  
I'm a fool, fool for your love  
I'm just a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for you.
