Learn to love me, assemble the ways  
Now, today, tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a listed crime  
My only weakness is well, never mind, never mind, oh  
  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, hand it over  
Hand it over, hand it over  
  
Learn to love me, assemble the ways  
Now, today, tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a list of crimes  
But last night the plans of a future war  
Was all I saw run Channel Four  
  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, hand it over  
Hand it over, hand it over  
  
A heartless hand on my shoulder, a push and it's over  
Alabaster crashes down, six months is a long time  
I tried living in the real world instead of a shell  
But before I began, I was bored before I even began  
  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, take over
