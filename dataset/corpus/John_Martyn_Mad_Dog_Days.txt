You sit in your room, pretending to cry  
Oh you seem so unwilling to try  
Say what you're selling is just a lie  
And know that your price is far too high.  
  
Every night and every day  
I show you my picture, you just throw the frame away  
With all that you think you've got little to say  
I can't look at your face any more.  
  
Oh the mad dog days  
I say oh they're just mad dog days  
In them mad dog days  
I don't care if it's true  
Between me and you  
Can't see it through  
Please, let me say goodbye.  
  
I never get used to you  
Oh no never, could never get used to you  
I never get used to you  
I never get used to you.  
  
You don't see my dream, I don't see your romance  
You make me feel like a dancer, but you don't care to  
dance  
You see me hit the bottle, you hit the sack  
I go ratbag racing on the flat of my back.  
  
In these mad dog days  
I call them mad dog days  
I know them mad dog days  
I don't care if it's true  
Between me and you  
Can't see it through  
Oh please, let me say goodbye.  
  
I never get used to you  
Oh I never get used to you  
Ooh, I never get used to you  
I never, never, never, never get used to you.  
  
Cos you, you keep sitting in your lonely little room  
You never, never, never come out at all  
You, you keep sitting in your little darkened room  
You're unwilling to try  
Pretending to cry  
You're telling a lie  
Oh please, just say goodbye.  
  
I never get used to you  
I don't want to get used to you  
I never get used to you  
I never, never, no, could never get used to you.  
  
Ah lord I never get used to you  
With your crying  
I never get used to you  
Stop crying, and lying  
Oh I never get used to you  
You know, could never get used to you.
