Hang up the phone, lose my number leave me alone so I can cry  
Don't touch my heart anymore, it's broken and sore  
And the moon just turned blue goodbye goodbye  
  
Just go on back to your old boyfriend he'll take you home and I know why it's
only fair I guess,  
My heart won't die from this and the moon just turned blue, goodbye,  
Goodbye I said the moon must turned blue  
I was looking right at you looking sweet and [unknown] blue and shy,  
  
Oh lord got me thinking baby,  
Such a fancy lad she might be telling mighty fancy lies so count me out of
your triangle  
I'm number three and honey I can't pretend  
I don't need heartache at all my heart can't take the fall and the moon just
turned blue,  
  
Goodbye goodbye it's only fair I guess...  
And the moon just turned blue I said the moon,  
It just turned blue, baby bye bye
