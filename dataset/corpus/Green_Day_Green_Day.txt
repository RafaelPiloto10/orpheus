A small cloud has fallen  
The white mist hits the ground  
My lungs comfort me with joy  
Vegging on one detail  
The rest just crowds around  
My eyes itch of burning red  
  
[Chorus]  
Picture sounds  
Of moving insects so surreal  
Lay around  
Looks like I found something new  
  
Laying in my bed  
I think I'm in left field  
I picture someone, I think it's you  
You're standing so darn close  
My body begins to swell  
Why does one plus one make two?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Laying in my bed  
I think I'm in left field  
I picture someone, I think it's you  
You're standing so darn close  
My body begins to swell  
Why does one plus one make two?  
  
Picture sounds  
Of moving insects so surreal  
Lay around
