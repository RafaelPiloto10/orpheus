I'd walk a thousand miles for you honey  
I'd walk a thousand miles in the sun  
I'd give up both my eyes if I could  
Make you realize  
So why can't you see that I'm the one  
Wish I could buy a limosine  
I'd fill it up and pick you up and  
Drive you to your dreams  
But when you get out on the highway  
Life is seldom as it seems  
And if the car broke down  
You'd start blaming me  
Moonshine bleeds into the dawn  
Who am I to say for you what's right  
And what is wrong  
When your gone gone gone  
The world will carry on  
You're like a song song song  
Who's melody is wrong  
But its so so hard to say so long to you  
My long lost love  
Many a man has sold his soul for silver  
Silver ain't worth nothing next to gold  
Some believe that diamonds shine forever  
But they offer little comfort when you're old  
Can't take it with you when you're gone  
Its the same end for the weak as for the strong  
And if beauty is skin deep  
Then why don't it come more cheap  
And why can't you and I just get along
