You must always remember  
Life can be a challenge  
Life can seem impossible  
It's never easy, when so much is on the line  
  
But you can make a difference  
With courage you can set things right  
The gift to dream and make dream real,  
Is yours and mine  
  
The power of one!  
Begins with believing!  
It's starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world!  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one!  
  
Each of us is chosen  
There's a mission just for you  
Just look inside  
You'll be surprised  
What you can do  
  
The power of one!  
Begins with believing!  
It's starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world!  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one!  
  
Then one by one  
We can make the world  
A much better place!  
  
The power of  
One!  
Begins with believing!  
It's starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world!  
Imagine how life will be!  
When we stand in unity!  
Each of us holds the key  
It's inside of you and me!  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one!  
  
The power of one
