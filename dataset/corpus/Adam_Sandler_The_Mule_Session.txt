My girlfriend left me for a seven foot Indian  
My grandma hung herself on a tree in the Caribbean  
My sister's on the dope and my brother always picks his nose  
And Daddy's only happy when he's wearing Mama's pantyhose, yeah  
I just lost my job to a God damn robot (Good times!)  
Then my dog got in the freeze box, he ate everything I got  
But I've got my mule  
He's a very, very nice mule  
He walks with me home from school  
Cause he's a very, very nice mule  
When he was a baby my mother fed him gruel  
But now he prefers to dine on his own stool  
He always philosophizes with the rabbis after shul  
Cause he's a very, very pious mule  
When he sees a picture of a carrot he has a tendency to druel  
On Halloween he tries to scare me by dressing up as a ghoul  
He once challenged someone who stole my hat to a duel  
Cause he's a very, very Old school mule  
A needle-nosed plier is his favorite tool  
He lifeguards on a volunteer basis and the Rec. Center pool  
When I break down on the side of the road he shows up with unleaded fuel  
He's a devoted fan of Ms. Paula Abdul  
And also approves of the recent makeover of former folkie Jewel  
(coughing)  
When I told him Halle Berry's husband cheated he just shook his head and said
to himself 'what a fool'  
Cause he's a very, very monogamous mule  
(snoring) Porkchop! Wake up, man, the session's not over!  
After several well-publicized arrests for public urination he now drinks
exclusively O'Doul  
And every year he puts on a presentation at the Boys Club to show kids smoking
isn't cool  
His favorite Elvis song is 'Don't be Cruel', no it's 'Hound Dog'  
I was just kidding you
