So your time has come  
Children watch the fools  
Don't let anyone tell you  
What you must do  
Do you like what you see  
Or does it make you cry  
Use your imagination  
And start a fire  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hear that sound  
There's a voice to be found  
Making changes go round  
Hear that sound  
  
And my selfish ways  
Disappeared one day  
With the realization  
Of a new way  
Images of the free  
Coming into view  
Our hearts full of promises  
Of all we can do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So your time has come  
Children watch the fools  
Don't let anyone tell you  
What you must do  
Do you like what you see  
Or does it make you cry  
Use your imagination  
And start a fire  
  
[Chorus]
