You say either  
And I say either  
You say neither  
And I say neither  
Either, either, neither, neither  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
You like potatoes  
And I like potatoes  
You like tomatoes  
And I like tomatoes  
Potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
But oh, if we call the whole thing off  
Then we must part  
And oh, if we ever part  
Then that might break my heart  
  
So it you like pajarnas and I like pajamas  
I'll wear pajamas and give up pajamas  
For we know we need each other  
So we'd better call the calling off, off  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
So if you go for oysters  
And I go for oysters  
I'll order oysters and cancel the oysters  
For we know we need each other  
So we'd better call the calling off, off  
Let's call the whole thing off
