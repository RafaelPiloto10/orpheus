Well it's 40 below and I don't give a fuck,  
Got a heater in my truck and I'm off to the rodeo  
  
It's an alla man left and alla man right  
Come on you fuckin' dummy get your right step right  
Get off stage you god damn goof you know  
  
You piss me off, you fuckin' jerk  
You get on my nerves  
  
Here comes Johnny with his pecker in his hand,  
He's a one ball man and he's off to the rodeo  
  
It's an alla man left and alla man right  
Come on you fuckin' dummy get your right step right  
Get off stage you god damn goof you know  
  
You piss me off, you fuckin' jerk  
You get on my nerves
