Who is counting sleepless nights  
Who is counting letters I meant to write  
I said who is counting at all  
If you are  
I look pretty small  
  
But no matter what I do  
If I couldnt call you mine  
If I couldnt be with you  
Id just be killing time  
  
You went searching for me in the night sky  
And when I burned away you wondered why  
Well Ill tell you babe I could not bear to stall  
I fell too fast I fell too far  
  
But no matter what I do  
If I couldnt call you mine  
If I couldnt be with you  
Id just be killing time  
  
Big big fishes in little ponds  
Ive seen them walk around with magic wands  
  
But no matter what I do  
If I couldnt call you mine  
If I couldnt be with you  
Id just be killing time  
  
There aint no magician hidden inside of me  
So no matter what you hear I hope you see  
That just when Im trying to be tall  
Thats when I end up looking pretty small  
  
But no matter what I do  
If I couldnt call you mine  
If I couldnt be with you  
Id just be killing time  
  
No matter what I do  
(and you know I will burn)  
If I couldnt be call you mine  
(like a star in the sky)  
If I couldnt be with you  
(all Id be doing is)  
Id just be killing time  
  
But no matter what I do  
If I couldnt call you mine  
If I couldnt be with you  
Id just be killing time
