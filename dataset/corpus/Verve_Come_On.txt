I must be feeling low  
I talked to god in a phonebox on my way home  
I told you my answer  
I left you my dreams on your answering machine  
  
Come on  
Let the spirit inside you  
Don't wait to be found  
Come along with my sound  
Let the spirit move you  
Let the waves come up  
They'll fuse you  
I never met no one to deny a sound  
  
I must be going insane  
I called the doctor so he can relieve  
He's got a little pill for me  
Just a little luxury  
Help me through my day  
  
Come on  
Let the spirit inside you  
Don't wait to be found  
Come along with our sound  
Let the spirit move you  
Let the waves come up  
They'll fuse you  
I never met no one to deny our sound  
  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
Come on  
  
There's only one life  
There's only one life  
  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
  
This is a big  
Fuck you!  
This is a big  
Fuck you!  
Come on!  
  
Come on now
