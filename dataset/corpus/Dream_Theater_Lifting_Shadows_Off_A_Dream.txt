He seems alone and silent  
Thoughts remain without an answer  
Afraid and uninvited  
He slowly drifts away  
  
Moved by desire and fear  
Breaking delicate wings  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
As the rain is pouring down  
Tears of sorrow wash his mind  
Drifting with the current  
This stream of life flows on  
  
He seems alone and silent  
Waiting on his hands and knees  
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly  
  
Moved by desire and fear  
He takes a few steps away  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
And she listens openly  
  
He pours his soul into the water  
Reflecting the mystery  
She carries him away  
And the winds die slowly  
  
And she listens openly  
And she listens openly  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
Lifting Shadows off a Dream  
Lifting Shadows off a Dream
