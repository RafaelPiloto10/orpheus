I heard you say  
Life can't go on this way  
And you need to change your view.  
So you packed up and moved out of my life.  
To find a world of your own.  
Even now that you've up and gone.  
For you there's still a place in my heart  
Only real love in my life  
That even time can't erase.  
So darlin'  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love don't shine.  
Darlin' keep this heart in mind  
Everytime.  
I knew you cared  
Cause in your letters you would write and say  
That you missed my lovin' every day.  
Well if that's true,  
All I'd ever why  
Aren't you next to me.  
And you call me on the telephone  
Afraid because you're all alone  
Well, Baby, just remember  
Oh love will abide  
So darlin'  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love don't shine.  
Darlin' keep this heart in mind  
Everytime.
