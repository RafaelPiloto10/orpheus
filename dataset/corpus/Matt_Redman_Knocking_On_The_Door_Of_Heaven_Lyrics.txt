We will give ourselves no rest  
'Till Your Kingdom comes on earth  
We've positioned watchmen on the walls  
Now our prayers will flow like tears  
For You've shared Your heart with us  
God of Heaven, on our knees we fall  
  
Come down in power, reveal Your heart again  
Come hear our cries, the tears that plead for rain  
  
We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven  
We're crying, crying for this generation  
We're praying for Your Name to be known in all of the earth  
We're watching, watching on the walls to see You  
We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough  
We're praying for Your Word to bear fruit in all of the earth  
All of the earth
