And they wandered in  
From the city of St. John  
Without a dime  
Wearing coats that shined  
Both red and green  
Colors from their sunny island  
From their boats of iron  
They looked upon the promised land  
Where surely life was sweet  
On the rising tide  
To New York City  
Did they ride into the street  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam  
  
They are hounded down  
To the bottom of a bad town  
Amid the ruins  
Where they learn to fear  
An angry race of fallen kings  
Their dark companions  
While the memory of  
Their southern sky was clouded by  
A savage winter  
Every patron saint  
Hung on the wall, shared the room  
With twenty sinners  
  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam  
  
By the blackened wall  
He does it all  
He thinks he's died and gone to heaven  
Now the tale is told  
By the old man back home  
He reads the letter  
How they are paid in gold  
Just to babble in the back room  
All night and waste their time  
And they wandered in  
From the city of St. John without a dime  
  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam
