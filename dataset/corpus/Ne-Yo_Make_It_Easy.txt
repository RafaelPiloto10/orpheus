Do you love me for me though?  
The real me not my fly alter-ego?  
I know I'm never not fly,  
But if I ever was, would you still ride?  
  
If it's early in the morning and my breath stink  
Would you still roll over kissing on me like it ain't?  
If I didn't have millions in the bank,  
I'm talking cardboard box and a fish tank  
Better yet a fish bowl,  
And if the fame got old  
If the cameras didn't flash when I walk through  
If I wasn't makin' them bands when I walk through  
Is it where I lost you?  
Or is you holding me down?  
You never let 'em bring me down  
All the haters in the world right now  
Would you add to the stress  
Or would you make it easy  
  
For me to take it easy  
That's what I'm lookin' for,  
Baby let me know would you make it easy?  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, eh  
  
Uh girl I know what I need  
Se appeal, intelligence, positive energy  
When the drama comes, she become serenity  
Lady when I need a lady, freak when I need a freak  
Shawty ride like me like I ride the beat  
Everything bout her quality  
Why I send her and her girls to Dubai for bout a week  
Just a little reward for, for when she hold me down  
Never let 'em bring me down  
All the haters in the world right now  
You're the one that I'm lookin' for to make it easy  
  
Baby, girl  
For me to take it easy  
That's what I'm lookin' for,  
Baby let me know would you make it easy?  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, eh  
  
Where you at? Ey?  
Shawty where you at?  
Baby girl, we got bags to pack  
We got trips to take, if you cool with that  
Show me that you got my back  
Let me see that you got my back  
Then we'll get into all that  
Said we'll get into all that  
You have to make it easy  
For me to take it easy  
That's what I'm lookin' for,  
Baby let me know would you make it easy?  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, ooh oh ooh oh  
Ooh oh ooh oh oh  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, eh eh
