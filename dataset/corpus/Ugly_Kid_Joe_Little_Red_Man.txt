American flag wraps round the pole  
And the little red man is taking control  
The man with the puppet  
Starts to juggle your dreams  
  
And the world that you live  
May not be what it seems  
Hold onto sorrow, it constantly lies  
And the things that I thought always kept me in stride  
  
Smoke cigarettes till the light came to see  
Read the fine print on the wrong guaruntee  
Little Red Man  
You're kind of young  
  
Now its time to retreat  
You're the right people, the wrong ones for me  
Some turn to apples and lemons of spice  
Wings of tomorrow will swallow your pride  
  
I'm just a dreamer, swimming in my mind  
I'm just a dreamer in my mind  
I'm just a dreamer, laughing into mine  
I'm just a dreamer in my mind  
  
Drinking the sunlight  
The salt from the sea  
You're the wrong people, the right ones for me  
Circular motions and things that are found  
  
Wings of tomorrow you won't hear a sound
