No prayers left for heroes,  
The dead won't see the ending,  
War started by rich men  
Won't stop the poor from dying  
  
I'll grant you, your death wish,  
It's not just time I'm killing,  
Blood's thicker than water,  
It's too late to surrender  
  
This will be your last stand,  
I wash the blood from my hands  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I, I'm fearless  
  
I answer no questions,  
You will obey my order,  
I'll punish all sinners,  
This battle has no borders  
  
No saving salvation,  
Your soul is stained and rusted,  
I follow no leader,  
My vigilante justice  
  
I'd rather die on my feet  
Than live a life on my knees  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I, I'm fearless  
  
My skin and bones drip off of me,  
I'm more than man, more than machine  
  
This will be your last stand,  
I wash the blood from my hands  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I, I'm fearless
