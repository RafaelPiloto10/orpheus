We made a promise  
But what's the difference  
Call me friend, what you calling for  
You couldn't take me as I am  
But that was only party chat, I ran.  
  
You asked me up here  
You said it was "gear"  
So Liverpool but  
We never understood the slang  
We couldn't sing it like they sang  
But that was carnaby excuses, I ran.  
  
Like rent-a-driver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You can only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you leave it  
  
Call me baby, how our love grows  
Supremely simple  
Like baby, baby, baby  
You're out of time  
  
Shine, shine shine  
Don't call me shine  
But there's no rhythm to your rhyme, I ran.  
  
Like rent-a-driver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you  
Break a promise  
But what's the difference  
Call me friend--what you callin' for  
You couldn't take me as I am  
But that was only party chat, I ran.
