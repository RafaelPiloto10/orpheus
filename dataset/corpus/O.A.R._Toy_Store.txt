Hoping to find something better  
At least better than what ya thought  
So many aisles to venture down  
So many choices you thought  
  
Then a man come walkin down the aisle  
With a smile as wide as the rain  
But mom she's gotta go away again  
And I'm runnin with the pain  
  
Yeah, la la la la  
You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone  
And walk away  
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want  
  
She says, one toy today, she says  
Why only one or another or none at all  
How come every time I trip I never fall  
Then a man he come walkin down the aisle with a smile as wide as the rain  
  
But mom she gotta go away again and I'm runnin with the pain  
Yah la la la la  
Yah la la la la  
You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone  
  
And walk away  
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want  
She says, one toy today  
So many aisles to venture down  
  
And there's nothin lookin nice  
How come every time I look once, I have to look twice  
But mom she's comin round the bend  
And I'm buyin another toy  
  
And she said son just come along with me  
But I'm runnin with the boys  
Yah la la la  
Yah la la la  
  
You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone  
And walk away  
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want  
She says, one toy today, she says
