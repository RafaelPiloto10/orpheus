Well I'm on the brink, of something horrible  
Just what it is I'm not to sure  
But I can't take it anymore (round 1 fight)  
  
I can't explain the feeling that I feel,  
I'm not even sure that they're for real  
Doesn't work to end in sour tales  
Go to sleep so I can wake up  
Wondering why things are this way  
What the fuck did I just say?  
To make you hate me any way  
  
I'm on the brink, I lost my self control  
I didn't think that this would happen to me anymore  
Just want to be a babe for once  
  
I can't explain the feelings that I feel,  
I'm not even sure if they're for real  
Doesn't work to end in sour tales  
Go to sleep so I can wake up  
Wondering why things are this way  
What the fuck did I say?  
To make you hate me any way  
(You Lose)
