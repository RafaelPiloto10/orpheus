Lost it on the chesterfield  
Or maybe on  
A gamblin' wheel  
Lost it in a diamond mine  
It's dark as hell  
And hard to find  
You can climb to the  
Top of the highest tree  
You can look around  
But you still won't see  
What I'm lookin' for  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?  
Well I still don't know  
  
Out in the back  
In the old corn field  
Underneath the tractor wheel  
Thought I'd dig  
Till I'd found it first  
Broke my back  
And died of thirst  
You can bribe the devil  
You can pray to God  
You can sell off  
Everything you got  
And you still won't know  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?  
And you still don't know  
  
Saw it on the silver screen  
Preacher says  
"Don't know what it means"  
Last page ad  
In a comic book  
Bought me a map  
Showed me where to look  
It ain't carved of stone  
Or made of wood  
And if you paid for it  
Then it's still no good  
And you still won't know  
What I'm looking for  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?
