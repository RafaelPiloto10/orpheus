If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
  
Here we are, how did we come so far  
Just tell me how you are, I need to know  
Night has come to see the senses run  
And every single one, we all must show  
  
And when you feel the flood upon the waters edge  
And take the leap from bitter sweet  
Do you believe, do you believe  
Do you still believe  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
  
In the sea of those eyes, in the fall of the rise  
There is no compromise  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Won't you come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
Won't you come to me
