They say radiation's harmful,  
It's a fact of life  
Without it we would die...  
  
We're nuclear babies now,  
We're nuclear babies now.  
  
We're nuclear babies now,  
We're nuclear babies now,  
We're nuclear babies now.  
  
Radiation's here to stay  
I think I'll cop some cosmic rays  
It gives my skin that healthy glow... Oh-woah.  
  
Makes my eyes shine clear and bright  
And when it's dark I don't need light,  
I'm irridescent all the time... Oh-woah.  
  
There's nothing wrong with a mutation  
They're good for mankind and the nation,  
They're useful for society  
It breaks up the monotony!  
  
Different sizes, different colours  
Some have bones that bend like rubber,  
No two faces look alike  
We snap, We crawl,  
We bounce, We fly,  
Our temperatures unique and vary  
Long and short, We're Bald and hairy  
There's one thing that we're all sure of...  
We're mutants and we just don't care  
  
We're nuclear babies now,  
We're nuclear babies now  
  
Radiation's fine by me,  
The unpredictability,  
I like the way it changes chromosomes.  
  
There's nothing wrong with a mutation  
They're good for mankind and the nation,  
They're useful for society  
It breaks up the monotony!  
  
I've been soaking up those rays for such a long time,  
That I feel fine when I'm blue  
Plutonium will do, or Cobalt too...  
Neutrons, X-rays, don't forget the Gamma rays  
Bop ba bop ba bop ba bop....  
  
There's one thing we're sure of,  
We're mutants and we just don't care...  
  
We're nuclear babies now,  
We're nuclear babies now.  
  
Ahhhh, ah ah ah ah ah ahhhh...  
  
We're nuclear babies,  
We're nuclear babies,  
We're nuclear babies.  
  
Ahhh, ah ah ah ah ah ahhhhh...  
  
We're nuclear babies,  
We're nuclear babies,  
We're nuclear babies.  
  
Ahhhhhhh...
