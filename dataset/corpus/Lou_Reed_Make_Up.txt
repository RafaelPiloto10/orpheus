Your face when sleeping is sublime  
And then you open up your eyes  
  
Then comes pancake factor number one  
Eyeliner, rose hips and lip gloss, such fun  
You're a slick little girl, you're a slick little girl  
Rouge and coloring, incense and ice  
Perfume and kisses, oh it's all so nice  
You're a slick little girl, you're a slick little girl  
  
Now we're coming out, out of our closets  
Out on the streets, yeah, we're coming out  
  
When you're in bed it's so wonderful  
It'd be so nice to fall in love  
When you get dressed I really get my fill  
People say that it's impossible  
  
Gowns lovely made out of lace  
And all the things that you do to your face  
You're a slick little girl, you're a slick little girl  
Eyeliner, whitener then color the eyes  
Yellow and green, oh what a surprise  
You're a slick little girl, oh, you're such a slick little girl  
  
Now we're coming out, out of our closets  
Out on the streets, yes, we're coming out  
Yeah, we're coming out
