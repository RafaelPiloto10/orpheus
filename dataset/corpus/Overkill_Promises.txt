Wishing never got us what we needed  
So we waited for our salvation to arrive  
Then it took everything that we loved  
And it let us alive  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go  
  
Solitary movement meant for two  
Can you hear the loneliness in silent cries  
If you take everything that I love  
Leave me to die  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go  
  
If you take everything that I love  
And you leave here,  
Leave me alive  
If you take everything thet I love  
And I'm standing here  
Waiting to die  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go
