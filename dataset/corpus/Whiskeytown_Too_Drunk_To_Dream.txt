Can you hear that lonesome moanin'  
Is that you or is that me  
My broken heart ain't aching for nothing  
That I can't touch or I can't see  
  
And do you hear that lonesome cryin'  
Thought I made it stop its singin'  
But my hands lay there on the bottle  
And I just drank till my heart would be  
Too drunk to dream.  
  
So baby you can leave if you wanna  
There ain't no drinkin' when the bottle is dry  
Sugar, you can leave if you want to  
I ain't got no more tears to cry  
  
Do you hear that lonesome shuffle  
Of my feet walking out of the bar  
And I stumble down the same damn streets  
My daddy done stumbled before  
  
So baby you can leave if you wanna  
All the flowers in your garden have died  
Baby, I'm gonna have to warn you  
I ain't got no more tears to cry  
  
Well sugar, you can leave if you want to  
There ain't no drinkin' when the bottle is dry  
Baby, I'm gonna have to warn you  
I ain't got no more tears to cry
