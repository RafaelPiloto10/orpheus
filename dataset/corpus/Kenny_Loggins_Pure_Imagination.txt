Come with me, and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
We'll begin, with a spin  
Traveling in a world of my creation  
What we'll see will defy explanation  
  
And if you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
And if you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be
