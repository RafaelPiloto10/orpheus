Do you think I'm so naive,  
How dare you play with me,  
I gave you heart and soul, yeah  
Tell me baby please,  
Why are you screwing with my head,  
I don't think you understand,  
I won't take you shit no more ,  
Don't knock on my door,  
  
Not this time because I recognize,  
I've heard it all before,  
And I e I e I,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think about the times that I wasted,  
Think about the times that I took you back, ain't no way I'll be lonely,  
I don't want to let you back in.  
Let's just face it,  
  
I'm better off alone and I won't turn back,  
You thought that I would be lonely,  
I don't want to let you back in.  
  
Don't tell me how to feel,  
Or say that your for real,  
My mind's made up I'm cool without you,  
You've got no more appeal,  
  
Now this girl don't need no man,  
Say she can do what she can,  
Now I live for me,  
Boy does that make you weak,  
  
Not this time because I recognize,  
I've heard it all before,  
And I e I e I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think of times that you made me cry,  
You had me so confused,  
I'm tired of trying,  
Leave behind this,  
What's a girl to do?  
  
Think of all the times you made me sick,  
I used to think I couldn't handle it,  
What you think I'm just another chick,  
Must of ripped boy you must have tripped,  
What were you thinking when you lost my trust, you had it all and now you left
with nothing,  
Oh baby now I know you want my touch,  
And now your lonely and you still want me,  
  
[Chorus]
