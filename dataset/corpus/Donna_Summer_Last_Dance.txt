Last dance  
Last chance for love  
Yes, it's my last chance  
For romance tonight  
  
I need you by me  
Beside me, to guide me  
To hold me, to scold me  
'Cause when I'm bad  
I'm so, so bad  
  
So let's dance the last dance  
Let's dance the last dance  
Let's dance this last dance tonight  
  
Last dance  
Last dance for love  
Yes, it's my last chance  
For romance tonight  
  
Oh oh I need you by me  
Beside me, to guide me  
To hold me, to scold me  
'Cause when I'm bad  
I'm so, so bad  
  
So let's dance, the last dance  
Let's dance, the last dance  
Let's dance, the last dance tonight  
  
Oh oh I need you by me  
Beside me, to guide me  
To hold me, to scold me  
'Cause when I'm bad  
I'm so, so bad  
  
So c'mon baby  
Dance that dance  
C'mon baby  
Dance that dance  
C'mon baby  
Last dance tonight  
  
Yeah yeah
