Hey yeah yeah  
Give up that booze  
And take out the trash  
Give up the night life  
And stop smoking that hash  
Give up the good sex  
It's a heart attack  
Surrender life  
Wrap it up in a sack  
All dressed up  
In the kings new clothes  
Climbing up the monkey's nose  
Standing out  
Like a stiff on parade  
You're overworked and underpaid  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Got you on the run  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Blocking out the sun  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Beating on his drum  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Got you on the run yeah  
Stop all the traffic  
Put this time on hold  
Stop all the press  
'cause it's been bought and sold  
Stop the revolution  
There's nothing left to fight  
Will the last man standing  
Turn out the light  
Standing out with the freaks in the cold  
Sucking down on a Virginia gold  
The cabarets all dressed for the kill  
They'll stiff you now  
And give you the bill  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Got you on the run  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Blocking out the sun  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Beating on his drum  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Got you on the run yeah  
Solo  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Got you on the run  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Blocking out the sun  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Beating on his drum  
Jello man,  
Jello man  
Got you on the run yeah  
Jello Man
