I was just minding my business  
Life was a beautiful song  
Didn't have a care nor worry  
Then you had to come along  
I fell in love with you first time  
I looked into them there eyes  
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'  
With them there eyes  
They make me feel happy, they make me blue  
No stallin'  
I'm fallin'  
Going in a big way for sweet little you  
My heart is jumpin'  
You sure started somethin'  
With them there eyes  
You'd better watch them if you're wise  
They sparkle, they bubble  
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble  
You're overworkin' 'em  
There's danger lurkin' in  
Them there eyes  
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'  
Maybe you think I'm all lies  
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in  
Them there eyes  
I fell in love with you first time  
I looked into them there eyes  
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'  
With them there eyes  
They make me feel happy, they make me blue  
No stallin'  
I'm fallin'  
Going in a big way for sweet little you  
My heart is jumpin'  
You sure started somethin'  
With them there eyes  
You'd better watch them if you're wise  
They sparkle  
They bubble  
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble  
You're overworkin' 'em  
There's danger lurkin' in  
Them there eyes
