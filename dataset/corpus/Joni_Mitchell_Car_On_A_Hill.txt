I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show  
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio  
He said he'd be over three hours ago  
I've been waiting for his car on the hill  
He makes friends easy  
He's not like me  
I watch for judgement anxiously  
Now where in the city can that boy be  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill  
  
He's a real good talker--I think he's friend  
Fast tires come screaming around the bend  
But there's still no buzzer  
They roll on  
And-I'm waiting for his car on the hill  
It always seems so righteous at the start  
When there's so much laughter  
When there's so much spark  
When there's so much sweetness in the dark  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill
