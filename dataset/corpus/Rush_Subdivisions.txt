Sprawling on the fringes of the city  
In geometric order  
An insulated border  
In between the bright lights  
And the far unlit unknown  
  
Growing up it all seems so one-sided  
Opinions all provided  
The future pre-decided  
Detached and subdivided  
In the mass production zone  
  
Nowhere is the dreamer  
Or the misfit so alone  
  
Subdivisions  
In the high school halls  
In the shopping malls  
Conform or be cast out  
Subdivisions  
In the basement bars  
In the backs of cars  
Be cool or be cast out  
Any escape might help to smooth  
The unattractive truth  
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe  
The restless dreams of youth  
  
Drawn like moths we drift into the city  
The timeless old attraction  
Cruising for the action  
Lit up like a firefly  
Just to feel the living night  
  
Some will sell their dreams for small desires  
Or lose the race to rats  
Get caught in ticking traps  
And start to dream of somewhere  
To relax their restless flight  
  
Somewhere out of a memory  
Of lighted streets on quiet nights
