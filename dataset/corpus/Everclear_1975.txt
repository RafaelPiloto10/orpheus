Brawling scratches mean a bad hair day  
Go on and press your face  
All up against the glass  
Watch and wonder as the pretty things spin and burn  
Swing and missing all  
Almost every time  
Yeah, almost every time  
Brawling scratches mean a bad hair day  
Go on and press your face  
All up against the glass  
Watch and wonder as the pretty things spin and burn  
Swing and missing all  
Almost every time  
I'm not alive, 1975  
I'd spend my time wasted, dull, damaged, and blind  
I'm not alive, 1975  
Yeah, 1975  
I see scratches and the idiot kids  
I watched them getting high  
Out in the cold blue sky  
Watch and wonder as the asphalt babies burned  
Dancing in the flame, laughing all of the while  
I'm not alive, 1975  
I'd spend my time wasted, dull, damaged, and blind  
I'm not alive, 1975  
Watch and wonder as they fade away  
Dull, damaged, and blind  
Sounds a lot like me  
Dull, damaged, and blind  
Yeah, almost all of the time  
Dull, damaged, and blind  
Whoa, 1975  
I'm not alive, 1975  
I was not alive, 1975  
I'd spend all my time wasted dull, damaged, and blind  
1975  
Watch and wonder as they fade away
