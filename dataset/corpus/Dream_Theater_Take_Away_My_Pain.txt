I was sitting on the edge of his bed  
Staring at the headlines on the paper  
He said, "Look at poor Gene Kelly  
I guess he won't be singing in the rain"  
You can take away my heroes  
Can you take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Leave the cold outside  
Please don't let it rain  
Don't stumble on my pride  
  
Take away my pain  
I'm not frightened anymore  
Just stay with me tonight  
I'm tired of this fight  
Soon I'll be knocking at your door  
  
She was standing by the edge of his bed  
Staring at the message on their faces  
He said, "What else can you do, babe?  
I guess I won't be coming home again"  
They just took away all my promises  
Make them take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Leave the cold outside  
Please don't let it rain  
Don't stumble on my pride  
  
Take away my pain  
I'm not frightened anymore  
Just stay with me tonight  
I'm tired of this fight  
Soon I'll be knocking at your door  
  
His final scene  
The actor bows  
And all those years  
Are gone somehow  
The crowd applauds  
The curtain falls  
  
I was standing by the edge of the water  
I noticed my reflection in the waves  
Then I saw you looking back at me  
And I knew that for a moment  
You were calling out my name  
You took away my hero  
Will you take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Let the cold inside  
It's time to let it rain  
There's nothing left to hide  
  
Take away my pain  
I'm not frightened anymore  
I'm learning to survive  
Without you in my life  
Til you come knocking at my door
