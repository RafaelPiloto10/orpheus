My heart flies on her wings  
Now I'm crying, the moon so red  
Tomorrow shall be yet another hell  
To the sun, (the) sky's soul is fed  
Blows pass me  
(I'm) down them I do not feel  
Anything except the shadow is real  
Why did she do it ? , Why did she die ?  
How could she leave without saying goodbye ?  
She has proven my life to be just a lie  
When sea waves crush they hit me hard  
But I do not feel them  
And then reality is no more real to me  
I ask myself, should I end it now  
And rejoin her, at last ?  
I miss the cold embrace of lust  
There's nothing left, just dust  
Nothing is left from my dearest love
