Let's hit the road and throw out the map  
Wherever we go, we won't look back  
Cause we're going places and we're going there fast  
And let's move to Paris and get ourselves a loft  
Let's live in squalor, and spend all cost  
Let's throw caution to the wind and start over again  
  
Think how many doors we'll open  
Just as many stars are shining  
Who knows where we're going  
Yeah who knows what we'll find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
Let's hike in the mountains and challenge our will  
Let's leap over canyons and get lost in the hills  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
Think how many doors we'll open  
Just as many stars are sure to shine  
Who knows where we're going  
And who knows what we'll find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
All of our plans will be at sea  
The sum of all our failures, they cannot hurt us now  
Let's hoist up ourselves  
And shove off to China and climb up a wall  
We'll keep on climbing, looking over it all  
Laughing it up, yeah having a ball  
  
Think how many doors we'll open  
Just as many stars are going to shine  
Who knows where we're going  
And who knows what we'll find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you
