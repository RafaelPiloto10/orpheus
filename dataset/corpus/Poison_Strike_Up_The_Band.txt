Living off the friends we made  
Never ever getting paid  
Kicking ass and paying dues  
Lose our mind in self abuse  
  
Loving ladies by the score  
Waking up and wanting more  
I hope my Mama understands  
When I strike up the band  
  
Well I spit out my anger as the sweat do fly  
Fifteen years of paying dues just to get me by  
Now the barkeeps would pay us by the crowds we bring  
But those son-of-bitches never paid us one damn thing  
And my poor Daddy, he just don't understand  
It's balls out tonight, watch the shit hit the fan  
When we strike up the band  
  
Now those drop dead ladies line the very first row  
I do believe I'd like to spend some time after the show  
Now them years gone by, the barkeeps pay in cash  
And them lovely ladies feed me an earful of trash  
  
And my old lady, she just don't understand  
Why those floozies got their hands on her man  
And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand  
Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn  
When we strike up the band  
  
Living like a gypsy,  
an air conditioned hippie  
Who's never seen the light of day  
Rode dog and cowboy  
Don't know how, boy  
I ever lived this long this way, no, no, said  
  
And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand  
Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn  
When we strike up the band
