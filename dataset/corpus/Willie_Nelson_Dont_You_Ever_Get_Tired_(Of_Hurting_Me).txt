You make my eyes run over all the time and you're happy when I'm out of my
mind  
You don't love me but you won't let me be don't you ever get tired of hurtin'
me  
You must think that I look bad with a smile  
For you haven't let me have one in such a long long while  
Still I keep running back how can this be don't you ever get tired of hurtin'
me  
  
You must think that I look bad...  
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
