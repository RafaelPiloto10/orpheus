If the sun would lose its light  
And we lived an endless night  
And there was nothing left that you could feel  
That's how it would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didn't have your love to make it real  
  
If the stars were all unpinned  
And a cold and bitter wind  
Swallowed up the world without a trace  
Ah, well that's where I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face  
And if no leaves were on the tree  
And no water in the sea  
And the break of day had nothing to reveal  
That's how broken I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didn't have your love to make it real  
If the sun would lose its light  
And we lived in an endless night  
And there was nothing left that you could feel  
If the sea were sand alone  
And the flowers made of stone  
And no one that you hurt could ever heal  
Well that's how broken I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didn't have your love to make it real
