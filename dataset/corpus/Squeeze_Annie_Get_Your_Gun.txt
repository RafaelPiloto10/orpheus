She goes for her medical  
She's passed, its' a miracle  
She's up over the moon  
She whistles nonsense tunes  
She wants drinks for everyone  
She's found a chord that she can strum  
Emotions peaking out  
Her paints all over town.  
  
[Chorus]  
What's that she's playing?  
Annie get your gun  
What's that she's taking  
The song has to be sung  
She's gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
That's unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Don't pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Don't shoot that singer  
You're shooting number one, number one  
  
He's not into miracles  
Sees life all to cynical  
The cat has got his tongue  
Now she bangs on his drum  
He says pull the other one  
Bells ring, look what you have done  
Emotions leaking out  
Her paints all over town.  
  
What's that she's playing?  
Annie get your gun  
What's that she's taking  
The song has to be sung  
She's gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
That's unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Don't pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Don't shoot that singer  
You're shooting number one  
  
Get your gun  
Get your gun  
She's gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
That's unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Don't pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Don't shoot that singer  
Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie
