Met my match today  
Felt the blood rushing and mingling  
A curious and enigmatic thing now  
Spiders in my dreams  
Synchronicity weaves like a web when  
You were meant to be a meal  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I understand why they say  
High school never ends  
  
Ill never act my age  
But you can tell byu the lines in my smile  
That I have been around for a while  
So insecurities  
Are about as useful as trying  
To put the pin back in the grenade  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I understand why they say  
High school never ends  
  
This isn't coincidence  
There's no such thing  
This isn't coincidence  
There's no such thing  
No such thing
