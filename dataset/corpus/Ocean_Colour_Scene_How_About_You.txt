Today I find all my world is slowly turning blue  
How about you  
I walk around with my head in the sky and it is blue  
How about you  
Today I find all the things I held so high are in the ground  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  
Today I see a million faces in shades of fading blue  
How about you  
I felt so sure familiar places and children's skies are blue  
How about you  
Today I find all the things I held so high are in the ground  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you
