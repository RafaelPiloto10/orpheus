Down in Texas near the DFW among the shrubs and patios and barbecues  
Was born a suburban boy named Billy be Bad  
Had a white bread momma and a rock and roll dad  
Didn't have much soul or country roots but he sure looked cute in his cowboy
suit  
  
Bbb...Billy Billy be Bad, bbb.. Billy Billy be Bad  
Bbbb... Billy Billy be Bad bbb... Billy Billy be Bad  
Bbb... Billy Billy be Bad bbb... Billy Billy be Bad  
He can spot a trend and he knows a pad he's a country singer named Billy be
Bad  
  
He sounds like everybody on the radio he's building up his biceps for the
video  
The people at the label said we like to start 'em young  
We know you're twenty three but we'll say you're twenty one  
They played him some Strait they played him some Jones  
  
Now he's got that country music way down in his bones  
Bbb... Billy Billy be Bad...  
Watch out for your daughters he's gonna drive 'em mad  
The country sex symbol called Billy be Bad  
  
Now poor ol' Billy's at the end of the line  
He's over the hill cause he's pushing twenty nine  
He's not as young and he's not as handsome he just tested positive for
brandson  
He'll never be that hot again look for his music in the oldies bin  
  
Bbb... Billy Billy be Bad...  
What a great career he had say goodbye to Billy be Bad
