Come on!  
It is you and me...  
  
I see you standin' there  
And I'm watchin' every move you make  
I'm just waiting for the moment to... walk up to you... and tell the truth  
You will understand  
Something about you makes me lose control  
Takes my thoughts into another world  
Where you touchin' me and you can't let go...  
  
I see you standin'  
Across a floor  
I'm comin' to ya... to ya... to ya...  
  
Baby I... I'm gonna make you feel alive  
Ohh... I'm standin' right in front of you... all you have to do  
Is see it... see it... see it...  
  
Baby I... You know I make you feel alive  
Ohh... Love's right in front of you... all you have to do  
Is see it... see it... see it...  
  
Sometimes I try to find  
A million reasons not to be with you  
Now you are way deep inside of me  
And it makes me weak  
Ohh I just can't breathe  
  
I see you dancin'  
On the floor  
I'm comin to you... to you... to you...  
  
Baby I... I'm gonna make you feel alive  
Ohh... I'm standin' right in front of you... all you have to do  
Is see it... see it... see it...  
  
Baby I... You know I make you feel alive  
Ohh... Love's right in front of you... all you have to do  
Is see it... see it... see it...  
  
I make you feel alive  
  
Baby I (Baby I...)... I'm gonna make you feel alive (Gonna make you feel
alive...)  
Ohh... I'm standin' right in front of you... all you have to do  
Is see it... see it... see it...  
  
Baby I... I... ! You know I make you feel alive (Somethin's wrong with you
baby...)  
Ohh... Love's right in front of you (You're not gonna feel)... all you have to
do (You're not gonna feel... so alive)  
See it... see it(So alive)... see it...
