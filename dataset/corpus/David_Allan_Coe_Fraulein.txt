Far across the deep blue waters lives an old German's daughter  
On the banks of the old River Rhine  
Where I loved her and left her now I can't forget her she is my pretty
Fraulein  
Fraulein Fraulein walk down by the river each night when the stars start to
shine  
By the same stars above you I swear that I love you you are my pretty Fraulein  
[ fiddle - steel ]  
When the memory wanders away over yonder to that cute girl that I left behind  
In a moment of glory her face comes before me the face of my pretty Fraulein  
Fraulein Fraulein walk down by the river...  
You are my pretty Fraulein
