Suddenly it happened so fast  
I couldn't believe the news that I received  
My heart stopped as I hit the floor  
I fell to my knees crying, "Lord help me"  
No matter what time brings  
All the changes we go through  
In life there's some things  
We just can't prepare for  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
Don't they know  
True love never dies  
I promise to love you  
For the rest of my life  
Life goes on, that's what they say  
Time will heal all your pain away  
But I feel, feel so alone and  
Now you're gone, how can I live on?  
No matter what time brings  
All the changes we go through  
In life there's some things  
That we just can't prepare for  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
Don't they know  
True love never dies  
I promise to love you  
For the rest of my life  
Until I see you again  
I'll hold on to sweet memories  
I'll treasure the times we spent  
I see I'd do anything  
I see your face, I see your smile  
Calling out my name  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
Don't they know  
True love never dies?  
I promise to love you  
For the rest of my life  
I don't care what they say  
Don't care what they do  
I don't care what they think  
I'm gonna love you  
For the rest of my life  
I don't care what they say  
I don't care what they do  
What they think  
'Cause I promise, I promise  
To love you  
For the rest of my life  
(For the rest of my life)
