Lies, lies, I can't believe a word you say  
Lies, lies are gonna make you sad some day  
Tears, tears, I've shed a million tears for you  
Tears, tears, and now you're loving someone new  
Someday I'm gonna be happy  
But I don't know when just now  
Lies, lies, you're breaking my heart  
You think that you're such a smart boy  
And I'll believe what you say  
Who do you think you are, boy?  
To lead me on this way, hey  
Lies, lies, I can't believe a word you say  
Lies, lies are gonna make you sad some day  
Someday you're gonna be lonely and you won't find me around  
Lies, lies, you're breaking my heart  
Someday I'm gonna be happy  
But I don't know where or when  
Lies, lies, you're breaking my heart  
You think that you're such a smart boy  
And I'll believe what you say  
Well, who do you think you are, boy?  
To lead me on this way, hey, hey, hey  
Lies, lies, I can't believe a word you say  
Lies, lies are gonna make you sad some day  
Someday you're gonna be lonely but you won't find me around  
Lies, lies, you're breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart
