He is the king of all the land  
In the Kingdom of the sands  
Of a time tomorrow.  
  
He rules the sand worms and the Fremen  
In a land amongst the stars  
Of an age tomorrow.  
  
He is destined to be a King  
He rules over everything  
On the land called planet Dune.  
  
Body water is your life  
And without it you would die  
On the desert the planet Dune.  
  
Without a still suit you would fry  
On the sands so hot and dry  
In a world called Arrakis.  
  
It is a land that's rich in spice  
The sand riders and the "mice"  
That they call the "Muad'Dib".  
  
He is the Kwizatz Haderach.  
He is born of Caladan  
And will take the Gom Jabbar.  
  
He has the power to foresee  
Or to look into the past  
He is the ruler of the stars  
  
The time will come for him  
To lay claim his crown,  
And then the foe yes  
They'll be cut down,  
You'll see he'll be the  
Best that there's been,  
Messiah supreme  
True leader of men,  
And when the time  
For judgement's at hand  
Don't fret he's strong  
And he'll make a stand,  
Against evil and fire  
That spreads through the land,  
He has the power  
To make it all end.
