Not by the way of an apology  
For the things that I have done  
Do I set my boat upon the sea  
So like thunder, I am breaking free  
In the landscape of the heart  
It's hard to tell what's really taken me  
  
Now I see it all through different eyes  
This emotion can't be wrong  
Past the mountains under empy skies  
And the road goes on and on.  
  
I've been living through this poetry  
Tangled words and worn out prose  
Love is needing, love is bleeding me  
  
Now I see it all through different eyes  
This emotion can't be wrong  
Past the mountains under empty skies  
The road goes on  
Now I see it all through different eyes  
Where I'm going, where I've gone  
All I know - I'm still surprised  
That the road goes on and on.
