I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love  
And I'll never ever make you cry  
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love  
And love is something that money can't buy.  
  
Well, a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances  
Are sometimes very few  
Ain't got no money if you'll be my honey  
Here's what I'll offer you.  
  
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love  
And I'll never ever make you cry  
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love  
And love is something that money can't buy.  
  
Oh, we met by chance and I knew at a glance  
That I'd found my destiny  
I'd still carry you off and marry you if  
You would agree.  
  
To givin' me love that's above and beyond the call of love  
And I'll never ever make you cry  
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love  
And love is something that money can't buy
