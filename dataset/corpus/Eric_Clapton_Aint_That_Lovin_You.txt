You don't know me, baby,  
Like I know myself.  
I just want to love you, baby,  
But you leave me on the shelf.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
Ain't that lovin' you, baby?  
But you don't even know my name.  
  
Let me tell you something,  
I swear to God it's true.  
If you give your love to me,  
I'm gonna give it all to you, you know it's true.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They may kill me, baby,  
And bury me like they do.  
My body will lie, but my spirit's gonna find  
Only you.  
  
[Chorus]
