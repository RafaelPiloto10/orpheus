I know you're scared  
I can feel it  
It's in the air  
I know you feel that too  
But take a chance on me  
You won't regret it, no  
One more "no" and I'll believe you  
I'll walk away and I will leave you be  
And now's the last time you'll say no, say no to me  
  
It won't take me long to find another lover  
But I want you  
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you  
  
If you don't ever say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Cause my heart is open  
Now you gotta say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
  
It's just a moment go and seize it  
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me  
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no  
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love  
I'll do anything you want me to  
Cause I can't breath until I see your face  
  
Oh and I don't need time to find another lover  
But I want you  
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you  
  
If you don't ever say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Cause my heart is open  
Now you gotta say yeah  
Let me hear you say yeah  
Wanna hear you say yeah yeah yeah  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
Wanna hear you say  
  
Yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes, yes
