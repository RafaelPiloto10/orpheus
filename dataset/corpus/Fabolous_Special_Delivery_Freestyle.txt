[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
It wont stop 'till these young cowards bleed  
So if you see the kid spittin' shells it ain't 'gon be sunflower seeds  
Ya rims are too small rocks are too little  
When ya talk to birds and rats like Dr. Dolittle  
I barely reloads  
I got those  
Slugs that'll hit you in different area codes  
Keepin' mine homie  
I ain't Scarface I'm the quiet dude that creep behind Tony  
I do it for fifty thousand  
I'm the kid involved with more projects than New York City Housing  
I get in ya girly's hiney  
Cause they ain't seen the Jordans on my feet since the early ninetys  
Since Box Beamers  
I been bustin' on chick's faces 'till they look like they covered in Noxzema  
I'm still be stashin' the sket  
Even after my soundscan numbers look like the national debt holla

Please believe it  
Believe it please  
We here now  
Yeah uh
