This is a hidden track right after "Nan's Song", on Escapology.  
  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh  
  
Things got weird  
Like a three year old with a beard  
Like a vision of Britney Spears  
Like a tuna always seared  
Do you like it a lot?  
Guess what's on the clock?  
I'd rather fanny about on a yacht  
Stop staring at the stars  
  
Save The Children  
Save The Children  
  
Things got weird  
Like a three year old with a beard  
Like a vision of Britney Spears  
Like a tuna always seared  
Do you like it a lot?  
Guess what's on the clock?  
I'd rather fanny about on a yacht  
Stop staring at the stars
