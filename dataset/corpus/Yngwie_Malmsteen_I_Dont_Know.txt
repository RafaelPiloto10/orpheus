Living in a big world,  
that ain't too kind to me.  
lookin' for some changes  
that no one wants to see  
running round in circles  
nowhere left to go  
too many uniforms  
tryin' to run this show  
I don't know  
it's never what i wanted  
living in this heap  
got to get the hell out  
I'm in too fuckin' deep  
this world is a crazy place  
I'll take it day by day  
lord, won't you help me  
I got to get away  
I don't know.
