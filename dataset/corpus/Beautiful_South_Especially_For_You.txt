Only buy this if you're lonely  
Only listen if you're blue  
If you are married and you are happy  
This song is not to do with you  
  
If you're listening at your work place  
Feeling small amongst the men  
Do not sing this to your workmates  
This song is not to do with them  
But if you're sitting on a barstool  
Wondering what on earth to do  
Don't let them tell you no-one cares  
This songs one especially for you  
  
If you are listening on your radio  
Smiling while you drive along  
Tune the band into another  
Because this song is not your song  
  
If you're working as a DJ  
Leave this record in it's sleeve  
Cause this ones not for general airplay  
This song's for the day she leaves  
  
If you've bought this and you're sinking  
And I think that you know who  
It matters not the mouth that's singing  
This song's one especially for you  
  
So this goes out to the lonely  
So this goes out to the sad  
And it goes out to the only  
One you felt you ever had  
  
If you're there in total darkness  
With a letter in your hand  
Do not bother with the letter  
lust listen to the band  
  
So only buy this if you're lonely
