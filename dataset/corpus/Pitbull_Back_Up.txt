(Chorus)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold Diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 1)  
I'm in the cut in the club  
Scopin the scene  
Cup half way full  
Smokin the green  
She got her hand on my nuts  
What does that mean?  
Pointed at her friend  
And she said, they'll tag team  
Now who said dreams don't come true  
Its like I'm dreamin  
When I come through  
I always find something to run through  
Speak into the mike mami  
Mic check one two  
Drunk in the club  
Off the chain  
But who gives as fuck?  
That's why I came  
So pour it up  
And get down  
Ya'll have no choice  
But to listen to Pit now  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 2)  
Everybody knows  
Pit's got tight raps  
When I'm in the club  
DJs bring it back  
With no questions asked  
But the number one question is  
"Does he got cash?"  
Lil Jon's at the bar  
While me and them eastside boys smoke out  
Roll another one  
No doubt  
Get a couple hoes  
Roll out  
Beef, you don't want none  
To go down  
dumb diddy dumb dumb  
My times now  
The city I'm from  
Is covered with federals  
That'll make your crew run run  
Your crew run run  
Its next to come  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
(Verse 3)  
I convince mami to creep on the DL  
Even though my head spinning  
Like some sprewells  
Skip the details  
Its the vodka bottom line  
that's testin my patience like doctors  
I'm not impressed by the cool shit  
Or those chains or that ice or them cars  
All that's bullshit  
If that's what your lookin for  
Keep lookin hoe  
Cause you got the wrong one bitch  
I'll let you know  
Mami's like damn  
That Cuban's shot out  
Bitch I came to the club  
To wild out  
If you came to act up  
Then you need to get from me bitch  
And back up  
(Chorus)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)  
It don't involve money then (back up)  
Dawg, get from me and (back up)  
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)  
Haters in the club (back up)  
Gold diggers (back up)  
Broke niggaz (back up)  
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)
