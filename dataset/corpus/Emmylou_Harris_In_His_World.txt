Every night I dream about him  
In my world of fantasy  
I pretend that we're together  
In his world there's a garden in the moonlight  
In his world there's a sweet and gentle breeze  
In his world, oh he tells me that he loves me  
That's where my heart wants to be  
  
I saw a star falls from the heaven  
I hope the wish I made comes true  
I don't want to live without him  
In his world I can see a new tomorrow  
In his world where he gives his heart to me  
In his world we will share this love together  
That's where my heart wants to be  
  
Why must I go on pretending  
Why can't I tell him how I feel  
These sweet dreams are never ending  
And this loneliness is real  
  
I saw a star fall from the heavens  
I hope the wish I made comes true  
I don't want to live without him  
In his world I can see a new tomorrow  
In his world where he gives his heart to me  
In his world we will share this love together  
That's where my heart wants to be  
  
In his world there's a garden in the moonlight  
In his world there's a sweet and gentle breeze  
In his world, oh he tells me that he loves me  
That's where my heart wants to be
