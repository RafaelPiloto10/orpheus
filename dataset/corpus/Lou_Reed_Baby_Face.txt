Jim, livin' with you'd not such fun  
You're not not the only one  
You don't have the looks  
You're not the person that you used to be  
And there are people in the street that would go for me  
  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no, baby face  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no, baby face  
  
I met you in a bar in L.A., I was not feeling so good  
And you made the proper moves, you did everything that you should  
But now you're making a mistake  
And somebody else will take your place  
You're talking drugs over me  
  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no, baby face  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no, baby face  
  
You're not the kind of person that's easy  
To live with in a house  
I cool all your meals  
I make sure that you work out  
But lately it's been gettin' so hard  
The way you talk, oooh, the way you walk  
And I'm not sure exactly what it's all about  
  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no, baby face  
And I said, no, no, no, no, no, baby face  
And I said, no, no, no, no  
And I said, no, no, no, no, oooh, baby face  
No, no, baby face  
No, no, no, baby face  
(You can keep it, just keep it)
