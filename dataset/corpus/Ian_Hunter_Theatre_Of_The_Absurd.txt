(ian hunter)  
  
My tea turned seven shades darker  
As I sit 'n' write these words  
And london's gettin' paler  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
You figured for an evening  
And you made it all worthwile.  
It's seldom people have a job  
And even rarer that I smile.  
  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours.  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower.  
  
And if your songs be classics,  
Throw them to the hurd.  
Truth is where they came from  
And not this theatre of the absurd.  
Some say you wanted to play for me  
But it's only what you've heard  
That made you want to capture me  
In your theatre of the absurd.  
It was not me, I said myself  
And you must do so, too.  
I hope you have the strength to stay  
When I'll be watchin' you.  
  
So baby,  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours.  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower.  
  
Oh when I got here back home tonight  
Something within me stirred.  
Oh it must have been a different kind of play  
That touched my theatre of the absurd.  
Now I'll be on my way alone  
But an interesting thing occurred  
See nobody ever shared too much  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
And there I was back in london,  
Thought about history.  
It was just like being in school again  
But I felt something movin' in me.  
Hearin' just a bit of the future,  
Oh it's comin' and it's still blurred  
And that's the only thing worth living for  
In my theatre of the absurd.  
  
Come on,  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Teach your children to be them  
And never ever ours.  
Oh play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Someone took the park away  
But they left a lonely flower.  
  
(beautiful)  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
(john, come on)  
Play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Oh, play me some, (come on, eric) play me some,  
Play me brixton power.  
Oh, play me some, play me some,  
Play me brixton power.
