[Chorus:]  
Here we go, vertigo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
Here we go, in slo-mo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
  
Some kind of trouble on the sensory screen  
Camera curves over caved-in cop cars  
Bleacher-creatures, would-be desperados  
Clutch at plausible deniability  
Don't touch that dial,  
We're in denial  
Until the showcase trial on TV  
  
Some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news  
Miles of yellow tape, silhouetted chalk lines  
Tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knock-offs  
Conform to uniforms of some corporate entity  
Don't change that station  
It's Gangster Nation  
Now crime's in syndication on TV  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some kind of drama live on satellite  
Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom  
Nail-biting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets  
Clutching at the straws of respectability  
Can't do the time?  
Don't do the crime  
And wind up in the perp. walk on TV
