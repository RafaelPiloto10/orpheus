You go where you want  
You do what you please  
Never let on, that even once  
That you've ever been lonely  
It's nice to see you alone  
Are you lookin' for somethin'  
Maybe you ain't gettin' at home?  
  
Your hair is in place  
You're dressin' to kill  
Your old man has promised  
When he died he would leave you his money  
And the pool where you swim  
Are you lookin' for somethin'  
Maybe you ain't gettin' from him?  
  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
To get a little action on the side  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
The day time queen takes a midnight ride  
  
And it's plain as plain can be  
You're a woman who wants to get free  
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,  
Come on and step out with me  
  
The party's a bore  
It's bound to get worse  
Let's sneak out somewhere  
And engage in our own celebration  
Will you pour me some wine?  
Are you thinkin', baby, maybe  
Your needs are the same as mine?  
  
Wanna go for a walk,  
Go for a ride,  
Maybe just stand here and think  
What we can do to each other  
No, we don't have to dance  
If you're thinkin' of steppin' out  
Baby, this is your chance  
  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
To get a little action on the side  
Steppin' out, steppin' out  
The day time queen takes a midnight ride  
  
And it's plain as plain can be  
You're a woman who wants to get free  
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,  
Come on and step out with me
