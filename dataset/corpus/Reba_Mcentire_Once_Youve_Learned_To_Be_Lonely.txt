You're asking me to open up  
I'm tryin' my best to give enough  
To keep this love alive  
It wouldn't be so hard for me to do  
If it hadn't have been for all my heart's been through  
  
But once you've learned to be lonely  
And lonely is the only thing you've known  
It begins to feel like home  
It becomes your comfort zone  
  
And once you've learned to be without someone  
And settle for the silence of an empty room  
Oh, it changes you  
There's a lot you have to undo  
Once you've learned to be lonely  
  
It becomes a habit of the heart  
To be afraid to even start  
To try and love again  
I want to give you myself to you  
But I've been alone that I'm scared to move  
  
But once you've learned to be lonely  
And lonely is the only thing you've known  
It begins to feel like home  
It becomes your comfort zone  
  
Once you've learned to be without someone  
And settle for the silence of an empty room  
Oh,it changes you  
There's a lot you have to undo  
Once you've learned to be lonely  
  
I've built these walls but I feel them falling down  
Touch by touch your love is my way out  
  
But once you've learned to be lonely  
And lonely is the only thing you've known  
It begins to feel like home  
It becomes your comfort zone  
  
Once you've learned to be without someone  
And settle for the silence of an empty room  
Oh,it changes you  
There's a lot you have to undo  
Once you've learned to be lonely  
There's a lot you have to undo  
Once you've learned to be lonely.
