Just one more dance, just one more chance so I can talk to you.  
Don't run around, don't turn me down and I will try to prove  
I would do anything you want me to.  
  
Just one more dance, just one more chance let me talk to you.  
Don't go too far with that crowd at the bar  
That's not the way to win, please fall in love again.  
Give me your heart so I can start to build our life anew.  
  
Just one more dance, just one more chance let me talk to you  
  
Don't go too far with that crowd...
