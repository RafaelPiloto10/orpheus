[Hook: Gucci Mane]  
The tints on my shit there look darker  
Pouring up drank nigga, my shit darker  
The kush came in this time look darker  
I'm whipping up a brick and the work look darker  
Kush came in this time look darker  
Pouring up drank nigga my shit darker  
The work came in this time look darker  
And the tints on my shit there look darker  
  
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]  
  
Dark tint on my soowoo red charger  
The niggas round me drink lean not water  
I could never hold a job down like my father  
But I could hold a block and push the rock, Shawn Carter  
Bitches on my dick cause my skin real darker  
Got a yellow bitch and The Devil Wears Prada  
Got the narcs on me say my car tail got bothered  
Big fish in little pond, get swallowed  
Dark weed, super dark weed, Cali og  
Dark lean, super dark lean, straight codeine  
Dark meat pretty brown bitch that adore me  
Dark tint on my dark bent on a dark street  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]  
It's a dark night, had a gun fight with a dark clique  
Set up by a dark skin bitch, she was dumb thick  
Gucci Mane keep pulling up in darkly painted cars  
Dropped the top on your bitch, now she looking at the stars  
Diamonds dancing on my wrist, you dancing with the star  
Gucci Mane so geeked up, he don't care you light or dark ho  
I just paid 300 cause didn't have nowhere to park ho  
If Gucci Mane just bought why the fuck he paint it darker  
That shit was already hard, Now he made it harder  
Cali kush, just touched down nigga and this pack a lil' darker  
Dog food bricks and cocaina them, now they look darker  
Dark skin brick I'm touching it and with it whipping away from the water  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: Chief Keef]  
(Squad!)  
I just bought six pints, they dark as fuck (Leaning)  
Bitch I'm with the dart gang, don't think so we dart you up  
Bitch I'm with the art gang, don't think so we paint you up  
Them niggas ain't with us, them niggas lame as fuck  
Bitch we the Black Disciples so our blood a lil' darker  
I'm rolling in that Beamer big guwop in his charger  
And we racing down your block like we ain't riding Forgiatos  
Disrespect So Icey Brick Squad we gon' drop you  
Beat the lil' nigga ass like his father  
On that Glo' Boys shit, you ain't with it we pop you  
These lil' bitches on my dick cause my money got larger  
I'm smoking on this Keisha getting head from Ms. Parker  
  
[Hook:]
