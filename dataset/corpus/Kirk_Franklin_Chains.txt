Chains  
That try to bind me  
Chains  
That won't let me go  
Oh Chains  
They keep me from trying  
Chains  
Please loose your stronghold  
Chains  
Though I try to surrender  
Chains  
Yet still I remember  
Whom the Son sets free  
Is truly free indeed  
Lord free me from these chains  
  
Chains  
And a heart full of sorrow  
Chains  
I won't sleep well tonight because of these  
Chains  
How I long for tomorrow  
Cause today  
There are no tears left to cry  
Chains  
Though it feels cold as winter  
Chains  
I will fight to remember  
That by your stripes  
I'm healed  
To your heart Lord I appeal  
Please free me from these chains  
  
Of abuse (Chains)  
Of suicide (Chains)  
Pain from my past (Chains)  
That robbed my peace of mind (Chains)  
Chains of divorce (Chains)  
Addiction and fear (Oh Chains)  
Being afraid to die (Chains)  
And afraid to live (Chains)  
Chains of depression (Chains)  
Haven't laughed in a while (Chains)  
Restore my joy (Chains)  
And give me back my smile (Ooh Chains)  
I do love you Jesus (Chains)  
But not like I should (Chains)  
I love you forever (Chains)  
But not like I could (Chains)  
Have mercy on me (Chains)  
Can't go on this way (Chains)  
Save me I'm lost (Chains)  
Help me believe what you say (Chains)  
This is just a test (Chains)  
Though it's hard to see (Chains)  
I surrender your will (Chains)  
So now I ask you please  
Free me from these  
Oh please free me from these  
Oh free me from these  
  
I know you can  
You said you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
I know you can  
Please if you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
I believe you can  
I believe you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
So if you can  
I pray you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
  
Please Lord I'm begging you  
Free me from  
Oh free me from (from these)  
Free me from these  
Chains [x5]
