The moon begins to rise upon my fallen eyes  
I'm taken back to firelight  
A drunken dreamer's plan to stay just as I am  
Amidst the dancing paradise  
A case of beer, a smile, a motorcycle child  
I feel the glow surround me  
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you  
  
Orange funnels and snowy tunnels  
Summer troubles and books in bundles  
Orange funnels and snowy tunnels  
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you
