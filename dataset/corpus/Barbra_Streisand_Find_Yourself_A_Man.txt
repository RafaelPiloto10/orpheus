Time has passed. Fanny has given birth  
To a daughter, Frances, who is now five  
Months old, and Fanny is going back into  
The new Ziegfeld show. Eddie and  
Mrs. Strakosh suggest that Fanny's  
Mother needs a new interest in life.  
  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find yourself a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
You're demented.  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find yourself a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
That's just what I need.  
[Eddie:]  
You'll see what a difference it makes ev'ry day.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Send me a letter,  
You'll write me a resume  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Just take me and Dave--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Romeo and Juliet--  
[Eddie:]  
Dave is still her slave.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Send the slave my regards!  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Open your heart and from out of the skies  
A prince on a horse will materialize.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Boy, is some lucky prince  
Gonna get a surprise!  
[All:]  
Find a man!  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find yourself a man,  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
I repeat it, Rose.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Find myself a man.  
[Eddie:]  
You're defeated, Rose.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
I'll hang a sign out,  
Big letters that high,  
Come in and sample  
You don't have to buy.  
[Eddie:]  
Hear a voice talk back.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
I hear voices now.  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Money you don't lack--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Why, you've been countin'?  
Just what I need is a middle-aged sheik  
Whose uppers and lowers  
Will click when he'll speak,  
And life is a song 'cause he'll click and I'll creak.  
[All:]  
Find a man.  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
The man that you select--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
What about him?  
[Eddie and Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Must treat you with respect.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
That's important.  
[Eddie:]  
He must understand there  
Are rules to obey,  
Not toy with your morals  
And lead you astray.  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
Please, darling, let the man do things his way.  
Mrs. Strakosh and [Eddie:]  
Find a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
I'm a grandmother!  
[Mrs. Strakosh:]  
Find a man--  
[Mrs. Brice:]  
You got somebody in mind?  
[All:]  
Find yourself  
A man.
