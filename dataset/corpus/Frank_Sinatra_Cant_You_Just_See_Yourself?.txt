Can't you just see yourself in a gingham gown,  
Little pink ribbons tied in your hair,  
Sitting there by my side when we ride through town,  
Folks'll turn around, oh how they'll tell.  
  
Can't you just see yourself on a porch with me,  
Watching a show that stars give for free.  
One little word can do it, so say the word  
And we'll have dozens of chicks, a house in the sticks,  
Where people are glad to be known as hicks,  
Can't you just see yourself in love with me?
