Here I come around the bend again  
Don't want to battle cause you know that I'll win again  
Check it, battle scars earned and worn with pride  
These words are where my soul resides  
And never did I ever fit into this place, right?  
And I couldn't stand looking at your face, right?  
And you didn't mind making this a race, right?  
So check out the bass  
When I flow, I know, that I grow  
Sit back relax and check out the bomb show, bet  
And never could you ever bring me down, clown  
Yeah, check out the sound!  
  
Well I saw your face one time, I never thought I'd walk away  
Then we hit the trip that wouldn't quit, and I never walked away again  
I said I'd never walk away again  
  
Let me jump back into the boom of the room  
Come and take a ride to the top of the moon  
I don't want to fight and make this a bad trip  
I just want to sit back, relax, take a fat rip  
Check out the shapes and the colors in the grooves  
Check out the thoughts that make your mind move  
Check out the lights that form the new patterns  
Check out the beats and the rhymes that make us much phatter  
  
Check out the zebrahead style  
Boom, boom, boom in the room  
And I kick  
Free style form not the norm  
Cause I slang it  
Coming five fold take another hit and I hold  
And don't try to wreck cause kid you'll get rolled  
On the flip side if you choose to decide  
Wreck it from New York to Cali or anywhere I reside  
So check out the crew with the funk flow flavor  
Spitting out smooth sounds that you know that you want to savor  
  
I wish you could see all the that I see  
Back in the day you were down with me  
Back in the day when things were all right  
Check out the lights  
Check out the sounds that I found all underground  
And the swing that I bring up all around  
Watch the walls as they all come crumbling down  
Check out the shake and the quake as I kick it down  
This is the bomb track and we never take it back  
Funky fresh flow is something that we never lack  
So get up and ride this and never try to bite this  
Aim for the sky cause you never know you might miss  
Check out the shapes and the colors in the grooves  
Check out the thoughts that make your mind move  
Check out the lights that form the new patterns  
Check out the beats and the rhymes that make us seem much phatter
