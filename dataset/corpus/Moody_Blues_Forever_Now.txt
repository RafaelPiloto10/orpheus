If we could live forever  
Where would our dreams lead us to  
Living in a world of ever  
Changing expectation  
If it could be  
If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If we could be here forever  
Where in this world would heaven be  
As we race across the universe  
In search of confirmation  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be forever now  
There's no way out  
There is no return  
There's no way back  
There's no way to learn  
The final act  
The curtain falls  
On the stage  
On the stage  
Standing at the crossroads  
Waiting for the new millennium  
For if it could be  
If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If we could live forever  
Where would our dreams lead us to  
Living in a children's world  
Of simple fascination  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  
For if it could be, if it could be  
It would be forever now  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now
