Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is a bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song as we go along  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "No man"  
But you can do the job, you're in town  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'?  
Though, your nose gets a little chilly  
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, "Are you married?", we'll say, "No man"  
You can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid the plans that we made  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland  
  
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way  
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
