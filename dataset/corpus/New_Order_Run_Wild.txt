Open hearts  
Empty spaces  
Dusty roads  
To distant places  
But all the time  
When I'm alone  
I think of you  
And how you've grown  
  
Far and wide  
Sweet and simple  
Jehovah knows  
That I've been sinful  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
I'm not cruel  
And you're not evil  
And we're not like  
All those stupid people  
Who can't decide  
Which book to read  
Unless the paper  
Sows the seed  
  
You're the kind of person  
That I've always wanted to be with  
Well you're really cool  
And you always say the right things to me  
But now I'll tell you something  
For my heart beats for you deep inside  
You'll never be a burden  
And my love for you will never die  
Never die, never die, never die, never die  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
I swear it's getting warmer  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
  
I'm gonna live 'til I die  
I'm gonna live to get high
