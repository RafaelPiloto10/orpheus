Melanie is sweet  
A vision on her feet  
So young so fair  
A bridge of iron  
Standing tall between two parted spheres  
She's a novelty of reality  
Though she tried so hard  
My sweet darling Melanie  
  
She's glad for what she's had  
Her mom and several dads so she complained  
This modern love affair  
With life can really get you down  
  
She's a novelty of reality  
But she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie  
  
Ooh but life goes on  
Ooh the same old song  
Ooh but love's in search of mystery  
So you worked so hard my sweet darling Melanie  
  
Over the horizon  
Birds of paradise sit in her eyes  
You can feel forever on her sweet and silken sighs  
  
She's novelty of reality  
So she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie  
Na, na, na  
She's novelty of reality  
So she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie  
So she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie  
Na, na, na...
