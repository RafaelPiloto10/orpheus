You keep on asking me  
Why can't we be together  
I keep saying won't you wait a while  
What's all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time 'til i can make up my mind  
  
I'm not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I don't expect to get a guarantee  
It's just that i believe  
Lovers should stick together  
I'm only saying  
Won't you wait for me  
  
[Chorus]  
I've got to be  
Got to be certain  
I've got to be so sure  
I've had my share of hearts broken  
And i don't want to take that any more  
  
I've got some friends who say  
Boys are all the same  
They're only looking out for just one thing  
I'm only hoping that  
You won't turn out like that  
I need some time 'til i can make up my mind  
  
Been hurt in love before  
But i still come back for more  
I was such a fool  
I couldn't stop myself  
If you believe in me  
If you want our love to be  
I know you'll wait for me, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus until fade]
