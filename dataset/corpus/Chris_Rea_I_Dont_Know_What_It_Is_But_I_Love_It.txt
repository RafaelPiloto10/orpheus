Could it be just that I'm crazy  
Could it be the way I feel this time of year  
When a certain situation seems to bring the best out of me  
I don't care  
  
When she's standing close beside me  
Something turns inside me  
Brings my senses to the point of no return  
  
And I don't know what it is but I love  
And I don't know what it is but I want it to stay  
And I love it  
  
And it seems to be around me  
Even though no-one can see  
They seem to care  
When a certain situation seems to bring the best out of me  
I don't care  
  
When she's standing close beside me  
Something turns inside me  
Brings my senses to the point of no return  
  
And I don't know what it is but I love  
And I don't know what it is but I want it to stay  
And I love it
