Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Himitsu o shiri tai  
You're wondering who I am (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
Machine or mannequin (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
With parts made in Japan (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
I am the modern man  
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin  
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain ibm  
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised  
I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide  
To keep me alive, just keep me alive  
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive  
I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see  
I've come to help you with your problems so we can be free  
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know  
I'm just a man who's circumstances went beyond his control  
Beyond my control, We all need control  
I need control, We all need control  
I am the moldren man (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
Who hides behind a mask (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
So no one else can see (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
My true identity  
Domo arigato, Mr, Roboto  
Domo, Domo  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo, Domo  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
(Thank you very much oh Mr. Roboto  
For doing the jobs that nobody wants to)  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
(And thank you very much oh Mr. Roboto  
For helping me escape just when I needed to)  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
(Thank you thank you thank you)  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
(I wanna thank you)  
Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto  
(Please thank you)  
The problem's plain to see  
Too much technology  
Machines to save our lives  
Machines de-humanize  
The time has come at last (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
To throw away this mask (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
Now everyone can see (Secret secret, I've got a secret)  
My true identity  
I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy....
