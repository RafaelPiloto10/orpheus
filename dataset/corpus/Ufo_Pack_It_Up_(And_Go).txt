I've got to sympathize  
You run with all the rest  
You've kept on moving but never got the best  
And all our yesterdays go sailing out of view  
I know there's something left hope you can make it through  
Pack it up and go, pack it up and go,  
Leftover from the show, just pack it up and go  
You made the impact back in 1969  
But now move over friend I think you've had your time  
And all our yesterdays go sailing out of view  
I know there' something left, hope you can make it through  
Pack it up and go, pack it up and go, left over from the show just pack it up
and go  
  
And all our yesterdays go sailing know there's something left  
Hope you can make it through
