Writhing and screaming, the pain just won't go  
He'll show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands, it's useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
Tourted and flaming, you'll give birth to hell  
Living a nightmare  
It is a pity, you'll pray for your death  
But he's in no hurry  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
[Chorus:]  
Nowhere to run  
Your fate is in his hands  
Your time has come  
You'll live to his command  
I'm warning you  
The worst is yet to come  
The killer who  
Remains a mystery  
  
I that believe in the stories of old  
Would never fight it  
Demons and curses that play on your soul  
Like something ignited  
  
You never imagined such a fate could follow you  
(You never thought it was true)  
And when it's your time I wonder how  
(And what you'll do)  
Your kinds of troubles running deeper than the sea  
(So what you gonna do about it)  
You broke(the rule)  
You've been(a fool)  
The little doll is you, yeah!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Writhing and screaming, the pain just won't go  
He'll show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands, it's useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
[Chorus:]
