come home a little late at night  
And I crawl into my bed  
I think of you and where you are tonight  
And I wish you were here instead  
  
I really want you to know that I'm the one  
I'm never letting go  
I swear I'll do the best I can to be  
Your one and only man cause  
  
[Chorus]  
You light up my night and day  
You bring on the sunshine  
You make me feel good today  
Yeah you wonderful you  
  
When times are hard and nothing goes my way  
And I wonder what to do  
I think of you and all the things you say  
You're the one that pulls me through  
  
I really want you to know that I'm the one  
I'm never letting go  
I swear I'll do the best I can to be  
Your true and only man cause  
  
[Chorus]
