[Fabolous:]  
Loso Loso Loso  
Nigga tell him whats my name  
Loso Loso Loso  
Bitch tell him whats my name  
Da da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da da  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I come from the streets where the man stand hungry  
And you see the diamonds on this man hand chunky  
So I gotta come with the heat like Stan Van Gundy  
Cause I eat more in a day than a man can monthly  
Niggas didn't act funny growin' up  
But things changed when the crack money slowin' up  
In the black Bentley with black twentys showin' up  
Its hard for a nigga not to get into they feelings  
I'm tryin' to show 'em how to get into the millions  
Trips to Rio'll make 'em get into Brazilians  
You keep followin' a snitch nigga lead  
When its time of the month though bitch nigga bleed  
The red light on the Mac switch niggas speed  
Gun shots'll have 'em dashin' a hundred meters  
Nah they ain't stashin' a hundred either  
They just on Smack flashin' a hundred heaters  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
Chit chat  
I ain't wit that  
But I could still bag 'em  
In the Magnum  
Please tell 'em whats my name  
Somebody tell 'em whats my name  
  
I said chit chat  
I ain't with that  
I rather ride gently  
In the Bentley  
Please tell 'em whats my name  
Somebody tell 'em whats my name  
  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
Now everytime ya think ya out they pull ya back in  
Pull the Mac-10  
With bullets packed in  
I pulled it back then  
Da da da da da  
And these niggas have been miserable  
Its hurtin' 'em all to see me in physical  
With a grin visible  
I like my position  
Its like a magician  
A finger snap'll make a nigga invisible  
POOF! Fabdini The Great  
Who else go to exotic dealerships grab 'Ghinis and skate  
Niggas can't get the dimes or the nickels to sale  
Put the sour to the bottle like its pickles for sale  
I get money so the bitches gonna chase ya'll  
They can see somebodys riches in the place ya'll  
I get 'em  
Before they snitches in the case ya'll  
They face'll have more stitches than a baseball  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
Chit chat  
I ain't wit that  
But I could still bag 'em  
In the Magnum  
Please tell 'em whats my name  
Somebody tell 'em whats my name  
  
I said chit chat  
I ain't with that  
I rather ride gently  
In the Bentley  
Please tell 'em whats my name  
Somebody tell 'em whats my name  
  
[Fabolous:]  
And thats what it is man  
F-to the A-B-  
A.K.A. Loso  
Ya'll know who I'm with right?  
Street Fidadidadam  
I'm just tryin' to motivate niggas you know?  
Its all motivation baby  
You see all this?  
Its all motivation  
I think I'm gettin' kind of hot too  
Maybe its me like  
Like maybe I'm just doin' all this shit for nothing like I don't know  
You know what I mean?  
I mean its cool  
Its all cool man  
Niggas wanna do shit holla man  
But right now its all about the F-A-B-
