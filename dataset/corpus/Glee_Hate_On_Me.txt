If I could give you the world, on a silver platter  
Would it even matter, you'd still be mad at me,  
If I could find in all this a dozen roses which I would to give you,  
You'd still be miserable.  
  
Cause reality, I'm gone be who I be  
And I don't feel no faults, for all the lies that you bought.  
You can try as you may, bring me down but I say  
That it ain't up to you. Gonna do what you do.  
  
Hate on me Hater, now or later,  
Cause I'm gonna do me, you'll be mad baby.  
(Go head and hate) go head and hate on me hater cause I'm not afraid of  
What I've got I paid for, you can hate on me.  
  
Oh If I gave you peaches outta my own garden  
And I made you a peach pie, would you slap me high?  
What if I gave you diamonds outta my own womb,  
Would you feel the love in that or ask why not the moon?  
If I gave you sanity for the whole of humanity.  
And Have all the solutions for the pain and pollution.  
No matter where I live, despite the things I give.  
You'll always be this way, so go head and hate  
  
Hate on me Hater, now or later,  
Cause I'm gonna do me, you'll be mad baby.

What I've got I paid for, you can hate on me.
