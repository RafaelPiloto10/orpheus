It's cold and it's  
Smooth and it's  
A hard shade of white  
And everybody needs to lick the surface clean  
But it never tastes better  
  
White blossoms to red and freezes white again  
Close it before something crawls in  
Commit it, leave it, get away - we always  
Drop our good side  
  
Being good gets you stuff  
Being stuff gets you good  
Good stuff gets you being  
And wheelin' and dealin' and squeelin'  
Shit lives forever  
  
They have no legs, but chase us anyway  
Wipe the shadow of your best friend  
Gave birth to something we don't want to be  
We drop our good side  
  
You can't kill it  
  
Eat is just as deep as you can fuck it  
So cough it up or go down  
And there's only one thing that separates  
A man  
  
Shit lives forever  
  
We'll retire with a turd on our lips  
Under a pair of knowing eyes  
I'm gonna take a few down with me  
And drop my good side  
You can't kill it  
  
Take it from our drummer, "Puff"  
Being good it gets you stuff
