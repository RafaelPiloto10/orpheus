We had a life, we had a love,  
But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it  
Well that was then and this is now  
And I want you back  
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry  
  
How can something so good go so bad  
How can something so right go so wrong  
I don't know, I don't have all the answers  
But I want you back  
How many times can I say I'm sorry  
  
You can run, and you can hide  
But I'm not leaving less you come with me  
We've had our problems but I'm on your side  
You're all I need, please believe in me  
  
I only wanted someone to love  
But something happened on the way to heaven  
It got a hold of me and wouldn't let go  
And I want you back  
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry  
  
You can run, and you can hide  
But I'm not leaving less you come with me  
We've had our problems but I'm on your side  
You're all I need, please believe in me  
  
They say you can't take it with you  
When you go  
And I believe it  
But taking what I've got or being  
here with you, you know  
I'd rather leave it  
  
You can run, and you can hide  
But I'm not leaving less you come with me  
We've had our problems but I'm on your side  
You're all I need, please believe in me
