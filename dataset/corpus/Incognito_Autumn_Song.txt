(chorus)  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
  
Why didn't you hear me  
All the times I told you that love was gone  
No you never heard me  
'Cause I know there was too much on your mind  
  
(refrain)  
Runnin' around in a circle, (tryin' to catch up to myself)  
Runnin' out of time  
Losin' myself in the darkness, (every time I played my hand)  
I was losin' every time  
I knew I'd given all that I could give  
That's why it had to end this way, (this way)  
  
[repeat chorus]  
  
I know that I hurt you  
At a time you needed me there  
Yes you did, yes I know (yes I know)  
But my heart had been broken  
And my mind was no longer there  
I had to go, yes I did  
  
[repeat refrain]  
  
[The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived]  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
[The leaves were down]  
Before the summer sun had gone  
[Long before the autumn winds arrived]  
I'm sorry that it had to be this way...  
  
Love was gone...  
  
[repeat chorus]
