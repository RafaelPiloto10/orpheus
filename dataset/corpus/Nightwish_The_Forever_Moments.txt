The ticktock of time allows me to see  
An owl turn to an echo  
The butterfly to a cocoon  
A swan to ugly duckling  
A lake to an ocean  
  
The dead times awake  
As I've been called myself to yesterday  
The flower has fallen it's petals  
Out of the petals a cradle I will  
  
My cradle rocks with the waves of time  
The time of beauty will never be the same  
Oh, little girl, as thou must now leave  
Please take me, take me with thee  
  
Now I hear my mother from the deep  
Sing me a lullaby of eternal sleep  
Wilt blow wee plant that last to recall  
As in silence we sing to reborn
