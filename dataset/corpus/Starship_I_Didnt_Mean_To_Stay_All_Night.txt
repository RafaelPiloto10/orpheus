My love is drifting in a sweet dream  
And my heart is beatin' like a drum  
And my words don't make a sound  
And I'm dancin', but my feet ain't on the ground  
  
I am flyin', forever within your arms  
I'm flyin', forever within your heart  
I am flyin'  
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no  
But, baby, you hold so tight  
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no  
But, baby, you won't refuse  
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no  
It's heaven, it can't be wrong  
I didn't mean to stay all night  
  
My thoughts are runnin' in a race  
And my mind is slippin' into space  
'Cause your world is all around  
So I'm dancing, but my feet ain't on the ground  
  
I am flyin', forever within your arms  
I'm flyin', forever within your heart  
I am flyin'  
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no  
But, baby, you hold so tight  
I didn't mean to turn you loose, oh no  
But, baby, you won't refuse  
I didn't mean to turn you on, oh no  
It's heaven, it can't be wrong  
  
I am flyin', forever within your arms  
I'm flyin', forever within your heart  
  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to make you stay  
But, baby, you got your way  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to fool around  
But, baby, you held me down  
  
I didn't mean to stay all night  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to make you stay, oh no  
I didn't mean to let you get your way  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to fool around, oh no  
I didn't mean to let you hold me down  
I didn't mean to turn you on, baby, oh no  
To make you fall in love  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to turn you loose, honey, oh no  
But you just can't refuse  
And I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to stay all night, oh no  
But you won't let go  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to make you stay, oh no  
I didn't mean to let you get your way  
I didn't mean  
I didn't mean to fool around, oh no
