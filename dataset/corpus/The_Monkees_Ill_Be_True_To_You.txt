I'll be true to you, yes I will  
I'll be true to you, yes I will  
I won't look twice when  
The other girls go by  
I'll be true to you, yes I will  
  
Somehow this time, it's all so clear to me  
The way to go is easy to see  
My heart is sure you're  
The girl I've waited for  
And I'll be true to you, yes I will  
  
Yes I will  
I used to be the kind  
Who said that every girl's the same  
And love was just a game for having fun  
But when I looked at you  
I knew that I was wrong  
And that I really could belong to only one  
  
I'll be true to you, yes I will  
Every dream that you have, I'll fulfill  
I never promised this to anyone before  
But I'll be true to you, yes I will  
  
I'll be true to you, yes I will  
Every dream that you have, I'll fulfill  
  
I never promised this to anyone before  
But I'll be true to you, yes I will  
Yes I will, yes I will
