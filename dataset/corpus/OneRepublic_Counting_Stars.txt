Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Yeah, we'll be counting stars  
  
I see this life  
Like a swinging vine  
Swing my heart across the line  
In my faces flashing signs  
Seek it out and ye shall find  
  
Old, but I'm not that old  
Young, but I'm not that bold  
And I don't think the world is sold  
I'm just doing what we're told  
  
I feel something so right  
Doing the wrong thing  
I feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I could lie, could lie, could lie  
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be, we'll be counting stars  
  
I feel the love  
And I feel it burn  
Down this river every turn  
Hope is a four letter word  
Make that money  
Watch it burn  
Old, but I'm not that old  
Young, but I'm not that bold  
And I don't think the world is sold  
I'm just doing what we're told  
I, feel something so wrong  
Doing the right thing  
I could lie, could lie, could lie  
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be  
But baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be, we'll be counting stars  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Take that money, watch it burn  
Sink in the river the lessons I learned  
  
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive  
  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming about the things that we could be  
Baby I've been, I've been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be counting stars  
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep  
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be  
Baby I been, I been prayin' hard  
Said no more counting dollars  
We'll be, we'll be counting stars  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)  
(Sink in the river the lessons I learned)  
  
(Take that money and watch it burn)
