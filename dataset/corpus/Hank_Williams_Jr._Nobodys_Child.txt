I'm nobody's child I'm nobody's child I'm like a flower just growing wild  
There's no mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles  
Nobody wants me I'm nobody's child  
I was slowly passin' an orphan's home one day  
  
And stop there for a moment just to watch the children play  
Alone a boy was standin' and when I asked him why  
He turned his eyes that couldn't see and he began to cry  
People come for children and take them for their own  
  
But they all seem to pass me by and leave me all alone  
I know they'd like to take me but when they see that I'm blind  
They always take some other child and I'm left behind  
I'm nobody's child...  
  
No mother's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry  
Sometimes it gets so lonely here I wish I could die  
I walk the streets of heaven where all the blinds can see  
And just like for the other kids there'd be a home for me  
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles nobody wants me I'm nobody's child
