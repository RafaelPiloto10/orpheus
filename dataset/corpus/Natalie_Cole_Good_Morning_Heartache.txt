Whoa, whoa, ha, yeah, hm, oh  
Good morning heartache, you old gloomy site  
Good morning heartache  
Thought we said goodbye last night  
I tossed and turned until it seemed that you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Ho, wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay, yeah  
It seems I met ya, when my love had gone away  
I start each day out just by saying to you  
  
Good morning heartache, what's new  
Stop haunting me now, can't shake you no how  
Why don't you just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Those straight through Sunday blues  
Oh, good morning heartache, here we go  
Here we go, here we go again, well  
  
Good morning heartache  
You're the one who knew me when  
I guess I might as well get used to you hanging around  
Good morning heartache, I see you're back in town  
Good morning heartache, why don't ya sit on down, sit down
