Hey you, wake up, get yourself together  
Yeah you, so you think you made it better  
Cause you know it's coming at you  
While your back is turned  
Look too long and I can't help you  
So clear your head, find a way home  
Better make up your mind  
First you say that you will  
Then you say you won't  
Well I'm just trying to figure  
Try and figure you out  
  
How long can this go on  
Tell me what is wrong  
And maybe there's a way  
That we can work it out  
  
There must be some kind of way  
That we can make it right  
But I, I just can't do it all  
Without you, without you  
  
Hey fool, wise up, better late than never  
Yeah you, you know that nothing lasts forever  
Nobody ever told you that your  
Time is running out  
Too bad and I can't help you  
  
How long can this go on  
Tell me what is wrong  
And maybe there's a way  
That we can work it out  
  
There must be some kind of way  
That we can make it right  
But I, I just can't do it all  
Without you, without you  
  
The point I'm trying to make  
You got to give more than you take  
You gotta give, give more than you take  
Gotta, gotta, gotta work it out
