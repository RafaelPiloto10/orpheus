Can't touch this  
Can't touch this  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
  
My-my-my-my music makes me so hard makes me say oh my Lord  
Thank you for blessing me with a mind to rhyme and two hype feet  
That's good when you know you're down  
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown  
And I'm known as such  
And this is a beat uh u can't touch  
  
I told you homeboy u can't touch this  
Yeah that's how we're livin' and you know u can't touch this  
Look in my eyes man u can't touch this  
You know let me bust the funky lyrics u can't touch this  
  
Fresh new kicks and pants  
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance  
So move out of your seat  
And get a fly girl and catch this beat  
While it's rollin' hold on pump a little bit  
And let me know it's going on like that like that  
Cold on a mission so pull on back  
Let 'em know that you're too much  
And this is a beat uh u can't touch  
  
Yo I told you u can't touch this  
Why you standing there man u can't touch this  
Yo sound the bells school is in sucker u can't touch this  
  
Give me a song or rhythm  
Making 'em sweat that's what I'm giving 'em  
Now they know when you talk about the Hammer  
You talk about a show that's hyped and tight  
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a mic  
Or a tape to learn what it's gonna take  
And now he's gonna burn  
The charts legit either work hard  
Or you might as well quit  
  
That's word because you know  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh-oh-oh)  
Break it down  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh)  
Stop Hammer time  
  
Go with the flow in a spin if you can't move to this  
Then you probably are dead  
So wave your hands in the air  
Bust through the moves run your fingers through your hair  
This is it for a winner  
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner  
Move slide your rump  
Just for a minute let's all do the bump  
Bump bump bump yeah  
  
Can't touch this  
Look man u can't touch this  
You'll probably get hyped boy 'cause you know you can't u can't touch this

Every time you see me that Hammer's just so hype  
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic  
Now why would I ever stop doing this  
With others makin' records that just don't hit  
I toured around the world from London to the bank  
It's Hammer go Hammer  
It's a Hammer yo Hammer and the rest go and play  
  
Can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh)
