No candidate would I support  
His platform could I endorse  
Another accomplice slinging dirt  
Campaign promises falling short  
I don't belong to any race  
Pledge allegiance to a place  
No borderline in the sand I'd trace  
I'm just a sucker for a pretty face  
Uncomfortable in the realm of the political  
Position's always been a little left of cynical  
I'm fundamentally for the individual  
Preoccupied purely with the physical  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a hound dog chasing a bird  
Sometimes a certain tom's gotta peep  
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls  
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see  
  
I don't want to find religion  
Or another man's opinion  
I can't choose what's not my decision  
When there's only one under the sun  
There's no need to be denied  
Chew before swallowing pride  
I want to live so let me die  
Oh by the way, what's your sign?  
  
Can't comprehend the meaning of the metaphysical  
I'd rather leave that to your so-called intellectual  
But what I do know I know feels only natural  
I'm just a red-blooded heterosexual  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird  
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep  
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls  
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird  
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep  
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls  
And I think I like, like a hound dog, chasin' a bird  
  
And I think I like  
A dirty water dog  
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see
