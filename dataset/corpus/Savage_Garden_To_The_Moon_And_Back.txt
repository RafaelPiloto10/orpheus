She's taking her time making up the reasons  
To justify all the hurt inside  
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes  
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one  
They're saying mamma never loved her much  
And, daddy never keeps in touch  
  
That's why she shies away from human affection  
But somewhere in a private place  
She packs her bags for outer space  
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come  
And she'll say to him  
  
I would fly to the moon and back if you'll be my baby  
Got a ticket for a world where we belong  
So would you be my baby?  
She can't remember a time when she felt needed  
If love was red then she was color blind  
All her friends they've been tried for treason  
And crimes that were never defined  
She's saying love is like a barren place  
  
And reaching out for human faith is like a journey  
I just don't have a map for  
So baby's gonna take a dive and  
Push the shift to overdrive  
Send a signal that she's hanging  
All her hopes on the stars  
What a pleasant dream  
I would fly to the moon and  
Back if you'll be my baby got a ticket  
For a world where we belong repeat
