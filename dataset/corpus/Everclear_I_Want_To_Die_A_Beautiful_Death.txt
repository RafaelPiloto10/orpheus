"Ha ha ha ha"  
  
Everybody here in this small town  
Looks used and abused at bay  
Everybody here's looking outside in  
Seems like nothing ever changes  
  
Everybody, they just want to have a good time  
Everybody, they just want to forget  
Everybody wants to feel like they did  
When the sky looked blue  
And the world was perfect  
  
I don't care  
I just want to die pretty  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I don't want to live forever  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
  
"Ha ha ha ha"  
  
(Ugh)  
Yeah, I got to get the hell out of this town  
Everybody's looking upside-down  
Everybody here is looking for the same thing  
When it seems like nothing ever changes  
Everybody they just want to find a slow ride  
Everybody they just want to get by  
  
Everybody wants to feel like they did  
When the sky looked high  
And the world was simple  
  
I don't care  
I just want to die pretty  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I don't want to live forever  
I want to die a beautiful death  
  
I want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh (oh)  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh (oh)  
Sometimes I just want to die  
  
I just want to get lost in the moment  
I just want to get lost inside the city tonight  
I just want to get lost inside myself  
I don't care about nothing  
  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I don't want to live forever  
I want to die a beautiful death  
  
I want to die a beautiful death  
Yes, I want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die pretty  
  
"Oh yeah"
