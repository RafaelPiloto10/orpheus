Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T,  
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T,  
Bucket bucket T T, bucket T bucket T,  
  
Found her in a barn in Tennessee  
I paid five bucks for my Bucket T  
Took me three years of sweat and blood  
To clean off all that Tennessee mud  
  
[Chorus:]  
My Bucket T (Bucket T)  
Bucket T (Bucket T)  
My Bucket T (Bucket T)  
My Bucket T (Bucket T)  
T T T... Bucket bucket bucket...  
  
Cruise down the street in front of school  
I wanna rev it up but I gotta be cool  
Drivin' down the road I'll get my kicks  
A'poppin' the clutch and a'slippin' the sticks  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was right, too, she's first in her class  
There's nothing on the freeway she don't pass  
All the girls want to take a ride with me  
But there's only one seat in my Bucket T  
  
[Chorus]
