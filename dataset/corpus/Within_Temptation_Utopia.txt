Burning desire to live and roam free  
It shines in the dark and it grows within me  
You're holding my hand but you don't understand  
So where I am going you won't be in the end  
  
I'm dreaming in colors of getting the chance  
I'm dreaming of china the perfect romance  
The search of the door to open your mind  
The search of the cure of mankind  
  
Help us, we're drowning  
So closed up inside  
  
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?  
Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are?  
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?  
How will the lights die down, telling us who we are?  
  
I'm searching for answers not given for free  
They live inside as they lie within me  
You hold my hand but you don't understand  
Taking the road all alone in the end  
I'm dreaming in colors, no boundaries again  
Dreaming the dream we all seem to share  
  
The search of the door to open your mind  
The search of the cure of mankind  
  
Help us, we're drowning  
So closed up inside  
  
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?  
Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are?  
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?  
How will the lights die down, telling us who we are?  
  
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?  
Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are?  
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?  
How will the lights die down, telling us who we are?  
Why does it rain?
