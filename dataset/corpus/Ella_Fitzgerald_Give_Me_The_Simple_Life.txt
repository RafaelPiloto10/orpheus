I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'  
Why mess around with strife?  
I never was cut out to step and strut out  
Give me the simple life  
  
Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant  
Those things roll off my knife  
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes  
Give me the simple life  
  
A cottage small is all I'm after  
Not one that's spacious and wide  
A home that rings with joy and laughter  
And the ones you love inside  
  
Some like the high road, I like the low road  
Free from the grief and strife  
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy  
Give me the simple life
