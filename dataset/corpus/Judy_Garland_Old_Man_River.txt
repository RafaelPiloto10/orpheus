Old man river that,  
Old man river he must know something  
But don't say nothing,  
He just keeps rolling,  
He keeps on rolling along.  
You and me,  
We sweat and slave bodies all aching  
And racked with pain,  
Tow that barge, lift that bail,  
Get a little drunk and you land in jail.  
I get weary,  
And sick of trying I'm tired of living,  
But scared of dying,  
That old man river,  
He just keeps rolling along.
