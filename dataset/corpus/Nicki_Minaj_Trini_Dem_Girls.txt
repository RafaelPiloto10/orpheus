Yo, he in love with a ghetto girl  
He said he want a piece like Metta World  
Pet, pet on the kitty cat  
He don't mess with...regulars  
He tryna kick it like a ninja  
He tryna stick it like syringes  
He don't ever play the benches  
So Imma let him touch it if he playin with some inches
