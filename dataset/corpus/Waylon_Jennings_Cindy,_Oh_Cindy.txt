There'll come a time girl, you'll look for me  
In each horizon, in each face you see  
You'll look for love like love used to be  
There'll come a time girl, you'll look for me  
Look all around you if you have the time  
Look at me once more if you can  
You once said you loved me, now you've changed your mind  
But you'll change your mind again  
There'll come a time girl, you'll look for me  
In each horizon, in each face you see  
You'll look for love like love used to be  
There'll come a time girl, you'll look for me  
There'll come a time girl, you'll look for me  
In each horizon, in each face you see  
You'll look for love like love used to be  
There'll come a time girl, you'll look for me
