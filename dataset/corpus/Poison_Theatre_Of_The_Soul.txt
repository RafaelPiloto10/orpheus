On a cold night in a hotel in New Orleans  
came the final blow  
And somehow somewhere we lost sight  
in our search for that pot of gold  
  
And all that happened I don't understand  
Could somebody here, somebody please explain to me  
Cause I'm feeling so damn deceived  
  
And I can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately  
Theatre of my soul play on child  
  
Ashes to ashes, light the good Lord lays us down  
Dust to dust, oh, no  
The time has come to lay to rest the years  
All the years it took this heart to trust  
  
Maybe too much too soon, I couldn't get my head on straight  
All that worry, just wasted time  
and now it's much too late to save it  
  
Long forgotten midnight dancer  
plays her final role  
The curtain falls and I'm still standing  
Theatre of my soul you left in vain  
Could someone please explain, and I said  
  
I know that nothing's the same  
Riding blind on the winds of change  
But in my head that scene just keeps on playing  
  
Long forgotten midnight dancer  
plays her final role, oh, yes she does  
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately  
The curtain falls and I'm still standing  
In the theatre of my soul  
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately  
When time it just keeps on passing,  
I got to let it go, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll  
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately  
I keep searching for those long lost answers  
In the theatre of my soul  
Theatre of my soul
