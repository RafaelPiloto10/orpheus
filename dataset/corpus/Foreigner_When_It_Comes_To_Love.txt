I remember the day  
Seems so far away  
When I walked into your life  
And the look in your eyes  
How it took you by surprise  
But it felt so right  
Then I drew you in  
Told you anything  
'cause I wanted you so bad  
Girl I led you on  
Said there's nothing wrong  
In giving your heart to me  
But when it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
Yeah, it coulda ben you  
I never realized  
How time was on my side  
Lost sight of my perfect world  
And the man that I've become  
From the damage that I've done  
It's so clear to me now  
But I wished that I  
Never was the kind  
To steal a lonely heart  
And I didn't see how good you were for me  
Now it's too late to go back  
'cause when it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I can't help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I should've held on to  
Ah, it coulda been you  
Making a change in my heart  
Finding a new place to start  
Wondering what I can do  
Will I ever get over you... no  
When it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
'cause you are the one I should've held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I can't help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I should've held on to  
Ah, it could've been you
