Christmas day joyous, feast of all peoples  
Heaven and earth resound with glad praise  
Angels descending sing forth His glory  
Bringing us faith, hope, love, all our days  
Bringing us faith, hope, love, all our days.  
  
Bethlehem's star with radiance beaming  
Fills human hearts with heavenly mirth  
God's loving message brings new assurance  
So let the world proclaim Jesus' birth  
So let the world proclaim Jesus' birth.  
  
In adoration widows and orphans  
Whose hearts are burdened, turn unto Heav'n  
In faith and hope and love they can pray now  
Since Jesus Savior is to them giv'n  
Since Jesus Savior is to them giv'n.  
  
Joy we behold on earth and in Heaven  
Wonderful Yuletide, blessings from Him  
Joy everlasting gladden all hearts now  
Bring to the world peace, goodwill to men.  
  
Bring to the world peace, goodwill to men...
