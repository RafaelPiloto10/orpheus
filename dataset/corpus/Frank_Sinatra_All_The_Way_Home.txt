Bluebirds, flowers  
Sunshine and showers  
Sunsets and rainbows  
On skies of red and blue  
Badges, whistles  
Rockets and missiles  
Puppies, kittens  
And penny candy too  
You make me feel so new  
Like carnivals and carousels  
Popsicles and wishing wells  
And I am so in love with you  
I can't believe it's true  
We're gonna make it all the way home  
Magic potions,  
Incense and lotions  
Bells, books and candles  
Can make a witches' brew  
But I don't need witches  
Love spells or riches  
You are my treasure  
My fairy tale come true  
With you is where I'll stay  
All the time, anywhere  
Turn around, and I'll be there  
It was I, now it's we  
And I know it will be  
You and me, all the way home  
Me and you, all the way home.
