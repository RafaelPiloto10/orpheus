I guess is better to be in love and not...  
It doesn't matter, lay awake,  
Say your prayer for good and sake,  
Don't know how much I can take!  
No one ever said love was fair, what we could choose?  
But the last thing I thought about was losing you  
And I think about it all the time  
The girl is messing with my mind,  
That's why they say love is blind!  
  
Bridge:  
I'm on in the middle... Like a fiddle,  
Hear the volume and the cry!  
Momma said to have patience,  
Love is sick as a patient  
I don't understand why  
  
Chorus:  
We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
  
My heart was a lock, your love a key,  
So much hurt on my chest, feel like I can breathe.  
Should I pressure forward with me, I wanna leave,  
Instead of living a life full of...  
I know that every relationship knows ups and downs,  
But saying... Come back around  
To the moment...  
You will feel the same, hey!  
  
Bridge:  
I'm on in the middle... Like a fiddle,  
Hear the volume and the cry!  
Momma said to have patience,  
Love is sick as a patient  
I don't understand why  
  
Chorus:  
We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
  
I'm trying to be...  
I'm trying to be the man,  
I'm trying to be the one you could talk to.  
I'm trying to understand  
After all the arguing, be the best I can!  
But everything... Just wasn't right for you  
So what I gotta do!  
Hey, even made the sacrifice,  
... Just wasn't right,...  
  
Chorus:  
We've been going through these changes,  
Acting like the strangers,  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
We hold so much anger, our love this in danger  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
You don't wanna save me, seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point, no turning back  
... You feel the same as I do,  
Never pass a point, no turning back
