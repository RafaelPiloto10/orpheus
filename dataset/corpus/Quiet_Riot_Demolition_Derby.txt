We're gonna take you to a demolition derby (yeah)  
It's on a Saturday night and the boys want to rock  
Gotta get some action, not yourself  
Meet you at the ally  
Everybody get about at night  
School's out and we can't keep still  
Gotta hold myself back and wait until  
Tonight's the night  
All hell's gonna break loose  
We're gonna take you to a demolition derby  
We're gonna make you topsy-turvy  
We're gonna take you to a demolition derby  
Now now now now now now now  
The neighbors are screamin' "hey, stop that noise"  
Give 'em a wink and shout "kill him, boys"  
My daddy saw me now  
He wouldn't let me out for a week  
Trooby's got a sprain and Blondy's got his back  
Noodle's with his action, better watch him for that  
I've got my shoe shine in my pocket  
Everybody's ready, let's go  
We're gonna take you to a demolition derby  
We're gonna make you topsy-turvy  
We're gonna take you to a demolition derby  
Now now now now right now
