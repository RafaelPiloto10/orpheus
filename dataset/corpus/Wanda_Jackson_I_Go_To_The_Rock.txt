I GO TO THE ROCK  
Writer Dottie RMBO  
I go to the rock  
Where do I go,  
When there's nobody else to turn to  
Who do I talk to,  
When nobody wants to listen  
Who do I lean on,  
When there's no foundation stable  
I go to the rock  
I know he's able  
I go to the rock  
Chorus:  
I go to the rock of my salvation  
I go to the stone that the builders rejected  
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me  
When the earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter  
When I need a friend I go to the rock  
Where do I go (x2)  
When the storms of life are threating  
Who do I turn to  
When the winds of sorrow blow  
And is there a refuge in the time of Tribulation  
I go to the rock  
I know he's able  
I go to the rock  
CHORUS (x2)  
I go to the rock (x4)  
You can go to the rock (x4)  
I go to the rock (x6)  
When the earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter  
When I need a friend  
I go to the rock
