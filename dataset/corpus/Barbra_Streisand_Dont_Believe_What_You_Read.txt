They say her pretty face is enough to launch a ship  
Mix that with charm and style  
How you gonna miss  
With all the admiration the world is at her feet  
She's living for attention when she's spotted on the street  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
Dinner an a movie  
I'll just show my face in town  
Rumors fly so fast that I don't try to live'em down  
Gets old answering questions why and trying to explain  
Why I prefer to stay at home with friends and entertain  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
To the outside world it's paradise  
They'd love to be in my shoes  
They don't seem to realize that it's not like in the news  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
I just read in the papers that I bought some birds today  
Flying all around my house  
Just havin' their own sweet way  
It makes me feel so foolish 'cause they called my house a cage  
But there's nothing I can do  
Just puts me in a rage  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that we lead
