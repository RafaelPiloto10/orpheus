[Chorus:]  
She had Hennessey hips, and Belve' eyes  
Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs  
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)  
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night  
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive  
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Hey hey hey shorty, took me to tipsy from sober  
Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier  
Hopin' she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover  
Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta  
Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need  
Like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment, must be sealed inside  
Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind  
Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime  
Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?  
Body bangin', I lay the language, that walk is famous  
The proper anus like she was painted  
She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous  
None other, who's her lover, this above her  
Get it from her mother, did it to her brother  
Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler  
Shorty whats up! She had  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Hey parking lot pimpin', yeah that's the way I approached her  
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster  
Miss, got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder  
Serious, she the business and I need closure  
So hood and I'm startin', I'm blowin' see no stuck up trumpin'  
Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money  
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami  
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin' my platinum my money  
This ain't your normal every day baby  
The type to drive nothin' less than that 600 Mercedes  
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily  
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380  
I feel like she put me under a spell  
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell  
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal  
I put her on my tab, had her sippin', call a cab  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
All my shorties if you with me, let me hear you say Ms. Hangover  
(Ms. Hangover)  
All my shorties if you with me, let me hear you say Ms. Hangover  
(Ms. Hangover)  
All my ballers if you with me, let me hear you say I'm hungover  
(I'm hungover)  
All my ballers if you with me, let me hear you say I'm hungover  
(I'm hungover)  
Ms. Hangover (Ms. Hangover)  
Got me hungover (got me hungover)  
I'm hungover (I'm hungover)  
From Ms. Hangover (from Ms. Hangover)  
Ms. Hangover (Ms. Hangover)  
Got me hungover (got me hungover)  
I'm hungover (I'm hungover)  
From Ms. Hangover (from Ms. Hangover)  
  
[Chorus]
