I say hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you  
I knew Mary Lou we'd never part  
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
You passed me by one sunny day  
Flashed those big brown eyes my way  
Ooh, I wanted you forever more  
Hey, I'm not one that get's around  
Swear my feet stuck to the ground  
And though I never did see you no more  
Yeah neah  
I said hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you  
Hey, I knew Mary Lou we'd never part  
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
So hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
One more time  
Yes, hello Mary Lou (goodbye heart)  
Hey, wait a minute  
One minute  
Ah, I need my fucking water  
I don't care, let's go  
Right, give us the right key for fuck's sake
