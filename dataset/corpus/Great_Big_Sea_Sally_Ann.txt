All eyes on Her from dawn till dusk  
Hanging on Her every word  
Kings and Queens never saw such a fuss  
Her Servants are waiting to serve  
  
Sally Ann Sally Ann  
Oh when you dance  
Every move that you make is amazing.  
Take my Heart Take my Hand  
Hey Sally Ann  
Life will be all that you make it.  
  
I must have got caught in your hair so bright  
Got lost in your eyes so blue  
I followed around in circles all night  
For a chance to dance with you  
  
It breaks my heart to hear her cry  
I'm a Fool for Her for sure  
See me swallowing my pride  
She got me crawling on the floor
