Verse 1  
When I'm shaken to my soul  
He is my strength  
When life seems to take control I trust in His grace  
So let the strong winds blow  
I won't be afraid  
For I'm anchored to his love  
And He has power to save  
  
Chorus  
On Jesus Christ  
The Solid Rock  
By faith I stand  
And trust in Him  
The earth around me  
I sinking sand  
On Jesus Christ  
The Solid Rock I stand  
  
Verse 2  
My hope is in the Lord  
And His righteousness  
The strong tower of His name  
Will be my fortress  
When all around my soul gives way  
I will stand strong  
My life must always stay  
In Christ where I belong  
  
Bridge  
Let the rain fall (Let the rain fall)  
Let the wind blow (Let it blow)  
My foundation will hold
