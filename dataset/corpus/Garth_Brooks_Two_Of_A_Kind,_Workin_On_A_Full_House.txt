Yes, she's my lady luck  
Hey, I'm her wild card man  
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand  
We live out in the country  
Hey, she's my little queen of the South  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
She wakes me every mornin'  
With a smile and a kiss  
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist  
She's my easy lovin' woman  
I'm her hard workin' man, no doubt  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
Yea, a pickup truck is her limousine  
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans  
She loves me tender when the goin' gets tough  
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up  
  
Lord I need that little woman  
Like the crops need the rain  
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane  
We really fit together  
If you know what I'm talkin' about  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind  
Lord the perfect combination is her heart and mine  
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep  
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps  
  
So draw the curtain, honey  
Turn the lights down low  
We'll find some country music on the radio  
I'm yours and you're mine  
Hey, that's what it's all about  
Yeah, we're two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house  
  
Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind  
Workin' on a full house
