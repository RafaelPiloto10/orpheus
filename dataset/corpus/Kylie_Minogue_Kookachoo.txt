No-one else I know can thrill me like you do  
I only ever want to Go-Go dance with you  
You're the dreamboy on my bedroom poster  
Now we're on a rollercoaster ride  
  
Chorus  
You're the greatest gift that I could ever wish for  
And there's not a single thing I wouldn't give for a little time with you  
My Kookachoo  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
  
No-one else can take me to the highs like you  
You show me all the colours when I'm feeling blue  
You're the brightest shining lights on Broadway  
Pink in evening sunsets every day  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Even at night, when I'm sleeping  
You are all I'm ever dreaming of.
