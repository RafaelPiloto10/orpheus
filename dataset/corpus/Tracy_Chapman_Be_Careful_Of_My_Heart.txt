You and your sweet smile  
You and your tantalizing ways  
You and your honey lips  
You and all the sweet things that they say  
You and your wild wild ways  
One day you just up and walked away  
You left me hurting  
  
But I can forgive you for that now  
You taught me something  
Something took half my life to learn  
When you give all yourself away  
Just tell them to be careful of your heart  
  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
Be careful of this heart of mine  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
It just might break and send some splinters flying  
Be careful of my heart, heart  
Be careful  
  
You you you  
You you you  
You you you  
Took my love  
Thought you took it all  
  
You you you  
You you you  
You you you  
Took my love  
And now you're gone  
  
But I'm not breaking down  
And I'm not falling apart  
I just lost a little faith  
When you broke my heart  
Given a chance I might try it again  
But I wouldn't risk it all this time  
  
I'd save  
A little love for myself  
Enough for my heart to mend  
A little love for myself  
One day I just might love again  
One day some sweet smile might turn my head  
One day I just might give all myself away  
One day  
One day  
One day
