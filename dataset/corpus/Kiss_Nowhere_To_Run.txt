Don't know what's been going on in your head, no  
When you knew that his love was through  
You closed your eyes instead  
I was there with a shoulder to lean on  
It's not gonna happen twice  
If you go I just want you to know  
It's alright  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
  
Did you think it would open up in the night, yeah  
Just pretend I'm only a friend and disappear from sight  
One day you're gonna be lonely, wishing I was by your side  
And one day you'll think of me only  
But girl, you gotta take the ride  
Well too bad, now that the damage is done  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
  
Little girl, gonna make your bed in the night, yeah  
Now you say you're going away  
But I will keep your heart  
And you will cry when you realize you were wrong  
Run on, run on  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, no  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide, no  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to run, no
