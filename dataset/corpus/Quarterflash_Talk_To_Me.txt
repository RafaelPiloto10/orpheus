There's some out there tonight  
Who's lost and lonely, too  
There's a heart beating just with mine  
There's a voice in the air  
But it just can't get through  
I'm hoping that someday I'll find someone  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart  
  
There's a song in the air,  
But I can't hear the words  
There's a promise that's never made  
There's a voice in the streets  
That no one's ever heard  
I'm hoping I'll hear it someday calling  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart  
  
Somewhere there's a voice that's calling  
Someone who's alone and falling  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart
