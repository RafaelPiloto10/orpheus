Sit there, hmm, count your fingers.  
What else, what else is there to do ?  
Oh and I know how you feel,  
I know you feel that you're through.  
Oh wah wah ah sit there, hmm, count,  
Ah, count your little fingers,  
My unhappy oh little girl, little girl blue, yeah.  
  
Oh sit there, oh count those raindrops  
Oh, feel 'em falling down, oh honey all around you.  
Honey don't you know it's time,  
I feel it's time,  
Somebody told you 'cause you got to know  
That all you ever gonna have to count on  
Or gonna want to lean on  
It's gonna feel just like those raindrops do  
When they're falling down, honey, all around you.  
Oh, I know you're unhappy.  
  
Oh sit there, ah go on, go on  
And count your fingers.  
I don't know what else, what else  
Honey have you got to do.  
And I know how you feel,  
And I know you ain't got no reason to go on  
And I know you feel that you must be through.  
Oh honey, go on and sit right back down,  
I want you to count, oh count your fingers,  
Ah my unhappy, my unlucky  
And my little, oh, girl blue.  
I know you're unhappy,  
Ooh ah, honey I know,  
Baby I know just how you feel.
