There's a pirate, known to fame  
Black Macocco was the Pirate's name  
In his day, the tops was he  
Round the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea  
When he sites a clipper ship  
Mack would board her and begin to clip  
First he'd grab, the ladies fair  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare!  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare  
Especially those with jewels  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare!  
With his ladies and his loot  
Next Macocco from the ship would scoot  
Then he'd set the ship afire...what a pretty funeral  
Funeral pyre!  
Mack the Black, what a pretty funeral  
Mack the Black, marvelous funeral pyre!  
Though the years this black Macocco  
Lead his pirate reign  
His claim to fame was as black as his name  
All around the Spanish Maine  
When he'd a make his daily rounds  
Gals would trail him like a pack of hounds  
Ev'ry night he'd have a date Ladies go to pieces  
Over pieces of eight.  
Hey!  
Sleep my baby, baby sleep  
Time for babe to be in slumber deep  
If you wake or cry or laugh  
Mack the Black will whack ya  
And he'll whack ya in half!  
Mack the black will really whack  
Mack the black will whack ya!  
Mack the black would really have to  
Whack ya in half!  
Mack the Black will really whack ya,  
Mack the Black will whack ya!  
Mack the black will whack ya  
And he'll whack ya!  
Aaaaaah! Mack was ruthless  
Mack was feared  
Perhaps it's better that he disappeared  
Yet I know, that he was bad  
I could fall in love with,  
Fall in love with the lad!  
Evening star, if you see Mack  
Stop his wanderings and guide him back  
I'll be waiting, patiently  
By the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea.  
Is that the Caribbean Sea?  
And if I met this famous pirate  
Met him face to face  
You think I'd run and hide my head  
And scream around the place  
Why no I'd just sashay around  
Displaying all my charms  
And soon I'd have him walk the plank  
Right into my arms  
That's what I think of Mack the Black Macocco!
