Do you still feed the animal  
Animal finger  
Finger on the phone  
Curve around corners  
Do you still feed the animal  
Your muffled voices  
Up this ideal head  
And the wires come in  
Open us  
Close us  
(slide beneath the city)  
Slide beneath the city  
And the feet in the streets above us  
(and your voice again)  
And your voice again  
(and your voice again)  
(and your voice again)  
I don't want you to call again  
Do you still feed the animal  
Muffled madness  
Quiet calm pervade her  
I couldn't go through this again  
You said you love her  
You know you love her  
You never want to be without her  
You said you never want hurt her  
You know you hurt her  
I  
How many lives you lives  
How many hurt you done  
How many times you come to this place  
How much you want it  
You said you love her
