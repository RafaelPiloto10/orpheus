Well, me and my lady had our first big fight  
So I drove around till I saw the neon light  
The corner bar. It just seemed right so I pulled up.  
Not a soul around but the old bar keep  
Down at the end lookin' half asleep  
But he walked up and said, what'll it be?  
I said the good stuff.  
He didn't reach around for the whiskey.  
He didn't pour me a beer.  
His blue eyes kinda went misty.  
He said you can't find that here.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date.  
Momma's all worried when you get home late  
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate  
'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much  
And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair.  
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year  
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up  
Yeah man, that's the good stuff.  
  
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass.  
And I smiled and said I'll have some of that.  
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends.  
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare.  
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair  
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.  
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me.  
But I've been sober three years now  
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey  
  
Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl  
The way she adored that string of pearls  
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl  
Married his high school love.  
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa.  
Bein' right there as our time got small  
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up  
Yeah man that's the good stuff.  
  
He said, when you get home she'll start to cry.  
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I.  
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up  
'Cause that's the good stuff.  
  
That's the good stuff.
