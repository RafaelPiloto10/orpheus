One last time let me love you one last time  
All I need is one more chance to say goodbye  
One last kiss then I swer I'll let you go baby I need you I've got to see you  
One more night stay with me till tomorrow  
  
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come (baby I need you)  
One last time loving you before the end I can't face never seeing you again  
One last look in your eyes to know we're through baby I need you I've got to
see you  
One more night stay with me till tomorrow  
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come  
  
Baby I need you (one last time) I've got to see you (one last time)  
Baby I need you (one last time) baby I need you (one last time)  
Baby I want you (one last time) baby I want you (one last time)  
Baby I want you (one last time) baby I want you (one last time)
