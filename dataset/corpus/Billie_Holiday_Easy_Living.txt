Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There is nothing in life but you  
  
I never regret the years I'm giving  
They're easy to give when you're in love  
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you  
  
For you maybe I'm a fool  
But it's fun  
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand  
Darling, it's grand  
They just don't understand  
  
Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There's nothing in life but you
