Every night a different town I sing my song  
I play and sing pack my things and move along  
A pretty face, another place I never get to know  
A one night stand, another show  
My guitar a railroad car a bus or plane  
Chocolate bar and there you are the price of fame  
If I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go  
A one night stand is all I know  
I wish that I could be two people  
Instead of being on my own  
I wish that I could be two people  
And then I'd never be alone  
Photographs of where I've been and all I've done  
In this whole world, is there a girl, no, not one  
Goodbye, hello I've got to go I hope you understand  
A one night man is all I am  
A one night stand, a one night man.
