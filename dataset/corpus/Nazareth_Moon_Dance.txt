Light with the mornings goes  
I live a long, forgotten shadow  
Love with the morning goes  
And what to do I just don't know  
The moon is on the run  
Another day to up and lay low  
Mad dogs and noonday sun  
I need the darkness to show  
  
Moondance, moondance  
  
There goes a setting sun  
That's when we turn from strobe to struttin'  
Turn on the city lights  
Cause you know I'm moody blue  
  
Moondance, moondance  
  
The women shadow box  
They're dancing tough but the ice is melting  
The music gives what it's got  
The moon is looking at you  
  
Moondance, moondance, moondance
