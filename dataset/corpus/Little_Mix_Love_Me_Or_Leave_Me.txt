[Verse 1: Jesy]  
You used to tell me that you loved me once  
What happened, what happened?  
Where is all of this coming from?  
What happened, what happened?  
You say I'm crazy and there's nothing wrong  
You're lying and you know I know  
Baby what have we become?  
What happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]  
We used to never go to bed angry  
But it's all we ever do lately  
And you're turning away like you hate me  
Do you hate me, do you hate me? Oh  
  
[Chorus: Perrie]  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No, this isn't fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
  
[Verse 2: Jade]  
Do you remember when you loved me once?  
What happened, what happened?  
And you'd hold me here just because  
What happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jade]  
We used to never go to bed angry  
But it's all we ever do lately  
And you're turning away like you hate me  
Do you hate me, do you hate me? Oh  
  
[Chorus: Perrie]  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No, this isn't fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
  
[Bridge: Jade]  
Love me baby please cause I could still be the only one you need  
The only one close enough to feel you breathe  
Yeah I could still be that place where you run  
Instead of the one that you're running from, ooh  
  
[Chorus: Leigh-Anne]  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No, this isn't fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here
