Don't tell me baby  
Cause I already know  
Things could be better,  
Not like this Broadway Show  
  
Always a reason  
There's no time to talk  
I don't want you leaving  
And I surely don't want you to walk  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I never felt this way I feel before  
Is this the blues? Almighty blues  
I've never felt so lonely, since I lost my one and only  
  
I can't go the distance  
I can't close the door  
Feel alone in a crowd  
I can't take no more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't need a reason  
To be in your game  
With a loser's luck  
It's nothin' but a cryin' shame  
  
[Chorus]
