In the biblical sense and sensibility  
Let me know you  
I'll kiss that smile off your face just say when  
  
Just say when.  
  
I'm not afraid to say "I love you"  
Any more than I used to be babe I am scared to death  
To fall in love (with you)  
  
All these pick-up lines from hell  
Icebreakers infernal  
From a heart so black and blue  
Only for you  
  
Just say when again.  
  
I'm not afraid to say, "I love you."  
Any more than I used to be, babe.  
I am scared to death.  
I am scared to death to fall in love with you.  
  
With you.  
  
I'm not afraid to say, "I love you."  
Anymore than I used to be, babe.  
I am scared to death.  
I am scared to death to fall in love.  
  
I'm not afraid to admit I adore you  
Any more than I was before babe I am scared to death  
To fall in love with you  
  
With you.  
With you.  
  
I'm scared to death.  
I'm scared to death.  
I'm scared to death.  
  
And you're sweet like poison.
