You may be sweet and nice  
That won't keep you warm at night  
Cause I'm the one who taught you how  
To do the things you're doing now  
He may feel all your charms  
He may hold you in his arms  
But I'm the one who let you in  
I was right beside you then  
  
Once upon a time  
You let me feel you deep inside  
And nobody knew, nobody saw  
Do you remember the way you cried?  
  
I'm your toy, I'm your old boy  
But I don't want no one but you to love me  
Oh I wouldn't lie  
You know I'm not that kind of guy
