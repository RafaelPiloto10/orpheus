Me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on  
We both know that it's wrong  
But it's much too strong to let it go now  
  
We meet every day at the same cafe  
Six-thirty, I know she'll be there  
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans  
While the jukebox plays our favorite song  
  
Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones  
We got a thing going on  
We both know that it's wrong  
But it's much too strong to let it go now  
  
We gotta be extra careful  
That we don't build our hopes too high  
'Cause she's got her own obligations, and so do I  
Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones  
  
Well, it's time for us to be leaving  
And it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside  
And now she'll go her way, I'll go mine  
But tomorrow we'll meet at the same place, the same time  
Me and Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Jones  
(Same place)  
We both know that it's wrong  
(Same time)  
Everyday at the same place  
(Same place)  
We got a thing going on, you know it's wrong  
(Same time)  
But it's much too wrong  
(Same place)  
Me and Mrs. Jones
