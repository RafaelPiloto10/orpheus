Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)  
Pretending I'm doing well (ooh ooh)  
My need is such I pretend too much  
I'm lonely but no one can tell  
  
Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)  
Adrift in a world of my own (ooh ooh)  
I play the game but to my real shame  
You've left me to dream all alone  
  
Too real is this feeling of make believe  
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal  
  
Ooh ooh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)  
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)  
I seem to be what I'm not (you see)  
I'm wearing my heart like a crown  
Pretending that you're still around  
  
Yeah ooh hoo  
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal  
  
Oh yes I'm the great pretender  
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)  
I seem to be what I'm not you see  
I'm wearing my heart like a crown  
Pretending that you're  
Pretending that you're still around
