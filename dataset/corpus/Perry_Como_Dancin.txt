Ho! the band stopped playin'  
An' the couples stopped swayin'  
But we kept on . . . dancin!  
  
The lights went on  
An' the crowd was gone  
But we kept on . . . dancin!  
  
The janitor said, "Please let me sweep the floor!"  
So, I hummed a tune an' we danced right . . .  
through the door!  
  
It started rainin'  
But we both were insane  
An' we kept right . . . on dancin'  
  
We looked a sight  
By the traffic light  
But we . . . kept on dancin'  
  
The signal was red so we just tapped our feet  
When the light turned green  
Well, we danced across the street!  
  
( Couples parked in cars were romancin' )  
They were romancin'  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
( Ba bum ba bum bum' )  
Our clothes were drippin'  
An' we couldn't help slippin'  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
Our feet were sore  
When we reached your door  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
When I kissed ya goodnight  
My heart started dancin' too  
That's when I knew . . .  
That I would dance my whole life through  
With only you . . .  
  
With only you . . .  
With only you . . .  
My whole life through  
With only you . . .
