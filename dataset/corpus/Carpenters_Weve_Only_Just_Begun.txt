We've only just begun to live  
White lace and promises  
A kiss for luck and we're on our way  
(We've only begun)  
  
Before the risin' sun, we fly  
So many roads to choose  
We'll start out walkin' and learn to run  
And yes, we've just begun  
  
Sharing horizons that are new to us  
Watching the signs along the way  
Talkin' it over, just the two of us  
Workin' together day to day  
Together  
  
And when the evening comes, we smile  
So much of life ahead  
We'll find a place where there's room to grow  
And yes, we've just begun  
  
Sharing horizons that are new to us  
Watching the signs along the way  
Talkin' it over, just the two of us  
Workin' together day to day  
Together  
Together  
  
And when the evening comes, we smile  
So much of life ahead  
We'll find a place where there's room to grow  
And yes, we've just begun
