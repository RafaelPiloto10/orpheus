Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your life  
Don't shut the door, shut the door, door on my life  
You been locking apart of your love away  
You been holding out on me  
I just want to get down deep inside of you  
  
So that I can set you free  
Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your mind  
Don't be afraid, be afraid, afraid of what I might find  
I would never be judge you for what you are  
You can say what's in your heart  
It's the things that you're hiding that bother me  
And it's keeping us apart so  
If you really love me like you like to say you  
Really do  
  
Gotta open up and let the rest of you come  
Shining through  
Don't shut me out, shut me out of your life  
Don't lock the door, lock the door, door on my life  
Such a beautiful thing we could come to know  
If you'll only trust in me  
I just want to get down deep inside of you  
So that I can set you free and  
Turn you loose so you can see, so  
  
Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your life and  
Don't shut the door, shut the door, door on your  
Sweet, sweet, yeah  
  
Don't be afraid, be afraid, afraid of what I might find, no  
Don't lock the door, lock the door, door on your  
Sweet, sweet mind.
