I got a heart as big as Texas but it's not made of stone it's not as  
Tough as the salt of the earth I'll tell you that, for what it's  
Worth... I didn't come here looking for you I didn't lie I said I didn't  
Come here alone I swear that all I loved was your empathy someone - at  
Last - to understand me! So understand me what I want from you if you  
Love me set me free, say - "I'm not in love with you" I've got a heart  
As big as Texas but something that big gets its own way it's tearing me  
In two directions I know my head - doesn't have a say! But I'm a  
Respected responsible citizen I lie down when I make my bed but unless  
You block all roads in front of me this heart is gonna be the death of  
Me!
