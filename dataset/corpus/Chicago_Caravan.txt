Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan.  
  
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep  
Across the sands so I may keep  
The mem'ry of our caravan.  
  
This is so exciting, you are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms  
  
You beside me, here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan.  
  
This is so exciting, you are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms  
  
Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan.
