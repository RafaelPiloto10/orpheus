Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean  
The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green  
The snowbird sings the song he always sings  
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring  
When I was young my heart was young then too  
Anything that it would tell me that's the thing that I would do  
But now I feel such emptiness within  
For the thing that I want most in life is the thing that I can't win  
Spread your tiny wings and fly away  
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day  
The one I love forever is untrue  
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you  
[ dobro ]  
The breeze along the river seems to say  
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay  
So little snowbird take it with you when you go  
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow  
Spread your tiny wings...  
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you
