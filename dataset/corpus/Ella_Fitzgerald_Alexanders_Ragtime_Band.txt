Come on and hear (2x), alexander's ragtime band,  
Come on and hear (2x), it's the best band in the land!  
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,  
So natural that you want to go to war--  
That's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb!  
Come on along (2x), let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man (2x), who's the leader of the band,  
And if you want to hear the swanee river played in ragtime  
Come on and hear (2x), alexander's ragtime band!
