Them that's God shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Yeah, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't  
Ever make the grade  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own  
  
Money, you've got lots of friends  
Crowdin' round the door  
When its gone and  
Spendin' ends  
They don't come no more  
  
Rich relations give  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But don't take too much  
  
Momma may have  
Poppa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got his own  
That's got his own
