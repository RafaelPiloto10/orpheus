Foreign skies  
That blinded me to empty charms  
I crossed the ocean and fell into your arms  
So sure, so wrong  
You sang me a simple tune  
I took it for a song  
  
Say goodbye, don't tell me why you have to go  
Loving you was as good as gold (as good as gold)  
I'd love to love you, really love you  
But you see, there's something you should now  
I really didn't think you'd go  
  
Because today  
I could have sworn I heard you say  
I love you  
I want you  
I need to be with you  
  
Today  
I saw something in your face  
Stay here  
Beside me  
I need your love to hide me  
You lied  
And now you've gone away  
And left me crying like a baby
