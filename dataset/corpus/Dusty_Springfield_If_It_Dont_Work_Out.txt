When he loved me nothing in this world  
Could touch his love  
And now the light of love is back  
Can I return the joys he's dreaming of  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
(But if it don't work out)  
The tears that I'm crying baby  
Won't bring him home, no, no  
I want to bring him home  
  
Will he still care for me  
The way he did he before  
Or, will he turn away  
And tell me he don't love me anymore  
I don't know  
Oh, I don't know  
  
(But if it don't work out)  
The tears that I'm crying, baby  
Won't bring him home  
I want to bring him home  
  
But if I could forget  
The tears and the crying  
That I went through once before, yeah  
Maybe my love and I could start  
We'd start again, yeah  
  
One day I know we'll find again  
The love we had and I  
Will know and feel  
The joys and pleasures that I'm dreaming of  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
(But if it don't work out)  
The tears that I'm crying, baby  
Ain't going to bring him home, again  
Ain't going to bring him home  
  
Hey, but if it don't work out  
The tears that I'm crying, baby  
Hey, ain't going to bring him home again  
I'm going to cry my heart out waiting for him, yeah  
Cry my heart out, yes I will  
Cry my heart out, yes I will  
Cry my heart
