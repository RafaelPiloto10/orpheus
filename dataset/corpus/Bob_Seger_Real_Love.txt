Words and music by bob seger  
  
I think I've found the real love  
Genuine and true  
I think it's really come my way today babe  
I think it's really you  
  
I remember moments looking in your eyes  
Could have sworn I saw the spark of love babe  
Flickering inside  
  
I've been around this track  
And the only thing I lack  
Is the real love  
  
Every time I see you, every time we touch  
I can feel the way you feel for me babe  
And it means so much  
  
And every time you look at me  
It's just the way it all should be  
In the real love  
  
Oh darlin' darlin' darlin'  
Stay with me stay  
I long to see you in the morning sun  
Everyday everyday  
  
So until that moment  
When I take your hand  
I'm gonna try to do my very best babe  
To prove that I'm your man  
  
I'm gonna do my very best  
I'm not gonna rest  
Until we've got the real love  
  
Real love  
Until we've got the real love
