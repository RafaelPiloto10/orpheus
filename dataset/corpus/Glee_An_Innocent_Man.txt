Some people stay far away from the door  
If there's a chance of it opening up  
They hear a voice in the hall outside  
And hope that it just passes by  
  
Some people live with the fear of a touch  
And the anger of having been a fool  
They will not listen to anyone  
So nobody tells them a lie  
  
I know you're only protecting yourself  
I know you're thinking of somebody else  
Someone who hurt you  
But I'm not above  
Making up for the love  
You've been denying you could ever feel  
I'm not above doing anything  
To restore your faith if I can  
Some people see through the eyes of the old  
Before they ever get a look at the young  
I'm only willing to hear you cry  
Because I am an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
  
Some people say they will never believe  
Another promise they hear in the dark  
Because they only remember too well  
They heard somebody tell them before  
  
Some people sleep all alone every night  
Instead of taking a lover to bed  
Some people find that it's easier to hate  
Than to wait anymore  
  
I know you don't want to hear what I say  
I know you're gonna keep turning away  
But I've been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive  
I'm not above going through it again  
  
And although this is a  
Fight I  
Can lose  
The accused is an  
Innocent  
Man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man  
Oh....
