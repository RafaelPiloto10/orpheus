I will follow You through green pastures  
And sing hallelujah to Your Name  
I will follow You through dark disaster  
And sing hallelujah through the pain  
  
And even in the shadow of death  
I will praise You  
And even in the valley I will say  
  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
  
You are seated on your throne in heaven  
And You see all of us down here  
And You have promised You will not abandon  
So I shall not fear  
  
And even in the shadow of death  
I will praise You  
And even in the valley I will say  
  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
  
You made every star  
And You taught it how to shine  
You knew my name before there was time  
And all this was just part of Your glorious design  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise  
Holy, My God  
You are worthy of all my praise
