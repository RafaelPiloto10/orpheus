You, you're driving me wild  
You're making me fall in love  
In love with you baby, I  
I'm losing control  
I don't want to let go yet  
Till you want me  
You, you're all that I need  
You're all that I want  
And I'd sure love to love you, I  
I gotta go slow  
Keep it under control now  
Till you want me  
  
(chorus)  
But my body keeps changing my mind  
Keeps changing my heart  
When we're dancing  
My body says love you tonight  
To drive me out of my mind  
When we're dancing  
  
(Verse 1)  
Well I know it wouldn't be right  
To say take me home tonight  
But when we get to dancing  
When I see you dancing  
When it comes to dancing  
My body keeps changing my mind  
You, it's you in my heart  
It's you on my mind  
And you just can't help it  
I should give it some time  
And wait for the right sign  
That you want me  
'Cause  
  
Repeat (chorus )  
  
Repeat (Verse 1)  
  
And we fly together across the floor  
My heart's crying out for more  
Cause I just can't resist you  
  
Repeat (Verse 1)  
  
You know  
  
Repeat (chorus)
