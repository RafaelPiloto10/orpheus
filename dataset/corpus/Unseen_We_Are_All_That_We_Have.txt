The kids they come from all around  
With the same look in their eyes  
They're bruised and boozed with nothing to lose  
Some don't care if they die  
  
This world has pushed them  
Beat them to the ground  
Tonight it's different  
We stand on equal ground  
  
We are all that we have  
No matter what they say  
We are all that we have  
And they can't take that away  
  
See the circles form  
Bodies flying left to right  
Days of tensions fade away  
Even if it's for one night  
  
Controlled aggression  
Your only release  
Helps to numb depression  
Real pain will never cease  
  
We are all that we have  
No matter what they say  
We are all that we have  
And they can't take that away  
  
Outside these walls  
You're a misfit, messed up kid, no one to trust  
Outside these walls, you're an outcast  
Here and now you're one of us  
  
We are all that we have  
(we are all!)  
We are all that we have  
(we are all!)  
We are all that we have  
(we are all!)  
We are all that we  
We're all that we have!
