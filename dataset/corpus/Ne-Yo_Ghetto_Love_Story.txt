(talking)  
In the ghetto  
Things don't always turn out the way  
You would expect them to  
That's how it goes  
Its real life  
Check it  
  
She was a brick house bangin  
Ill shoe game and  
No regular cat could get that  
She only wanted two things  
A puppy and a man that  
Wanted more than to just hit that  
  
Well out on the block  
What did she spot a  
Pretty thug walkin a baby rot wiler  
  
Pow  
They caught eyes  
It was love at first sight  
Crazy how somethin that seems so right can go wroongg  
See it didn't take too long  
For her to see just what this dude was on  
  
He was a good dude true and deep  
But he liked to make his money runnin the street  
So she hit him with its either the block or me  
And the beautiful thing suddenly ugly  
  
But that's how it goes  
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story  
And in the ghetto  
It doesn't always have a happy ending  
  
But that's how it goes  
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story  
And in the ghetto  
It doesn't always have a happy ending  
But that's how it goes  
  
So she stay maintain and  
She don't wana be alone  
But every time he leave the house  
She be worried bout  
If hes even gona come back home  
  
It seems no matter what she say  
He must make that paper just  
Gotta get his hustle on  
  
But it hurts him to his heart cus his love is strong  
And though hes tryna make things right for her  
All she see's is wrong  
All he can do is keep on  
Cus she don't understand just what hes on  
  
You see he loved her true and deep  
But he had to make his paper in these streets  
So she hit him with its either the block or me  
And the beautiful thing suddenly ugly  
  
But that's how it goes  
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story  
And in the ghetto  
It doesn't always have a happy ending  
  
But that's how it goes  
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story  
And in the ghetto  
It doesn't always have a happy ending
