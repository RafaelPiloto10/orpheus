Nobody's perfect  
Not even a perfect stranger  
But oh what a gal  
She was such a perfect stranger  
And you're the best in your field  
In your office with your girls  
And desk and leather chair  
Thought that time was on your side  
But now it's time the avenger  
  
Nobody's permanent  
Everything's on loan here  
Even your wife and kids  
Could be gone next year  
And with what you have left  
You'll be forever under pressure  
To support her  
And a lover who looks strangely  
Like time the avenger  
  
Time, time, hear the bells chime  
Over the harbor and the city  
Time, one more vodka and lime  
To help paralyze that tiny little tick, tick, tick, tick  
  
Nobody's perfect  
Not even a perfect gent  
When your property took the a train  
I wonder where your manners went  
You were standing at the station  
In your briefcase  
Was your aftershave and underwear  
Can you hear the whistle blow?  
Sounds like time the avenger  
  
Time, time, hear the bells chime  
Over the harbor and the city  
Time to kill another bottle of wine  
To help paralyze that tiny little tick, tick, tick, tick
