I lick my brain in silence  
Rather squeeze my head instead  
Midget man provoking violence  
Listen not to what I said  
  
I said please calm it down  
Everything is turning brown  
  
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist  
Of the worm like tips of tentacles expanding  
In my mind, I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine  
You can get another drop of this, yeah you wish  
  
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist  
Of the worm like tips of tentacles expanding  
In my mind, I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine  
You can get another drop of this, yeah you wish  
  
Laughing lady living lover  
Ooo you sassy frassy lassie  
Find me the skull of Haile Sellase, I  
Give me shoes so I can tapsy  
Tap all over this big world  
Take my hand you ugly girl  
  
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist  
Of the worm like tips of tentacles expanding  
In my mind, I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine  
You can get another drop of this, yeah you wish
