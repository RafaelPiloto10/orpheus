Oh, it really wasn't my intention  
To disregard convention  
It was just an impulse  
That had to be obeyed.  
Beacon Hill behavior we've been scorning  
But I'll still not go in mourning  
Though my reputation  
Is blemished, I'm afraid.  
What's done is done  
But wasn't, and isn't it, fun  
Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.  
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.  
And probably we shouldn't.  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Actually, it all was blameless.  
(of course it was)  
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless  
(I suppose)  
So the lady shall be nameless  
(thank you)  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Socially, you'll be an outcast  
Obviously, we dined alone  
On your good name there will be doubt cast  
With never a sign of any chaperone.  
No matter how they may construe it  
(it'll be the wrong way)  
Whether or not, we have to rue it  
(we will)  
Whatever made us do it  
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Honestly, I thought I couldn't.  
Naturally, I thought I wouldn't.  
And probably I shouldn't.  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Dinner was quite above suspicion  
Milk in the glasses when they'd clink  
Listening to a tired musician  
But what is it Mrs. Grundy's going to think?  
That I'm a bounder, a rounder, a cad, a Boston blighter  
When speaking of me, she'll be no politer  
Oh let's turn to something brighter  
Whatever we did, we're glad we did
