I'm working on gospel time these days  
(The summer this could be the cool part of the summer)  
  
The sloe eyed creature in the reckless room she's so severe  
A wise child walks right out of here  
  
I'm so excited I can barely cope  
I'm sizzling like an isotope  
I'm on fire so cut me some slack  
  
First she's way gone then she comes back  
She's all business then she's ready to play  
She's almost gothic in a natural way  
  
This house of desire is built foursquare  
(The city the cleanest kitten in the city)  
  
When she speaks it's like the slickest song I ever heard  
I'm hanging on her every word  
As if I'm not already blazed enough  
She hits me with the cryptic stuff  
That's her style, to jerk me around  
  
First she's all feel then she cools down  
She's pure science with a splash of black cat  
She's almost gothic and I like it like that  
  
This dark place so thrilling and new  
It's kind of like the opposite of an aerial view  
Unless I'm totally wrong  
I hear her rap and brother it's strong  
  
I'm pretty sure that what she's telling me is mostly lies  
But I just stand there hypnotized  
  
I'll just have to make it work somehow  
I'm in the amen corner now  
It's called love, I spell L -you- V  
  
First she's all buzz then she's noise-free  
She's bubbling over then there's nothing to say  
She's almost gothic in a natural way  
  
She's old school then she's like young  
Little Eva meets the Bleecker Street brat  
She's almost gothic but it's better than that
