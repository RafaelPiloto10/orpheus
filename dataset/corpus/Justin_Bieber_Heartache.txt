But yesterday we were  
I don't understand?  
  
We started out it was perfect  
Nothing but fun  
And my heart was convinced  
To say that you're the one  
  
And I thought it would last the rest of our lives  
Boy was I in for a big surprise,  
With no doubt looking round  
Thinking that I'm so cool  
  
Same place, same time  
Every day of my life could we meet after school  
Finally if I didn't make her cry  
She wouldn't be with another guy  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Now I'm all tore up taking up  
When I was at your door  
For the first time when you said  
Forever I'll be yours  
Started walking your hand in my hand  
Feelings got stronger  
  
We made a promise.  
  
And whenever I leave it feels like you're still with me  
But it all came crashing down  
Sitting in my room  
I gotta get out of here  
What am I to do when I look up  
And you're not there.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Say I'm to young for love  
I got so much live to live ahead  
But if only this love?  
I could get over  
I know I have to deal with the pain.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here
