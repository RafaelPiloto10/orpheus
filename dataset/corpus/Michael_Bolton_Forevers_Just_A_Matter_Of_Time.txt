How in the hill did this begin  
Like some cruel game we can't seem to win  
It just goes on over and over again  
  
It took the best outta you and me  
I thought we swore we'd let this love rest in peace  
Am I wrong  
Didn't we part as friends  
  
How many lifetimes must we live through  
'Til we're lookin' through the eyes of the truth  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that don't know how to let go  
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing  
When we say good-bye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever ain't a place we can find  
We'll know how we've tried  
And that forever's just a matter of time  
  
So much love, so much pain  
No one to judge, no one to blame  
It holds on  
How desperate this need that remains  
  
We know the passion that leads us blind  
'Cause the two of us are one of a kind  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that don't know how to let go  
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing  
When we say good-bye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever ain't a place we can find  
We'll know how we've tried  
And that forever's just a matter of time  
  
Time after time we stumble and fall  
Past the point of no return  
God knows we've given so much more than our all  
To this lesson we may never learn  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that don't know how to let go  
What does it mean when it don't mean a thing  
When we say good-bye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever ain't a place we can find  
We'll know how we've tried  
And that forever's just a matter of time
