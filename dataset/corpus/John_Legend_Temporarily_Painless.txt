[Verse 1]  
We don't have to explain it  
The beat is way too loud  
Even though the lights faded  
I still saw you in the crowd  
When I put you in my arm  
Feel it all through me  
When you promise me nothing  
You give me everything I need  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She comes over  
We're both not sober  
It's like we're losing our minds  
We kiss like lovers  
And Cupid hovers  
Like he's just learning to fly  
And even though it's dangerous  
It's temporarily painless  
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger  
  
[Chorus]  
No need to justify  
Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't even know what your name is  
When I taste your skin  
I don't wanna sound shameless  
I just wanna bring your body  
Wanna push you in my place  
Either hear you scream  
You don't even have to stay  
Oh but I don't think you wanna leave  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She comes over  
We're both not sober  
It's like we're losing our minds  
We kiss like lovers  
And Cupid hovers  
Like he's just learning to fly  
And even though it's dangerous  
It's temporarily painless  
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger  
  
[Chorus]  
No need to justify  
Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
  
[Bridge]  
And even though it's dangerous  
It's temporarily painless  
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger  
Even though it's dangerous  
It's temporarily painless  
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger  
  
[Chorus]  
No need to justify  
Little by little we love tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
No need to justify  
All I wanna be is your friend tonight  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too  
I need somebody  
You need somebody too
