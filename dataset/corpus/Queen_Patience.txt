Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you  
I'm still alright to smile  
Girl, I think about you every day now  
Was a time when I wasn't sure  
But you set my mind at ease  
There is no doubt you're in my heart now  
Said woman take it slow  
It'll work itself out fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
Said sugar make it slow  
And we'll come together fine  
All we need is just a little patience  
(inhale) Patience...  
Ooh, oh, yeah  
Sit here on the stairs  
'Cause I'd rather be alone  
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear  
Sometimes, I get so tense  
But I can't speed up the time  
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider  
Said woman take it slow  
Things will be just fine  
You and I'll just use a little patience  
Said sugar take the time  
'Cause the lights are shining bright  
You and I've got what it takes to make it  
We won't fake it, Oh never break it  
'Cause I can't take it  
... Little patience, mm yeah, ooh yeah,  
Need a little patience, yeah  
Just a little patience, yeah  
Some more pati... (ence, yeah)  
I've been walking these streets at night  
Just trying to get it right (Need some patience, yeah)  
It's hard to see with so many around  
You know I don't like being stuck in a crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)  
And the streets don't change but maybe the name  
I ain't got time for the game  
'Cause I need you (Patience, yeah)  
Yeah, yeah well I need you  
Oh, I need you (Take some patience)  
Whoa, I need you (Just a little patience is all we need)  
Ooh, this ti- me....
