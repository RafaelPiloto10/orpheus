I walked alone my heart a little colder  
Trying to make it on my way  
I took a ride wasn't getting any older  
Seventeen was here to stay  
They caught us living a dream  
We tried to get out the steam  
  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to be reminded  
What I left behind me  
So far away  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to feel the fire  
Yesterday's desire  
Ain't far away  
  
I was raised by my daddy's hand  
My mama taught me how to pray  
Got no regrets 'bout the things I've done  
Now I'm lookin' back to yesterday  
They caught us living a dream  
We tried to get out the steam  
  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to be reminded  
What I left behind me  
So far away  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to feel the fire  
Yesterday's desire  
Ain't far away  
  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to be reminded  
What I left behind me  
So far away  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to feel the fire  
Yesterday's desire  
Ain't far away  
  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to be reminded  
What I left behind me  
So far away  
Take me back  
'Cause I need to feel the fire  
Yesterday's desire  
Ain't far away  
  
Take me back  
Take me back  
All right
