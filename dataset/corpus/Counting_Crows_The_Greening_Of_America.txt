She's closing all the shades  
She finds the daylight just a little frightening  
She pulls the pedals overhead each day  
But she's opening her business is blooming nightly  
And every time it does it gets me hazy  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and I just go crazy  
The greening of Americas progressing smoothly  
Cuz she's choosing me  
It's later then I said  
And all the worlds a shade of black and purple  
Everybody else has gone to bed  
But when she makes me happy I just fly in circles  
And every time she does I just get teary  
The color of head changing everyday  
A little puff of wind and she's always near me  
The greening of America is progressing nicely  
It's all right with me  
Ba ba ba ba na na na na na [Etc.]  
If there's another life, and if get to chose I'd like  
To be a daisy  
I'll stay up waiting for my dusky wife  
To open and get high with just my jasmine baby  
And every time she does it gets me crazy  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and I just get crazy  
The greening of Americas progressing nicely  
It's all right with me-every time she  
She does just get teary  
The color of her head changing every day  
A little breath of wind and she's always near me  
The greening of Americas progressing smoothly  
Cuz she's choosing me
