Well, Old Joe, he moves slow  
He likes to look at things and paint pictures on his radio  
He says they make the songs look better.  
  
One day, Joe met a girl  
Sweet breathing thing  
Dancin' naked, nudey, in the winter snow  
Underneath her dozen sweaters  
  
And someday, somewhere  
Some things get hit by lighting  
And some things just don't  
Hope we live long and lucky  
  
At least one things for sure  
Or maybe it isn't.  
No matter where we are  
It's this life that we're livin' in  
  
At least one things for sure  
Or maybe it isn't.  
No matter where we are  
It's this life that we're livin' in  
  
And someday, somewhere  
Some things get hit by lighting  
And some things just don't  
Hope we live long and lucky
