I feel the dark when I see you  
I feel the dark when I see you  
  
Loosen the harness of trust  
Survey an impulse of lust  
The thespian is far away  
Uprooted yet forced to stay  
  
Sing a lie, ghost of the night  
Give yourself to me  
The road is long and winding still  
And these bonds will stay to fray  
But another day  
  
A flaking wish inside  
  
Veiled comes the daylight through the glass  
In the never-ending rain  
This is no friend of mine  
Stalking the comfort within  
  
A flaking wish inside  
The mother of lies  
  
And you're going out to war  
When the beast is coming home  
And the sun is seen no more  
For the devil's love you bore  
  
I feel the dark when I see you
