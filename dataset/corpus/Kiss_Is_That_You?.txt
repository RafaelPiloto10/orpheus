Cat's droolin' on the bar stool, shake your hips and crack your whips  
Cheap seventeen and trashed out, you went too far, been a bitch you are  
Your reputation's in the bathroom, it's on the wall and down the hall  
I hear you're cheatin' with my teacher after school, tell me what you do  
When you know, you always get the boys you like  
Play nice, then stick them with your knife, take off your insecure disguise  
  
Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs, is that you  
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs) Is that you, lookin' half way dead  
  
Write on the mirror with your lipstick, much too vain, got scattered brains  
You used me just enough to get off, act your age, get off your stage  
  
When you know, you always get the boys you like  
Play nice, then stick them with your knife, take off your insecure disguise  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs, is that you  
(Is that you, crawlin' up my stairs)  
Is that you, lookin' half way dead, is that you  
(Is that you, lookin' half way dead) Is that you, with your long black hair  
  
You always get the boys you like, play nice, then stick them with your knife  
You always get the boys you like, play nice, then stick them with your knife  
Take off your insecure disguise
