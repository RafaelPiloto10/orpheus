You might know of the original sin  
And you might know how to play with fire  
But did you know of the murder committed  
In the name of love you thought what a pity  
  
Dream on white boy  
Dream on black girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
To find your dreams are washed away  
  
There was a time when I did not care  
And there was a time when the facts did stand  
There is a dream and held by me  
Well I'm sure you had to see it's up in arms  
  
Dream on white boy  
Dream on black girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
To find your dreams have washed away  
  
You might know of the original sin  
And you might know how to play with fire  
But did you know of the murder committed  
In the name of love you thought what a pity  
  
Dream on white boy  
Dream on black girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
Dream on black boy  
Dream on white girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
Dream on black boy  
Dream on white girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
To find your dreams are washed away  
  
Dream on, to play with fire  
White boy, black girl  
Dream on, in the name of love  
Black boy, white girl  
White boy, black girl  
Black boy, white girl  
  
Dream on  
The name of love, yeah  
You thought what a pity  
  
Original sin
