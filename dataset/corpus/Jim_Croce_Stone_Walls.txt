It's been too many years inside this prison  
Too many years just for one little fight  
He got what was comin'  
And I think I served enough time  
I'm goin' home tonight  
  
That stone looks mighty cold  
And the guard that walks that wall  
Is just waitin' to get a convict in his sights  
But if I can clear the top  
You can bet I'll never stop  
Cause I'm goin' home tonight  
  
Because stone walls do a prison  
Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they don't  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind?  
  
Now those guards are on my tail  
I can hear those sirens wail  
But I know that I'll get away and that I'll be alright  
Cause I'd rather live on the run  
Stand free in the morning sun  
Then to spend another lonely prison night  
  
Because stone walls do a prison  
Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they don't  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind?
