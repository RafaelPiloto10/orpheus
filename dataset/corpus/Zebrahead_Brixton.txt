Started off as I fall in a ball of flame  
Burning out on your sentiment, it's all in vain  
Shot your 44 caliber words with aim  
You might've killed the heart but you left the brain  
Devastated and I hate it, see your eyes are insane  
Gray and dissipated building just like rust on a chain drained  
Dislocated echo in the things you say  
You might've killed the heart but you left the brain  
Your words are making me sick  
No more lies, enough with your rhetoric  
Whoa, what you got to hide?  
Whoa, you're dead inside  
What a wonderful lie  
Don't you feel alive?  
Whoa, what you got to hide?  
Whoa, you're dead inside  
What a wonderful lie  
Don't you feel alive?  
Cut away, cut it all away now  
Cut away, cut it all away now  
Cut away, cut it all away now  
Cut me off at the pass, as a hydroplane  
Crashing down from your promises, all were fake  
Shot your 44 caliber words with aim  
You might've killed the heart but you left the brain  
Formulated and I'm fated to withstand the pain  
Wave of generated conscience from the edge of a blade  
Feigned, fabricated echo in the things you say  
You might have killed the heart but you left the brain  
Your words are making me sick  
No more lies, enough with your rhetoric  
Whoa, what you got to hide?  
Whoa, you're dead inside  
What a wonderful lie  
Don't you feel alive?  
Whoa, what you got to hide?  
Whoa, you're dead inside  
What a wonderful lie  
Don't you feel alive?  
Switch all the lights off, tell me what you want from me  
Take my time and my energy  
Turning you heart off came about so easily  
It's not enough but it's plenty  
Bleed in the black out, said that you'd be there for me  
Now you're gone and we're history  
Screaming your lungs out, say you want what's best for me  
Give it up, you abandoned me  
Whoa, what you got to hide?  
Whoa, you're dead inside  
What a wonderful lie  
Don't you feel alive?  
Whoa, what you got to hide?  
Whoa, you're dead inside  
What a wonderful lie  
Don't you feel alive?  
Cut away, cut it all away now  
Cut away, cut it all away now  
Cut away, cut it all away now
