Must we wait for tomorrow  
There's a chance we may find it today  
Lonely hearts know the answer  
If you just let me show you the way  
I'll lead you to a paradise, oh  
Passion hides in the shadows  
Let emotion take over your soul  
Lose yourself in a moment  
You know our love is a river that flows  
All the way to paradise, oh  
Heaven tonight will be waiting for you  
In this heart burning bright  
There's a promise forever to  
Heaven tonight is just a kiss away  
How long must I wait for you?  
Come to me in the darkness  
Let me hear every beat of your heart  
Whisper words in the silence  
And say together we're here with the stars  
In a never ending love, oh  
Heaven tonight will be waiting for you  
In this heart burning bright  
There's a promise forever to  
Heaven tonight is just a kiss away  
How long must I wait for you?  
And when I close my eyes I see us together  
Make this dream of mine come true  
'Cause if you ever need someone  
Don't worry now, heaven is waiting for you  
Heaven tonight will be waiting for you  
In this heart burning bright  
There's a promise forever to  
Heaven tonight is just a kiss away  
How long must I wait for  
Heaven tonight will be waiting for you  
In this heart burning bright  
There's a promise forever to  
Heaven tonight is just a kiss away  
How long must I wait for  
Heaven tonight will be waiting for you  
In this heart burning bright  
There's a promise forever to  
Heaven tonight is just a kiss away  
How long must I wait for you?
