Take the ribbons from your hair shake it loose and let it fall  
Lay it soft against my skin like the shadows on the wall  
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light  
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night  
I don't care what's right or wrong now I won't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend  
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight  
I don't want to be alone help me make it through the night  
Lord, it's sad to be alone please help me make it through the night  
No, I don't want to be alone please help me make it through the night
