Honey pick the red corner shoes  
The ones that hardly ever get used  
I knelt in front of my whole collection  
And I'm picking you a special selection  
On a no news is good news middle of mid-year day  
I feel no ill with time to kill I want to play  
  
Let's make peace tonight  
(let's make peace tonight)  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
(moon is shining bright)  
Let's make peace tonight in a good time  
(let's make peace tonight)  
  
I'm callin' on my good friends today  
You know the drive's about an hour away  
And we'll be pitching up a tent by the trees  
And we'll be wading in the river to our knees  
Oh now love's been planted and we're checking out the yield  
It's two black dogs and a white one their running in the field  
  
Let's make peace tonight  
(let's make peace tonight)  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
(moon is shining bright)  
Well let's make peace tonight in a good time  
(let's make peace tonight)  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Well we used to have some money but we spent it  
(used to have some money but we spent it)  
Yeah so when we want to have it then we rent it  
(when we want to have it we rent it)  
But we're cuttin' up the rug and I know you love me love me  
(we're cuttin' up the rug and I know you love me)  
And the best of everything here is free  
(everything here is free)  
Oh when things get messy then we tidy up the room  
We'll be no stranger to that dustpan and the broom  
  
Let's make peace tonight  
(let's make peace tonight)  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
(moon is shining bright)  
Let's make peace tonight  
(let's make peace tonight)  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
(moon is shining bright)  
Let's make peace tonight in a good time  
(let's make peace tonight)
