Don't stop  
Love me right  
Don't stop doing what you're doing  
The way you touch me makes me feel so good  
There's something about the way you love me  
Boy you got me callin' out your name  
I love the way you love me baby

Give me all of your good love  
Until' I overflow

Love me right

Kiss me any time you want to  
Love with you is where I wanna be  
Could we do what you do to me?  
I just can't get enough  
Don't stop  
Don't stop  
Love me right  
Love me right  
I like what you do boy  
(I like what you do boy)  
You bring me so much joy  
(So much joy)  
So much that I can't get enough  
(I can't get enough)  
And I L O V E you  
Don't stop  
Don't stop  
Love me right
