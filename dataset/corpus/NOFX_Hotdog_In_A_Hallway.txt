He'll have another piece of pie  
She'll have a double reuben rye  
She works hard at eating well  
That's why I love her  
  
She's got a couple of pony kegs  
Her arms are bigger than my legs  
And when she holds  
Me I can't breathe  
  
That's why I love her yeah,  
I'm her butter she's my bread  
She's like mobile waterbed  
And when I get on top of her  
I can't touch the mattress  
  
And when her flesh begins to sag  
She's like a human sleeping bag  
I feel so cozy safe and warm  
She's my insulation  
  
I always know where she sat  
And when she's on me I get flat  
Some broken ribs a punctured lung  
That's why I love her  
  
She's my phillie, I'm her stud  
Her bean is bigger than my pud  
It's like feeding a tic-tac to a whale  
That's why I love her
