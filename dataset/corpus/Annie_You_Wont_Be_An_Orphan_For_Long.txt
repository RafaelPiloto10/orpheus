Grace  
  
If he should need the F. B. I.  
Then he will have the F. B. I.  
  
All  
  
With all the favors that he's done  
J. Edger Hoover owes him one.  
  
Cecille and annette  
  
'Till not a stone is left unturned  
  
All  
  
He will search everywhere  
And he'll find them, I swear.  
  
Grace  
  
Oh, you won't be an orphan for long!  
  
All  
  
Where other men would call it quits  
And disappear  
He'll use his fortune and his wits.  
So never fear  
Cross the street  
Or cross the sea  
Annie, sweet  
We guarantee  
That you won't be an orphan...  
  
Grace and the servants  
  
Tomorrow morning it begins  
You're with a man who always wins  
Trust him and he'll prove  
Mountains easily move  
Oh, you won't be an orphan --  
No, you won't be an orphan for long!
