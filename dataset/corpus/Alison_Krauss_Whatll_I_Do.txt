What'll I do when you  
Are far away  
And I'm so blue,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do when I  
Am wondering who  
Is kissing you,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just  
A photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just  
A photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true,  
What'll I do?
