I'm lost in your eyes  
Reaching out to cross the great divide  
You are drifting away  
Mind and soul and body day by day  
  
Nothing's stopping you and I  
It's do or die tonight  
  
So tell me why I'm alone  
When we're lying here together  
On a night that's so cold  
And you're just a touch away  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
  
I've been dying inside  
Holding back the tears I never cried  
Now I'm down on my knees  
Cause everything you are is what I need  
  
You're the meaning of it all  
Don't let me fall you've gotta  
  
Tell me why I'm alone  
When we're lying here together  
On a night that's so cold  
And you're just a touch away  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
  
We've got to come together  
Cause everybody needs a heart to hold  
Can't you see it's now or never  
Cause we've got nowhere else to go  
  
Tell me why I'm alone  
When we're lying here together  
  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
In your eyes  
The future never dies
