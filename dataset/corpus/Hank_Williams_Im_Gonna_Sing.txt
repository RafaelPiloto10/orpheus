In this world of sorrow I've seen trouble and woe when I get to glory I'll see
no more  
For I know my prayers have not been in vain  
When I get to glory I'm gonna sing sing sing  
When I get to glory I'm gonna sing sing sing I'm gonna let the hallelujahs
ring  
I'm gonna praise my blessed Saviour's name  
When I get to glory I'm gonna sing sing sing  
[ banjo ]  
Sometimes I get so weary inside then I recall how my Jesus died  
Up there I know there'll be no pain when I get to glory I'm gonna sing sing
sing  
When I get to glory...  
[ fiddle ]  
Up there no tears will blind my eyes and I'll walk along by my Jesus side  
I'll meet my loved ones all once again when I get to glory I'm gonna sing sing
sing  
When I get to glory...
