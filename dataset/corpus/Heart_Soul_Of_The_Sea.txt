Today you looked around to my heart's call  
This tiny life ain't been strangled after all  
Time, time, time, time  
Never ask what's become of us  
Just dedicate your sorrow  
Here and now  
To the soul of the sea  
And me  
  
Rushin' to me  
You turned around to my song's call  
You dreamer in the sand  
Just lie there laughing til the fall  
Kindest lover  
I can't stay alone tonight  
Bring me all your love  
Here and now  
Come rushin' to me  
  
Wake up late  
Without a smile  
Telephone rings  
You run like a child  
On the street  
Into the day  
The people I meet  
Have nothing to say  
  
No smile  
No sorrow  
No laughter  
No tomorrow  
They talk hen to hen  
They talk about their men  
And practice all the tricks for them  
Too soon nightime's coming on  
Deep in the darkness feeling alone  
  
No rain  
No seed  
No dreams  
No silence  
Far away today  
Mama ocean hold me to you  
Rock me on your waves  
And tell me...  
Is it all true?  
  
Time, time, time, time  
Never ask what's become of us  
Dedicate your sorrow  
Here and now  
To the soul the sea and me
