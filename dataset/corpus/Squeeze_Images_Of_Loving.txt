Your initials on the singles  
That you chose to leave behind  
Sit in my collection  
They get played from time to time  
Left to remind me of something I'd forgot  
The images of loving before I lost the plot  
What was love to us  
Just sensation  
What was love to us  
The invitation  
To sit on my bed stand by a tree  
What were we feeling  
What was love to us  
  
The stagecoach would get held up  
On a Sunday afternoon  
We're dozing by the TV  
On a sofa with no room  
No room to lay out flat with her there by my side  
One eye on her movements one eye on Rawhide  
  
I just wasn't made for these times  
Spun around my record deck  
How green was my valley  
How blue the eyes that wept  
Looking back I don't think that I really cared  
This was my first lesson with nothing to compare
