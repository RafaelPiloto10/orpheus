Here come Mr. 'I ain't like that', Mr. 'You can count on me'.  
Here come evolution, walkin' with stupidity.  
  
Waste a' time, waste a' my time.  
Give it up, lay it down, play the bottom line.  
Waste a' time, waste a' prime time.  
Hey! Let me shut that for you.  
  
There go no-one get over me, Mr. 'Not behind your back',  
Muthafucka got a larger than life, full a' shit, short a' fact.  
  
There's a kind of hush all over the world... tonight,  
All over the world, you can hear the sound.  
Know what I mean?  
  
Sit down, and shut up.  
Sit the fuck down, and shut the fuck up.  
  
Stoop muthafucka gettin' under my skin.  
Runnin' away with that mouth again,  
Ah ah ah got nothin' better to do,  
S.M.F. let me shut that for you!  
  
Waste a' time, waste a' my time.  
Give it up, lay it down, play the bottom line.  
Waste a' time, waste a' prime time.  
Hey! Shut the fuck up!
