I'm a football baby,  
  
Rollin' round the field.  
I've been passed and fumbled,  
Till I don't know what I feel.  
Everybody's the same,  
They're all footballs too.  
Setting up the big play  
  
And trying to score.  
  
I'm a football baby  
In a football game  
  
Run--kick  
I'm a football baby  
  
  
Life's a football game,  
As every chump and champ knows.  
  
We don't touch, we collide,  
Till we're worn out inside.  
We're kicking each other,  
Right where it hurts,  
Setting up the big play,  
And trying to score.  
  
I'm a football baby,  
  
In a football game  
I'm a football baby,  
I'm a football baby,  
In a football game  
I'm a football baby,  
  
Block--pass  
I'm a football baby,  
  
In a football game  
I'm a football baby,  
Run---kick---hit---goal .
