The five o'clock whistle's on the blink  
The whistle won't blow and whadd'ya think?  
My pop is still in the factory 'cause he don't know  
What time it happens to be  
  
The five o'clock whistle didn't blow  
The whistle is broke and whadda'ya know?  
If somebody don't find out what's wrong  
Oh, my pop'll be workin' all night long  
  
Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?  
Won't somebody fix the whistle?  
Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?  
So my poor old pop will know it's time for him to stop  
  
Ya ought to hear what my mommy said  
When papa came home and sneaked into bed  
And told her he worked till half past two  
Cause the five o'clock whistle never blew
