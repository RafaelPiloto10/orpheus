I've got a bad disease  
But from my brain is where I bleed.  
Insanity it seems  
Has got me by my soul to squeeze.  
  
Well all the love from thee  
With all the dying trees I scream.  
The angels in my dreams (yeah)  
Have turned to demons of greed that's mean.  
  
[Chorus]  
Where I go I just don't know  
I got to got to gotta take it slow.  
When I find my piece of mind  
I'm gonna give you some of my good time.  
  
Today love smiled on me.  
It took away my pain say please  
All that you had to free  
You gotta let it be oh yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, so polite indeed  
Well I got everything I need.  
Oh make my days a breeze  
And take away my self destruction.  
  
It's bitter baby,  
And it's very sweet.  
I'm on a rollercoaster,  
but I'm on my feet.  
Take me to the river,  
Let me on your shore.  
I'll be coming back baby,  
I'll be coming back for more.  
  
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone  
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad  
  
I could not forget  
But I will not endeavor  
Simple pleasures aren't as special  
But I won't regret it never.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where I go I just don't know  
I might end up somewhere in Mexico.  
When I find my piece of mind  
I'm gonna keep you for the end of time.
