When I was young I dreamed about  
Oh so many places  
When I was young I never thought I'd be afraid  
The years go by and with them comes  
Oh so many changes  
You know what I mean  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
  
And in my youth I realized nothing lasts forever  
I find myself remembering those happy days  
Follow me, I'll show you all the colors of the rainbow  
You know what I mean  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
  
Don't wait, don't be late  
You don't have a second left to hesitate  
Walk, talk, do it all  
Nothing you can do will break the fall  
  
Turn and turn  
Tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind  
If you want to be free  
Be there  
Turn around expectations  
Say 'goodbye' to complications  
Be there, be there  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
I pray  
I pray  
  
I pray there's another day  
Sunshine on the morning water  
What a day was yesterday, hm  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray  
  
I pray  
I pray  
I pray there's another day  
I pray there will be an answer  
I pray
