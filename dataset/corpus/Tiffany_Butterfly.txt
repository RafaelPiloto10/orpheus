(J. Brooks, T. Feehan)  
You should know that my smile was leading to this  
It's all in this letter  
Strange how your wings ache like a son of a bitch  
Just when you're, just when you're finally better  
(fly away)  
Butterfly  
Someone like you just better watch where you step  
People have been known to bleed  
See how my words read like a kick in the head  
Sometimes that's just what you need  
(fly away)  
Butterfly  
Butterfly  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away  
Don't you know that my smile was misleading  
I have outgrown my cocoon  
By the time that you read what you're reading  
I will have flown to the moon  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away...  
You should know that my smile was leading to this
