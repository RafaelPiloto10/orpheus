Strangely beautiful  
Beautiful strange  
That's what we said  
Instead of the name  
If you count the times  
He took all the blame  
You would find the reason  
Behind the game  
  
In the darkness  
We must look 4 the way  
Words so strange  
That only the mind can say  
If it makes no mind  
What color or holy day  
Why is this game  
The only one that we play  
  
Dive inside your sould if you wanna know  
The light inside the darkness 4ever glows  
The son is like the diamond inside the coal  
And like an embryo it grows and grows
