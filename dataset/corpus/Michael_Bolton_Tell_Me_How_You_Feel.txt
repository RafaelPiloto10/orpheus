If there's anything on your mind, I'm open  
It there's anything in your heart, honey, I'm open  
But how can I ever be a man  
If you won't open up and let me understand?  
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
Come on and tell me how you feel  
I really want to know  
If this love is gonna be real  
You gotta let your feeling show  
  
If your back's against the wall, I'm open  
If you're climbing high and you fall, I'm open  
Now if you need me to understand  
You know I can't unless you let me in  
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah  
  
'Cause I've been honest with you  
There's nothing more I want to do  
I just want to give you my love  
I only want to give you my love  
Yeah, take it, baby, oh, oh  
  
Tell me how you feel  
I really want to know  
Tell me how you feel, baby  
I really gotta know  
Tell me how you feel, baby  
Tell me how you feel  
I really want to know  
I really want to know
