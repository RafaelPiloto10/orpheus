I understand there's no future for us here  
Guess, I fooled myself into thinkin' there was  
Now you've made it clear  
It will never be right, guess we knew it all along  
Now we've got to say goodbye  
And I've got to be strong  
So tell me one more time, how it's better for the both of us  
Tell me one more time, how we'll hurt each other if we stay  
Tell me one more time, my darlin' there's just one more thing  
Before you walk away  
Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now  
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be  
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you  
Darlin' I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?  
Now if I try, I can see the reasons why  
Why we can't stay together  
And I might convince my mind  
But it's breakin' my heart to know I've got to let you go  
To find that I must leave behind  
The only love I've known  
Well, I can tell myself that I never really needed you  
I can tell myself that it's better just to say goodbye  
I can tell myself a thousand lies but tell me now  
Tell me how I do  
Explain it to my heart, it's better that we're over now  
Tell me one more time, this is the way it's suppose to be  
Tell me that I'm better off without you, how it's better to forget about you  
Darlin', I understand, now won't you please explain it to my heart?  
Say that I'll be better if we don't stay together  
Say that I'll be better off free but don't say it to me  
Explain it to my heart, tell me that I'm better off without you  
How it's better to forget about you, darlin', I understand  
Now, won't you please explain it to my heart?  
It's better that we're over now, tell me one more time  
This is the way it's suppose to be, tell me that I'm better off without you  
How it's better to forget about you, darlin', I understand  
Now, won't you please explain it to my heart?
