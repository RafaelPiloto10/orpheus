Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing  
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling  
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand  
Cause after I do ya  
Huh I never knew ya  
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits  
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits  
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow  
After we do it you can go home now  
I'm a brother with a big long...  
  
First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo  
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no  
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in  
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in  
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore  
And if that's what you're here for  
Exit through the door  
There's more  
To see of me but you're blind so  
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0  
  
Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo  
I know you like to rap and like to flow so  
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world  
Stay down and play the playground you little girl  
  
What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping  
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening  
It never fails I'll always get respect  
And you lose so take a rain check  
  
Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second  
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant  
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching  
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon  
  
Well you're mistaken  
It's not going that far  
I make brothers like you play the back yard  
You used to flow with the title but I took it  
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it  
  
Damn it look it  
Cause you're talking a lot of bull  
  
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives  
I hear females always talkin about women's lib  
Well get your own crib  
And stay there  
Instead of having more babies for the welfare  
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger  
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga  
For you to look at when your hair get nappy  
So take a piece of the pole and be happy  
  
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller  
You come in the room with your three-inch killer  
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone  
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown  
I'm a put it like this my man  
Without us your hand would be your best friend  
So give us credit like you know you should  
If I don't look good you don't look good  
  
I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant  
  
But you don't know how funky that I can get  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Man women I put a lot of fear in em  
Cause I had it up to here with em  
Drink a beer with em  
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day  
Yeah if you know what I mean baby  
  
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe  
If you was more of a man instead of faking it  
Women deserve the credit when they're making it  
  
Yeah so what's the problem  
  
Well I think we solved it  
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it  
  
Yeah I admit you can flow  
  
Well that's true  
  
But you see I'm a pro with the bank too  
  
Yeah I can see you got it good  
  
Oh that I know  
  
But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo  
The brand-new intelligent black lady  
  
You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me  
  
So what up then  
  
Girl what you tryin to do  
  
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through  
  
This is a man's world thank you very much  
  
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch  
  
Or a big butt...
