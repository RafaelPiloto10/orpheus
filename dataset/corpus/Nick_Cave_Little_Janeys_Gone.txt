Janey's gone now and she won't be back no more  
It was only yesterday I went knocking on her door  
Now she's gone away  
We won't see her no more  
  
Little Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone  
  
Little Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone away  
  
Oh yes, she's gone away  
Oh man, that's for sure  
  
Little Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone away  
  
Janey's gone, oh people, oh Lord  
Litlle Janey is gone  
She was the only one that we all could dip and dong  
Now she's gone away  
We won't see her any no more  
  
Little Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone  
  
Little Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone away  
  
Oh yes, she's gone away  
Oh man, that's for sure  
  
Little Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone now  
Janey's gone away  
  
Janey's gone now and she won't be back no more  
We'll have to find some other place to go and score  
  
Now she's gone  
Don't you see  
They're gonna throw away the key  
  
Little Janey's gone down  
Janey's gone down  
Janey's gone away
