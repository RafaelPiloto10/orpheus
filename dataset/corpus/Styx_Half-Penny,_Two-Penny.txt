Half penny, two penny, gold Krugerrand  
He was exceedingly rich for such a young man  
Sad story, old story  
Bring out the band  
Another divorce just a few hundred grand  
  
Half penny, two penny, back of the queue  
Yes mister poor man this means you  
Justice for money what can you say  
We all know it's the American Way  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
  
Half penny, two penny, back in the States  
You just couldn't take that African pace  
Yes, Mrs. Cleaver your son's home to stay  
We all know it's the American Way  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
  
"Come here - hey Angelo... what's happenin'?"  
"Hey, Stosh, good to see ya"  
"What the hell you doin'?"  
"We're tearing this old building down here"  
"Oh you're kiddin' me. Remember when we were kids, and we used to come here
every Saturday afternoon to see a cartoon?"  
"Yeah, I remember"  
"Well what's she lost to?"  
"Who knows- politicians, taxes...it's a disgrace"  
"I'm not surprised, they make me sick. They don't make theaters like this any
more."  
  
Half penny, two penny, ashes to dust  
The almighty dollar says "In God we trust"  
Justice for money how much more can I pay  
We all know it's the American Way  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
(I want to be free)  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
(We all want to be free)
