So you talked to my girl  
When I don't want you to  
Want you to  
Just the thought of you holding her  
When I don't want you to  
Want you to  
Won't do  
No, no, no  
It won't do, no  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
So you talk better than me  
And you know, you know it, know you know it  
And if you want to get her from me  
And you know you know it, know you know it  
Won't do, no  
I'm telling you it won't do, no  
  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us...
