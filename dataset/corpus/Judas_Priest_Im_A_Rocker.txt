The greatest times, I've ever known  
They're locked inside o' me  
And carved out of stone  
  
I've broken hearts  
Made people sing  
I've drove a million miles  
I've done everything  
  
I'm a rocker, oh oh  
Do as I feel as I say  
I'm a rocker, oh oh  
And no one can take that away  
  
Bring on the night  
That's when I live  
I come alive inside  
Give all I can give  
  
I live each day  
Like it's my last  
I live for rock and roll  
I never look back  
  
I'm a rocker, oh oh  
Do as I feel as I say  
I'm a rocker, oh oh  
And no one can take that away  
  
I'm a rocker  
And I'm always revvin' up  
I'm a rocker  
I can never get enough  
I'm a rocker  
It's something in my blood  
I'm a rocker  
Wouldn't change it even if I could  
  
I'm a rocker, oh oh  
Do as I feel as I say  
I'm a rocker, oh oh  
And no one can take that away
