I'll show you the stars in heaven,  
We'll look at the moon above.  
Though I'm a silly dreamer, you better stick with me.  
The best things in life are free,  
And I'm gonna be your good time man.  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No diamonds from Cartier,  
No shopping spree every day.  
I'll be your special lover, I know you'll understand,  
I'm doing the best I can  
And you'll be the one in wonderland.  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
Lee, I love you so, so much you'll never, never know,  
I have a special master plan,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No pad on Fifth Avenue,  
No carriage ride just for two,  
No table at Twenty One,  
We're gonna have ourselves some fun.  
  
No presents from Tiffany,  
Oh baby, that's not for me.  
No Rainbow Room at night, we'll just do it right,  
Doing it naturally  
And I do it good, you know I can,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
Lee, I love you so, so much you'll never, never, never know,  
I have a special master plan,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No fancy things from Chanel,  
I think that you just look swell.  
You are my special girl.  
I'm gonna take you round the world.  
  
A circle line round New York,  
Through Central Park we will walk.  
We'll hang out at the Boat House, take a paddle ride,  
We'll do it up in style,  
And I'm gonna make you smile, I can,  
I'll be your good time man.  
  
No Phantom of the Opera, not for me,  
I like Coney Island by the sea.  
French fries at Nathan's, not Grenouille.  
You're gonna see the real me.  
I'll be your good time man,  
I'll be your good time man,  
I'll be your good
