Silent night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
Round yon virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so,  
Tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Son of god  
Loves pure light  
Radient beams from thy  
Holy face  
With the dawn of  
Redeeming grace  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
Round yon virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so,  
Tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace
