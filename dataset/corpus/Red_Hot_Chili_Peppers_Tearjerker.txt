My mouth fell open  
Hoping that the truth  
Would not be true  
Refuse the news  
  
I'm feeling sick now  
What the fuck am I  
Supposed to do  
Just loose and loose  
  
First time I saw you  
You were sitting  
Backstage in a dress  
A perfect mess  
  
You never knew this  
But I wanted badly for you to  
Requite my love  
  
[Chorus]  
Left on the floor  
Leaving your body  
When highs are the lows  
And lows are the way  
So hard to stay  
Guess now you know  
I love you so.  
  
I liked your whiskers  
And I liked the  
Dimple in your chin  
Your pale blue eyes  
  
You painted pictures  
'Cause the one  
Who hurts  
Can give so much  
You gave me such  
  
[Chorus]
