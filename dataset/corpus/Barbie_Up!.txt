I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up up up up up up  
  
It's 'bout as bad as it could be  
Seems everybody's buggin' me  
Like nothing wants to go my way  
Yeah, it just ain't been my day  
Nothin's comin' easily  
  
Even my skin is acting weird  
I wish that I could grow a beard  
Then I could cover up my spots  
Not play connect the dots  
I just wanna disappear  
  
Up, up, up, can only go up from here  
Up, up, up, up where the clouds gonna clear  
Up, up, up, there's no way but up from here  
  
Even something as simple as  
Forgettin' to fill up on gas  
There ain't no explanation why  
Things like that can make you cry  
Just gotta learn to have a laugh  
  
Up, up, up, can only go up from here  
Up, up, up, up where the clouds gonna clear  
Up, up, up, there's no way but up from here  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
When everything is goin' wrong  
Don't worry, it won't last for long  
Yeah, it's all gonna come around  
Don't let it get you down  
You gotta keep on holding on  
  
It's 'bout as bad as it could be  
Seems everybody's buggin' me  
Like nothing wants to go my way  
Yeah, it just ain't been my day  
Nothin's comin' easily  
  
Up, up, up, can only go up from here  
Up, up, up, up where the clouds gonna clear  
Up, up, up, there's no way but up from here  
  
I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up up up up up up, I'm goin' up  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
