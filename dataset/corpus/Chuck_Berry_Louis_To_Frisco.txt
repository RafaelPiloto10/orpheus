I'm as free as a bird now  
As flighty as a Bumble Bee  
I'm here today and gone tomorrow  
Foot loose child and fancy free  
I'm absolutely independent  
Nothin' at all is gonna worry me  
I believe I was born to travel  
The open road is gonna bring me close  
You come to know some way-out people  
To say the least, I dig the most  
Who live and love across both borders  
Trip, East and West from coast to coast  
I only have one cradle to rock now  
I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go  
From St. Louis to San Francisco  
Ah! From Canada to Mexico  
I'm gonna let my cradle rock now  
'Till it just won't rock no more
