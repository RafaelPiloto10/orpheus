It's not the way you look no-no  
It's not the way you walk  
Your eyes are somethin' good  
You know they're clear and bright  
It's not the color of your hair  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
You're such a losin' cause  
Who says you write the laws  
Why don't you go get lost  
Who says you write the laws  
Go on get out of here  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
You're such a losin' cause  
Who says you write the laws  
Why don't you go get lost  
Who says you write the laws  
Go on get out of here  
  
It's not the way you look no-no  
It's not the way you walk  
Your eyes are somethin' good  
You know they're clear and bright  
It's not the color of your hair  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
Big eyes  
Big eyes  
Big eyes  
Big eyes  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
Big eyes
