You'll be my New's Year Day, my valentine  
I ain't gonna stop until I make you mine  
You'll be my April Fool, my Mardi Gras  
The music on my tongue, when I sing fa la la  
  
You'll be my flower child in the month of May  
My sunny summer love on my holiday  
You'll be my autumn leaves, my Halloween  
The winter snow and everything that's in between  
  
This year I'm gonna take you home  
This year I don't want to be alone  
This year, this Christmas, together,  
And the minutes they pass, and the hours, they fly  
This year, this Christmas, forever  
And the weeks and the months go rushing by  
This year we have learned how to live  
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear  
Just love, this Christmas, this year  
  
You'll be my spring ahead, my fall behind  
The shimmy in my hips, oh when I bump and grind  
You'll be my Santa Boy, all dressed in red  
And ride that little reindeer all through my head  
  
Round and round  
Round and round  
Here we go  
  
This year I'm gonna take you home  
This year I don't want to be alone  
This year, this Christmas, together  
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly  
This year, this Christmas, forever  
And the weeks and the months go rushing by  
This year we have learned how to live  
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear  
Just love this Christmas, this year  
  
Day by day, I'm gonna get my way  
This year I pray for you  
Seasons turn, I've got a lot to learn  
And I thank God for you  
  
This year I'm gonna take you home  
This year I don't want to be alone  
This year, this Christmas, together,  
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly  
This year, this Christmas, forever  
And the weeks and that months go rushing by  
This year we have learned how to live  
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear  
Just love, this Christmas, this year
