Standin' on the corner watchin' all the girls go by  
Drinkin' wine and whiskey smokin' joints and stayin' high  
I was young and crazy and I never thought that I could die  
Chorus  
'59 Cadillac '57 Chevrolet  
Goin' to the gravel pit and racin' til the break of day  
Smokin' in the boys room lookin' for some chick to lay  
I was young and crazy and life was full of girls and beer  
Now I'm gettin' older but I'm still crazy after all these years  
All these years  
Lookin' at the strippers hangin' out in tittie bars  
Life was Jim Beam whiskey, naked chicks, and fancy cars  
I thought I was bullet proof I was reachin' for the stars  
Chorus  
'59 Cadillac '57 Chevrolet  
Goin' to the gravel pit and racin' til the break of day  
Smokin' in the boys room lookin' for some chick to lay  
I was young and crazy and life was full of girls and beer  
Now I'm gettin' older but I'm still crazy after all these years  
All these years  
'59 Cadillac '57 Chevrolet
