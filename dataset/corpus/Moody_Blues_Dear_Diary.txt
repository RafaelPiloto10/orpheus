Dear diary, what a day it's been  
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream  
Woke up too late. Wasn't where I should have been  
For goodness sake, what's happening to me?  
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary  
  
It was cold outside my door  
So many people by the score  
Rushing around as senselessly  
They don't notice there's people like me  
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary  
  
They don't know what they're playing  
They've got no way of knowing what the game is  
Still they carry on doing what they can  
Outside me, yours truly, dear diary  
  
It's over. Will tomorrow be the same?  
I know that they're really not to blame  
If they weren't so blind, then surely they'd see  
There's a much better way for them to be  
Inside me, yours truly, dear diary  
  
Somebody exploded an H-bomb today  
But it wasn't anyone I knew
