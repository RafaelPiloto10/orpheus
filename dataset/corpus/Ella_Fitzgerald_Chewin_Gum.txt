I don't like steaks or fancy cake  
I'm cool to ice cream too  
I have just one obsession  
I really love to chew  
  
Lollipop and chocolate drop  
Have no effect on me  
But when I have some chewin' gum  
I'm happy as can be  
  
My mama gave me a penny  
To buy some candy  
I didn't want the candy  
So I bought some chewin' gum  
(Oh, yum, yum, yum)  
I love my gum  
  
My mama gave me a nickle  
To buy a pickle  
I didn't want a pickle  
So I bought some chewin' gum  
(Oh, yum, yum, yum)  
I bought some gum  
  
Each time I find myself with a dime  
I hurry to the store  
'Cause the boy who sells me chewin' gum  
Is the one that I adore  
  
My mama gave me a quarter  
For soda water  
I know I had an order  
But I bought some chewin' gum  
(A great big steak  
Is good for some)  
But as for me I'm happy  
When I'm chewin', chewin' gum  
  
Each time I find myself with a dime  
I hurry to the store  
For the boy who sells me chewin' gum  
Is the one that I adore  
  
My mama gave me a quarter  
For soda water  
I know I had an order  
But I bought some chewin' gum  
(A great big steak  
Is good for some)  
But as for me I'm happy  
When I'm chewin', chewin', chewin' gum
