Need I say I love you  
Need I say I care  
Need I say that emotion's,  
Something we don't share  
I don't want to be sitting here  
Trying to deceive you  
Cos you know I know baby  
I don't wanna go.  
  
We cannot live together  
We cannot live apart  
That's the situation  
I've known it from the start  
Every time that I look at you  
I can see the future  
Cos you know I know baby  
I don't wanna go.  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Is there nothing that I can say  
To make you change your mind  
I watch the world go round and round  
And see mine turning upside down  
You're throwing it all away.  
  
Who'll light up the darkness  
Who will hold your hand  
Who will find you the answers  
When you don't understand  
Why should I have to be the one  
Who has to convince you  
Cos you know I know baby  
That I don't wanna go.  
  
Some day you'll be sorry  
Someday when you're free  
Memories will remind you  
That our love was meant to be  
Late at night when you call my name  
The only sound you'll hear  
Is the sound of your voice calling  
Calling after me.  
  
Just throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
There's nothing I can say  
You're throwing it all away.
