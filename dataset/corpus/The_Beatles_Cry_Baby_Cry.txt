Cry baby cry  
Make your mother sigh  
She's old enough to know better.  
  
The King of Marigold was in the kitchen  
Cooking breakfast for the Queen  
The Queen was in the parlor  
Playing piano for the children of the King.  
  
Cry baby cry  
Make your mother sigh  
She's old enough to know better.  
So cry baby cry.  
  
The King was in the garden  
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play  
The Queen was in the playroom  
Painting pictures for the children's holiday.  
  
Cry baby cry  
Make your mother sigh  
She's old enough to know better.  
So cry baby cry.  
  
The Dutchess of Kircaldy always smiling  
And arriving late for tea  
The Duke was having problems  
With a message at the local Bird and Bee.  
  
Cry baby cry  
Make your mother sigh  
She's old enough to know better.  
So cry baby cry.  
  
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table  
For a seance in the dark  
With voices out of nowhere  
Put on specially by the children for a lark.  
  
Cry baby cry  
Make your mother sigh  
She's old enough to know better.  
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby  
Make your mother sigh.  
  
She's old enough to know better  
Cry baby cry  
Cry cry cry  
Make your mother sigh  
She's old enough to know better.  
So cry baby cry.
