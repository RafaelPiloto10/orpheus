Promise me love, promise me  
Kisses sweet love, meant for me  
Promise me love  
That you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (promise me)  
  
Promise me love, promise me (oh, promise me)  
Arms to hold love, never set me free (oh, promise me)  
Promise me love  
That you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (oh, promise me)  
  
I promise you blue cornflowers for your hair  
A golden necklace and my heart I swear  
I promise you a million promises I'd do  
And they'll come true  
Oh love, I promise you (ooh-ooh)  
  
Promise me love, promise me (oh, promise me)  
You'll be my love eternally (oh, promise me)  
Swear it true love that you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (oh, promise me, love, oh, promise me)  
  
I promise you blue cornflowers for your hair  
A golden necklace and a ring to wear  
I promise you a million promises I'd do  
And they'll come true  
Oh love, I promise you (ooh-ooh)  
  
Promise me love, promise me  
You'll be my love eternally (oh, promise me)  
Swear it true love, that you'll love me tenderly  
Oh love, promise me (oh, promise me, love, oh, promise me)  
  
Oh, promise me  
(Oh, promise me, love, oh, promise me)
