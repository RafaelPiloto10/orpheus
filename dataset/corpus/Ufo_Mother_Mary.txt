[Chorus 1]  
Try to make some changes really on the line  
Given your religion, never ever time  
All the jokers laughing, queens upon the floor  
Mothers understand it, baby needs some more  
  
Head held up to ransom, by a quick hand and a gun  
Just your education, hard to understand  
Will the teenage legend make a mark on you  
Make a big time status, with a pen we'll stab it through  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Mother Mary could you ever really feel the same  
And would you try to understand a wild colonial boy  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Chorus 1]
