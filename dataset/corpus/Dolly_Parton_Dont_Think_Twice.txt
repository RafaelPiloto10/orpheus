Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter anyhow  
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
  
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You are the reason I'm traveling home  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
That night, I never know  
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
  
Still I wish there was something you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe  
Like you never did before  
And there ain't no use in calling out my name  
Cause I can't hear you anymore  
  
Well, I'm thinking and wondering while I'm way down on the road  
I once loved a man but that love grew old  
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul  
Don't think twice, it's alright  
  
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good away, babe  
So I'm gonna say farewell  
  
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind  
But you just kinda wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice, it's alright
