[Chorus]  
I've got the stuff that you want  
I've got the thing that you need  
I've got more than enough  
To make you drop to your knees  
Cause I'm the queen of the night  
The queen of the night  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right  
I've got the feeling and I'm willing tonight  
Well I ain't nobody's angel  
What can I say, I'm just that way  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
You've got a problem with the way that I am  
They say I'm trouble and I don't give a damn  
But when I'm bad I know I'm better  
I just want to get you, and turn it up for you  
  
[Chorus]
