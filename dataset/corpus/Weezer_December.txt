Only love can ease the pain  
Of a boy caught in the rain  
  
Only hope will remember  
Burning flames in December  
  
Only love  
Only love...  
  
Only faith can bring to life  
One who falls by the wayside  
  
Only trust can inspire  
A soggy nose to breathe fire  
  
Only love  
Only love...  
  
It's only natural  
The moon is just half full  
We give our best away  
We give our best away  
Only love...  
  
Only trust can inspire  
A soggy nose to breathe fire  
  
Only love  
Only love...  
  
Only love  
Only love...
