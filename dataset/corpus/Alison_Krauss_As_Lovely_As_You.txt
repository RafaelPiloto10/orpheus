The big moon is risin' so bright in the sky  
But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes  
It rises above me so bright and so blue  
And I won't see anyone, as lovely as you  
Take me into the night,  
Past these lonely dreams in my heart  
I love you, more than I could show you  
More than I could know, in my heart  
So lay down beside me and hold me tonight  
For your love has found me and it feels so right  
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few  
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you  
Take me into the night,  
Past these lonely dreams in my heart  
I love you, more than I could show you  
More than I could know  
Take me into the night,  
Past these lonely dreams in my heart  
I love you, more than I could show you  
More than I could know, in my heart  
In my heart
