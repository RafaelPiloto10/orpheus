City of the angels.  
City of the angels.  
Walkin' and talkin' and laughin'  
About dreamin' the things that you want will work out.  
People in places where you want to be,  
I'm lost in the city, who's got the key?  
  
[Chorus:]  
City of the angels,  
Oo, I hear you callin' me.  
City of the angels  
I've got this feelin' that things will work out.  
I've got this feelin', and there ain't no doubt.  
I'm holdin' on, hopin' to find,  
Life in this city can bring peace of mind.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Just like, just like it used to be, yeah.  
City of the angels.  
I'm goin' home, home, bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye.  
Oh, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye  
Yeah, yeah, I'm leavin', leavin'  
Oo, oo, I'm goin' home  
I'm leavin', leavin'
