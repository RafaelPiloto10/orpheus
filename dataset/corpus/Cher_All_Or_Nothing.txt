I've been standing out in the rain  
I've been calling your name  
Got that lonely feeling again  
Calling out your name  
Do you hear me? Do you want me?  
  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
I don't want to run  
And I can't walk out  
You're breaking my heart  
If you leave me now  
Don't want to wait for ever  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Baby it's all or nothing  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
  
I've been trying to get to your heart  
But I'm chasing shadows  
We keep falling further apart  
So near and you're so far  
Do you care now? Do you know how?  
  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
I don't want to run and I can't walk out  
Breaking my heart if you leave me now  
Don't want to wait forever  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Who do you think you're fooling  
Baby it's all or nothing  
Baby it's all or nothing now  
  
Sometimes when you touch me  
I just can't help myself  
Desire makes me weak  
Desire makes me weak  
Do you care now? Do you know how?
