Hot as golden sand in fields  
We whiled away the hours  
I'm thinking of the days we had  
Enormous super powers  
Yes I'm sleeping, my mind's on the blink  
I thought a page, like it's written in ink  
When I remember distant days  
I remember many things, but  
Most of all, I remember the sun  
Squinting at the sun through eyes  
Screwed up by a fireball  
Tarmac on the road is soft  
Chaff burns in a smokewall  
Yes, I weeping, a teardrop attack  
I give emotion at the drop of a hat  
When I remember days at school  
I remember many things, but  
Most of all, I remember the sun  
Sun that worked on overtime  
Fuelled our bodies, kindled fire in our minds  
Burning scars soon disappear  
Like heat that hangs like water on the road  
But most of all, I remember the sun.
