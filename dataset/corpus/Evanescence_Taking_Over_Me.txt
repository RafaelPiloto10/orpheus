You don't remember me, but I remember you  
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you  
But who can decide what they dream?  
And dream I do  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
Have you forgotten all I know  
And all we had?  
You saw me mourning my love for you  
And touched my hand  
I knew you loved me then  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
I look in the mirror and see your face  
If I look deep enough  
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
  
I believe in you  
I'll give up everything just to find you  
I have to be with you to live to breathe  
You're taking over me  
You're taking over me
