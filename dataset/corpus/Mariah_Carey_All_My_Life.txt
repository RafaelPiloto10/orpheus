I've been waiting for someone  
To come into my life  
Who would bring me joy  
And give me pleasure  
  
I have taken chances on  
Romances once or twice  
And I found that in my heart  
It's you I treasure  
  
You and only you can  
Make me feel the way I do  
You and only you can  
Make it better  
  
You and only you can  
Do the freaky things you do  
And I'm so into you and  
That's forever and ever  
  
All my life  
My love's been  
Waiting for you  
All my life  
My heart's been waiting too  
  
All my life  
  
I've been wishing  
On a star  
I've been praying  
On my knees  
  
I've got some sly and  
Sexy tricks to show you  
Most of all  
I'll give you anything  
  
Boy that you need  
To keep you right  
Here by my side  
I know you  
I'll show you  
  
You and only you can  
Make me feel the way I do  
You and only you can  
Make it better  
  
You and only you can  
Do the freaky things you do  
And I'm so into you and  
That's forever and ever  
  
All my life  
My love's been  
Waiting for you  
All my life  
  
My heart's been waiting too  
Don't you know I need you  
And adore you  
All my life  
I'll give to only you
