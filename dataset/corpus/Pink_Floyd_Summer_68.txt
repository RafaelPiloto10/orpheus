Would you like to say something before you leave  
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel  
We said good-bye before we said hello  
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all  
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud  
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year  
And I would like to know  
How do you feel, how do you feel, how do you feel?  
  
Not a single word was said, delights still without fears  
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need  
I felt the cold far too soon - the wind of '95  
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there  
Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you  
Have you time before you leave to greet another man  
Just you let me know  
How do you feel, how do you feel, how do you feel?  
  
Good-bye to you  
Charlotte Kringles too  
I've had enough for one day
