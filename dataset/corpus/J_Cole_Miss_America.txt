This is a public service announcement  
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records  
"And so my fellow Americans  
Ask not what your country can do for you  
Ask what you can do for your country"  
  
Excuse me  
  
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars  
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors  
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg  
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg  
Don't trip nigga, they just words  
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs  
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse  
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church  
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo  
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo  
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit  
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick  
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail  
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel  
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga  
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas  
  
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch  
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich  
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch  
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge  
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments  
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit  
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit  
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge  
  
Miss America, petty thoughts  
Miss America, petty thoughts  
Miss America, petty thoughts  
Just to floss pay any and every cost  
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out  
Am I about dollars or about change?  
Am I about knowledge or about brains?  
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain  
  
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers  
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense  
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'  
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets  
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit  
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit  
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit  
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit  
Who the fuck was I?  
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side  
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at  
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back  
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack  
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat  
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft  
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag  
  
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch  
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich  
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch  
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge  
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments  
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit  
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit  
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge  
  
They don't feel my pain  
They'll never feel my pain  
And they'll never play this shit on the radio
