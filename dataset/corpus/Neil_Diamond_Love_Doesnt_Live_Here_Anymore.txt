How can I stay in this place  
All that I see is her face  
And every room just seems to haunt me  
  
Why would she throw love away  
Guess there's no reason to stay  
Maybe it's time to close the door  
  
[Chorus]  
Darlin',  
Love it doesn't live here anymore  
Why can't it be like before  
I know that she still wants me  
Tell me why, why did she have to go  
Love doesn't live here, I know  
  
I thought our love would go on  
But somehow she knew all along  
That we could never find an answer  
  
Putting an end to our plans  
Leaving my heart in my hands  
Saying goodbye is such a chore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we had something,  
There can be no doubt  
Now there's nothing left to talk about  
She's the one thing I can't live without  
How can I leave it all behind  
  
And how could she throw love away  
Guess there's no reason to stay  
Maybe it's time to close the door  
  
Darlin',  
Love doesn't live here anymore  
Why can't it be like before  
I know that she still wants me  
Tell me why, why did she have to go  
  
Love doesn't live here anymore  
Why can't it be like before  
I know that she still wants me  
  
Tell me why, why did she have to go  
Love doesn't live here,  
I know [Repeat: x4]
