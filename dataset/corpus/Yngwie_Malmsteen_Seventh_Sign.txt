The earth is crumbling, the end is near  
No one's listening, I'm filled with fear  
Hear the warning, in the prophet's word  
Day by day, we're destroying this world  
No more water  
No more blue skies  
No one cares, no one tries  
To save what we once had  
World at war (a world at war)  
Rich and poor (rich and poor)  
Burn in hell (burn in hell)  
Hear dooms days bells (dooms days bells)  
Ringing loud (ringing loud)  
I see black clouds  
We are making lucifer so proud  
World at war (a world at war)  
Rich and poor (rich and poor)  
Burn in hell (burn in hell)  
Hear dooms days bells (dooms days bells)  
Ringing loud (ringing loud)  
I see black clouds  
We are making lucifer so proud  
Blind leading the blind  
No one sees the seventh sign  
We're left behind  
There's no more hope, the day has come  
What we have done, can't be undone  
Too many years, we've lived in sin  
We know for sure, the beast will win  
Fight fire with fire, to start to run  
Don't trust a liar, like we have done  
We've lost the battle to the evil one  
Blind leading the blind  
No one sees the seventh sign  
We're left behind.
