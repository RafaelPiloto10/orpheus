Suddenly our shortcomings don't seem to matter at much  
Your IQ is 20 points low  
And I'm no Six Foot Hot Look All American Man  
  
Sad to say I pushed you away  
Waiting for "Mrs. Right"  
You never gave up  
  
[Chorus]  
Devotion  
Waiting for me  
You'll always be my girlfriend  
I too am waiting for you  
I'll always be your friend  
  
I commend your stubbornness  
Without it we'd never got this far  
I am done with perfection  
Chasing her leaves me with nothing but pain  
  
Unlike you  
She isn't true  
She's got her own concerns  
You never gave up  
  
[Chorus: x2]
