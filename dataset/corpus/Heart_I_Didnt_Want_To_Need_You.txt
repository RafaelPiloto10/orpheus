Baby, I never gave my heart to anyone, oh no  
Used to think that love was a game  
I used to make it just for fun  
When we spent the night together  
Didn't mean it meant that much  
Now I just can't live without your touch  
  
I didn't want to to need you, no  
I didn't want to want you like I do  
I didn't mean to fall  
Didn't want to care at all  
I didn't want to need you  
Like I need you now  
  
I can't get no sleep  
'Cause I keep thinking of you all through the  
Night, oh yeah  
My eyes can't wait to see you again  
My arms can't wait to hold you tight oh yeah  
And when you're laying here beside me  
There is nothing else I need  
Never thought that this could ever be  
  
I didn't want to to need you, oh no  
I didn't want to want you like I do  
I didn't mean to fall  
Didn't want to care at all  
I didn't want to need you  
Like I need you now  
  
I've always been free  
To leave when I want to leave  
But it's not up to me anymore  
I didn't want to need you  
  
I didn't want to to need you, no  
I didn't want to want you like I do  
I didn't mean to fall  
Didn't want to care at all  
I didn't want to need you  
But I need you now
