One good love  
Erases all the bitter tears on an empty dance hall  
All those lonely nights when she never called  
It just don't seem so tragic after all  
With one good love  
  
One good love  
And daddy's hands were strong and fair  
And momma understands because she's been there  
And all mistakes were just because they cared so much  
With one good love  
  
One good love  
You bless all my memories  
You soften the fall of my tears  
And in my arms you're more than enough  
You're one good love  
  
Hey, you're one good love  
Yeah, you're one good love  
  
One good love  
You bless all my memories  
You soften the fall of my tears  
And in my arms you're more than enough  
You're one good love  
  
One good love  
And born again means more than pass the plate and bow your head  
Yes, you bury what needs burying, you raise it from the dead  
The very best, you heal the brokenness, give grace to everyone  
With one good love  
  
Yeah, oh, one good love  
Hey, hey, one good love  
Yeah, I'll give you one good love  
Oooo, oooo, oooo, ooooo, oooo, yeah  
Lord, I feel born again, yeah  
You got to give me one good love now  
One good love
