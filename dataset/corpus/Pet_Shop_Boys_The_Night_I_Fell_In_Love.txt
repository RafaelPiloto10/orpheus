I was backstage  
Couldn't believe my luck was in  
I saw him approach  
Wearing a most approachable grin  
When he said hello  
I was surprised he spoke so politely  
I said I'd liked his show  
Well he just smiled  
I guess it happens nightly  
And so  
I fell in love  
  
We went to his room  
He had a video camera  
I was so nervous  
I had to try hard not to stammer  
He said  
'I'm glad you liked the show  
That crowd was dope out there tonight, alright  
You want to see some more?  
Well be my guest  
You can have a private performance'  
I'd fallen in love  
  
I didn't ask why  
Though he seemed like such a regular guy  
He said we could be  
Secret lovers  
Just him and me  
Then he joked  
'Hey, man!  
Your name isn't Stan, is it?  
We should be together!'  
And he was passionate  
I guess I would rate  
Him a nine out of ten  
By then  
I'd fallen in love  
  
When I asked  
Why have I heard so much  
About him being charged  
With homophobia and stuff  
He just shrugged  
  
Next morning we woke  
He couldn't have been a nicer bloke  
Over breakfast made jokes  
About Dre and his homies and folks  
Neither of us asked if or when  
We would see each other again  
But I thought that was cool  
'cause I was already late for school  
By then  
I'd fallen in love
