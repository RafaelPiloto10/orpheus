When I was young, my momma always told me  
I still hear her advice  
She said don't ever bet against your feelings  
Always think twice  
Don't go and throw your love away  
To some man just for the night  
Promises, promises, don't waste your time  
If his intentions don't feel right  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation  
I'm so thankful momma I am waiting  
To find someone who  
Was looking in the same direction  
That you pointed to  
I'll never turn and walk away  
If my heart gives me the sign  
When the one, comes along  
He'll understand  
That the wait was worth the while  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation  
(Momma said, she said)  
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me  
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation
