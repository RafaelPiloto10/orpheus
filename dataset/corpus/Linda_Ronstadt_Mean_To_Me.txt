Sweetheart I love you  
Think the world of you  
But I'm afraid you don't care for me  
You never show it  
  
Don't let me know it  
Everyone says I'm a fool to be  
Pining the whole day through  
Why do you act like you do  
  
You're mean to me  
Why must you be mean to me  
Gee honey it seems to me  
You love to see me crying  
  
I don't know why I stay home  
Each night when you say you'll phone  
You don't and I'm left alone  
Singing the blues and sighing  
  
You treat me coldly each day of the year  
You always scold me whenever somebody is near dear  
It must be great fun to be mean to me  
You shouldn't for can't you see  
  
What you mean to me  
You treat me coldly each day of the year  
You always scold me whenever somebody is near dear  
It must be great fun to be mean to me  
  
You shouldn't for can't you see  
What you mean to me
