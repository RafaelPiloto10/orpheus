It's in your eyes,  
The love you hide away.  
You can't disguise  
The things you feel, the thing you say  
  
If you just call my name  
Any time at all, I'll be there.  
  
I don't know why,  
The way you're falling away from me.  
I can't describe  
It's how it feels, it's what I see.  
  
If you just call my name  
Anytime at all,  
Anytime at all,  
Anytime at all, I'll be there.  
  
I look around, all I see is you  
But you gotta tell me that you want me too.  
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true.  
  
I'm here, just call my name  
Anytime at all, I'll be there.  
  
I look around, all I see is you  
But you gotta tell me that you want me too.  
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true.  
  
I can't disguise  
The love I wait for you to share  
I can't deny  
If you reach out and touch my hand it's there.  
  
Or just call my name,  
Anytime at all,  
Anytime at all,  
Anytime at all, I'll be there.
