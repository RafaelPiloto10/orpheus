Take me back to the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
Lost my heart in the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
Where the pines are so high  
That they kiss the sky above  
  
And when I get that lonesome feelin'  
And I'm miles away from home  
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains  
Callin' me back home  
  
So take me back to the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
And when I get that lonesome feelin'  
And I'm miles away from home  
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains  
Callin' me back home  
  
So take me back to the black hills  
The black hills of Dakota  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
To the beautiful Indian country  
That I love  
  
Take me back to the Black Hills  
To the beautiful Indian country that I love
