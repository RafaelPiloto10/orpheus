Somewhere between psychotic and iconic  
Somewhere between I want it and I got it  
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted  
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment  
But I stay down, girl I always stay down  
Get down, have her lay down  
Promise to break everybody off before I break down  
Everyone just wait now  
So much on my plate now  
People I believed in they don't even show they face now  
What they got to say now?  
Nothin' they can say now  
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now  
What more can I say now?  
What more can I say now?  
You might feel like nothin' was the same  
  
I still been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I still been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
I just been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I just been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya  
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya  
You know that paper my passion  
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened  
I can't help it  
I can't help it  
I was young and I was selfish  
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's  
And now you hate me  
Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'  
I can't take it  
Girl don't treat me like a stranger  
Girl you know I seen ya naked  
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender  
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together  
You know I stay remniscin'  
And makeup sex is tradition  
But you been missin' girl  
And you might feel like nothin' was the same  
  
I still been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I still been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
I just been drinkin' on the low  
Mobbin' on the low  
Fuckin' on the low  
Smokin' on the low  
I just been plottin' on the low  
Schemin' on the low  
The furthest thing from perfect  
Like everyone I know  
  
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'  
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money  
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin', schemin'  
Plottin', schemin', getting money  
  
This the life for me  
My mama told me this was right for me  
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me  
I should have Spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me  
Your actions make us doubt you  
Your lack of effort got me rapping different  
This the shit I wanna go out to  
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'  
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living  
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling  
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us  
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up  
Yours truly the boy  
I just build and build more  
Y'all niggas build and destroy  
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record  
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before  
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to, yeah  
This the shit I wanna go out to
