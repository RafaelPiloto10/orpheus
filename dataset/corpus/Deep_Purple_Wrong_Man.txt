I wasn't in the room when the action was going down  
I may have been there once but at the time I was out of town  
I'm seeing strange fruit, they're saving off with his head  
One way or another I'll end up dead  
  
You got the wrong man  
You don't understand  
You got the wrong man  
You got the wrong man  
I do what I can  
  
I plead not guilty to the charges you've laid out on your desk  
l know what you're thinking 'Oh yes, this is a DSF  
I think I'm prime ministerial material but I can't lie to you  
So I'm out of the running  
But from here in my cell I imagine  
Wouldn't that be something  
  
You got the wrong man  
You don't understand  
You got the wrong man  
You got the wrong man  
I do what I can
