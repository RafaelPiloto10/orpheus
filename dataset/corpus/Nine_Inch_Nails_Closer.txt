You let me violate you you let me desecrate you  
You let me penetrate you you let me complicate you  
Help me I broke apart my insides help me I've got no soul to sell  
Help me the only thing that works for me help me get away from myself  
I want to fuck you like an animal  
I want to feel you from the inside  
I want to fuck you like an animal  
My whole existence is flawed  
You get me closer to god  
You can have my isolation, you can have the hate that it brings  
You can have my absence of faith, you can have my everything  
Help me tear down my reason, help me its' your sex I can smell  
Help me you make me perfect, help me become somebody else  
I want to fuck you like an animal  
I want to feel you from the inside  
I want to fuck you like an animal  
My whole existence is flawed  
You get me closer to god  
Through every forest, above the trees  
Within my stomach, scraped off my knees  
I drink the honey inside your hive  
You are the reason I stay alive  
You get me closer to god  
Help me get away from myself  
You get me closer to god  
Help me get away from myself  
You get me closer to god
