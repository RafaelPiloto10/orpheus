This day's an invitation  
And it's just for you  
You've got a reservation  
For the 17th of June  
  
Open your eyes  
And let the sun break in for a while  
There may be something  
That you've never seen inside  
  
Feel how your heart beats  
Like a heavy machine  
The sound of the traffic  
Is like a silent dream  
  
The dust in the park  
The exhaust from the cars  
Ascends in that heated afternoon  
(You touch a sweaty body!)  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The day feels so tired  
From the lead in the air  
And the fire in the skies  
  
Life seemed to be a fault of grace  
But it's ok  
It gave you a kiss  
In the middle of the crossroads  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The heat of the sun  
Which is stored in the pavement  
Feels so fine  
  
Here stands the innocent  
And there it comes oh so wild  
That's when you're longing  
For a summer by the wall  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
Summer in Berlin, it's ok
