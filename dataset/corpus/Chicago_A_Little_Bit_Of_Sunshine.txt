[MARY SUNSHINE]  
When I was a tiny tot  
Of maybe two or three  
I can still remember what  
My mother said to me...  
  
Place rose colored glasses on your nose  
And you will see the robins  
Not the crows  
  
for in this tense and tangled web  
Our weary lives may weave  
you're so much better off  
if you believe...  
  
That there's a little bit of good  
In everyone  
In everyone you'll ever know  
  
Yes, there's a little bit of good  
In everyone  
Though many times, it doesn't show  
  
It only takes the taking time  
With one another  
For under every mean veneer  
Is someone warm and dear  
Keep looking...  
  
for that bit of good in everyone  
The ones we call bad  
Are never all bad  
So try to find that little bit of good!  
  
Just a little, little bit of good  
  
Is someone warm and dear  
Keep looking...  
  
For that little good in everyone  
Although you meet rats  
They're not complete rats  
So try to find that little bit of good!
