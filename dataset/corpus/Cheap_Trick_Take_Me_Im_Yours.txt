You walked in the room  
I saw your face and i saw you smile  
A pretty girl like yourself  
You've got a new approach  
And the time is right  
  
You think you're so fine, oh so fine  
And it so excites me  
Come six with my nine  
You're my perfect partner  
And the time's good tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me I'm yours  
Take me I'm yours  
Come on now and take me  
Take me amour  
Take me I'm yours  
Come on now and take me  
  
Oh don't you be so nice to me  
Oh you can't be serious  
A pretty girl like yourself  
You'll be my perfect partner  
And the time's good tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I love the way you wear your hair  
I saw the way you stopped and stared  
When i looked at you, oh no oh no  
Well maybe girls like you aren't free  
But baby, baby can't you see  
I just want to be with you.  
  
You walked through the room  
Continental style and sweet perfume  
A pretty girl like yourself  
You've got a new approach  
And the time's good tonight  
  
[Chorus]
