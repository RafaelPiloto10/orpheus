Baby take the long way home  
Don't stop at every light  
The wind is blowing you right through me tonight  
I'm somewhere in the ozone  
And I can hardly breathe  
Perfume and leather baby  
It's you and me together baby  
What good is living in paradise  
If you don't let yourself go once or twice  
Nobody's giving me better advice  
Show what you're feeling  
You wouldn't be stealing  
  
[Chorus]  
Smother me with those eyes Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes, yeah  
Promise me they don't lie they don't lie  
They don't lie  
Smother me with those eyes Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes, yeah  
Cover me once or twice Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes  
  
We fell into it baby  
This mood is like a dream  
The night we've waited for so long it seems  
Has come, to make us crazy, and we got  
No place to hide  
Heroes and virgins baby  
Life gets so urgent baby  
Being your friend has been very nice  
But I don't want to be after tonight  
The moon is giving us its perfect light  
The radio's beating  
And the words keep repeating  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby I'll stay devoted to you dedicated  
Next to you I just want to be with you baby  
Maybe I'll stay devoted to you dedicated  
Next to you I just want to be with you baby  
  
[Chorus]
