[Verse 1:]  
Yeah the lady and me both agree some days we just don't get along  
But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we both just better off  
Well the preacher believes that I'll meet all of these demons hanging on  
But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Hanging here by a thread  
Hear a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said "In case you hadn't noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore"  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Now the wagon I'm in's paper thin  
I think one wheel's coming off  
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?  
So kind of you to help me out  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Hanging here by a thread  
Hear a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said "In case you hadn't noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore"  
  
[Bridge x2:]  
Fall from grace, kingdom come  
Lying face down in the mud  
Please don't hate, look don't judge  
For I know not just what I've done  
  
[Refrain:]  
Lying face down in the mud  
For I know not just what I've done  
For I know not just what I've done  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said "In case you hadn't noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore"
