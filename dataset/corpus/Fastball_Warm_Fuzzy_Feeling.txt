I got a warm fuzzy feeling  
When I saw you on t.v.  
You were wearing a piece of me  
And it breaks my heart to look around  
And see the unimpressed  
Who can't believe the emperor is dressed  
  
Turn on my t.v.  
I want to check some action  
If you got no video  
Well then folks don't want to know  
But with you up there to light the way  
I can wear a smile as I survey  
The faces in the dark  
  
Waiting for you to hit one out of the park  
We notice every tiny little detail  
And every word we read we'll take to heart  
But we never really understand  
  
Until you realize  
There are no lies  
When you see that look in their eyes  
what are we gonna use to fill the empty spaces?  
  
When you see her in the crowd  
Will you make your mama proud?  
She can turn around and see the faces  
  
Looking at her son  
Climbing his way up to number one  
Scratching his way up to number one
