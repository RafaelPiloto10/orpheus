If you knew that you would die today  
If you saw the face of God and Love  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you knew that love can break your heart  
When you're down so low you cannot fall  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
  
[Chorus]  
How bad how good does it need to get?  
How many losses how much regret?  
What chain reaction  
What cause and effect  
Makes you turn around  
Makes you try to explain  
Makes you forgive and forget  
Makes you change  
Makes you change  
  
If you knew that you would be alone  
Knowing right being wrong  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you knew that you would find a truth  
That brings a pain that can't be soothed  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Are you so upright you can't be bent  
if it comes to blows  
Are you so sure you won't be crawling  
If not for the good why risk falling  
Why risk falling  
  
If everything you think you know  
Makes your life unbearable  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
If you'd broken every rule and vow  
And hard times come to bring you down  
Would you change?  
Would you change?  
  
If you knew that you would die today  
If you saw the face of God and Love  
Would you change?  
Would you change?
