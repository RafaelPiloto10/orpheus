Stephanie says  
That she wants to know  
Why she's given half her life,  
To people she hates now  
  
Stephanie says  
When answering the phone  
What country shall I say  
Is calling from across the world  
  
But she's not afraid to die,  
The people all call her Alaska  
Between worlds so the people ask her  
Cause it's all in her mind  
It's all in her mind  
  
Stephanie says  
That she wants to know  
Why it is though she's the door  
She can't be the room  
  
Stephanie says  
But doesn't hang up the phone  
What sea shell she is calling  
From across the world  
  
But she's not afraid to die,  
The people all cal her Alaska  
Between worlds so the people ask her  
Cause it's all in her mind  
It's all in her mind  
  
They're asking  
Is it good or bad  
It's such an icy feeling  
It's so cold in Alaska,  
It's so cold in Alaska,  
It's so cold in Alaska
