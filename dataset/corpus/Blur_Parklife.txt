Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur  
Of what is known as  
(Parklife)  
And morning soup can be avoided  
If you take a route straight through what is known as  
(Parklife)  
  
John's got brewers croop he gets intimidated  
By the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of him  
(Parklife)  
Who's that gut lord marching?  
You should cut down on your porklife mate, get some exercise  
  
All the people  
So many people  
They all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their parklife  
Know what I mean?  
  
I get up when I want except on Wednesdays  
When I get rudely awakened by the dustman  
(Parklife)  
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea  
And I think about leaving the house  
(Parklife)  
  
I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too  
It gives me a sense of enormous well-being  
(Parklife)  
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day safe in the knowledge  
There will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife  
  
Parklife  
(Parklife)  
Parklife  
(Parklife)  
  
It's got nothing to do with  
Vorsprung durch technique you know  
(Parklife)  
And it's not about you joggers  
Who go round and round and round  
(Parklife)  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife  
  
All the people  
So many people  
And they all go hand in hand  
Hand in hand through their Parklife
