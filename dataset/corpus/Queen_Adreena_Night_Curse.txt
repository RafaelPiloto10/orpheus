Careening crazy and awaked  
Night spark make her escape  
Spinning sick on the whack of a wheel  
  
Headlamp flashing close by  
Banging eyes  
Fireflies  
Drip in burst  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
Have I drunk my brain away?  
Has he shouted my thinking out?  
Well here I am still thinking just entirely devoid of  
Anything  
That I would consider of worth  
Just a ghost on this earth  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You do, do you?  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You don't, do you?  
  
There is a fist around a brittle stem  
Shake a fine dust off my tongue  
I hear the shriek of a molecule  
As she gets sucked and lacerated through a filter of  
You  
  
Headlamp flashing close by  
Banging eyes  
Fireflies  
Drip in burst  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You do, do you?  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You don't, do you?  
  
Careening crazy and awaked  
Night spark make her escape  
Spinning sick on the whack of a wheel  
Headlamp flashing close by  
Banging eyes  
Fireflies  
Drip in burst  
'Gainst the keening lean  
Of my night curse  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You do, do you?  
  
No I don't know what to do  
Do you know what to do?  
I don't know what to do  
You don't, do you?  
You don't, do you?  
You don't, do you?
