[Chorus]  
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family  
Fighting these precious in my life  
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammy's  
But these streets won't say a goodbye  
  
I can't say goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the hood goodbye  
To the streets (to my problems)  
  
I can't say goodbye  
To the hood  
Goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the streets  
I can't say goodbye goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the streets  
Goodbye  
To the hood  
I can't say goodbye  
To the hood  
Goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the homies  
  
[Verse 1]  
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy  
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy  
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy  
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy,  
Let them do them take care of your own boy"  
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy  
You had dreams of being a dope boy  
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po  
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'  
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,  
Pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first  
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church  
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st  
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse  
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
To the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made me,  
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me  
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,  
But if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,  
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted  
To the life, you just don't OD, I don't owe shit to the streets before they
owe me  
Took me in when my moma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops  
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man  
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams and what not  
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not shit, you think I forgot,
man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Thank good every day that the boy could spit  
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit  
I know I got plenty more wars to get  
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids  
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit  
They made me how I am, the music in the man  
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn  
If it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan  
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand  
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man  
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand  
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans  
Wrapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins  
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids  
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name  
Would live... In the streets  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just can't say goodbye  
  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I can't say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
You can take the man out the streets,  
But you can't take the streets out the man
