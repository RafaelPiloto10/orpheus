Here I am, on the lam ready to go  
Brighter days have hurried me along, nobody's wrong  
Love stays the same a heart's not to blame nothing is over  
Now it don't worry me at all there's just got to be  
Some kind of overflow nobody falls  
People, we cry, when wells go dry it threatens tomorrow  
Try and find some ways to ease the fright burn into the night  
But maybe a little rain would soothe the pain and drown our sorrows  
And looking straight at all that lives again  
Until we get our fill of overflows, nobody knows  
In search of love, the seasons above have taken to wander  
Unlike the ones we used to know, where did they go?  
Well, here I am, on the lam, low overflow  
Brighter days have hurried me along  
To see the rain come shinning through, nobody's blue  
Oh seagull, tis an hour of plight  
Energy from your wing helps bring the rain  
Call on your brotherhood of flight and let it rain all nights  
Oh sky lookin clear and bright, Moon, with your own true light  
Turn the tides and rain all night, Turn the tides and rain all night
