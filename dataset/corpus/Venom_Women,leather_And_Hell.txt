Stand aside, loose your pride  
I'm at the gates alone  
Sourcery, blasphemy  
All welcome in my home  
I'm leaving  
But soon I'm coming back  
Believe me  
I'm hot on your tracks  
Through the night  
Eagles flight  
The Angels kiss my brow  
Tempting me with studded heels  
The bitch is in heat now  
Oh you've got me  
That leather smells so sweet  
I'm on fire  
Breeding sin, breathing lust  
Witches spell ohhh...  
Women Leather and Hell  
Go for it  
Come on turn that mother up  
Dynamite, is right on time  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Destiny won't catch me  
The choice of death is mine  
Salvation is keeping out of sight  
Damnation is joining in the fight
