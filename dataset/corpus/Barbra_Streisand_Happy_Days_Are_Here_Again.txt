So long sad times  
Go long bad times  
We are rid of you at last  
Howdy gay times  
Cloudy gray times  
You are now a thing of the past  
  
Happy days are here again  
The skies above are clear again  
So let's sing a song of cheer again  
Happy days are here again  
  
Altogether shout it now  
There's no one  
Who can doubt it now  
So let's tell the world about it now  
Happy days are here again  
  
Your cares and troubles are gone  
There'll be no more from now on  
From now on...  
  
Happy days are here again  
The skies above are clear again  
So, let's sing a song of cheer again  
Happy times  
Happy nights  
Happy days  
Are here again!
