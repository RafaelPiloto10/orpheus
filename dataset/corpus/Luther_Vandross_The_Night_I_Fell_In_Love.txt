I keep going over it and over it again in my mind  
I get these flashbacks and I feel so good  
This is one night that I'll never forget  
You see, it was just like in the movies  
I mean, it actually happened just like this...  
  
The stars were shining brighter than most of the time  
Then love came out of nowhere  
  
No thrill will ever be like  
(The night that I fell in love)  
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night  
(The night when I fell in love)  
The stars' lights were in your eyes  
(The night that I fell in love) with you  
  
I've known so many people, been to most parts of the world  
And seen some things that have blown my mind, but...  
  
I thought I would be happy without any love in my world  
But now I know that , that is so untrue
