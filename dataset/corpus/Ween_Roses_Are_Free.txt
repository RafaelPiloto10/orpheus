Take a piece of tinsel and put it on the tree  
Cut a slab of melon and pretend that you still love me  
Carve out a pumpkin and rely on your destiny  
Get in your car and cruise the land of the brave and the free  
  
But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free  
  
Tke a wrinkled raisin, and do with it what you will  
Push it into third if you know you're gonna climb a hill  
Eat plenty of lasagna 'til you know that you've had your fill  
Resist all the urges that make you want to go out and kill  
  
But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Throw that pumpkin at the tree  
Unless you think that pumpkin holds your destiny  
Cast it off into the sea, bake that pie and eat it with me
