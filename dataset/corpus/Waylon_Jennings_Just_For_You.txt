Do you ever think about the one who thinks about you  
Do you ever wonder dear why he's always waiting here for you  
in spite of all the things you've said and done I'm a fool and you're the only
one  
I'll keep waiting while you'll have your fun just for you  
Can't you see you're a part of me and everything I do  
And every dream I dream is just for you  
Do you ever think about the one who thinks about you  
Do you ever wonder dear why he's always waiting here for you  
It makes no difference what you do or say I'll be waiting here the same old
way  
Living every moment of each day just for you  
[ guitar ]  
It makes no difference what you do or say I'll be waiting here the same old
way  
Living every moment of each day just for you just for you mhm just for you
