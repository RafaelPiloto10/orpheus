  
  
  
  
I'll give the world to make you mine  
  
'Cause I can't go on without you this time  
  
What are you doing tonight baby?  
  
Lets make tonight special  
  
All I'm asking for is a little word  
  
I look in your eyes  
  
(And) baby i see  
  
You are the only one i ever need  
  
Right from the start you were  
  
There in my heart and soul  
  
Cause baby tonight  
  
we'll make it right  
  
we'll light some candlelight  
  
make it all right  
  
cause I can't go on without you this time..(this time)  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
So lets make tonight special  
  
Something beautiful that  
  
We'll always treasure  
  
Lets make tonight so right  
  
We will make it a night to remember  
  
All our lives  
  
  
Baby tonight  
  
I hold you tight  
  
We will be close by the fireside  
  
Baby I know  
  
So strong, baby strong  
  
The stars shine so bright  
  
The moon and the sky  
  
With you means more than life  
  
Since i met you  
  
My heart has been true to you  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
So lets make tonight special..
