[Chorus]  
Gonna go down fightin'  
Gonna go down fightin'  
Cause I know that I'm right and  
I'm gonna go down fightin' for your love  
  
Well I know what your thinkin'  
You got me up against the wall  
But the higher that your flyin'  
The further down you gotta fall  
Now don't you be fooled by my shakin' knees  
Cause I can fight dirty and when I'm scared  
I get mean  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know you're thinkin'  
That the odds is on your side  
But the first thing you gotta learn is  
That it just don't come down to size  
I can see the seeds of doubt  
Begin to grow on your face  
If you want to back down now  
You know that's no disgrace
