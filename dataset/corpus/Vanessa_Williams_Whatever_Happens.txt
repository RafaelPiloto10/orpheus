Whatever happens  
We left some love along the way  
But it ain't reserved  
We'll think of some words of love to say  
And we'll smile oh and be happy anyway  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight  
  
And whatever happens  
There'll be some times along the way  
When it isn't easy  
There just can't be sunshine on every day  
We'll smile oh and be happy anyway  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight  
  
I've got you in my life  
Together we can reach a higher ground  
We'll be alright  
Just as long as you're around  
I won't let you down  
  
Whatever happens  
  
There'll be some good times and some bad  
But it ain't easy  
Let's just remember the good times that we had  
And we'll smile oh and be happy anyway  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight yeah  
And we'll kiss before we say goodnight
