We have a random on the west side  
Personality malfunction  
He says I can't give you anything at all  
Just a room with a bad view of you  
  
He sent a letter to a downstat  
Saying sorry that I missed you  
But I can't think of anything to do  
He's addicted to the time track  
  
Oo-oo-oo, we have a technical (x2)  
  
He's in the hotel where they all go  
Saying me, I've lost my memory  
It's so surprising just how quickly things can end  
Like a hero on a platform of friends  
  
This table is so crowded  
With people that I don't know  
And I never really turn my thoughts on you  
So the image breaks down again  
  
Oo-oo-oo, we have a technical (x2)  
  
I suppose it's very shady  
At least until the lights go out  
Advertising posters on the wall  
And the young ones singing softly  
  
Do they ever come back (do they ever come back)  
Or is it always at the wrong time (is it always at the wrong time)  
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real  
And move a hand in front of my eyes  
  
Oo-oo-oo, we have a technical (x6)
