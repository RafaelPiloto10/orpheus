Well I have known you  
Since you were a small boy  
And your mama used to say  
"My boy is gonna grow up and be  
Some kind of leader some day"  
  
Then you'd turn on the radio  
And sing with the singer in the band  
Your mama would say to you  
"This isn't exactly what we had planned"  
  
But you're a legend in your own time  
A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.  
  
And though I know you  
Still have the heart of that small boy  
Well, you lend it out far too much  
And no one woman loving you  
Can ever feel that she's been really touched.  
  
Then you turn on the radio  
And sing with the singer in the band  
Think kind of sadly to yourself  
This isn't exactly what you had planned.  
  
But you're a legend in your own time  
A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.  
  
Well a legend's only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone.
