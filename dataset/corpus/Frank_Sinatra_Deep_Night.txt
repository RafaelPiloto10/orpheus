Deep night, stars in the sky above  
Moonlight, lighting our place of love  
Night winds seem to have gone to rest  
Two eyes, brightly with love are gleaming  
  
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own  
Vow that you'll love me always, be mine alone  
Deep night, whispering trees above  
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer  
  
Deep night, deep in the arms of love  
Come to my arms, my darling, my sweetheart, my own  
Vow that you'll love me always, and be mine alone  
Deep night, whispering trees above  
  
Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer  
Deep night, deep in the arms of love
