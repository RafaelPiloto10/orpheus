I sing of power, magick and faith  
A sonnet of pure victory  
A hymn to the spirits of freedom and grace  
And whichever gods there may be  
Manacled, beaten, blackened and burned  
Cast from the light of the goal  
I'll never falter, stumble or kneel  
Thanks to the strength of my soul  
  
Lashed by the winds of fate  
Stung by the gods of hate  
I'm rising in power, I'm rising unchained  
Call this a sacred vow  
All that I tell you now  
I may be bloody, but I am unbowed  
I am power  
  
Harken the hour, season and day  
Phantom of dark misery  
Summon your demons, hunger and hate  
Spirit of impurity  
Ravaged by fire, stripped and enslaved  
Torn from the world that I know  
I'll never cry out, buckle or kneel  
I am the king of my soul  
  
Stung by the gods of wrath  
Blinded by circumstance  
I'm rising in power, I'm rising unchained  
All that I tell you now  
Sure as a sacred vow  
I may be bloody, but I am unbowed  
  
Die, fall on your sword, fall on your knees  
Die like your son nailed to his tree  
Die by my hand, die by my sword  
Right on this site, vultures defile  
  
Die, fall on your sword, fall on your knees  
Die in the sun nailed to these trees  
Die by my hand, die in my heart  
Flung from the heights, forever fall  
  
I sing of power, magick and might  
A sonnet of pure victory  
A hymn to the fearless, the savage, the brave  
The spirit of our liberty  
Total my debts, tally my sins, charge each offence on my scroll  
I'll never alter the course of my steele, I am the king of my soul  
  
Lashed by the winds of fate  
Stung by the gods of hate  
I'm rising in power through murdering rain  
Stronger than faith allows  
Braver than hero's vows  
My head is bloody, but I am unbowed  
I am power  
Power
