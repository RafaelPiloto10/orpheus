There ain't nothin' in the world that I like better  
Than bacon 'n lettuce 'n home grown tomatoes  
Up in the morning, out in the garden  
Get you a ripe one, don't get a hard 'un  
  
Plant 'em in the spring, eat 'em in the summer  
All winter without 'em is a culinary bummer  
I forget all about the sweatin' and the diggin'  
Every time I go out and pick me a big 'un  
  
Home grown tomatoes, home grown tomatoes  
What'd life be without home grown tomatoes  
Only two things that money can't buy  
That's true love and home grown tomatoes  
  
You can go out and eat an that's for sure  
But there's nothin' a home grown tomato won't cure  
Put 'em in a salad put 'em in a stew  
You can make your own very own tomato juice  
  
You can eat 'em with eggs, eat 'em with gravy  
You can eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy  
Put 'em on the side, put 'em in the middle  
Home grown tomato on a hot cake griddle  
  
Home grown tomatoes, home grown tomatoes  
What'd life be without home grown tomatoes  
Only two things that money can't buy  
That's true love and home grown tomatoes  
  
If I's to change this life I lead  
You could call me Johnny Tomato seed  
'Cause I know what this country needs  
Home grown tomatoes in every yard you see  
  
When I die don't bury me  
In a box in a cold dark cemetery  
Out in the garden would be much better  
'Cause I could be pushin' up a home grown tomatoes  
  
Home grown tomatoes, home grown tomatoes  
What'd life be without home grown tomatoes  
Only two things that money can't buy  
That's true love and home grown tomatoes
