At my door the leaves are falling  
The cold wild wind will come  
Sweethearts walk by together  
And I still miss someone  
  
I go out to wild the parties  
And look for a little fun  
But I find the darkened corner  
'Cause I still miss someone  
  
Though I never got over those blue eyes  
I see them everywhere  
I miss those arms that held me  
When all the love was there  
I wonder if she's sorry for  
For leaving what we had begun  
There's someone for me somewhere  
And I still miss someone  
  
Though I never got over those blue eyes  
I see them everywhere  
I miss those arms that held me  
When all the love was there  
I wonder if she's sorry for  
For leaving what we had begun  
There's someone for me somewhere  
And I still miss someone
