Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night,  
Tonight there will be no morning star  
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight.  
And for us, stars will stop where they are.  
  
Today the minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light  
  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight  
  
Today, the world was just an address  
A place for me to live in  
No better than alright  
  
But here you are,  
and what was just a world is a star  
Tonight
