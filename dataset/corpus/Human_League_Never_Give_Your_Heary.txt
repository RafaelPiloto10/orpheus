Never give your heart:  
  
Baby baby don't you hurt me  
Don't you say you've got to go  
Don't you threaten to desert me  
Is it something I should know?  
First you tell me it's the real thing  
Then you say you just don't know  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never tell yourself that you'll make them stay  
Put away your heart for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
  
All the heartache that we've been through  
That means nothing to you now?  
You can't come up with a reason  
Can't explain it anyhow  
Only leave me with a meaning  
I'm not asking for your vow  
So nice  
So fine  
One day going to make you mine  
Some day  
Could be  
You'll know what you mean to me  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
There's nothing you can do that will make them stay  
Stop them moving on, on another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
  
Save a little love  
Save a little love  
Save a little love  
For a rainy day  
Save a little love  
Ha ha  
  
So nice  
So fine  
One day maybe make you mine  
Some day  
We'll see  
You'll know what you mean to me  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Passing like a kiss on a holiday  
Save a little love for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
There's nothing you can do that will make them stay  
Stop them moving on, on another day  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never tell yourself that you'll make them stay  
Put away your heart for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway
