Loving me to you seems such a bother you made it so easy for me to love
another  
So don't you blame her for stealing me you let her  
Cause where your love stopped she went a little bit farther  
Why you changed so much I was more at ease with a stranger  
And it wasn't so hard our love was already in danger  
Now she does everything that pleases me that you never  
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther  
She went a little bit farther just to make me feel love  
She considered my feelings now she's all that I'm thinking of  
So don't blame her for stealing me you know you let her  
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther  
  
Yeah where your love stopped she went a little bit farther
