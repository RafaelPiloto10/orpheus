(Hillary Lindsey)  
  
Show me your shadows  
Let down the guard that you hold so high  
Come all unraveled  
Give me the pieces you always hide  
  
I will not judge you  
I will not run  
When you let me see you come undone  
Uncover your secrets  
Give me your trust  
Oh, my love is strong enough  
For your shadows  
  
I don't know what haunts you, baby  
The ghosts that you fight with the lone at night  
The fears that confront you  
I wanna see you from every side  
  
I will not judge you  
I will not run  
When you let me see you come undone  
Uncover your secrets  
Give me your trusts  
Oh, my love is strong enough  
For your shadows  
  
Let me lie down in your dreams  
Let me see and touch everything  
Everything  
  
Walk me through your shadows  
  
I will not judge you  
I will not run  
When you let me see you come undone  
Uncover your secrets  
Give me your trust  
Oh, my love, my love is strong enough  
For your shadows
