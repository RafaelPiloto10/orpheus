You're not the girl you think you are, no no  
They're not his shoes under your bed, yeah yeah  
He'll take you places in his car  
That you won't forget, no  
  
All the people that you know, yeah  
Will turn their heads as you go by  
But you'll be hard to recognise  
With the top down and the wind blowing, blowing  
  
He won't deceive you but tell you the truth  
Woman, he'll be no trouble  
  
He won't write you letters full of excuses  
C'mon, I believe you have one in a million  
  
You're not the girl you think you are, yeah  
There's someone standing in your place  
The bathroom mirror makes you look tall,  
But it's all in your head, in your head  
  
He won't deceive you he'll tell you the truth  
Woman, he'll be no trouble  
  
He won't write you letters full of excuses  
C'mon, I believe you have one in a million  
  
He won't deceive you but tell you the truth  
C'mon, I believe you have one  
You're not the girl you think you are  
C'mon I believe you have one  
You're not the girl you think you are  
C'mon I believe you have one  
You're not the girl you think you are
