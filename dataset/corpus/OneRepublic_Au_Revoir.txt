Today I'm not myself  
And you, you're someone else  
And all these rules don't fit  
And all that starts can quit  
  
What a peculiar state, we're in  
What a peculiar state, we're in  
  
Let's play a game  
Where all of the lives we lead  
Could change  
Let's play a game  
Where nothing that we can see  
The same  
  
But we'll find other pieces to the puzzles  
Slippin' out under the locks  
I could show you how many moves to checkmate right now  
We could take apart this life we're building  
And pack it up inside a box  
All that really matters is we're doing it right now  
Right now
