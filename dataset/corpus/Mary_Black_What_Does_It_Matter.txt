What does it matter if the sun don't rise  
It's midnight forever in my Jimmy's eyes  
What should it matter if it comes on to spring  
When I'm finding winter in everything  
  
Lived in this cold wind city all of my life  
Walking around still looks the same  
Same people coming and going  
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - From so far away  
  
All of the wisdom that I held so high  
Shining and useless as this April sky  
The hedgerows are singing and it comes on spring  
But I'm finding winter in everything  
  
Lived in this cold wind city all of my life  
Walking around still looks the same  
Same people coming and going  
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - From so far away  
  
So what should it matter if the earth may slide  
Sky break in pieces or the stars collide  
The little of sense left in this world or ours  
My Jimmy took with him in the wee small hours  
  
Lived in this cold wind city all of my life  
Walking around still looks the same  
Same people coming and going  
It doesn't feel right - See it all now - It's so far away  
  
I'm finding winter in everything  
I'm finding winter in everything
