If you can keep your head  
While all about you  
People are losing theirs and blaming you  
If you can trust yourself  
When everybody doubts you  
And make allowance for their doubting too.  
  
If you can wait  
And not get tired of waiting  
And when lied about  
Stand tall  
Don't deal in lies  
And when hated  
Don't give in to hating back  
Don't need to look so good  
Don't need to talk too wise.  
  
If you can dream  
And not make dreams your master  
If you can think  
And not make intellect your game  
If you can meet  
With triumph and disaster  
And treat those two imposters just the same  
  
If you can force your heart  
And nerve and sinew  
To serve you  
After all of them are gone  
And so hold on  
When there is nothing in you  
Nothing but the will  
That's telling you to hold on!  
Hold on!  
  
If you can bear to hear  
The truth you've spoken  
Twisted and misconstrued  
By some smug fool  
Or watch your life's work  
Torn apart and broken down  
And still stoop to build again  
With worn out tools.  
  
If you can draw a crowd  
And keep your virtue  
Or walk with Kings  
And keep the common touch  
If neither enemies nor loving friends  
Can hurt you  
If everybody counts with you  
But none too much.  
  
If you can fill the journey  
Of a minute  
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight  
Then  
The Earth is yours  
And Everything that's in it  
But more than that  
I know  
You'll be alright  
You'll be alright.  
  
Cause you've got the fight  
You've got the insight  
You've got the fight  
You've got the insight
