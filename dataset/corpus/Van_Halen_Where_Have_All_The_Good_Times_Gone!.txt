All my life I've never stopped to worry 'bout a thing,  
Open up and shout it out,an' never try to sing,  
Wondering if I've done it wrong,  
Will this depression last for long,won't you tell me,  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same,  
Time was on our side and we had everything to gain,  
This could be like yesterday,  
Is this me with your happy days,  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Ma and pa look back on all the things they used to do,  
Never had no money and they always told the truth,  
Daddy didn't need no little toys,  
Mommy didn't need no little boys,won't you tell me,  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Ow!  
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play,  
Ah but then lets face it,things are easier today,  
Yes you need some bringing down,  
Get your feet back on the ground,  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.  
Where have all the good times gone.
