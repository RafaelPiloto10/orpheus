I coulda swore her hair was made of rayon  
She wore a Milton Bradley Crayon  
But she was something I could lay on  
Can't remember what became of me . . .  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
She put a Doobie Brothers tape on  
I had a Roger Daitrey cape on  
There was a bed I dumped her shape on  
Can't remember what became of me . . .  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
Somewhat later on  
I woke up and she was gone  
There was dew out on the lawn  
In the sunrise  
Later she came back  
With a rumpled paper sack  
Which she told me would contain  
A surprise  
  
She stuck her hand right in it to the bottom  
Said she knew I'd be surprised she got'em  
Take a Charleston pimp to spot 'em  
Then she gave a pair of shoes to me ...  
Plastic leather, 14 Triple D  
  
I said: I wonder what's the shoes for  
She told me: Don't you worry no more  
And got right down there on the tile floor:  
Now Darling STOMP ALL OVER ME! ...  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy  
  
Is this something new  
Having people stomp on you?  
Is it what I need to do  
For your pleasure?  
What is this, a quiz?  
Don't you worry what it is  
It is merely just a moment  
I can treasure  
  
By ten o'clock her arms and legs were rendered  
She couldn't talk 'cause her mouth had been extendered  
Looked to me as though she had been blendered  
But was this abject misery?  
No! No!  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy!  
  
It might seem strange to Herb and Dee -  
Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy!
