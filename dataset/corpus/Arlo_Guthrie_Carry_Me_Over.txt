There's a tavern up on the roadside, I must be coming into town  
The moon must be in Aries, because the truck ain't slowing down  
Pulled back on the throttle, I've been doing that all day  
Looking ahead for a right-hand turn to carry me away  
There's times for understanding, it don't seem like one of those  
The times are too demanding when you're hanging by your nose  
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me here to pray?  
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise and carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight  
You know I'm feeling just like a riptide and I'm feeling a little scared  
A twisted maze of old highways, nobody has repaired  
It ain't nothing that can't be handled like an actor in a play  
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away  
Now all of your highways, don't mean much to me no more  
I've been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure  
But I still get lost on all of them roads, I can't seems to find my way  
I know there's one out there somewhere to carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight
