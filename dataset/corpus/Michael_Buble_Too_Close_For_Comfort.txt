Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart  
Don't upset your cart when she's so close  
Be soft, be sweet but be discreet  
Don't go off your beat  
  
She's too close for comfort  
Too close, too close for comfort  
Please not again  
Too close, too close  
To know just when to say when  
  
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware  
On your guard, take care  
While there's such temptation  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
She's much too close for comfort now  
  
Too close, too close for comfort  
Please not again  
Too close, too close  
To know just when to say when  
  
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware  
On your guard, take care  
When there's such temptation  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
She's much too close for comfort now  
  
One thing leads to another  
Too late to run for cover  
She's much too close for comfort now  
She's too close, way too close  
She's too close for comfort now
