Guess mine is not the first heart broken,  
My eyes are not the first to cry I'm not the first to know,  
There's just no gettin' over you  
I know I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around  
And wait for you  
But baby can't you see, there's nothin' else  
For me to do I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
But now there's nowhere to hide,  
Since you pushed my love aside I'm out of my head,  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you,  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
My head is saying "fool, forget him",  
My heart is saying "don't let go"  
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
But now there's nowhere to hide,  
Since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you,  
Hopelessly devoted to you
