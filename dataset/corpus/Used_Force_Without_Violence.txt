Our voices still silence  
The plans that we've made  
The dead cannot hear  
All the prayers that we beg  
  
Is there a force without violence  
Is there a catch with no hook  
Believing the lies while they fix all the books  
  
Things will never change  
If we remain the same  
Our hearts call us by name  
  
These walls won't keep us safe  
When they hold us back like barricades  
It's time now to replace these walls  
The walls around our heart  
  
There's no price we won't pay  
And we steal it back just to give it away  
Its time now to replace these walls  
The walls around our hearts  
  
When fear breaks the silence  
The choice has been made  
We're listening now to sounds from the grave  
  
This brave opposition  
Comes naturally  
Being exactly who we're supposed to be  
  
Things will never change  
If we remain the same  
Our hearts call us by name  
  
These walls won't keep us safe  
When they hold us back like barricades  
It's time now to replace these walls  
The walls around our heart  
  
There's no price we won't pay  
And we steal it back just to give it away  
Its time now to replace these walls  
The walls around our hearts  
  
We'll take what we're given  
We'll pay for our freedom  
We'll take what we're given  
We'll pray for our freedom  
  
We'll take what we're given  
We'll pray for our freedom  
We'll take what we're given  
We'll pay for our freedom  
  
These walls won't keep us safe  
When they hold us back like barricades  
It's time now to replace these walls  
The walls around our heart  
  
There's no price we won't pay  
And we steal it back just to give it away  
Its time now to replace these walls  
The walls around our hearts
