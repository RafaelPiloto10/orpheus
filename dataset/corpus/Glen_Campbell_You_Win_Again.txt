(What can I do you win again)  
The news is out all over town that you've been seen out runnin' round  
Now I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again  
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me  
Lord just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again  
  
(What can I do you win again)  
I'm so sorry for your victim now for soon his head like mine will bow  
Oh he'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again  
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame  
But I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again
