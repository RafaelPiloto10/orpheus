Me name Mary Seacole, famous nurse  
To de Crimean boys  
No, me not Florence Nightingale  
Dat mix up, me annoys  
  
Me learn me skills in Jamaica  
Where me mother nursed de sick  
And I tink it might be destiny child  
To be a war medic  
  
If you're coughing  
You should have a drink with it  
If your diet's poor  
You should really tink upon it  
  
If it's cholera,  
Rehydration's best for it  
If it's fever  
Better take some rest for it  
  
Wha-oh-oh, wha-oh-oh  
Wha-oh-oh-oh!  
  
When Crimean War broke out  
Me apply for Florence's crew  
She turn me down because me black  
Yep, weird I know but true  
  
History still says me name  
Cos me not one to moan  
Me ask me friend Thomas Day for help  
And set off on my own  
  
If you need it  
Put a massive plaster on it  
If you're bleeding  
Shouldn't be disaster for it  
  
If your leg broke  
Going to need a plaster on it  
If you're constipated  
Take oil of castor for it  
  
Wha-oh-oh, wha-oh-oh  
Wha-oh-oh-oh!  
  
Once here, in Crimea  
Me became a pioneer  
Me carpenters engineered  
A hotel at the new frontier  
  
Set up on the front line  
In 1855  
Independent woman  
Saving soldiers lives  
  
Welcome to the British Hotel!  
  
Me boarding house became de haunt  
Of de great and good  
Though it wasn't glamourous  
It was built of old bits of wood  
  
Supplied the troops with kits and clothes  
Served both de rich and poor  
Me nursed right upon de battlefield  
While Florence worked far from de war  
  
I'm a nursing lady  
Put a splint on it  
Me see a wounded man  
Better sprint to it  
  
Earned fame from de war  
And my stint in it  
But the Crimean shame  
Is me a skint from it  
  
When de War was done  
Me never have a dime  
Despite the work me do  
Bankruptcy was mine  
  
I'm a fierce lady  
Never fazed by it  
Wrote a book  
And earned funds raised by it  
  
Me hotel  
Men owed their lives to it  
Going down in history  
That's my prize for it!
