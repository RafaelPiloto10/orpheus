On the street of villains taken for a ride  
You can have the devil as a guide  
Crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt  
'Til your nervous system starts to tilt  
  
In a room of mirrors you can see for miles  
But everything that's there is in disguise  
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had  
Is all inside your file the good and the bad  
  
But in the rising sun you can feel your life begin  
Universe at play inside your DNA  
You're a billion years old today  
Oh the rising sun and the place it's coming from  
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue  
Oh the rising sun, Oh the rising sun  
  
Oh the avenue of sinners, I have been employed  
Working there 'til I was near destroyed  
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case  
When I heard the messenger from inner space  
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored  
But he held on to my umbilical cord  
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body mind  
Came out of hiding to become alive  
  
And in the rising sun you can hear your life begin  
And it's hear and there nowhere and everywhere  
Though it's atmosphere is rare  
Oh the rising sun and the place that it's coming from  
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly  
Oh the rising sun, Oh the rising sun  
  
And in the rising sun you can feel your life begin  
Universe at play inside your DNA  
You're a billion years old today  
Oh the rising sun and the place it's coming from  
Is inside of you, now your payment's overdue  
Oh the rising sun
