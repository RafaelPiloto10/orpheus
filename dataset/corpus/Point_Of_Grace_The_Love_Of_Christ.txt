[Chorus]  
How long (how long)  
How wide (how wide)  
Is the love of Christ  
How deep (how deep)  
How high (how high)  
Is the love of Christ  
  
It would take ten thousand lifetimes  
To comprehend, a love with no beginning  
A love that knows no end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More than any heart could measure or ever hold  
His love could fill the oceans  
'Til they overflowed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Higher than the mountains  
Deeper than the ocean  
Farther than the reach of the sky  
Wider than the heavens  
Longer than forever  
Greater is the love of Christ  
  
[Chorus]
