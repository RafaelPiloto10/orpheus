Summer stretching on the grass  
Summer dresses pass  
In the shade of a willow tree  
Creeps a crawling over me  
Over me and over you  
Stuck together with God's glue  
It's going to get stickier too  
It's been a long hot summer  
Let's get undercover  
Don't try too hard to think  
Don't think at all  
I'm not the only one  
Starin' at the sun  
Afraid of what you'd find  
If you took a look inside  
Not just deaf and dumb  
Staring at the sun  
Not the only one  
Who's happy to go blind  
  
There's an insect in your ear  
If you scratch it won't disappear  
It's gonna itch and burn and sting  
Do you want to see what the scratching brings  
Waves that leave me out of reach  
Breaking on your back like a beach  
Will we ever live in peace?  
'Cause those that can't do often have to  
Those that can't do often have to preach  
  
To the ones staring at the sun  
Afraid of what you'd find  
If you took a look inside  
Not just deaf and dumb  
Staring at the sun  
I'm not the only one  
Who's happy to go blind  
  
Intransigence is all around  
Military still in town  
Armour plated suits and ties  
Daddy just won't say goodbye  
Referee won't blow the whistle  
God is good but will he listen  
I'm nearly great  
But there's something I'm missing  
I left in the duty free  
Though you never really belonged to me  
  
You're not the only one  
Starin' at the sun  
Afraid of what you'd find  
If you stepped back inside  
I'm not sucking my thumb  
I'm staring at the sun  
Not the only one  
Who's happy to go blind  
  
Ah ah I  
Ah ah I  
Ah ah I  
Ah ah I
