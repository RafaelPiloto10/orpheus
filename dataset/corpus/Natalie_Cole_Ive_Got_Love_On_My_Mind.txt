I've got love on my mind  
I've got love on my mind  
I've got love on my mind  
  
And there's nothing particular wrong  
It's a feeling I feel inside  
When I woke up early this morning  
It was staring me straight in my eye  
I got there I start to unwind  
In your arms I like to be  
  
Caressing you gently and passionately  
From sunrise to sunset and all through the day  
I've been waiting for your return  
And you know this is where I'll be  
I can say to the world  
I learned only you can satisfy me  
  
I've got love on my mind  
I've got love on my mind  
I've got love on my mind  
  
When you touch me I can't resist  
And you've touched me a thousand times  
When I think of your tender kiss  
Then and there I start to unwind
