Verse 1  
Through her cries for mercy  
She heard their call for death  
She was pleading for her very life  
With every passing breath  
Though she knew that she was guilty  
And the price that she would pay  
But mercy knelt down from the throne  
And washed her guilt away  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Though the story's different  
My guilt was just the same  
For sin had brought it's burden  
And left it's filthy stain  
But in my cry for mercy  
Grace came down from the throne  
Telling me the price was paid  
And through His blood I've been atoned  
  
Chorus  
Now I've been washed  
In the blood  
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb  
All my sin stains of scarlet are now white as snow  
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb  
  
Verse 3  
Sometimes in human weakness  
My mind replays the past  
The pain and tears of yesteryears  
Bring failures rushing back  
Though many times I've failed Him  
And it seems I can't go on  
He reminds me of His precious blood  
That the stain of sin is gone  
  
Bridge  
Unworthy of His sacrifice  
My life was at an end  
But the Lamb of God laid down His life  
So that I could live again
