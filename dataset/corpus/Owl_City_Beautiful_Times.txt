A spark soaring down through the pouring rain  
And restoring life to the lighthouse  
A slow motion wave on the ocean stirs  
My emotion up like a rain cloud  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
  
A cab driver, turned to sky diver  
Then to survivor, dying to break down  
A blood brother, surrogate mother  
Huggin' each other, cryin' their eyes out  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
I'm ecstatic like a drug addict  
Locked in the attic strung out and spellbound  
  
I fought all through the night  
Oh, oh but I made it alive  
The sun's startin' to rise  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
(Lindsey Stirling solo)  
  
A bad feeling burned through the ceiling,  
Leaving my healing hard with a new scar.  
A dead fire rose and rose higher,  
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
We all suffer, but we recover,  
Just to discover life where we all are  
  
I fought all through the night  
Oh, oh but I made it alive  
The sun's startin' to rise  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
This fight of my life is so hard,  
So hard, so hard  
But I'm gonna survive  
Oh, oh these are beautiful times  
  
My heart's burning bad, and it's turning black  
But I'm learning how to be stronger  
And sincerely, I love your dearly,  
Oh, but I'm clearly destined to wander
