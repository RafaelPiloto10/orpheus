Turning around  
Is it everything beautiful  
You hoped it would be  
Does he toy with your fingers now?  
Won't he cater to  
Every last one of your needs?  
  
It's unjust  
I agree  
Feed me a taste of you  
Before I retreat  
  
Are you eager infatually  
Do your bruises speak evidence  
Of all you won't be  
I'll match all your hostility  
Set the tone daily  
But no boundaries decrease  
And then I said, "I agree"  
Are those tears meant for me?  
  
Chorus  
Just hold her hand  
Don't let it go  
Let it slip  
Let it begin  
Just hold her hand  
It's perfectly crazy  
You're perfectly crazy  
Be crazy like me  
  
Do you feel substantial nothingness?  
Is your margin of error  
Costing your life  
Pharmaceutical happiness  
If you knew how bland I made you  
Would you open your eyes  
  
Pureness  
I agree  
How much longer  
Will you be drowning me  
  
Chorus  
  
Right about now I'm  
Standing in the line  
With my face on the track  
And my life is on the line  
I take a deep breath  
Before I get on board  
And I let it go, let it go  
Let it all go  
  
Just hold her hand  
Don't let it go  
Just hold her hand  
It's perfectly crazy  
You're perfectly crazy  
Be crazy like me
