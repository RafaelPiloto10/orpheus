What's the deal with my brain?  
Why am I so obviously insane?  
In a perfect situation  
I let love down the drain.  
There's the pitch, slow and straight.  
All I have to do is swing  
And I'm the hero, but I'm the zero.  
  
Hungry nights, once again  
Now it's getting unbelievable.  
'Cause I could not have it better,  
But I just can't get no play  
From the girls, all around  
As they search the night for someone to hold onto.  
I just pass through  
  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
  
Get your hands off the girl,  
Can't you see that she belongs to me?  
And I don't appreciate this excess company.  
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has  
And so she starts to wander  
Can you blame her?  
  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
  
Tell me there's a logic out there.  
Leading me to better prepare  
For the day that something really special might come.  
Tell me there's some hope for me.  
I don't want to be lonely  
For the rest of my days on the earth.  
  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhh oh Ooohhhhhhhhhh  
Singing  
Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
