(Girl you sure know how to say goodbye)  
You kissed me and you said I was a gentleman to you  
You said I was a person you could trust  
You told me that you love me in a way that couldn't die  
  
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye  
You kissed me in a way you never did when love was right  
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye  
I stood and watched you walk away and I didn't even cry  
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye  
  
You gave me that old pep talk as you cried on my sleeve  
You said that you'd come running day or night  
You said that I could call on you throughout my lonely life  
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye  
You kissed me in a way
