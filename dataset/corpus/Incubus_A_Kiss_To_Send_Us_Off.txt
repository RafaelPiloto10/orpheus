Meet me here  
On November 11th, come alone  
Bring your mouth  
And selective irreverence, we'll both see stars, just  
One more time  
Kiss before the sky falls  
Out from  
This cloud we're hovering on  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
Kill your doubt  
With the coldest of weapons, confidence  
And no more words  
Just the sound of resplendent, tongues colliding  
One more time  
Kiss before the sky falls  
Out from  
This cloud we're hovering on  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
Here I am, there you are  
On a wire connecting our hearts  
There's a string, and it's tied  
To a kite  
There's a storm in the sky  
Now the clouds become electric  
There you are, here I am  
Could I?  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off  
A kiss to send us off
