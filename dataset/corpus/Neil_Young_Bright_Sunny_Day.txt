If you wake up in the morning light  
Something doesn't seem  
Or know is right  
Lay back and let your feeling show  
Come on and let the people know  
Oh, that's the price that you pay  
Oh, that's the price that you pay.  
  
Just?? Money  
Your baby??  
??  
Now come on boys,??  
Oh, that's the price that you pay  
Oh, that's the price that you pay.  
  
Oh, that's the price that you pay  
Oh, that's the price that you pay.  
  
Bad news is just an excuse  
Get down and  
Let yourself keep loose  
Go on and live for tomorrow  
So much spent today in sorrow  
Oh, that's the price that you pay  
Oh, that's the price that you pay.
