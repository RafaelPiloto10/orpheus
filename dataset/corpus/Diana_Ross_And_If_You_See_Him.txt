And if you see him  
Tell him I miss him  
Tell him I feel so bad  
For messing up what we had  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm sorry  
And I regret the day  
I let him walk away  
And I want to be by his side  
And I need his love and pride  
And I need him  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm begging  
I'll do a song and dance  
Just for a second chance  
And if you see him  
Tell him just how I look  
The circles underneath my eyes  
The make up don't seem to hide  
And I stay awake every night  
And I pray that he just might walk in  
And love me  
Walk in and love me  
I miss him more than he'll ever know  
Tell him he was  
My everything  
He was more than just a flame  
And I need him  
I miss him  
And if you see him  
Tell him my fire  
No, it's just won't burn  
Till the day that he returns  
And I want to be by his side  
And I need his love and pride  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm begging
