It's never too hard to find the words  
The words to say to you  
  
You make it so easy just to talk  
The way we talk things through  
You're never too tired to care  
You're never too busy  
Just to be there  
And when I smile my feelings show  
So everybody, everybody knows  
  
[Chorus]  
And everybody knows this love's for sure  
There's no searching anymore  
And no-one never doubts you're mine, I'm yours  
It's the one thing that's for sure  
And everyone we know says all the time  
They wish they had a love like yours and mine  
And everybody knows  
  
Even people in love said I'm a fool  
For loving you too much  
But we were the exception to the rule  
For us it's not enough  
They used to say we're out of touch  
Now everyone wants to like us  
Not afraid to let it show  
So everybody, everybody knows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like yours and mine  
The bridges all divides  
A love to conquer time  
When everybody knows  
  
[Chorus x3]
