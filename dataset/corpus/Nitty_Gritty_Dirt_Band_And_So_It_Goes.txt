A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see  
But like any other house it's only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If there's no love inside it'll soon fall apart.  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust,  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love, so it goes.  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you don't know where you're going, you don't mean a thing  
He would walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
He knows what it means to be a wealthy man.  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Colossus will crumble, bridges will rust,  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love, so it goes.  
  
Worldly treasures will all pass away  
There's just one thing's put here to stay  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust,  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love,  
So it goes, everything but love.
