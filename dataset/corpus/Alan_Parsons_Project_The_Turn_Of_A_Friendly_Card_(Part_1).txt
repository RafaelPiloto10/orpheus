There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chainsAnd a wheel in perpetual
motionAnd they follow the races and pay out the gainsWith no show of an
outward emotion  
And they think it will make their lives easierFor God knows up till now it's
been hardBut the game never ends when your whole world dependsOn the turn of a
friendly cardNo the game never ends when your whole world dependsOn the turn
of a friendly card  
There's a sign in the desert that lies to the westWhere you can't tell the
night from the sunriseAnd not all's the king's horse and all the king's
menHave prevented the fall of the unwise  
For they think it will make their lives easierAnd God knows up till now it's
been hardBut the game never ends when your whole world dependsOn the turn of a
friendly cardNo the game never ends when your whole world dependsOn the turn
of a friendly card  
But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrineAs he enters inside the
cathedral...
