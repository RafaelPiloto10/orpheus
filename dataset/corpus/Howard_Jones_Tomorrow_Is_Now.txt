Tomorrow is, tomorrow is now  
You think the past is behind you  
But baby what's that on your back  
It looks to me like you're draggin' it around  
Like a heavy pack  
  
Now we don't live in the present  
We're to busy hangin' on  
To what's been and gone so it comes again  
Singin' the same old song  
  
Singin' na na-na na na  
Let it go oh oh  
  
Tomorrow is, tomorrow is now  
Tomorrow is, tomorrow is now  
  
What are you going to ask for  
What are you going to create  
It's in you hands to build your own world  
Forget about fate  
  
And I don't need to remind you  
Life is short and life is sweet  
And before you even know it  
Past and future gonna meet  
  
Oh, every day and every way  
Good to go oh oh  
  
Tomorrow is, tomorrow is now [Repeat: x4]  
  
Not much to say  
It's all been said, anyway  
Not much to think about  
Just let go of yesterday  
  
Singin' na na-na na na  
Singin' na na-na na na  
Let it go oh oh  
  
Tomorrow is, tomorrow is now [Repeat: x4]
