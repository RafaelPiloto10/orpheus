If you go, they'll say you're following  
If you don't, then you're too good for them  
If you smile, you must be ignorant  
If you don't, what's your problem  
If you're down, so ungrateful  
And if you're happy, why so selfish?  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
  
[Chorus]  
The one who doesn't quite fit in  
Under dressed under your skin  
Oh a walking disaster  
Every time you try to fly you end up fallin'  
Out of line  
Oh you can't, you can't win no  
  
If you're thin, call it a walkin' disease  
If you're not, they're all screamin' obese  
If you're straight, why aren't you married yet?  
If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?  
If it's wrong, you'll never hit  
If it's right, you'll always miss  
You can't win, no you can't win no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you try you try so hard  
But I swear it on your heart  
And you play you play the game  
But you pay you pay for it  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
  
If you speak, you'll only piss them off  
If you don't, you're another robot  
If you stop, they'll just say you quit  
If you don't, you might lose your shh  
You can't win no, you can't win no  
You can't win no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't win  
  
[Chorus]
