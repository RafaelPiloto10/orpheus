[Intro]  
Aiight boys and girls, gather 'round. Story time. Check this out  
  
[Verse 1]  
I said, "I wish you'd just give it a try  
You've never done it, how you know what you don't like?"  
She said, "Am I not enough for you, is that why?"  
I said, "No, I just think it would be sexy and kinda fly"  
She said, "Well I don't"  
I said, "Well if I let you pick the girl, would that make a difference?"  
She said, "That don't matter cause I just don't think I'm cool with a
threesome"  
  
[Interlude]  
What? Come on. Man you trippin'  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said, "You actin' funny and I don't even know why  
Cause you can't tell me that you don't like girls, don't lie"  
She said, "I can appreciate a pretty face, a nice backside (Oh word)  
But just cause I might find a girl sexy, that does not make me bi"  
I said, "Yes it does"  
She said, "[?] you just wish I was"  
I said, "Why you frontin'?  
Just embrace who you really are  
And you just might enjoy, a threesome"  
  
[Interlude]  
You never know. Got to open up your mind. You only live once, know what I'm
talkin' 'bout? Nah but for real though, you never thought about it? Never?
Aiight  
  
[Verse 3]  
She said, "What if I said I want to bring in another guy?" What! ?  
I just gave her a look like "you done lost your [?] mind"  
She said, "Oh, okay so another girl is fine  
But when I mention another dude you're lookin' like you wanna punch me in the
eye"  
I said, "Don't tempt me"  
She said, "You know that ain't fair"  
I said, "I'm just playin'  
But for real don't no dudes allowed  
Only you, me and she in this threesome"  
She said, "Hold up, when did I agree to this threesome"  
I said, "Just now, and you can't take it back, let's have a threesome"  
She said, "Well I did think about my girl Stephanie before in a threesome"  
I said, "I got her number, I'll call her right now for this threesome"  
  
[Outro]  
She said, "Wait a minute. You got Stephanie's number? When'd you get
Stephanie's number?"  
I said, "Uhhh..."  
The end
