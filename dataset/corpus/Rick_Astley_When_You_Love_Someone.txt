Astley  
I went home for the weekend  
I saw my friends and my family  
I couldn't believe how they'd changed  
They where laughing and crying  
Feeling all the joy in life  
It was so good to feel it too  
And I know just how it feels  
I know just what it means  
(Chorus)  
When you love someone, it feels so right  
When you love someone, they hold you tight  
When you love someone, it feels so good  
When you love someone, it's understood  
A couple having a baby  
Are giving life to the love they feel  
They count the days expectantly  
And they, they know just how it feels  
Yeah they do, and they, they know just what it means  
Just what it means  
(Repeat chorus)  
It's just about time for a change  
It's just about time for me to rearrange  
Just about time for a change  
It's just about time for me to rearrange my life  
(Repeat chorus)
