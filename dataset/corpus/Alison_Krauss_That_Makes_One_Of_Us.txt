You've made up your mind  
We don't want the same thing  
And that we won't change things  
Wishing there were ways  
And there's no use staying together  
Nothing lasts forever  
That's what you say  
  
And that makes one of us not in love  
And that makes one of us who can't give up  
If you can walk away from the life we've made  
Then that makes one of us  
  
I still believe we've got something worth saving  
I keep hoping and praying for another chance  
You've held my heart and your gonna break it  
Cause you want to make it  
A part of your past  
  
And that makes one of us not in love  
And that makes one of us who can't give up  
If you can walk away from the life we've made  
Then that makes one of us  
  
Then that makes one of us
