I can't breathe  
The centipede  
Is choking me  
It's my one-armed monster  
Daylight  
No appetite  
Don't wanna fight  
Cause I'm  
Cause I'm  
Broken depressed fucked up insane  
Smokin depressed wanna see you again  
Broken depressed fucked up  
  
My heart aches  
I need a break  
A clean escape in my pink pajamas  
I'm angel-dusted  
I'm ill-adjusted  
I can't be trusted  
Cause I'm  
Cause I'm  
Broken depressed fucked up insane  
Smokin depressed wanna see you again  
Broken depressed fucked up insane  
  
I can't breathe  
The centipede  
Is killing me  
The furniture's  
Peculiar  
It keeps me company  
  
Broken depressed fucked up insane  
Smokin depressed wanna see you again  
Broken depressed fucked up insane  
Broken depressed fucked up insane
