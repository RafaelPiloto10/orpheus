Regenerate the impoverished souls  
That echo you  
Bleed to feed the masses  
Soup line two times two  
  
They got your picture from the  
Sunday Plain Dealer that listed you  
(Dead)  
  
Forget the story. There's a bounty on  
Your head. They fingered you  
  
Right away. Right away  
Green light. Get a move on  
Right of way, right of way  
Stop sign, put the brakes on  
  
Positive cell regeneration  
Positive cell regeneration  
  
Celebrate the immortal youth  
That wasted you  
Peel the skin back from all the lies  
That blistered you  
  
They hold for ransom  
All the watered down truths  
That splintered your  
(Faith)  
So sell your soul, because you're already  
(Dead)  
They've listed you  
  
To the fields where lesser mice go  
To the fields where men follow  
To the fields where lesser mice go  
To the fields where we all follow
