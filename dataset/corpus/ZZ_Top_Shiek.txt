I met a shiek from Mozambique  
Who led me to the Congo.  
He dreamed to go to Mexico  
And sample a burrito.  
  
My temperature had risen again,  
It must have been a hundred and ten.  
  
Under the oaks I was telling some jokes  
And thinkin' I had it made-  
Gettin' on with the folks, havin' some Coke  
And coolin' off in the shade.  
  
My temperature had risen again,  
And it must have been a hundred and ten.  
  
I took a boat that couldn't float  
To Rio de Janeiro.  
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba  
But I'll be gone tomorrow.  
  
My temperature had risen again,  
It must have been a hundred and ten.
