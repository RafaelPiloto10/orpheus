Moses come ridin' up on a quasar  
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar  
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold  
And I asked him to come in out of the cold.  
  
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent  
His motto is nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent  
He ask me for mercy, I gave him a gun.  
He said these things just got to be done.  
  
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence  
You'd get right to work if you had any sense  
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench.  
  
Gideon come up with his eyes on the floor  
Said "you ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door."  
Moses stood up above his six foot and ten  
Said "you can't close the door when the wall's caved in."  
  
Ask him for water, he poured me some wine  
We finished the bottle and broke into mine.  
You get what you come for, ya ready to go  
Well, it's one in ten thousand that come for the show.  
  
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well  
Mama came quick with the water witch spell  
Well cool clear water well you can't ever tell.  
  
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence  
You'd get right to work if you had any sense  
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench.
