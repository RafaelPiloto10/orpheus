When will realize you're already there?  
So watered down your feelings have turned to mud.  
"Love everybody" is destroying the value of  
All hate has got me nowhere  
  
I know I'm slipping I know I'm slipping I know I'm slipping away  
Oh no it is everything they said it was  
Oh no I am everything they said I was  
When you you get to heaven you will wish you you're in hell  
  
When will you realize you're already here  
You'll think us now that you have crossed over  
Don't pick the scabs or you will never heal  
The world shudders as the worm gets its wings  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it  
When I was a worm, thought I wouldn't get through it
