Why, do we feel, do we hope, do we steal the years  
As long as we're together, for as long as we're together  
We will know.  
  
Why do we give, do we say, will you take my hand  
And live with me forever, if you live with me forever.  
We will know.  
  
Every day and night belongs to us.  
Every step we take will be.  
Just like the moment when this world was made for us,  
Made for you and you for me.  
  
Why are we strong are we weak, are we everything?  
And meant for each other.  
We were meant for each other, that I know.  
  
Every day and night belongs to us.  
Every step we take will be.  
Just like the moment when this world was made for us,  
Made for you and you for me.  
  
Every day and night belongs to us.  
Every step we take will be.  
Just like the moment when this world was made for us,  
Made for you and you for me.  
  
Why do we give?  
Why do we feel?  
Why do we live?
