I want you to know  
He's not coming back  
Look into my mouth  
I'm not coming back  
  
So knives out  
Cut him up  
Don't look down  
Shove it in your mouth  
  
If you'd been a dog  
They would have drowned you at birth  
Look into my mouth  
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth  
  
So knives out  
Cut him up  
Squash his head  
Put him in the pot  
  
I want you to know  
He's not coming back  
His blood is frozen  
Still there is no point letting it go to waste  
  
So knives out  
Catch the mouse  
Squash his head  
Put him in the pot
