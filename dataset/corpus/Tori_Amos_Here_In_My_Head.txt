In my head I found you there  
And running around and following me  
But you don't dare  
But I find that I have, now, more  
Than I ever wanted to  
  
So maybe Thomas Jefferson wasn't born  
In your backyard like you have said and  
Maybe I'm just the horizon you run to when she has left  
You there you are, here in my head and  
Running around and calling me "come back  
I'll show you the roses that brush off the snow and  
Open their petals again and again" and you know that  
Apple green ice cream can melt in your hands I can't so I  
  
Held your hand at the fair and  
Even forgot what time it was  
And even Thomas Jefferson wasn't born  
In your backyard like you have said and  
Maybe I'm just the horizon you run to  
When she has left you and me here alone on the floor  
You're counting my feathers as the bells toll  
You see the bow and belt and the girl from the south all  
Favorites of mine you know then all well  
And spring brings fresh little puddles that makes it all clear makes it all  
Do you know what this is doing to me  
Here in my head.
