So ya  
Thought ya  
Might like to  
Go to the show.  
To feel that warm thrill of confusion,  
That space cadet glow.  
I've got some bad news for you sunshine,  
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel  
And they sent us along as a surrogate band  
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand!  
  
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?  
Get them up against the wall!  
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me,  
Get him up against the wall!  
That one looks Jewish!  
And that one's a coon!  
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?  
There's one smoking a joint,  
And another with spots!  
If I had my way,  
I'd have all of you shot!
