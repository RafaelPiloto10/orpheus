'I feel so strange what's wrong with me'  
You've got a problem that you can't see  
But I've got a feeling that the rumours are true  
I see the girl's go a hook in you  
You carry on believing  
That you can take or leave it  
Now who are you deceiving  
Cause when it's own up time  
She's in the back of you mind  
She's got her hooks in you  
You said you'd never let it happen again  
You spend your money and you're deeper in  
Your fairweather friends call two by two  
To let you know what's wrong with you  
But now your heartbeat's thumpin'  
You watch you nerve ends jumpin'  
Well I can tell yo somethin'  
When it's own up time  
You're gonna toe the line  
She's got her hooks in you  
She's got her hooks in me too.
