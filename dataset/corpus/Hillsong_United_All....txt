Verse 1:  
You're the one who gives me shelter...  
And you're the light that leads me home  
You're the love that gave forever...  
Lord you're all that I know  
Chorus:  
And all that I am... Unto you I surrender...  
Lord there is none like you  
And I know that I stand... In the arms of forever...  
Lord there is none like you  
There is none like you  
Verse 2:  
With the world upon your shoulders...  
Lord you gave your life away  
If the world I know was over...  
I know I'd have life in the price You paid  
Bridge:  
And I will stand... And I will worship You forever... For all You are  
And I will stand... And all to you I will surrender... I'll worship you
forever
