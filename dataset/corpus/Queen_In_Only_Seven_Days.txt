Monday the start of my holiday  
Freedom for just one week  
Feels good to get away ooh  
  
Tuesday I saw her down on the beach  
I stood and watched a while  
And she looked and smiled at me  
  
Wednesday I didn't see her  
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow  
And then on Thursday  
My luck had changed  
She stood there all alone  
I went and asked her name  
I never thought that this could happen to me  
In only seven days  
It would take a hundred or more  
For memories to fade  
  
I wish Friday would last for ever  
I held her close to me  
I couldn't bear to leave her there  
  
Saturday just twenty four hours  
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday  
  
Ooh so sad alone
