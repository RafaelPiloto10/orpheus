You're a tired buckeroo little pal  
You've been ridin' hard all day little pal  
Soon the sandman will be callin'  
As the twilight shadows fall  
And you'll go ridin' down the milky way.  
  
Chorus:  
So lay your curly head upon your pillow  
While your faithful dog stands watching over you  
Close your tired little eyes  
While I croon a lullaby  
And you'll ride the trail to dreamland, buckeroo.  
  
Mr. Moon is shining high up above  
And your eyes they soon will close my little love  
So sweet dreams until the dawn  
When the sandman will be gone  
And a new day then will ghreet you buckeroo.  
  
Chorus:  
So lay your curly head upon your pillow  
While your faithful dog stands watching over you  
Close your tired little eyes  
While I croon a lullaby  
And you'll ride the trail to dreamland, buckeroo...
