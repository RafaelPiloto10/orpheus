Heaven knows why I'm left here in this place  
With the sun up in my eyes  
Symbols of the morning comin' on  
With the love that's got too strong to hold  
If I'd been so much wiser then  
I would have known which path to choose  
Heaven help the lucky one  
Heaven help you  
  
Heard the news come on the radio  
About the loves and the flame  
I'd already heard before  
Baby, two years ago  
  
Say it's too hard to return  
Now it seemed just like a dream  
I saw and already seen it  
On my TV screen  
  
Now I could see all these conflicts goin' on  
Don't you think you could show some thanks  
I just might give you a standin' ovation  
When I'm here and gone
