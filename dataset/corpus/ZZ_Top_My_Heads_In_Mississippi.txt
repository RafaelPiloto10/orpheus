I'm shufflin' through the Texas sand,  
but my head's in Mississippi.  
I'm shufflin' through the Texas sand,  
but my head's in Mississippi.  
The blues has got a hold of me.  
I believe I'm gettin' dizzy.  
  
Help me now  
  
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis,  
Lord, I thought I was in Heaven.  
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis,  
I thought I was in Heaven.  
But I was stumblin' through the parking lot  
of an invisible seven eleven.  
  
What was I doin out there?  
  
Where's my head baby?  
Somewhere in Mississippi.  
  
Last night I saw a cowgirl.  
She was floatin' across the ceiling.  
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl.  
She was floatin' across the ceiling.  
She was mumblin to some howlin' wolf  
about some voodoo healin'.  
  
Mmm Baby
