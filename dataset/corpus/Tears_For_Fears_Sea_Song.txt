You look different every time  
You come from the foam - crested brine  
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight  
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale  
Am I yours? are you mine to play with?  
  
Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific  
When you're drunk I like you mostly late at night  
You're quite alright  
But I can't understand the different you  
In the morning  
When it's time to play at being human for a while  
We smile, we smile, we smile  
  
You'll be different in the spring, I know  
You're a seasonal beast  
Like the Starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide  
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon  
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own  
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own  
My very own  
We're not alone
