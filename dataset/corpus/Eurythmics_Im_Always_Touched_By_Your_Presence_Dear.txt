Was it destiny?  
I don't know yet  
Was it just by chance?  
Could this be kismet?  
Something in my consciousness told me you'd appear  
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear  
When we play at cards you use an extra sense  
It's really not cheating, you know?  
You can read my hand I've got no defence  
When you send your messages, whispered loud and clear  
I'm always touched by your presence dear  
Floating pass the evidence of possibilities  
We could navigate together psychic frequencies  
Coming into contact with outer entities  
We could entertain each one with our theosophies  
Stay awake at night and count your REM's  
When you're talking with your super friends  
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere  
I am still in touch with your presence dear  
I am still in touch with your presence dear
