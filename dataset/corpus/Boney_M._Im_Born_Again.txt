I'm born again, I feel free  
No longer alone  
A bright light is shinning  
And shows me a world that I own  
I can see my way through  
I know I will walk beside you  
All those prayers of mine weren't in vain  
I'm born again  
I'm born again, I feel free  
There's a quite different me  
No longer I'm tossed like a ship  
On an unruly sea  
I've been blessed with a love  
That's meant for the rest of my time  
All those prayers they were not in vain  
I'm born again  
Since love touched my heart right  
My life has a meaning  
I feel I'm no longer drifting in space  
I believe once again that there is a tomorrow  
A brand new tomorrow, I know I can face  
I'm born again, I feel free  
No longer alone  
A bright light is shinning  
And shows me a world that I own  
I can see my way through  
I know I will walk beside you  
All those prayers of mine weren't in vain  
I'm born again  
All those prayers they weren't in vain  
'cause I'm born again
