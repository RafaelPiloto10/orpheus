A shimmer or a shudder, a sentence or a shriek  
What other languages do we speak?  
I don't know what the answer is, but fair dues to you  
A local lack of wisdom never stopped your being true  
A drummer in the basement  
A rhythm - roll at each hand's turn  
Finding one thing you can believe in  
Could seem like so much work  
You've heard the cry before  
Up and away we shall go  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Hurry to dinner, son, the heat is on  
Your daddy's in the oven and your mamma, she's gone  
She went down to the clinic, but the news was not good  
They told her it was nothing much, but she'd had quite enough  
The ruins of a household, a loverboy who sits and stares  
"No, No" she cried, "I can't take it, I'm gonna go out somewhere"  
You've heard the cry before  
Up and away she goes  
She's tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
Now we're really with it, comrades, now we're set  
Ben Dolan's right behind us with the castanets  
It took a lot of pleading, but he came here after all  
And Ben's the very boy to take us right to where we want  
Hey, look at them couples linking through the rainy streets  
Someplace to be in love, the best there'll ever be  
Oh sister sadness, get yourself behind me  
Oh brother badness, why must you deny me?  
It doesn't matter where I've gone  
I'm on the run like everyone  
Tearing up the town  
Tearing up the town  
We're tearing up the town
