Standing on the rooftop  
There's all these people watching  
Hard to find the words  
When you got so far to fall  
Just trying to keep a secret  
And never tell a soul no no  
Take another drink so  
I can loose control  
  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, just want me too  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, just want me  
  
If I was a winner  
I'd cut the cards and deal them  
Buy a great big house where  
We could disappear  
But you find yourself a sweet spot  
And people want to get some  
You're just anther dead man  
Trying to fool the world  
  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, want me too  
I, I want you to  
Tell me that you want me, want me too  
  
I gave you the best of me  
And you said goodbye  
Should have taken the rest of me  
See the morning come up come up  
If you're going out tonight  
Maybe I'll catch you right  
Maybe we'll loose our minds tonight  
And fall until we fly  
  
I, I want you  
Tell me that you want me,want me too  
I, I want you to just  
Tell me that you want me, want me too  
  
I, I want you  
Tell me that you want me,want me too  
I, I want you to just  
Tell me that you want me, want me
