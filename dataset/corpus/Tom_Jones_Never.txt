From the first time that I heard you I knew  
I'd be hooked on you forever like the blues  
People told me you would hurt me, so untrue  
Cos after all these years, you're the one thing thats still here  
Cos of you there's no alone  
You've been with me through it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Never, never, never, never gonna give you up  
Running through my blood  
Never Never Never Never leaving you behind  
Always on my mind  
Can't get enough of your highs and your lows  
You take me places where nobody goes  
And if you went away, I would never be the same  
  
Oh your sweetness is like sugar on my lips  
When you're not around its your melody that I miss  
Like an old friend you come back to me so quick  
And after all this time I've still got you in my life  
You and me we're going strong  
You and me we still belong  
  
[Chorus: x3]
