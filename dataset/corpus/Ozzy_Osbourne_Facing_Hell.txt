You make promise of protection  
To a future after life  
To the final resurrection  
And to eternal paradise  
  
But then I'm blinded with temptation  
And to every mortal sin  
Is it God that sits there waiting?  
Or will the darkness suck me in  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
That I'm facing hell  
  
Oh the children sit and listen  
The belief was in their eyes  
In a land without tomorrows  
Through the night you hear their cries  
  
But then your eyes just skip the pages  
Of a book that never ends  
Is it God that sits there waiting?  
Do you hear the call again?  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
That I'm facing hell  
  
It's just crazy world we live in  
And I'm out of my mind  
You pray tomorrow but your leaving today  
Evil one is coming and he's knocking your door  
Cause today's the day you'll pay  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
  
That I'm facing hell  
That I'm facing hell  
That I'm facing hell  
That I'm facing hell
