(Do right)  
(Do right)  
  
Everytime I say  
Come closer my dear  
I need you to be by my side  
And every night I feel  
You're driftin' away  
Is there something you're trying to hide  
  
I can tell what it means  
That look in your eyes  
'Cause I've seen it before  
And it holds no surprise  
  
(Do me right)  
You've been holding me tight  
But your mind's on the new girl in town  
  
Now you know that you're lying  
And there's no use denying  
'Cause this is the time baby  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop (Hey)  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop  
  
All that I need from you  
Is that comes straight from the heart  
You have to be cruel to be kind  
And if I should lose you now  
I may hurt for a while  
But I'll leave all the sadness behind  
  
Life's not always the way that I want it to be  
But given the choice I would rather be free  
  
(Do me right)  
You've been holding me tight  
But your mind's on the new girl in town  
  
Now you know that you're lying  
So there's no use denying  
This is the time baby  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop (Hey)  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me
