Born again.  
Because have you at just being borne again.  
At last I feel that I'm alive and more.  
This is the moment I've waited for.  
Born to be loved by you.Born to be loved by you.  
Born to walk with you.Born to talk with you.  
I was born for you.  
Born to be with you, only you.  
Born to be loved by you.  
Born for you, born for you baby.  
Born for you, born for you baby.  
Born for you, born to be loved by you  
(you and only you) Born to be with only you.  
I look at you and all at once I know that dreams come true.  
For there you are the other part of me.  
I have found my destiny.  
Born to be loved by you.Born to be loved by you.  
Right or wrong for you.Weak or strong for you.  
Faithful or untrue  
Born chained forever and far beyond.  
Born to be loved by you and only you  
No one else will do.  
Heart and soul,Born to be loved  
Born to be loved.  
Born to be loved by you.  
(you and only you,Born to be with only you)  
Born for you.  
Born for you baby.  
Born for you.  
Born for you baby.  
Born for you, born for you baby...
