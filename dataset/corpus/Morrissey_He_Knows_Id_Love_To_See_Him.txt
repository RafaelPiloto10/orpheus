He knows (he knows)  
Or, I think he does  
'Cause when I lived  
In the arse of the world  
  
He knows, he knows  
He knows I'd love  
To see him happy  
(Or as close as is allowed)  
Oh, 'cause when I lived  
In the arse of the world...  
  
He knows, he knows  
He knows I'd love  
To see him happy  
(Or as close as possible)  
As close as possible  
As close as possible  
As close as is allowed  
  
Oh, my name still conjures up deadly deeds  
And a bad taste in the mouth  
And the police - they actually know me  
They said :  
  
"You're just another person in the world  
You're just another fool with radical views  
You're just another who has maddening views  
You want to turn it on its head  
By staying in bed !"  
  
I said : "I know I do"  
  
He doesn't know...
