Everything around is natural don't fight it  
Don't disagree with this and that, no  
Astrology, evolution, this-and-that-ity  
This religion and that, no  
  
Chorus  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well don't you think they wouldn't be  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well don't you think they wouldn't be, oh  
  
Your beliefs, philosophy, don't give us peace  
Destruction of our enemy does it make us right  
And if you took them apart and destroyed them all now one by one  
This still won't make it work, no  
  
Everything we like and don't like is whole and natural  
I know is doesn't feel like it and the world seems wrong  
But if we don't like it now then who can we blame  
Blame god, be still, find harmony
