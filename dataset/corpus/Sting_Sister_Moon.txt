Sister moon will be my guide  
In your blue blue shadows I would hide  
All good people asleep tonight  
I'm all by myself in your silver light  
I would gaze at your face the whole night through  
I'd go out of my mind but for you  
I'd go out of my mind but for you  
  
Lying in a mother's arms  
The primal root of a woman's charms  
I'm a stranger to the sun  
My eyes are too weak  
How cold is a heart  
When it's warmth that he seeks?  
You watch every night, you don't care what I do  
I'd go out of my mind, but for you  
I'd go out of my mind, but for you  
  
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun  
My hunger for her explains everything I've done  
To howl at the moon the whole night through  
And they really don't care if I do  
I'd go out of my mind for you  
  
Sister moon
