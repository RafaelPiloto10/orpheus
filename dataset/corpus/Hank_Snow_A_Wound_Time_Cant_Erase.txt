Have you found, since you've turned me down,  
The one that you were searching for?  
Are you glad that you made me sad,  
For you know I vowed to love you ever more.  
  
What did you have in mind,  
When you broke this heart of mine?  
Are you laughing in my face?  
Darlin', what can I do,  
When you tell me we are through?  
You've left a wound, time can't erase.  
  
Tell me, dear, are you satisfied,  
To be footloose and fancy free?  
Is it power you want,  
Or the things you have done?  
What you've gained, I guess I'll never see.  
  
What did you have in mind,  
When you broke this heart of mine?  
Are you laughing in my face?  
Darlin', what can I do,  
When you tell me we are through?  
You've left a wound, time can't erase.
