Well, it's getting late, have you seen my mates?  
Tell me when the boys get here  
It's seven o'clock and I got to rock  
Got to get a belly full of beer  
  
Well, my old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys  
And my old lady, she don't care  
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots  
A handful of grease in her hair  
  
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
Well, they're packed pretty tight inside here tonight  
I'm looking for a dolly to see me right  
I can use a little muscle to get what I need  
And have a little drink and shout out, "She's with me"  
  
A couple of the sound that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
I'm a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass  
  
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Night's alright  
  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Night's alright  
  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Night's alright
