I'm on my way to the other side  
I've broken doors and shattered glass  
I've derailed from the joyrider train  
And listened to the sounds of the insane  
I've looked for wisdom every hour  
Searched for decay in every flower  
Ionized all the sacred schemes  
And killed the prophets in my dreams  
  
I've torn james joyce to pieces to make the puzzle fit  
I've looked for secret messages in every little bit  
I've travelled through the craters of despair  
Grabbed the holy signs in every nightmare  
Broke on through to the other side  
Paid the one way fare, paid the one way fare  
  
I'm on my way to the other side, there's nothing I can do about  
I tried to hide behind perfection and starred in mirrors of deception  
There's no escape in any way, nowhere to run, nowhere to stay  
As long as I can't see the light I got to go to the other side  
  
I've torn james joyce to pieces...  
  
I've torn james joyce to pieces to make the puzzle fit  
I've looked for secret messages in every little bit  
I've spoken to the dead, ignorants have called me mad  
I've travelled through the craters of despair  
Grabbed the holy signs of every nightmare  
Conjured up digression, suffered from depression  
Paid the one way fare, paid the one way fare  
  
I'm a missionary man  
I'm a missionary man
