Here I am again  
I feel time is dragging on  
Aren't you getting tired of me?  
Whinging overdrawn  
  
[Chorus]  
Faceless, blind  
Want to take her out again  
She's not just mine  
Want to take her out again  
  
In a bodiless embrace  
Thriving, I have grown  
Fickle, changing, grip replaced  
Choking, take it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dedicated, true to form  
Still the only one  
Only guarantee  
Continue after I am done  
  
[Chorus]
