If a girl isn't pretty  
Like a Miss Atlantic City  
All she gets in life is pity  
And a pat  
Kindly name a star who hasn't  
Won a contest or a pageant  
If she hasn't she just never  
Gets to bat  
She must shine in every detail  
Like a ring, you're buying retail  
Be a standard size that  
Fits a standard dress  
When a girl's incidentals  
Are no bigger than two lentils  
Then to me it doesn't spell  
Success  
Frumpy faces that could cause ya  
To have temporary nausea  
Do I have to hear a lecture  
Such as that?  
Is a nose with deviation  
Such a crime against the nation?  
Should I throw her into jail  
Or drown the cat?  
So she looks a bit off balance  
She possesses golden talents  
Or is that a pill too bitter  
To digest?  
Oh, she's got very nice deportment, hmm  
But when they see that at Ortmund's  
From the gallery they'll be  
Throwing fruit
