(Intro: Gucci Mane)  
I wanna thank God  
For opportunity, success  
Wealth and health  
  
(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)  
My daddy name Gucci, he the Gucci Mane  
Honestly he turned me on to the ice game  
He fed the fam with 3 tops, that's the current game  
Well fuck you, who are you?  
You ain't God mane  
I fell out with my right hand man, he tried to top on me  
I guess it's clear we ain't homies like I think we homies  
I'm at the top and I swear to God, it's really lonely  
But I'm not coming down, no stoopin' down, I keep it movin'  
These young nigga's got no respect who make music  
Broke ass nigga never can get used to it  
And the bottom of some valley don't do it like the top do it  
Roll the crisp we hear ak's more than church music  
  
[Hook:]  
I hit this car, horse on the car, with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin, Gucci chargin' with no problem  
Hit shot dead in the bushes with his head off  
Head cut off, those slick blood knocked off  
Decapitated (Huh?)  
Decapitated  
Decapitated (Bang), bow down  
Decapitated (It's Gucci)  
  
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane)  
I know African's that cut off legs  
Jamaican's that cut off heads (What's up bumbaclot)  
This millionaire still in the feds  
You in the county and you can't get outta jail nigga?  
Damn, that's so sad  
That's so bad  
You played out, jj bad  
Mob ties put a head in your bed (horse head)  
You touch Guwop and they goin' mine and wrap yo head  
I got so much overhead, I gave him diamond bricks instead  
And I chumm without a charm, diamond chain and watch instead  
Team some team  
My grandad in house and I stay next door to Ned  
Cooking dope instead of eggs  
Hundred pt's in my fridge  
  
[Hook:]  
I hit this car, horse on the car, with the top off it  
Topless broads drivin, Gucci chargin' with no problem  
Hit shot dead in the bushes with his head off  
Head cut off, those slick blood knocked off  
Decapitated (Huh?)  
Decapitated  
Decapitated, goddamn  
Decapitated
