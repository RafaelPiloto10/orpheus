Check it out, intro to tha third chapter,  
Which contains most violence to the O. C. Fuzed minds,  
With the transitional rhymes  
That'll bring physiological karma causin drama  
To you and your fuckin baby momma,  
It slides like this,  
  
Don't test me with your gay attitude  
Cuz nigga I aint feelin it  
Who the fuck do you assume your fuckin wit  
Manifest, discovered the G-E-O-are-G-E  
Bootleg crips and bloods trying to pull me down with gravity  
But what ya don't know is that I be fuckin ya'll spinal cord  
Out wit the radius frequency  
I hold a 5. 0 desert eagle and the homie, a double edged samuri sword  
Is what we be strap-a-lin an,  
Lame ass gangs is what we be slash-a-lin and clap-a-lin,  
(dj) fr, fr, erra, raa, erra, fresh out the fuckin boat  
Makin yo momma give us deep throat  
1 stroke she chokes  
Causin you to suffer a heightened awareness  
Outlaws around the corner writing you in our hit list  
Gomez Assasin obliterating all you bitches wit mad fists  
Handle the basic which need you to face it,  
At dark when you be sleepin  
That's when swoon be creepin  
Tearin off your arm like an alley cat  
Hangin you from the back so take that as a personal fact  
If it werent for fag ass laws  
The silent assasins be fuckin murderin yo foo's  
Swoon be readin the 4: 20 biblical verse  
Causing havoc on natures earth  
The only ones bringing killin to ya first  
Sparkin the bowl to burn  
50 caskets for you, tables are turned  
Gibs burst into pieces  
Charged with W-E-E-D  
As a result to your death  
J. B. G slices your body parts til nothings left  
So toon later for chapter four  
If your yearning for fuckin more!
