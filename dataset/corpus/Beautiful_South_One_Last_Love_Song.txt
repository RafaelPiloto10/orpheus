I once had a friend who I loved from my heart  
But I went on and left her 'fore I'd made a start  
Now I'm moaning the blues like the rest of the charts  
Take me back  
  
So I'll cry with a limp  
Just get by on a limb  
Till these blue eyes of mine they are closed  
So here's to an old fashioned peck on the cheek  
And farewell my sweet Northern Rose  
  
Give me one last love song  
To bring you back, bring you back  
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black  
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end  
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend  
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend'  
Let it die, let it die  
  
Those bloody great ballads we hated at first  
Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse  
Save us from baldness and saving the earth  
Take me back  
  
And I'll smile with a limp  
And I'll love with a limp  
Till the clouds disappear from above  
And as the storm moves away all I can say  
Is there's a towel on the door for your love  
  
Give me one last love song  
To bring you back, bring you back  
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black  
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end  
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend  
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend'  
Let it die, let it die, let it die
