You just can't believe me  
When I show you what you mean to me  
You just can't believe me  
When I show you what you cannot see  
  
You're hiding from feelings, searching for more  
Sharing and hoping, untouched for so long  
Our lives still change from the way that we were  
And now I'll tell you something I think you should know  
You just can't believe me  
When I show you what you mean to me  
You just can't believe me  
When I show you what you cannot see  
  
You cause me confusion, you told me you cared  
He's calling these changes that last to the end  
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies  
The past is your present, the future is mine  
You just can't believe me  
When I show you what you mean to me  
You just can't believe me  
When I show you what you cannot see  
  
You tell me you need me, I'll make it this time  
The thread won't divide us, the sensation survives  
I was sure that I told you it was good from the face  
You've caused me some problems, you've taken my place  
  
Why can't you see what you mean to me?
