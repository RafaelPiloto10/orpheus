Slow motion, slow motion baby  
We want our love to last  
Everything's so right, why try to go so fast  
It's easy to lose sight  
And then the moments passed  
  
Go easy, go easy baby  
You know there's time for us  
Even though this world seems to be speeding up  
Maybe we can try to slow things down  
  
Because we need to draw the line  
Because we need to make the time  
Because we need to sip the wine  
  
Because the clock is running,  
And it's going so fast  
The future's coming but it's soon the past  
It's here today and there's no turning back  
  
Go lightly, go lightly baby  
In time we'll find a way  
It's never over 'till it's over  
Why rush it through'  
Never pausing to admire the view  
  
Slow motion, well if we get tired  
Then we can rest awhile  
If we're gonna go, we're gonna go in style  
Isn't that what life is all about
