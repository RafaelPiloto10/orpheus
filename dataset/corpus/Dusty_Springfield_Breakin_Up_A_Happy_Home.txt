If we fuss and we fight  
Why do we have to do it every Saturday night?  
We can act for our friends  
But why can't we face each other when the masquerade ends?  
Well now, I don't know what's happening  
I can't tell just who's to blame  
But two forgiving people  
Could be so in love again  
  
Stop! We're breakin' up a happy home  
Oh darlin'  
Stop! 'Cause I never was much good alone  
Sweet baby  
Oh, don't turn your back and walk away  
Don't do it, no  
Stop! We're breakin' up a happy home, yeah  
  
It's a game no-one wins  
Trying to hurt each other with those needles and pins  
I can't go back, can't go on  
But somehow I know the feeling isn't totally gone  
Oh, there's so much love between us  
That we're so afraid to show  
It's been keeping us together  
But for how long, I don't know  
  
Stop! Yeah, we're breakin' up a happy home  
Oh darlin'  
Stop! I never was much good alone  
Listen baby  
Ooh, don't, no, turn your back and walk away  
Don't do it, oh stop  
Stop! We're breakin' up a happy home, yeah  
  
Ooh  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
Gotta be another way we can try  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
Stop! Stop! Don't break it up  
I don't want to hear you saying goodbye  
Oh baby, sweet baby, ahh, yeah baby, ooh baby
