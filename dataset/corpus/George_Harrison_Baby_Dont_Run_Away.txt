Baby don't run away from me  
Baby don't go  
Baby I'm always thinking of you  
Baby don't run away from my love  
  
You brought me everything I've wanted  
Lady don't go  
How could I ever live without you  
Lady don't run away from my love  
  
Way out there where the ocean is still  
A calm reflection in the sea  
Sat alone with the stars and the moon  
You turned round to me  
And love was in your eyes to see  
That's when it happened to you and me  
  
Baby don't run away from me  
Baby don't go  
Baby I'm always thinking of you  
Baby don't run away from my love  
  
Way back then it was easy to see  
A calm reflection in the sea  
Sitting still and without any cares  
You turned out to be  
A lover who was sure of me  
That's when it happened to you and me  
  
Baby don't run away from me  
Baby don't go  
Baby I'm always thinking of you  
Baby don't run away from my love
