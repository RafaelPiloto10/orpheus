Readymade, Readymade  
Steady as a river flow  
Readymade, Readymade  
And this is how the story goes  
  
I got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona  
Gonna rock it to her mound in the of the moaner  
  
Readymade, Readymade  
Steady as a river flow  
Readymade, Readymade  
And this is how the story goes  
  
And I give to you now, sacred sigh, you got  
And I pray that you are, stay the night, come get in  
  
Readymade, Readymade  
Getting out to celebrate  
Readymade, Readymade  
And now it's time to educate  
  
I got a sister makin' babies with a Black and Decker blowtorch  
Gonna frop it all night in the middle of a black hole  
  
Readymade, Readymade  
Let 'em out to celebrate  
Readymade, Readymade  
And now it's time to educate  
  
And I give to you now, sacred sigh, come get in  
And then I pray that you are, stay the night, you get it  
  
Readymade, Readymade  
Rock it for the circus slave  
Readymade, Readymade  
Tell them now the love to save  
  
I got a brother makin' trouble in the state of California  
Gonna let it all night in the city of Sedona  
  
Readymade, Readymade  
Rock it for the circus slave  
Readymade, Readymade  
Listen you, don't be afraid  
  
And I say to you, sacred sigh, come get in  
And I pray that you are, stay the night, you got it
