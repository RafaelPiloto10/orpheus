A little quiet conversation in the night  
I need my time with you  
It always seems to make  
The day turn out alright  
  
It's easy when I'm here with you  
And when life is hard to understand  
You reach out for the hand  
Of someone who believes in you  
  
And when I'm sure  
I'm not worth anything at all  
I need my time with you  
When we're together,  
  
All those troubles look so small  
When nothing seems real  
Then I need my time with you  
Hard times,  
  
City lights shine all over the sky  
Don't you know in a dog eat dog world  
We need each other to survive  
I got to know if they storm the walls  
  
I'll have you by my side  
I turn the page  
And see another restless day  
I'll need my time with you  
  
I'll keep believing  
Till tomorrow fades away  
Takes only that moment with you  
It's never easy  
  
When you got to keep it going  
And your back's against the wall  
As every dreamer knows,  
It doesn't really matter  
  
If you rise or if you fall  
You can hand it all  
To someone who believes in you  
And cares for you,  
  
And shares that time with you  
I need and I want  
And I love my time with you  
I need my time with you
