A place in time  
Can make the grind  
Fall out when you want to  
Anyplace, anytime  
All the world loves another  
You know you can't find no other  
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Dark at one  
Are you havin' fun  
Come on out with your play toys  
You've got the blues on the run  
All the world loves another  
You know you can't find no other  
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah  
Yes, I'm gonna love you anyway yeah, yeah, yeah  
No, no, no, no  
Feelin' low  
How I loved you so  
Cut out all your teasing  
You may never know  
All the world loves another  
You know you can't find no other  
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah  
Yeah, yes I know  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway
