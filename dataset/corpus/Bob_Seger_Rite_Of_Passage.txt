It's the age of reason for the anarchist  
It's a change of venue for the lobbyist  
It's a dream of justice buried in the grist  
  
It's a secret briefing based on need to know  
It's a condescending rationale from command control  
Feel the sense of wonder at the overthrow  
  
It's a rite of passage through a hurricane  
Through a rolling thunder through a screaming rain  
Hear the shriek of Abel hear the cry of Cain  
  
And Abraham will take his son  
Five billion years from now the cruelty will be done  
  
Make a destination  
Of the greater truth  
Make 'em hang their heads and eat their words  
When you find the proof  
This is all you're given  
It's your only move  
  
It's a rite of passage for the everyman  
To a higher ground  
To a brighter light  
To a promised land  
You can feel the power  
Of the master's hand  
  
It's a rite of passage
