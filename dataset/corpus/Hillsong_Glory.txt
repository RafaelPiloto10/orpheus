[Verse 1:]  
Great is the Lord  
God almighty  
Great is the Lord on high  
The train of His robe  
Fills the temple  
And we cry out  
Highest praise  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Glory to the risen king  
Glory to the Son  
Glorious Son  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lift up your hands  
Open the doors  
Let the king  
Of glory come in  
And forever be our God  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Holy is the Lord  
God almighty  
Holy is the Lord on high  
Let all the earth  
Bow before you  
And crown You Lord of all
