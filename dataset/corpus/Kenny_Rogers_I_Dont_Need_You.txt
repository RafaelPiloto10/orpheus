I don't need you.  
I don't need friendship.  
I don't need flowers in the Spring.  
I don't need you.  
And you surely don't want me.  
  
I don't need love and affection.  
I don't peace and harmony.  
I don't need you.  
And you surely don't need me.  
  
[Chorus]  
But we both want it bad enough.  
Yes, we both want it. Don't we?  
I don't need you baby.  
And I know you don't need me.  
  
I don't need your loving arms around me.  
All I need is to be free.  
That's what I keep telling myself.  
And I tell you, you don't need me.  
  
I don't need children in my old age.  
No more cluttered leaves around the tree.  
And I don't need you baby.  
And I know you don't need me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we don't need each other, baby.  
We don't need each other, baby.  
Or do we?
