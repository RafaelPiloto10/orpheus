I dunno wot she got  
I dunno wot she got  
I dunno what she got but it seems to have a grip upon me  
No telling where she learn the things she do to me  
And I don't know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her  
  
(wanna) take it out on her  
Take it out on her  
Take it out on her  
With my weapon  
  
She's so exacting that she tells me when I go wrong  
She doesn't value the attention she receives  
She says I'm taking all the time but I'm not returning  
(that's right)  
  
'Do this' but she won't do that  
Lying beside me like a parcel of fat  
Hot love - cold sweat - feel her beneath me want to crush her to death  
She tries to justify the people who despise me  
She puts her finger on things she knows will hurt  
And I can't defend myself till we turn the lights off then  
  
I dunno wot she got - my weapon  
My stinking weapon
