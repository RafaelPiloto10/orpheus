It's time to let the lost boys take you in  
It's getting cold out  
You wear yourself down  
So please don't go out  
You're looking dead behind these eyes  
We'll stay at your house  
Watch all those late shows on TV  
I like it best when you're in here with me  
And all the lost boys  
We'd make a picture perfect team  
Bruising sidewalks  
With all the drumming of our feet  
And boy I promise  
We'll never ever let you leave  
Never let you leave
