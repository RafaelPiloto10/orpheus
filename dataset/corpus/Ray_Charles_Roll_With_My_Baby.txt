Went to see my sweetheart  
Last night around about ten  
She said, "Home sweet, Papa"  
Squeeze me every now and then  
  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way  
  
We went out to a movie  
Stop in the very last row  
We hadn't been there a good five minutes  
Before she's ready to go  
  
I had to roll with my baby  
I had to roll with my baby  
I had to roll with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way  
  
I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime  
Can't buy me no whiskey  
I guess I'll have to settle for wine  
And then I can  
  
Roll with my baby  
I know I can roll with my baby  
I'm sure I can roll with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way  
  
She's such a sweet woman  
I'll never let her go  
'Cause deep down inside of me  
Lord knows I love her so  
  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way
