Some people say life's like a merry-go-round  
I think it's more like a Ferris wheel  
'Cause sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down  
Sometimes you just don't know what to feel  
And just when you think you've got the game figured out  
And you say you've had enough  
The mysterious mad man with his hand on the lever  
Don't seem to never ever want to let you off  
You can't get off this wheel of karma  
You can't stop the hands of time  
Now I have a friend, I might have a few  
Sometimes I think they just don't care  
But I think sometimes they think the same thing of me, yeah  
You might say we've got a problem there  
You know we all got this habit  
We like to talk too much  
And that always tends to slow you down  
But we never change direction  
We just keep going round and round and round and round  
And let me off this wheel of karma  
Let me stop the hands of time  
Seems like I've been around so many places  
And I must have learned a lot of things  
And although I ain't yet come up with a so-called answer  
At least I think I finally learned how to sing  
And there's j  
Sometimes they make my brain get sore  
Like if kids were left of all devices  
Would they ever come up with a thing like war  
Let us off this wheel of karma  
Let us stop the hands of time
