Too hard on the brakes again  
What if these brakes just give in?  
What if they don't get out of the way?  
What if there's someone overtaking?  
I'm going out for a little drive  
And it could be the last time you see me alive  
There could be an idiot on the road  
The only kick in life is pumping his steel  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
They won't ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive  
  
Don't die on the motorway  
The moon would freeze, the plants would die  
I couldn't cope if you crashed today  
All the things I forgot to say  
I'm going out for a little drive  
And it could be the last time you see me alive  
What if the car loses control?  
What if there's someone overtaking?  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
They won't ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive killer cars  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
No they won't ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive killer cars  
They all drive killer cars  
They all drive killer cars
