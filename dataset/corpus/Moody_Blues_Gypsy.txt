A gypsy of a strange and distant time  
Travelling in panic all direction blind  
Aching for the warmth of a burning sun  
Freezing in the emptiness of where he'd come from  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Left without a hope of coming home.  
Speeding through a shadow of a million years  
Darkness is the only sound to reach his ears  
Frightening him with the visions of eternity  
Screaming for the future that can never be  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Left without a hope of coming home.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
A gypsy of a strange and distant time  
Travelling in panic all direction blind  
Aching for the warmth of a burning sun  
Freezing in the emptiness of where he'd come from  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Left without a hope of coming home.  
Left without a hope of coming home  
Left without a hope of coming home
