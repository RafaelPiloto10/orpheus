It's like I'm fallen out of bed  
From a long, weary dream  
The sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees  
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me  
It's like I've fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Just exactly as I remember  
Every word  
Every gesture  
  
And my heart, in my mouth  
Like I'm fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying  
  
And as that woman blows her cover  
In the eye of the beholder  
I'm a fish now out of water  
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me  
  
I fell open  
I laid under  
At the tip out  
I was just your number  
I want stay on it  
And get back under  
  
And if you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
If you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
If you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
  
(Wake me up, wake me up)  
If you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
(Wake me up, wake me up)  
Like I'm fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying  
  
When at last you'll give in  
When at last you'll give in  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up
