Titillations been replaced, by interstate brick face and coffee mate  
And by a list of phone calls, you'll like to make  
Where you could sit on the edge of your bed  
And you could stare into your own shoes  
And in the pools of light there, go wherever you choose  
Just rig up a complication, and if it derails  
You can throw away the rudder and float away like vapour trails  
there's nothin' funnier than pride in an utterly confident stride  
So I pulled the car on over to give you a ride  
Damn this sleepy weather he said, as he marched in soppin? wet shoes  
Through rain pools evaporatin?, says in this sign I?ll conquer you  
I pulled the car on over, to give you a ride  
But there's nothin? uglier than a man hittin? his stride  
Past Mexicans all dressed in beige shirts, leanin? over their hoes  
Now the mornin?s over, it?s time to let them sprinklers hose  
Past hills of chambermaids? dark bare arms  
And fields of muscles quilted to the bone  
Right now I'm flyin? over, ya right now I'm flyin? home  
Where I can sit on the end of my bed  
And I can stare into my own shoes  
And in the pools of light years, go wherever I choose  
And throw away the rudder, float away on vapour trails  
I rigged up a complication, totally derailed  
So I throw away the rudder, float away like vapour trails  
I pulled the car on over  
(It?s time to let them sprinklers hose)  
Woo, woo, woo, throw away the rudder
