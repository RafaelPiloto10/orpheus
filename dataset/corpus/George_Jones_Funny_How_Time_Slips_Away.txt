Well hello there my it's been a long long time  
How am I doin' oh I guess that I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday  
Gee ain't it funny how time slips away  
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine  
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time  
Now that's the same thing that you told me seems like just the other day  
Gee ain't it funny how time slips away  
I gotta go now I guess I'll see you around  
Don't know when though never know when I'll be back in town  
But remember what I tell you in time you're gonna pay  
And it's surprising how time slips away  
(Repeat)
