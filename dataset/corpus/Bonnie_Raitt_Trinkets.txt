Bonnie Raitt-Trinkets  
(Emory Joseph)  
When I was a kid  
I had a little record  
I played it over and over  
Each and every day.  
Sung by a man  
Named Louie Armstrong.  
Saint's marched right in from my Close and Play.  
When I was a kid  
I had a little picture  
And I looked at that picture  
All the time.  
Painted by a man  
Mama said his name was Vinnie.  
A farmer sowing seeds on a really nice day.  
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies like  
To help 'em be happy  
Like that guy named Mike.  
Yeah that groovy old man that fixes my bike  
Down there on 'Dumaine Street, New Orleans Louisiana.  
When I was a kid  
I had a little wiener dog  
I loved that little wiener dog  
And she loved me.  
Spent warm spring days feeding that little wiener dog  
Ripe sweet cherries from our cherry tree.  
(An') if I ever get older, if I ever die.  
If I get to a gate at the end of the sky.  
And a beautiful creature says  
Now Bonnie what do you want?  
Might say a record and a picture and a wiener dog swear to God.  
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies want  
To help 'em be happy  
Like that ol' gal named Betty.  
Yeah that groovy old chick teaches Tai-Chi on the levee.  
Rain or shine she's out there she's dedicated.  
She wrinkled but she  
Lovely.  
She flexible and don't you wish we all were flexible enough to  
Dance now?  
Dance little children now  
The whole round world is your neighborhood.  
Dance little children now  
Nekkid as a Jaybird.  
Dance little children now  
The whole round world is your neighborhood.  
Dance little children now  
Nekkid as a Jaybird.  
They're just trinkets.  
Little stepping stones  
To let you know you was here.
