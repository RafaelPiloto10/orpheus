I knew it was there  
Though I tried to hide it  
The feeling just kept on shining through  
Haven't known you that long  
So I try to deny it  
But the feeling was much too much too strong  
  
Could this be love  
Deep down inside  
Tearing me apart  
I feel it in my heart  
  
Constantly, you're on my mind  
Thinking about you all the time  
I can't sleep no matter what I do  
I just keep on thinking 'bout you  
  
Why do I feel this way  
When I know you have someone  
That you're seeing each and every day  
Should I play this game  
Of just being your friend  
When I know that's not where I want it to end  
  
How could this be wrong  
When the feeling's so strong  
Tearing me apart  
I feel it in my heart  
  
Constantly, you're on my mind  
Thinking about you all the time  
I can't sleep no matter what I do  
I just keep on thinking 'bout you  
  
Constantly, you're on my mind  
Thinking about you all the time  
I can't sleep no matter what I do  
I just keep on thinking 'bout you  
  
No I don't want to start no trouble  
Between you and I and your lover  
But I must tell you what I'm going through  
Everytime you walk by I see love in your eyes
