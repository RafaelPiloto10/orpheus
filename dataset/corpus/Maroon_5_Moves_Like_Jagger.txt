Just shoot for the stars if it feels right  
And aim for my heart if you feel like it  
Take me away and make it okay  
I swear I'll behave  
  
You wanted control so we waited  
I put on a show now we're naked  
You say I'm a kid my ego is big  
I don't give a shit and it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
I don't need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
Baby it's hard when you feel like  
You're broken and scarred  
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me  
I make you believe that I've got the key  
  
Oh, so get in the car we can ride it  
Wherever you want get inside it  
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear  
I'll take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
I don't need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
You want to know how to make me smile  
Take control, own me just for the night  
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it  
Nobody else can see this  
  
So watch and learn I won't show you twice  
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right  
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it  
Nobody else can see this  
  
And it goes like this  
  
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you  
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
  
I don't need to try to control you  
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger  
I've got the moves like Jagger
