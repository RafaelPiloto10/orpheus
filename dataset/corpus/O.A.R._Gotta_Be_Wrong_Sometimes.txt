Baby don't you wait that long  
You told me underneath that song.  
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you move,  
Yeah it gets to me like a melody.  
  
I don't wanna wait all night,  
Cause soon it's gonna pass me by.  
I only wanna make you smile  
Let me get to you like I always do.  
  
Show me how you really feel  
Make it all go and disappear.  
We can dance into the night,  
Come together and we'll make it right.  
Come together and we'll make it.  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To make it all feel right.  
So don't apologize,  
You gotta be wrong sometimes.  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To live inside these lines,  
We were right all along.  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes.  
  
Every little thing you say,  
Got me lifted and I'm on my way.  
Baby come with me, you don't have to stay.  
You follow me like a memory.  
  
Show me how you really feel,  
Make it all go and disappear,  
We can dance into the night,  
Come together and we'll make this right,  
Come together and we'll make it right.  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To make it all feel right.  
So don't apologize,  
You gotta be wrong sometimes.  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To live inside these lines,  
We were right all along.  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes.  
  
Maybe the world will let us stay,  
Give us back what it took away.  
Or maybe I'm just high, so high.  
Somewhere out there in between,  
Being wrong and being clean,  
I see it all inside your eyes.  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To lose our mind  
I'm ready to fall, we gotta be wrong!  
  
You move like a melody,  
Everything they've got you've seen  
That's why you keep coming back to me for so long.  
We got to get wrong  
You move like a melody,  
Everything they've got you've seen  
That's why you keep holding on to me for so long.  
We got to get wrong  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To make it all feel right.  
So don't apologize,  
You gotta be wrong sometimes.  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To live inside these lines,  
We were right all along.  
You gotta be wrong,  
Gotta be wrong sometimes.
