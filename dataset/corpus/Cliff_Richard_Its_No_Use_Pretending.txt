It's no use pretending  
What's done is done  
And you can't turn back the clock  
It's no use pretending  
What you have said  
Will stay inside my head  
Oh it's over  
I tried to please you  
But all you could do  
Was talk behind my back  
Now I see through you  
Nothing I could say or do  
Would get to you  
You've bitten off more than you can chew  
Although I've got to say we're through  
There's nothing I would rather do  
Than be with you  
There's more to you than meets the eye  
I must admit you used to try  
But since you've gone the other way  
Your head is in the sky
