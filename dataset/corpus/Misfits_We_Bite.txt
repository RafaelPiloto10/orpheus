1, 2, 3, 4  
We walk the streets, I'm out to get you  
We bite  
Just a feast of gore and blood  
We bite  
Carnivores live for pleasure  
We bite  
Strike out like a wolf's endeavor  
We bite  
  
And when I get your blood I rip your throat  
Your blood I rip your throat  
I want your blood, I rip your throat  
To drink some blood  
  
We bite, we bite, we bite, we bite  
And when I get your blood I rip your throat  
Your blood I rip your throat  
I want your blood, I rip your throat  
To drink some blood  
  
We bite, we bite  
And when I get your blood I rip your throat  
Your blood I rip your throat  
I want your blood, I rip your throat  
To drink some blood  
  
We bite, we bite, we bite, we bite
