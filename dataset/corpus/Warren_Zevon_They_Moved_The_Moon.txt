I was counting on you  
To stand by me  
To see me through  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
I'm so confused  
Don't know what to do  
Don't know which way to turn  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
Can't you see me?  
Can't you hear me now?  
Don't you want a love that's true?  
Don't you know my heart belongs to you?  
  
I was counting on you  
To stand by me  
To see me through  
I was counting on you  
  
They moved the moon  
While I looked down  
When I looked away  
They changed the stars around  
  
They moved the moon  
I feel so strange  
While I looked down  
Everything I depended on  
When I looked away  
Has been rearranged  
They changed the stars around
