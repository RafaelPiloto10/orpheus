I always knew, somewhere in time  
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line  
Don't need to question, no reason why  
The answer lies before your eyes.  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you understand?  
  
Chorus:  
Deja vu, dreams come true  
I see my soul inside of you  
Deja vu, so many lives  
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.  
  
We cross between worlds through windows of light  
With open arms we hold back the night  
The crystal of power we hold in our hands  
We go on forever and love is the plan.  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you understand?  
  
Repeat Chorus.
