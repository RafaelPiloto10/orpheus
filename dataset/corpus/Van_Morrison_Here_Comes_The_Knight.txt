On the road with my sword  
And my shield in my hand  
Pressing on to the new day  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
  
In the valley I see horsemen pass  
Baby, baby, baby they don't want this love to last  
There's a battle for the throne  
And it's raging down in your soul  
It says this love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
  
I've been accused of truth and alchemy  
I've been accused of speaking out for freedom too  
I give a demonstration in front of a crowd  
A man saw my hands move and he began to shout  
  
Here come, here come, her come horsemen through the pass  
They say cast a cold eye on life, on death  
There's a battle for the truth  
And it means to thine own self be true  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always  
This love will surely last forever  
This love will surely last always
