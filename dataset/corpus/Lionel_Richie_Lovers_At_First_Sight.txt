Love can have its mysteries  
Some strange, enchanted notion  
You can't explain just how it begins  
A feel, a smile, a potion  
But something goes off in your head  
You can't believe the words you just said  
It's not so hard to see the light  
Lovers at first sight  
When the right one comes along  
There is no hesitation  
You wonder how you lost all control  
It's just a revelation  
And that's the way I felt with you  
One glance was all it took and I knew  
You and I were just so right  
Lovers at first sight  
(Je t'aime beaucoups, mon cherie)  
I love that you love me  
(Jai' envie d'etre pres de toi)  
I want you too  
'Cause when we are together  
There is no place in this world that I'd rather be  
Girl,  
(Dura-t-il pour toujours?)  
Yes, it's forever  
(Est-ce que tu me promets?)  
I promise my cherie  
'Cause you know nothing will change  
The way we're gonna live together  
In our litle fantasy  
Chorus:  
That's the way I felt with you  
One glance was all it took and I knew  
You and I were just so right  
Lovers at first sight  
Fade...  
(Depuis que j'etais un enfant)  
(Je t'aimais)  
(Mais tu ne savais pas que j'existais)  
(Et maintenant que nous sommes ensemble)  
(Tu dis que see'est l'amour do premier coup)
