I was talking to the mockingbird  
He says you are the worst he's heard.  
Bob White! What ya gonna swing tonight?  
  
I was talking to the whipporwill  
He says you've got a corny trill.  
Bob White! What ya gonna swing tonight?  
  
Even the owl, threw in the towel  
After you sang the gato!  
And the flamingo Hollared by jingo!  
What a vibrato!  
  
There's a lotta talk about you, Bob!  
And they're saying you're "off the cob."  
Fake it, Mister B  
Take it, follow me!  
Bob White!  
We're gonna break it out tonight!
