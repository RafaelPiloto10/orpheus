When you're in prison, don't turn the other way  
Keep your back against the wall  
When you're in prison, don't turn the other way  
Do not bend at all  
  
Oh don't pick up the soap, pick up the soap  
It's bad for you  
  
Oh don't pick up the soap, pick up the soap  
Someone will be waiting there for you  
  
When you're in prison be sure to stay awake  
Always lie upon your back  
  
When you're in prison be sure to stay awake  
Keep you from attack  
  
Oh don't be no one's bitch, be no one's bitch  
It's bad for you  
  
Oh don't be no one's bitch, be no one's bitch  
They won't help you make it through.  
  
When you're in prison, don't turn the other way  
Follow what I say to do.  
  
When you're in prison, don't turn the other way  
You can make it through  
You can make it through  
You can make it through
