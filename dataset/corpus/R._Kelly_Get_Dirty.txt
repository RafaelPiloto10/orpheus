And This for my niggaz, bitches, playas, pimps  
When they keep it in the street, we keep it in the streets  
And This for my niggaz, bitches, playas, pimps  
When they keep it in the street, we keep it in the streets  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey hey (Hey, hey), I'm hollyhood (Hollyhood)  
I'm on patrone in the club feelin' good (Feelin' good y'all)  
Hey, hey (Hey, hey), I'm so high (So high)  
And the DJ got the club so loud (So loud)  
Hands Up (Hands Up)  
Now let 'em bounce (Let 'em bounce)  
Two steppin' lil' mama work it out (Work it out)  
Go down (Go down)  
Now get dirty (Get dirty)  
Go down (Go down)  
Now get dirty (Get dirty)  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Roll up on dem wheels again  
Hop up out the whip again  
Fuckin' wit them chicks again  
In the club Kellz on the scene again  
Order me some rounds again  
Man I'm 'bout to clown again  
I'm about to see them strippers go down the poles again  
Niggas in the club gettin' out of control again  
Man they 'bout to come shut this whole bitch down again  
Take it to my crib (That's whats up)  
The after party (That's whats up)  
Straight to the mornin' (That's whats up)  
Now get the fuck out (That's whats up)  
Stuntin' I don't give a fuck  
Take my chain hold it up  
Bounce it like a real playa  
Pimp all in my cup  
Man I'm in the club looking and for a main chick  
Someone like a brain chick  
Someone I can stand chick  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chamillionaire]  
Yea, ladies tell me I'm too cute  
And thats translates that I'm too rich  
They wanna spend the night at the crib  
So they hit the club with two bigs  
We always be in VIP  
And each playa got two chicks  
They look at up like we live here  
They look at you like who's this  
We ain't trippin' up out the media  
Send one of our platinum plaques  
Matter fact  
You can send  
Picture of our middle fingers attached to that  
All eyes (All eyes) on me (On me, all eyes on me)  
'Cause I'm the playa all the hatas wanna be (Wanna be)  
Chamillitary, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Purple phantom, dip low  
Blowin' out that purple smoke  
Open up that closet door  
Fresh shoes, fresh clothes  
Private jets  
Takin' trips  
Ballin' man  
Spinning chips  
Give that girl a gold medal  
The way she out there turning flips  
Bend it over (That's whats up)  
Now shake it nasty (That's whats up)  
Girl heres my number (That's whats up)  
Gimme that (That's whats up)  
Man you know we pimpin'  
Man you know we sippin'  
Man you know we got them chicks in the pool skinny dippin'  
Kellz  
  
[Chorus]
