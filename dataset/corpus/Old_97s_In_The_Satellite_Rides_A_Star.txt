Time knows you're done  
Time as you fall  
I'm in the middle, letters you've signed  
In your cursive, cursive style  
Going down tonight  
It's different for boys and girls  
I've got your number, I know who you are  
You're a satellite on the world  
And I feel it slowing  
And I feel it slowing down  
And I feel it slowing  
And I feel it slowing down  
You didn't have the right  
To go so many a mile  
Ain't a good woman who rolls out of sight  
She could honestly stay a while  
So roll on as you like  
Yeah, roll in the sand like a stone  
I've got your number, I know who you were  
You were a satellite all alone  
And I feel it slowing  
And I feel it slowing down  
And I feel it slowing  
And I feel it slowing down  
And I feel it slowing  
And I feel it slowing down  
And I feel it slowing  
And I feel it slowing down  
And in the satellite rides a star  
And in the satellite rides a star  
And in the satellite rides a star
