Say it isn't right  
To be alone tonight  
So in love with you  
Tell you what I'm gonna  
Do about it  
  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
  
All I ever do  
Is what you want me to  
So in love with you  
Tell you what I'm gonna  
Do about it  
  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
  
Say it isn't right  
To be alone tonight  
So in love with you  
Tell you what I'm gonna  
Do about it  
  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme
