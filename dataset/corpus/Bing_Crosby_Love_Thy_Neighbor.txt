Love thy neighbor,  
Walk up and say "How be ya  
Gee! But I'm glad to see ya, pal,  
How's tricks? What's new?"  
Love thy neighbor,  
Offer to share his burden,  
Tell him to say the word "n"  
You will see him through  
Especially if there should be  
a beautiful girl next door,  
Say to that girl next door,  
don't think I'm bold  
But my mother told me to  
Love thy neighbor  
And you will find your labor,  
A great deal easier,  
Life'll be breezier  
If you Love Thy Neighbor
