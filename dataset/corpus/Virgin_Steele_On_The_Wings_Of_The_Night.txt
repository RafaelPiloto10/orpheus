When the dark is complete  
And the day goes to sleep  
That's when I come alive  
Faster than shadows  
On the wings of the night I'll be by your side  
  
And my soul spreads wide its raven wings  
And I cover you tonight  
Ooh you won't need no other  
I'm your dangerous lover, oh babe you know it's true  
  
I want to feel you in the dark  
I want to kiss your body  
I want to make you mine!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ride on the wings of the night  
(You know you want to)  
Ride on the wings of the night  
(You're old enough to)  
Ride on the wings of the night  
(I'm coming for you)  
  
And they tell you I'm wild  
That I'm the devil's child  
I'll only make you cry  
They say you're too young to feel  
They say my love's a lie  
  
But they don't know what it does to me  
Just to have you in my arms  
I'll introduce you to life's forbidden delights  
I'll make you a woman of you  
  
We Ride!  
Midnight, hearts collide  
Naked alone, your body's mine  
Ooh babe, don't say no..  
  
Tonight... my virgin child come..  
I want to feel you in the dark...
