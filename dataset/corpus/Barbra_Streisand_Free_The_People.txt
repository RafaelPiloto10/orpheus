Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  
Come and save the likes of me  
  
Saw your light from the street  
As I passed by the other day  
I was scared, my knees were weak  
Forgot what I had come to say  
  
Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  
Come and save the likes of me  
  
Saw a man walk on water  
With everybody looking on  
I didn't know I was his daughter  
'Til both of us had come and gone  
  
Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  
Come and save the likes of me  
  
If you see me in the alley  
Looking like I don't belong  
You can put me in your greenest valley  
I'll still be singing the same old song  
  
Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar
