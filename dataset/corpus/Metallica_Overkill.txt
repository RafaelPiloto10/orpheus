(Originally recorded by Motorhead)  
  
Only way to feel the noise, is when it's good and loud  
So good I can't believe it, screaming with the crowd  
  
Don't sweat it, give it back to you  
Don't sweat it, give it back to you  
Overkill  
Overkill  
Overkill  
Shut up!  
  
On your feet you feel the beat, it goes straight to your spine  
Shake your head, you must be dead, if it don't make you fly  
  
Don't sweat it, give it back to you  
Don't sweat it, give it back to you  
Overkill  
Overkill  
Overkill  
Get the fuck down!  
  
Ooh, yeah!  
  
Know your body's made to move, it goes straight to your spine  
You gotta move it, if it don't make you fly  
  
Don't sweat it, give it back to you  
Don't sweat it, give it back to you  
Overkill  
Overkill  
Overkill  
Get on with it!
