Watch the watch the way I walk  
Can't you think my movements talk  
  
See me silently quietly creep  
I am too amped to sleep  
Lamp rays shining down  
Street lamps make the buzzing sound  
Subway creaking down below  
Garbage piled up and ready to go  
  
Lock the windows the gates on  
Taxi in the distance coming along  
Stalking the streets till the break of day  
New York beauty take my breath away  
Near some cats but dogs don't bark  
Cool cats strolling after dark  
  
Watch the watch the way I walk  
Can't you think my movements talk  
  
Shaky lock and kicky door  
Smokey air that I adore  
Down in the alley is where I hunt  
All is quiet on the eastern front  
  
Stalking the street till the break of day  
New York beauty take my breath away  
  
Watch the watch the way I walk  
Can't you think my movements talk  
Watch the watch the way I walk  
Can't you think my movements talk  
Can't you think my movements talk  
Can't you think my movements talk
