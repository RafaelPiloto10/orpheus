I feel like I've been locked up tight  
A century of lonely nights  
Waiting, waiting for someone  
  
You're licking your lips  
And blowing kisses my way  
That don't mean I'm gonna give it away  
Baby, oh baby  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
The music's playin'  
And the lights down low  
One more dance and then we're good to go  
Waitin', waitin' for someone  
  
My hormones racin' at the speed of light  
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight  
Baby, ooh baby  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
Gotta make a big impression  
Gotta like what you do  
Gotta like what you do  
Gotta like what you do  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
You gotta make a big impression  
Gotta like what you do  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My heart is sayin' no)  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My heart is sayin' no)  
  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My heart is sayin' no)  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My body's sayin' let's go)  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out
