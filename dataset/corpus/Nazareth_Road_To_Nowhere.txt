I tried to hang on for as long as I could  
But now I can see that it just ain't no good  
Our love it has wasted  
Right down to the core  
Whatever we had  
We don't have anymore  
  
You've got to get off a road to nowhere  
You've got to get off a road to nowhere  
  
Well I tried and I tried to make things work out right  
But I guess we're two people who can't help but fight  
Your eyes they are open  
And oh so are mine  
We both need our freedom  
Don't you think it's about time  
  
I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere  
I'm trying to get off this road to nowhere  
  
Thank you for the good times we've had in the past  
But we both know enough to know good times don't last  
Baby you're just no good for me  
And I'm no good for you  
Let's not waste our time talkin'  
We both know what to do  
  
We've got to get off this road to nowhere  
It's time to get off this road to nowhere  
You've got to get off this road to nowhere  
We've got to get off this road to nowhere
