Born a queen up on her side, and she felt it too.  
There's a lot you can see when there's nothing to do  
She got down on her knees and she dug herself out  
Slipping to the east side and prancing about.  
  
Learn a language baby, it's that kind of place  
Low card is hunger and high card is taste  
And trouble is small change when daddy's around  
You know that she learned a lesson when she happened down  
  
She didn't know-the barrel was loaded  
She didn't know-the barrel was loaded  
She didn't know-the barrel was loaded  
She didn't know  
  
One eye on the table, one eye on the floor  
She got beat for her pride with her back to the door  
She be digging the spotlight and called it her own  
But you know it's over when everyone's gone  
  
Stealing seconds together, the day is the night  
You can fly your own colors as long as they're right  
The trigger invites you and so do the boys  
But if there ain't no one listening there ain't no noise
