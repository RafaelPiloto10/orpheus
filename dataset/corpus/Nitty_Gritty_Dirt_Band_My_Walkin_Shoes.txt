My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
It's a long way from here to over yonder  
My feet, they're getting mighty sore  
I ain't comin' back, you've made your mind to wander  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
I'll be a long time gone from you, baby  
You'll never hear me knock upon your door  
Thought you were worth it once but I was crazy  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town, honey, I won't be around  
My walkin' shoes don't fit me anymore
