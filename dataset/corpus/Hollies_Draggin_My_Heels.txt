First at the gate post but the last one through  
I hung around far too long for you  
Left out the game left out the deal  
Stupid of me to be draggin' my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin' my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin' my heels, heels  
Time waits for no one and I wasted my time  
Got to the crossroads but took the wrong sign  
I'd go too far didn't know how she'd feel  
Stupid of me to be draggin my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin' my heels  
Oh oh oh draggin' my heels, heels  
If I had the chance to go back again,  
I wouldn't do the same  
I learned by mistakes  
I'd be on my knees I'd be there to please  
I'd be anything you want me to be  
You want to be  
verse 1  
heels, heels
