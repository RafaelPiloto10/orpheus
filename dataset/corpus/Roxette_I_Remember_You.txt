Are you ready? Go!  
I hear your footsteps like your walking.  
I hear your voice like your talking to me.  
I can reach every moment, every caress like I'm living a dream  
Down to the bone, go little darling.  
Oh I remember you, feels like it was yesterday.  
I remember you, you've got me running back again  
You shared my secrets and my laughter.  
I fell in love with the light in your eyes  
And I believed that summer would go on and on  
For the rest of my life  
Down to the bone...  
You've got me running.  
I say: na na na na na na na na na na.
