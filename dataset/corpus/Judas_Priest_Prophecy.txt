I am the darkness  
Born out of light  
I am the force the fire  
That burns here tonight  
  
Bringing the future  
To all mankind  
Guider of life, of death  
The sight of the blind  
  
Your future lies within my eyes  
What I predict will terrify  
I can't control what comes to be  
From the past to the present to eternity  
  
[Chorus]  
I am Nostradamus  
Do you you believe  
I am Nostradamus  
That I conceive  
  
Master of chaos  
Anger and rage  
I hold the key  
My presence will unlock the cage  
I am your witness  
The one who can tell  
Bearing the sword, the shield  
To your heaven from hell  
  
As I unfold the mystery  
I change the course of history  
With premonitions from the void  
Will you live, will you die  
Will your worlds collide  
  
[Chorus]  
I am Nostradamus  
The hand of fate  
I am Nostradamus  
With love and hate  
  
Lost in this vortex  
The mystery begins  
Will you be victim  
Saved from your sins  
Time is illusion  
Trapped in the skies  
Destiny's calling  
Hear from my eyes  
  
Many years ago a boy was born  
A boy with a gift  
A gift that would be the envy of all mankind  
To see what no other could - great visions  
Of the future  
Or would a curse be bestowed on the boy  
The boy whose name was Nostradamus,  
Damus, damus, damus, damus, damus  
  
[Chorus]  
I am Nostradamus  
Do not forsake  
I am Nostradamus  
Your life's at stake  
  
[Chorus]  
I am Nostradamus  
The lightning rod  
I am Nostradamus  
The voice of God  
  
Celestial comets  
Reign towards earth  
Alchemy's tempest  
Predicting your worth  
Pray for deliverance  
Escape if you can  
For I have borne witness  
To the purging of man
