I remember when we were sweethearts  
I was safe with you, you were my protector  
Those days are over, now I need someone  
Someone to keep me safe from you  
  
Love was all we had, we were young and sure  
Who'd expect their love would turn to war?  
I don't know who to pity more  
How much pain can love endure?  
  
I should leave you but I can't seem to  
You say, "I'm sorry, dear," and I believe you  
Though the next time may be the worst yet  
How easily I forgive, how quickly you forget  
  
The poison words, the ugliness  
When low on hope and deep in debt  
The promises that bring regret  
For loving you, is this all I get?  
  
The poison words, the ugliness  
The cold remains of married bliss  
To all our dreams, a fatal kiss  
Oh what kind of love is this?
