Look around me, look at what I've found Credits  
Look around me, look at what I've found  
People come and people go  
And that's the way it is ,  
What does it really matter  
About twenty years after?  
Specialise, we modernise  
Make changes day to day  
One day up and one day down  
Let's call it fashion  
  
Look around me - can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
  
Turn and turn, tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
  
You know the city-slicks and politics  
Now they don't bother me  
As long as there's no ration  
Of love and passion  
Be cool, be kind  
But don't be blind  
To all the love I'm giving  
Don't waist a minute  
Get into living  
  
Look around me - can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
  
Don't wait, don't be late  
You don't have a second left to hesitate  
Walk, talk, do it all  
Nothing you can do will ever break the fall  
Turn and turn, tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
Turn and turn, tell me what are you seeing  
Clear your mind if you wanna be free  
  
Everybody  
They need somebody  
Everybody  
They're looking at me  
Everybody  
They need somebody  
Everybody  
They're looking at me  
  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
Look around me - can anybody tell me what to do  
Look around me - I only have eyes for you  
Look around me - tumbeling, stumbeling upside-down  
Look around me - Look at what I've found  
  
  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found  
Oh, look around me, look at what I've found
