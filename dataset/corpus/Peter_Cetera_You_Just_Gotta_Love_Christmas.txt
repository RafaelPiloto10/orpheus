Something beautiful  
Happens this time of the year  
Unbelievable  
Knowing that Christmas will soon be here  
  
Making an angel on new fallen snow  
Take an icicle souvenir  
It's so beautiful  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Something magical  
Happens this time every night  
So incredible, candles and ribbons  
And so many colored lights  
  
Gather the family and sit by the fire  
Sing when the gang's all here  
It's so magical  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Little children find it hard to sleep at right  
Waiting for old Santa and his reindeer  
A time to see each other in a different light  
There are so many reasons  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Little children find it hard to sleep at night  
Waiting for old Santa till the morning light  
It's a time to see each other in a different way  
It's a wonderful time of the year  
You just gotta love Christmas  
  
Gotta love Christmas  
Gotta love Christmas  
Gotta love Christmas
