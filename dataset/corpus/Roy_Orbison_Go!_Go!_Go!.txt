Well, you can't be my lovin' baby  
You ain't got the style  
I'm gonna get some real gone love  
That'll drive a cool cat wild  
We gotta move, roll and run on down  
Gonna get me a gal, then I go out on the town  
Well, I'll move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal, that make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
And when she starts struttin', gotta go, go, go  
Well, I'm gonna show you ain't so hot  
I'm gonna get what you ain't got  
She'll be sweet, won't do me wrong  
She'll be cool and twice as gone  
We're gonna roll, move and run on down  
I'm gonna get me a gal, make some time  
Well, I wanna move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal, that make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
'Cause when she starts struttin', gotta go, go, go  
Well, I wanna move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal, that make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
'Cause when she starts struttin', gotta go, go, go
