I can settle dow-own and be doin' just fine  
Til I hear an old train rollin' down the line  
Then I hurry strai-aight home and pack  
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack  
I love you ba-aby, but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man.  
  
Some folks might sa-ay that I'm no good  
That I wouldn't settle down if I could  
But when that open ro-oad starts to callin' me  
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see  
Sometimes it's har-ard but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me, he made a ramblin' man.  
  
I love to see the tow-owns passin' by  
And to ride these rails 'neath god's blue sky  
Let me travel this la-and from the mountains to the sea  
Cause that's the life I believe he meant for me  
And when I'm go-one and at my grave you stand  
Just say God's called home your ra-amblin' man.
