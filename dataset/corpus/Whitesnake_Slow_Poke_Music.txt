Why know the joint was jumping  
Like a dancing fool,  
I saw you standing in the corner  
Looking oh, so cool  
I had a word with the DJ  
To make the music hot,  
I'm gonna get you on the dance floor  
If you are ready or not  
  
Slow poke music,  
I'll get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
I'll never leave you alone, I'll never leave you  
  
When you move it to the left,  
Or you shake it to the right,  
No matter what you do, babe,  
It's like dynamite  
With your sweet French perfume  
An' that criminal walk,  
You know you'd melt my ice cream  
With your body talk  
  
Slow poke music,  
I'll get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
I'll never leave you alone, I'll never leave you  
  
I'm gonna shake you down,  
Girl, I'm won't do you no harm  
  
Well, you move so fine,  
Like stepping on glass,  
An' when you give me that smile,  
I see lightning flash  
East an' West, North an' South,  
Oh babe, you're so hot  
I'm gonna melt in your mouth  
  
Slow poke music,  
I'll get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
Get into it, babe,  
Slow poke music,  
I'll nail it down to the bone  
Slow poke music,  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
Girl, I'll never leave you alone
