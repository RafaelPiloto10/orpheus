Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine  
Gonna have me a holiday  
Poor man's party, rich man's daughter  
Gettin' hotter and hotter  
  
She's pushin' way too hard  
I don't want any part of her way  
Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine  
Gonna have me a holiday  
  
It's a holiday... It's a holiday  
  
[Chorus]  
Mama mama please, no more jaguars  
I don't want to be a pop star  
Mama mama please, no more deckhands  
I don't want to be a sailor man  
Mama mama please, no more face lifts  
I just don't know which one you is  
Mama mama please, no more husbands  
(I don't know who my daddy is)  
  
Drinkin' my wine, wastin' my time  
Hidin' out in my rented dream  
Lookin' for attention  
A cover story mention in  
  
Life magazine  
Ask the chauffeur who he knows  
Numbers he's got, lots of those  
  
Drinkin' my wine, spendin' my time  
Tryin' to run from this Halloween  
  
It's a holiday... It's a holiday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a holiday... It's a holiday
