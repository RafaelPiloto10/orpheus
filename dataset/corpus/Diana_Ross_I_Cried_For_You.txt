I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
That's one thing I'm learning  
  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
Now I found two eyes  
A little bit bluer  
I found a heart  
Just a little bit truer  
  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
That's one thing I'm learning  
  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
Now I found two eyes  
Just a little bit bluer  
I found a heart  
Just a little bit truer  
  
That I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me
