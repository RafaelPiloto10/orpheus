Since I become a shooting star  
I've been wondering where you are  
Seems like your forever in a getaway  
Momma told me that it would happen to me one day  
Feels like we've been apart for some light years  
Crater in my heart, filled with my tears  
Stars align, I'll be your girl again  
What I'm tryin say, I want you back in my world again  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
And I bet you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Don't know how it happened, just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated, don't you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal, Where you at?  
And I don't know how we lost contact  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
Sitting watching time passing by me  
Voice in my head asking why me?  
I'm here wishing you would stop by my place  
But the only time we talk is on Myspace  
By the way, have you found my replacement?  
She should be the one on this spaceship  
Waking up, reaching for you when you're not there  
You got me in another galaxy, I'm out there  
  
You're the reason I don't change my number  
I want you to know that it's still the same  
Oh boy I know you remember that summer  
When we kicked it everyday  
Don't know how it happened, just happened  
Kinda like we faded away  
And I feel so alienated, don't you feel so alienated  
  
I miss you and I want you back  
I lost your signal, Where you at?  
And I don't know how we lost contact  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Can't get you outta my system  
Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
I wanna know, where did you go?  
  
System, Outta my system, Outta my system  
System, Outta my system, Outta my system  
How can I get you outta my  
System, Outta my system, Outta my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you  
  
System, my system, my system (If I could only get you)  
System, my system, my system (Outta my system baby)  
System, my system, my system  
Where did you go? I'm searching for you, yeah
