I am you are me  
Good woman said you gotta believe  
Submerge into the urge of we  
Deliciously the mystery  
  
[Chorus]  
We big mob aw yea aw yea  
One big mob aw yea aw yea  
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea  
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea  
  
Ooze into into my noodle  
East or west shepherd or poodle  
Ladybug pinetree  
To mingle with the bumblebee  
A lover to the sun  
And a brother to the cool breeze  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Scrawled upon the wall  
Of a bathroom stall  
A stranger wrote a note  
That spoke to all  
  
One two buckle my shoe  
Take care of me  
'Cause I might be you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We live in the city  
We live in the jungle  
It's time to be drinking  
A thimble humble  
Everything you ever see  
Is never more than you and me  
Give it on in to the beauty of the mystery  
One big mob in one big home  
A broken home  
I'd like to share some air with you  
Some air with you  
A morning forest full of truths  
The green is blue  
The head that's getting pregnant lives  
To give and give  
What was I thinking in my head  
The color red  
Breaking hearts instead of bread  
Something I said  
Checkmated by frustration  
Need to be cut loose  
A different kind of being lost  
A sullen cost  
  
Picaboo street  
In Timbuktu  
Do I need repeat  
That a boy  
Named Sue  
Rockin'  
To the beat  
Of the kangaroo  
Let me kiss your feet  
And your  
Forehead  
Too
