Uh uh  
I friend of mine was talking  
I was earjacking, eavesdropping  
Down on my knees  
So I could hear what she was saying  
As I got closer to her fire, her desire  
Was to lead me on and on and on  
It was like  
  
Beautiful  
(We are free again, we're out of here)  
Beautiful  
(You need a friend, let's disappear)  
  
Now I get to thinkin' 'bout the high speed dirty deeds  
What I want, what you need  
I think you best believe it  
Got it, want you here,  
But you still gotta know  
We can skin it, we conceal it  
And so baby let's begin it  
Sayin'  
  
Beautiful  
(We are free again, we're out of here)  
Beautiful  
(You need a friend, let's disappear)  
Beautiful  
(Do all the things we never tried)  
Beautiful  
(Just spread your wings and learn to fly)  
  
Whoa (whoa)  
Whoa (whoa)  
(Beautiful)  
(Beautiful)  
  
Beautiful  
  
Beautiful  
(We are free again, we're out of here)  
Beautiful  
(You need a friend, let's disappear)  
Beautiful  
(Do all the things we never tried)  
Beautiful  
(Just spread your wings and learn to fly)  
  
Whoa (whoa)  
Whoa (whoa)  
(Beautiful)  
Beautiful
