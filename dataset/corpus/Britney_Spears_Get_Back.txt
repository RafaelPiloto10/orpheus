So baby now  
You're the one who's looking for me  
I wonder why?  
Cuz u used to be the one  
Who asked me to let her be  
  
So you're the one  
Who want us  
To get back  
(You say lets get back together)  
(Lets get back forever)  
Now it's u the one  
Whos's followin me around  
Like a homeless dog  
And you pray  
(Let's get back together, let's get back for better)  
Get back  
Lets lets lets  
Get back  
(Back, back, back...)  
  
Now your the one  
Whos chasing me  
Everywhere I go  
Ur all I see  
It's like ur following me everywhere  
I used to pray for that to happen  
But now I just don't care  
It's more  
It's startin to annoyme  
I'm gettin crazy  
It's gettin chaotic  
  
So baby now  
Ur the one who's looking for me  
I wonder why?  
Cuz if I remember rightly u were the one  
Who asked me to be free  
  
So you're the one  
Who want us  
To get back  
(You say lets get back together)  
(Lets get back forever)  
Now it's u the one  
Whos's followin me around

Oh baby  
You should have thought of that  
  
Before speakin  
Cuz now I just don't care what u say  
Now I don't care what u can be thinkin  
Now ur just so out of my way  
Oh baby  
Oh now I've found  
That I'm better without you  
I found out I didn't need u to survive  
I've also realised  
That u were the one  
Who needs me  
Who'll call me  
Who can't forget me  
The one who can't help herself but love me  
  
Oh

Who want us  
To get back  
(You say lets get back together)  
(Lets get back forever)

Everyday everyhour  
Ur the one whos right on my back  
Everywhere I am  
In the car in the shower  
Ur the one whos addicted to me  
Just like a drug  
Ur the one whos chasing me  
The one who want us  
To get back  
(Back, back, back...)
