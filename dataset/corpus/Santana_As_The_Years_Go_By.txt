Well there's nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
Well there's nothing I can do  
If you leave me here to cry  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I gave you all that I own  
That's one thing you can't deny  
I gave you all that I own  
That's one thing you can't deny  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by  
  
I'm gonna leave it up to you  
So long,so long good bye  
I'm gonna leave it up to you  
So long,so long good bye  
You know my love will follow you  
As the years go passing by
