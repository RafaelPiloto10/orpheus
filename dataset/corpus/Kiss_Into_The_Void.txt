I'm losing power and I don't know why  
Not really sure if I'll live or die  
I want to leave but I can't get away  
  
It's a strange sensation  
Out of control being by myself  
I feel this gravitation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm being pulled  
  
Into the void  
I want to get away, get away  
Into the void  
I'm being pulled, I'm being pulled down  
Into the void  
This place is spinning, spinning around  
Into the void  
Fell like I'm being pulled into a black hole  
  
This crazy feeling's screwing with my head  
I'm overloading and my gauges are red  
State of confusion's got a hold on me  
  
I feel a hesitation  
I'm being drawn, falling right off the track  
Don't like the situation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm being pulled  
  
Into the void  
I want to get away, get away  
Into the void  
My head is spinning, spinning around 'round  
Into the void  
This force is getting, gettin' stronger  
Into the void  
Fell like I'm being pulled into a black hole  
Into the void  
  
I'm being pulled, being pulled down down down  
  
Into the void  
Don't like this feeling, I'm being pulled down  
Into the void  
I want to get away, get away  
Into the void  
Feel like it's spinning, spinning around  
Into the void  
I'm being pulled, being pulled down down down  
Into the void  
Get away, get away  
Into the void  
Fell like I'm being pulled into a black hole  
Into the void
