If I could I surely would  
Child ease your pain  
But if I could no longer  
Would you still know my name?  
  
If I couldn't drain the tears  
That pour from these eyes  
Would you turn your back on me  
Would you wave goodbye?  
  
[Chorus]  
Or leave me way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
  
If I could be the shoulder  
Which your head would rest upon  
Would you still be waiting (mama)  
Or would you be gone?  
If I couldn't keep the smile  
Forever on your face  
Would I still be around  
Or would I be replaced?  
  
(Yeah)  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive (yeah)  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
  
Oh-o  
Oh-o-o-o  
Oh-ooo  
  
(And) Would you promise me  
Things they'd never change  
Could you promise me  
That things they'd stay the same?  
  
If I couldn't clear the clouds  
From over your head  
Would you keep your word to me  
Amongst all the things you said?  
  
Or leave me way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive (yeah)  
Way beyond empty inside  
(oh-o-o)  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
Oh yeah child!
