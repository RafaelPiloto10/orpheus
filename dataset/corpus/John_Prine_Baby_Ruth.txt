Well it's sure good to see you  
But my how you've changed  
Since the last time I saw you  
Girl you've been rearranged  
I always said your people  
Were just like my kin  
When I was down and out  
They would always take me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I love you my Baby Ruth  
Never lie to you  
I only tell the truth  
Oh I love you since you were a child  
Every time I see you girl  
You always raise a smile  
  
I was living out on the highway  
You didn't turn me out  
I lived in your closet  
And you fed me by mouth  
My boots were my pillow  
Wrapped under my head  
I kept all my stuff  
Stashed out under your bed
