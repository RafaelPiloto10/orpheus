Wait  
You ain't even thinking what you say  
Your words leave me frozen like a lake  
And dropped under the surface  
You killing out  
The one thing  
That gives us purpose  
  
Stop  
Take a look at love  
You'll never know  
'Cause I'm not gonna let you  
Leave me feeling cold  
So don't you come here  
There'll be no more tears  
In this atmosphere  
  
All that I asked for  
Is love that  
Don't hurt soul  
Why did you come here?  
Tell me  
Why did you come here?  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to  
  
You  
Don't understand  
The way of  
What you do  
But I made it through  
The other side  
I'm through  
And I took this hard  
And you can see me speaking  
From a dead cold start  
  
All that I asked for  
Is love that  
Don't hurt soul  
So why did you come here?  
Tell me  
Why did you come here?  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to  
  
I  
Can hold my head up high  
As frost covers the ground  
And I can see sunlight  
Through these clouds  
  
Yeeah  
Yeeeeah  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
An icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
An icicle
