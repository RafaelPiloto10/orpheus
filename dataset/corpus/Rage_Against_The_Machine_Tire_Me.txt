Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
I can see you in front of me, front of me  
Ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
Why don't you get from in front of me?  
Oh she's got everyone's eyes  
Yeah!  
In every home there's a sickening distress  
Yeah!  
Of roll that film she's a precious, a precious one  
But we're all gonna, nah we're already dead!  
We're already dead!  
  
And those colorful words for tha Laos frontiers-man  
Who passed away with the truth  
Amidst the eulogies of bliss  
Who will know now what I know about you?  
Now that history's a flowery cancerous mess  
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me  
A mess!  
Overbearing yes ya tryin' ta tire me  
A mess!  
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
So get the fuck from in front of me  
Nah let's see it broken, bloody and undressed!  
We're already dead!  
  
In a violent time (?)  
  
I want to be Jackie Onassis  
I want to wear a pair of dark sunglasses  
I want to be Jackie O  
Oh oh oh oh please don't die!  
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
I can see you in front of me, front of me  
Ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me  
Why don't you get from in front of me?  
Ruh!  
We're already dead!  
We're already dead!  
We're already dead!
