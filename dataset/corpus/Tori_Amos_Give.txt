So you heard I crossed over the line  
Do I have regrets?  
Well, not yet  
  
There are some, some who give blood  
I give love  
I give  
  
Soon, before the sun  
Before the sun begins to rise  
I know that I, I must give  
So that I, I can live  
  
There are some, some whose "give"  
Twists itself to take their mistake  
Who, what? what made up the line?  
Some say it was pain  
Or was it shame?  
  
Soon, before the sun  
Before the sun begins to rise  
I know that I, I must give  
So that I I, I can live  
  
Some, some who give blood  
I give love, I give  
  
Soon before the sun  
Before the sun begins to rise  
I know that I, I must give  
So that I, I can live
