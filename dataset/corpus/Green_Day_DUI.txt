Let's get drunk and go out driving  
Let's see just how quickly we can go  
Let's plowed and plow down some old lady  
Let's go drink off the stereo  
Let's go down and vomit out the window  
Let's keep score of how many we've killed  
Two tequila slammers off the dashboard  
There's an alcoholic at the wheel  
Careful when I'm taking this next corner  
Don't want anybody wasting beer  
Pass another lime and Corona  
Too drunk to use my butt for shifting gears  
Let's get drunk and go out driving  
Let's do donuts in the cul-de-sac  
Let's get drunk and go out driving  
Whirling and we're never coming back  
Whirling and we're never coming back  
Whirling and we're never coming back
