Well you think you're the hardest thing a goin'  
The way things come to you you think you're in  
But one of these days that wind's a gonna start blowin'  
You may not lose the big boy you won't win  
Cause the devil gets his dues and you'll start payin'  
When he collects you know you'll pay your debt  
The devil gets his dues like I been sayin'  
You hurt just like you've hurt me you can bet  
[ guitar ]  
When it comes to love you wear the devil's menu  
And you bribe a lot that you just can't be hurt  
You're not the only one who knows the trick or two  
Some day I might rub your face in the dirt  
Well your little play house is sittin' on sticks of dynamite  
And I get mad tonight and light the fuze  
If you come in and find out that my dog bites  
You'll know the devil's here collectin' dues  
Cause the devil gets his dues...
