Uh, star struck hoes beg me to connect with em  
'Cause I look correct with em and knows how to sex them  
Houses on two acre lakes in the Peach State  
Eat steak and lobster, steady tryin to prosper  
  
Build up my roster like the ol Motown  
Too much to hold down and the whole world know now  
I demonstrate stackin' paint platinum tapes  
And bustin that ass with groups like XSCAPE  
What the deal? Uhh  
  
I want to see if you can get down  
Get down like you say you do  
In the midnight when I want to feel right  
All I think about is you  
  
Put me in a fly position  
Make me want to scream your name  
And just when you think I've had enough  
I'm like baby do you think we can do it again?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
'Cause everytime you show me that  
And every which way that you throw my back  
I just can't get enough  
I find myself sayin "let's do it again, let's do it again"  
  
Tingle tingle my body  
You make me oohh baby  
I ain't been the same since then  
That night when you put me in a fly position  
  
You made me scream your name  
You can say I'm sprung out, I don't give a damn  
I want to do it again and again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
When we made love for the first time  
It felt so good inside  
I laid across my bed and watched tears run from my eyes  
Too good to let it go  
So don't disturb this flow  
All I know is I can't wait  
Can't wait to do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(In the morning) 'cause everytime you show me that  
(Sweet love in the summertime) and every which way that you throw my back  
(Just your sweet face) I just can't get enough  
  
(all laid up next to mine) I find myself sayin "Let's do it again, let's do it
again"  
'Cause everytime you show me that (Let's do it again)  
And every which way that you throw my back (again, again)  
I just can't get enough  
  
I find myself sayin "let's do it again, let's do it again"  
Let's do it, do it, do it, do it, do it again
