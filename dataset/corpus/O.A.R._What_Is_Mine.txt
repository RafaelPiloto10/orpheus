Iron winter, got me cold  
Convicted like a criminal  
Sharp and nimble, the wind unfold  
Got me to my feet again  
Past the mountain I hear a cry  
Coming from the pinnacle  
Oh, In the distance a city shines  
Oh, what a welcoming  
  
[Bridge]  
Been to the black rock  
Found my salvation  
Rendered me patient  
But wearing me thin  
So I'm  
  
[Chorus]  
On the way back home  
Seen the big show, thousand times  
Got to get back what is mine  
The only way I know  
Feet been walking, thousand miles  
Got to get back what is mine  
  
Bless the evening, it's showed the way  
Back to where it all began  
Oh, undercover I made my case  
I'm quietly a gentleman  
Man, To be a fool is such a waste  
He'll eat until he's sick of it  
Why not stop when you find your place  
And be happy that you made it in  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What is mine  
Fallen time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On the way back home  
I'm on my way  
You know I'm on my way back  
The only way I know  
  
Getting what is mine  
Gonna get it back, give it back now  
I've come so far tonight
