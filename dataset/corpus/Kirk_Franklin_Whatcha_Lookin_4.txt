I was searchin'  
For someone to love me right  
Hear me when I cry  
Keep me late at night  
Jesus came even in my misery  
Wipe the tears from my eyes  
This is what He said  
  
Chorus  
Whatcha' lookin' 4  
I'm the One you're lookin' 4  
What you're searchin' 4  
You don't have to search no further  
Give you peace and joy  
Fill your life with happiness  
Don't you look no more  
'Cause I'm the One you're lookin' 4  
  
L-O-V-E love never meant that much to me  
'Til I saw your face  
I felt amazing grace  
But in the midnight hour  
When I held my pillow tight  
He wiped the tears so I could see  
This is what He said  
  
I never knew love could be so sweet  
The joy You give to me  
Peace and harmony  
I love You so  
More than you'll ever know  
What is this that I found, that  
Never, never lets me down  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
What you want  
I've got it  
What you need, I'm the One you're lookin' 4  
It's yours  
I'm the One you're lookin' 4
