Where's this come from? he's just as  
Where's this come from  
He's just as dumb  
As he denies  
  
He never lies  
Her new disguise  
Is butterflies  
  
I'm all sick for you  
I'm not a fool  
You're the one that bothers me  
I am not a fool  
You're the one pretending to be  
  
I die for some  
Rare pelicans  
In wonderland  
  
If she was true  
She'd make them blue  
Everytime (yeah it goes)  
  
Where's this come from  
He's just as dumb  
As he denies
