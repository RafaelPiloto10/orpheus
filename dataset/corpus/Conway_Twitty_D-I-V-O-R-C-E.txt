Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man  
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand  
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R-P-R-I-S-E  
But the words we're hiding from him now  
Tears the heart right out of me.  
  
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today  
You and little J-O-E will be going away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E.  
  
Watch him smile he thinks it's Christmas or his fifth birthday  
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurtin' words  
Then turn my head when I speak  
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt  
That's dripping down my cheeks.  
  
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today  
You and little J-O-E will be going away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E...
