In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you standing there  
In a sea of emotion with faithful devotion you were there  
In heat of the night under the street lights once again  
At the edge of the fire for the love of the jungle again and again, oh yeah  
  
They can't tame the lion  
Can't tame the lion  
They can't tame the lion  
  
One night in Detroit, yes I swear I saw you standing there  
In a summer of dreams down by the river you were there  
I remember it's all so clear  
In the midst of a dream, yes I swear I say you standing there  
  
They can't tame the lion  
Can't tame the lion  
They can't tame the lion  
  
In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you standing there  
In a sea of emotion with faithful devotion you were there  
I remember it's all so clear  
In the embers of reckless years  
  
In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you standing there  
They can't tame the lion  
Can't tame the lion  
They can't tame the lion  
At the edge of the fire, for the love of the jungle  
They can't tame the lion  
Can't tame the lion  
They can't tame the lion
