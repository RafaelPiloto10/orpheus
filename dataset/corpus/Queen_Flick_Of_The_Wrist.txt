Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says  
I'll have you seeing double (double)  
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied  
Simply with those eyes, ooh ooh ooh  
Synchronize your minds and see  
The beast within him rise  
  
Don't look back  
Don't look back  
It's a rip-off  
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby  
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out  
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head  
He's taken an arm and taken a leg  
All this time honey  
Baby you've been had  
  
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying  
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble  
Prostitute yourself he says  
Castrate your human pride, ooh ooh ooh  
Sacrifice your leisure days  
Let me squeeze you till you've dried  
  
Don't look back  
Don't look back  
It's a rip-off, aah, aah, aah  
  
Work my fingers to my bones  
I scream with pain  
I still make no impression  
Seduce you with his money-make machine  
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money money)  
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine  
Then the last goodbye  
It's a rip-off  
  
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby  
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out  
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head  
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg  
All this time honey  
Baby you've been had
