I was drivin' around in Old Mexico.  
I got lost didn't know what way to go.  
I was confused, It was late and I was in the fog,  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
  
I felt that smoosh and I said oh Mama.  
My lowrider squished that little Chihuahua.  
I pray for forgiveness and I sin to my god.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
  
If I am caught they will lock me in a cell with 20 locks.  
Unless I can pin it on Jack in The Box.  
I'll be wipped then beaten and then I will be flogged.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
  
His last words were yakey aro el medico.  
I flattened that pup, to hell I will go.  
I should have not gone driving and went for a jog.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.
