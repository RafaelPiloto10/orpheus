Lately we've been talking 'bout who we are  
Seems we don't know anymore  
And all this time that we've been thinking  
At night I've been dreamin' about you  
And I know you don't believe me when I say  
I'll love you till the end forever and a day  
I guess we'll never know  
Exactly where this river is gonna flow  
And I guess we'll never understand  
Until we reach that promised land  
So I guess we'll  
I guess we'll never know  
People say that we're sweethearts  
They say nothing in the world could tear us apart  
Well, I don't know about you  
But this thing we're going through is tearin' me in two  
And I know you don't believe me when I say  
I'll love you till the end forever and a day
