Where did they go?  
When did they come from?  
What has become of them now?  
  
How much was the leakage  
From the drain in the night  
And who are those dudes in the  
Back seat of calvin's car?  
  
Where did they go?  
When they got off the car?  
Did they go get sandwich  
And eat in the dark?
