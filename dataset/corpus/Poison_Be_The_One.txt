So you want to talk about the pain  
Talk to me, please explain  
Maybe I know what your going through  
  
You got so much pain to hide  
You keep it locked up deep inside  
In a room no one gets to  
  
I can't feel the way you feel  
Maybe i, I've got those same scars, same scars to heal  
Wish you've got to understand  
I want to be the only man to  
Ever touch you baby  
To ever  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there should the sun go down  
Lift you up to a higher ground  
Let me in, let me be the one  
I'll be there should you fall from grace  
Wipe those tear drops from your face  
I see no more damage done  
Baby, baby,  
Just let me be the one  
  
I want to be the one to show to you?  
Should the rains come down  
Never let you drown  
I'll pull you through  
  
I want to hear you when you scream  
Be your prince when you dream  
Hold you close when you cry  
  
I said  
I want to feel your love, your hate  
Should you be lost, I'll bear your cross of pain  
Love seal your fate  
I'll comfort you in fits of rage  
I'll be the book you can turn the page, and  
I'll still love baby  
I'll still  
  
Chorus  
  
I gotta touch you I'll see no more damage done  
You gotta let me  
  
Solo  
  
I hear the hurt I hear the scars  
You can lay your hand right down across my heart  
Then you'll learn to understand  
I want to be the only man to  
Ever touch you baby, ever touch you baby ever  
  
Chorus  
  
I'll be calm in fits of rage  
Hold you close in times of pain  
I see more damage done  
Baby, baby, you got to let me be the one
