Forgiving him  
Was the first thing I had to to  
In order to move on  
Forgetting it was not as easy to do  
I had to teach myself to be strong  
And its so easy to be scared  
When I think of all that I shared  
When I think of how it made me feel  
The bad and the good sometime I wish I can take it back  
But we cant go back gotta keep moving  
  
Its all good  
Don't wanna hear no would coulda  
Maybe I shoulda  
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true  
Its all good now that I'm going for what  
Now that I'm growing now that I know enough  
Never gonna give up on  
Never gonna give up on love  
Never gonna give up on love  
  
I have to admit  
You weren't the only one at fault  
I was at wrong to  
Trying to be someone I wasn't  
I thought I ca make myself happy with you  
And its so easy to be scared  
When I think of all that I shared  
  
When I think of how it made me feel  
The bad and the good sometime I wish I can take it back  
But we cant go back gotta keep moving  
Its all goodg  
Don't wanna hear no would coulda  
Maybe I shoulda  
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true  
Its all good now that I'm going for what  
Now that I'm growing now that I knowin  
Never gonna give up on (ohh ohh )  
Never gonna give up on love(ohh)  
Never gonna give up on love  
  
I knew was going to get through it  
Braking up is hard to do  
But I had to do it  
It had something to do with me figuring this out  
What this is all about  
When it came to me when it comes to me gotta do what best for me  
Its all good  
Don't wanna hear no woulda coulda  
Maybe I shoulda  
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true  
Its all good now that I'm going for what  
Now that I'm growing now that I knowing  
Never gonna give up on (ooh ooh )  
Never gonna give up on love(ooh)  
Never gonna give up on love
