(I love the way you say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way you mumble while you fumble for the key  
More time for kissing me  
(I love the way you say goodnight)  
I kinda like the way you linger with your finger on the bell  
More kisses and they're swell  
When you say gotta get home by twelve  
I always say let's go  
'cause you can take longer to say good night than any three others I know  
(Both) I love the way you say goodnight  
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb  
Mmmmmm I'm never never never going home  
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the way you always say) good
night  
(The way you always whisper honey nighty night)  
The way you let our kisses mingle 'til I tingle to my toes  
(giggle ... We're blushing like a rose)  
I love the way (I kinda like the way the extraordinary way) you say good night
(the way you always say don't go just hold me tight)  
I kinda like the way you giggle while you jiggle with your bag  
(sign ... our heart's are playing tag)  
When you say (we just got to be home by twelve)  
But don't I always say let's go 'cause you take longer to say good night than
any three others I know  
I love the way (I kinda like the way) you say (the super duper special way)
goodnight  
(The way you have me flying higher than a kite)  
I kinda like the way you snuggle while you juggle with your comb  
(It looks as though you're never going)  
No I'm never never never never never never gonna go home
