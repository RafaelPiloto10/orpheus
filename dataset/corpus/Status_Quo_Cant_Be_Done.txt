Everywhere I dare to go, the corners that I turn  
I'm sure to see a face I know, someone who doesn't earn  
That's all I ever get to hear is other people's woe  
Let's climb into a rocket and we'll press the one and go  
Although they say, it can't be done  
Don't say to me it can't be done  
Looking how we used to be, the way and what we wore  
The things we hoped that future held but always wanted more  
If God had meant for man to fly, he would have given wings  
He didn't, so we have to make the best of everything  
So let's not say it can't be done  
Although they say it can't be done  
Don't say to me everybody says it can't be done  
That there ain't no chance at all  
Anybody can be right or wrong  
When there ain't no chance at all  
Half the world is in a mess, the other half as well  
I've got a feelin' strange to me I wish that I could tell  
It won't be long before we push the button I am sure  
So throw away the key when I am locked behind the door  
You're telling me it can't be done  
Stop telling me it can't be done  
Don't say to me everybody says it can't be done  
That there ain't no chance at all  
Anybody can be right or wrong  
When there ain't no chance at all  
Half the world is in a mess, the other half as well  
I've got a feelin' strange to me I wish that I could tell  
It won't be long before we push the button I am sure  
So throw away the key when I am locked behind the door  
You're telling me it can't be done  
Stop telling me it can't be done  
Let's pray and pray it can be done  
Just pray and pray it can be done  
It can be done  
It can be done  
It can be done  
It can be done
