Take the time to make some sense  
Of what you want to say  
And cast your words away upon the waves  
Bring them back with Acquiesce  
On a ship of hope today  
And as they fall upon the shore  
Tell them not to fear no more  
Say it loud and sing it proud  
And they...  
  
Will dance if they want to dance  
Please brother take a chance  
You know they're gonna go  
Which way they want to go  
All we know is that we don't know  
What is gonna be  
Please brother let it be  
Life on the other hand won't let you understand  
Why we're all part of the masterplan  
  
I'm not saying right is wrong  
It's up to us to make  
The best of all things that come our way  
And all the things that came have past  
The answer's in the looking glass  
There's four and twenty million doors  
Down life's endless corridor  
Say it loud and sing it proud  
And they...  
  
Will dance if they want to dance  
Please brother take a chance  
You know they're gonna go  
Which way they want to go  
All we know is that we don't know  
What is gonna be  
Please brother let it be  
Life on the other hand won't let you understand  
Why we're all part of the masterplan
