Headin' up to San Francisco  
For the Labor Day weekend show,  
I've got my hush-puppies on,  
I guess I never was meant for  
Glitter rock and roll.  
And honey I didn't know  
That I'd be missin' you so.  
  
Come Monday It'll be all right,  
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.  
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze  
And I just want you back by my side.  
  
Yes it's been quite a summer,  
Rent-a-cars and west bound trains.  
And now you're off on vacation,  
Somethin' you tried to explain.  
And darlin' I love you so that's  
The reason I just let you go.  
  
Come Monday It'll be all right,  
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.  
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze  
And I just want you back by my side.  
  
I can't help it honey,  
You're that much a part of me now.  
Remember the night in Montana when  
We said there'd be no room for doubt.  
  
I hope you're enjoyin' the scenery,  
I know that it's pretty up there.  
We can go hikin on Tuesday,  
With you I'd walk anywhere.  
California has worn me quite thin,  
I just can't wait to see you again.  
  
Come Monday It'll be all right,  
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight.  
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze  
And I just want you back by my side.
