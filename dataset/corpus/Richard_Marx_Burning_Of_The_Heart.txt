One after one they give into the urge  
Caught by some hand of desire.  
Held by the feelings that brings them together.  
Its all a mystery. When will they learn.  
Its just emotion on fire.  
That soul taking, primitive, passion of nature.  
  
Chorus:  
I try to run. I try to never fall apart.  
But love takes pleasure from  
The burning of the heart  
Burning of the heart.  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher.  
And watching for questions I have in my mind.  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer.  
  
Chorus  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher  
And watching for questions I have in my mind  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer.
