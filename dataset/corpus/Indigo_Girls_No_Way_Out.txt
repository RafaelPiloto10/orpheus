As I was wading through your distance  
I heard you say theres no way out  
And I was just thinking as my independence faded  
Well theres no way in for me  
  
Theres no way out and you know  
Theres no way in  
Were on either side  
Scared to say were friends  
  
Now I found jesus and you found yourself  
Sometimes I still feel like I'm losing out  
But we both found that its just too hard to know for sure  
Just what we can lean on when were falling down  
  
You always did see  
The other side of things and sometimes  
I'm bound to wonder  
Do you see through me  
  
With all the voids I tried to fill  
And all the emptiness I tried to tell you about  
There was never time enough  
There are never words enough  
And Ill never have the guts enough  
But Ill tell you I've been needing you so bad  
  
Theres no way out and you know  
Theres no way in for me now  
And were on either side  
And were crying for a friend  
  
Theres no way out and you said  
Theres no way in for me now  
And were on either side  
And were scared to say were friends
