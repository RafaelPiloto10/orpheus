I just saw a picture, from the lost and found  
It was taken the day that we met  
With so many people around  
  
All my false bravado seemed to disappear  
So I just had to follow my heart  
I knew it would take me somewhere  
  
And I still feel the same  
But it's heart to explain  
All my emotions are tossed in the wind  
Lost 'til the moment, I hold you again  
  
When I say I love you  
When I say I need you  
When you say come closer  
I know I'll never leave you  
  
You can stare into heaven  
When your heart is free  
I suppose that we just couldn't wait  
For heaven is where we must be  
  
And we still feel the same  
No need to explain  
I don't see the shadows  
I don't feel the rain  
I'm walking in sunlight  
I'll tell you again  
  
When I say I want you  
When I say I need you  
When you say come closer  
I know I'll never leave you  
When I say I love you  
When you come closer  
I know I'll never leave you
