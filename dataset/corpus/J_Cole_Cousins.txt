[Verse: Bas]  
They putting prices on heads, silver or lead  
I pray the scores settle 'fore the devil notice you dead  
Got me smoking the potent, my eyes open and Otis, they red  
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said  
That aunty sippin on, we missin ya  
Even tho you gone, your thought alone can lift us up  
This is us  
Got some niggas that never call me unless they need something,  
But I pick up, like, "whassup, what you need cousin?"  
My niggas know that I love 'em  
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em  
Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow  
Used to borrow your digital scale  
Flippin' them sales  
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past  
Boy, trust me when I tell you, the picture got much bigger  
The swishers and dutch fill up  
Bitches in lust with us  
Momma would dissapprove, losing my way  
Lost in the sauce, this bolognese is so amazing  
Had a talk and she remark: "you so engaging"  
Running game, it's all the same  
I'm growing jaded  
Had a couple things in common, like Lonnie Lynn  
But I'm too faded for conversatin'  
I'm sittin' here contemplatin'  
  
[Hook: J Cole]  
Time keeps slipping away, away  
Another day another love song, hey  
Another day another love song, hey  
(X2)  
  
[Verse 2: J Cole]  
Yeah  
Cousin in jail again, asking me for bail again  
Close when I was 12, but I was much frailer then  
He was like 16, a nigga from the gutter and  
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and  
Here we are, runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and  
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then  
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home  
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone  
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'till he proved that wrong  
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song  
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now he buggin'  
Cause he looking at the cover and say "Damn yo that's my cousin"  
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't  
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden  
And I'm showing love saying "yo look what I did,  
Ain't nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big"  
But now you saying "Yo enough about you,  
Shit what about me, nigga what about me?  
Oh you forgot about me?  
Saying niggas showed you how to rap, now you don't know how to act  
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that  
Put me in a video, yo put me on your hottest track  
Bring me on the road with you, you know 'cuz got yo back  
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up  
I see you headed to the top you need to let me catch up  
Please let me catch up  
Won't you let me catch up man"  
I'll see you when I see you  
Harsh as it seems to say, I wouldn't want to be you  
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God  
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you  
  
[Hook:]
