Ain't just your kiss, K-I-S-S, that I miss  
Ain't just the way that you squeeze me tight  
If there's a wish at the top of my list  
Is that you be there everyday and every night  
  
I found a new four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
I found a new four letter word  
Lust can kinda be nice  
But it ain't L-O-V-E  
  
Indeedy  
Alright  
  
And when the rush that I'm dreamin' of's not enough  
You touch and I can't control myself  
You put the glide back into my stride, oh yeah  
You move me like nobody else  
  
I found a new four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
I found a new four letter word  
Lust can kinda be nice  
But it ain't L-O-V-E  
  
Oh yeah  
Let me spell it out  
C'mon  
  
You're all I'm lookin' for  
You ain't the girl next door  
You're real and so much more  
You put me to shame  
And then you walk right in  
You know I can't explain  
Here come that lovin' thing  
All over again  
  
Live life just like a wild ride  
More like a landslide  
Take me away  
  
New four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
I found a new four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
New four letter word  
And baby, the sweetest sound that I ever heard  
New four letter word  
  
Hey  
Lust can kinda be nice  
But it ain't L-O-V-E
