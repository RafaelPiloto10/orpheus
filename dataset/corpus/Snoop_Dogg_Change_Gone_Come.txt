When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer [Repeat: x4]  
  
Ahh, used to be a hard kid  
Rhyme a rhyme and tap this  
Sippin' silver satin while we smoked on the pin head  
A couch was a nigga bed  
  
Mary kept a nigga fed  
Twenty first a nigga, yeah that's where a nigga live  
I'm on the GA and fucked the D.A.  
Why? Cause the railroad the homie easy  
  
And just cause the didn't know what (Whasup)  
I'm on a motherfuckin mission to come up, come up  
  
[Chorus]  
[1]- I feel like givin' it up  
We all like livin' it up [Repeat: x2]  
  
[2]- When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer  
[Part 1 overlaps Part 2]  
  
We are living in a world  
Where anything can go at anytime  
And if you ain't up on the game  
Then I suggest you rearrange  
  
'Cause change gone come  
And it ain't waitin' on no one  
They got me plottin' from the bottom  
With the ??? ain't no stopin'  
  
And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin'  
Is the to much to ask fo', oh no  
And I heard through the East side you spend to get some dough  
So when you get your funk, go take to the store  
  
Take it to daddy rap cause he's a professional  
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the floor  
Beach city rider you know, for sure  
You see that what flossin' is all about  
  
The tightest rider gone turn it out  
Bouncin', swirving and looking cute  
Dogg Pound out the moon, Johnny longing for soup  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'  
How can I be patience?  
Look at what I'm facin'  
They ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station  
  
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration  
Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge  
Of all judges budge this  
And put it in perspective all praises due, true  
  
We are living in a world  
Where anything can go at anytime  
And if you ain't up on the game  
Then I suggest you rearrange  
  
'Cause change gone come  
And it ain't waitin' on no one  
For all the drama I done went through  
To get this to ya  
  
How do I think I was gone do ya  
Have you been mislead, since I asked you all to creep with me  
You coulndn't be cause ever since its been DP  
LB-B.S chronic in my chest  
  
Deathrow doggystyle holding down the west  
With a shot of what gangstas drink  
And a took off for a choke off, the most kept my G's off a toast  
And keep LBC singing y'all, DP ginging y'all  
  
We and y'all face it all  
Times living it up  
Snoop Dogg again and you know I'm just giving it up  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When Doggy Dogg comes  
You better answer (you better answer) [Repeat: x15]
