Love isn't just  
Somethin' to try  
No "act" of love  
Can satisfy  
You've got to believe  
It's live or die  
To ask yourself the question  
"How can love survive?"  
  
And if we try  
And it don't work out  
Like so many people do  
It's just a fact of life  
No we ain't in charge  
There ain't nothin' that's wrong with me  
Ain't nothin' that's wrong with you  
  
Chorus:  
  
Love's got Nothin' to Prove  
It's not up to you  
Two souls come into a world made  
Of time and space  
Searchin' for the truth  
With nothin' but love to prove  
And find it in the gift of  
A moment of grace  
  
Your heart is broken  
'Cause your love was untrue  
You're asking God  
"Oh why you?"  
  
Oh was it crazy  
Givin' all of you?  
You ask yourself the question  
"What more could I do?"  
  
Bridge and Chorus  
  
There's always somebody to tell you how  
You were a fool who jus' believed too much  
But in the end the fool, you'll come to know  
Is not the one who loved
