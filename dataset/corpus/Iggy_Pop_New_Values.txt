I'm healthy as a horse  
But everything is spinnin'  
And if I use a gun I'm sure to go to prison  
I'm stubborn as a mule  
And nobody breaks my rules  
But nothin' comes my way.  
  
I've got a hard-ass pair of shoulders  
I've got a love you can't imagine  
Yeah, and what I got I double  
I swear I'm keepin' out of trouble.  
  
I'm lookin' for one new value  
I'm lookin' for one new value  
But nothing comes my way.  
  
We live in the same world  
  
But nothin' comes my way.
