(sambora, foster, morolda)  
  
All alone in the dark  
No walls no windows  
Trying hard to define  
Heaven from hell  
Standing out in the rain  
With just one shadow  
Nothing to see or believe  
Beyond myself  
See my life going by  
Each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
All alone with my fears  
No words are spoken  
A story yet to be told  
Locked in my mind  
Hope is somewhere ahead  
Shining brightly  
But the past is always following close behind  
See my life going by, each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
Leading the way, leading the way
