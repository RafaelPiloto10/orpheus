Lately you've changed  
Acting so strange  
If something's wrong  
Don't drag it on  
  
'Cause each time I phone  
You're never home  
Each time we meet out on the street  
You hardly speak  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby are we near the end  
I know baby something's in the wind  
So why pretend  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby tell me what it is  
Something baby is blowing in the wind  
Out in the wind  
  
Nothing has changed  
That's what you say  
So how come each date  
You turn up late  
  
You say I'm wrong  
Your love's still strong  
So how come each kiss  
Means less and less  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby are we near the end  
I know baby something's in the wind  
So why pretend  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby tell me what it is  
Something's baby is blowing in the wind  
Out in the wind
