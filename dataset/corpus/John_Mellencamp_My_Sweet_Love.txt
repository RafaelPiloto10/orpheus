Sweet love standing at my gate  
Oh my sweet love  
It sure would feel good to feel good again  
Oh my sweet love  
  
You say that you need me  
You'll always believe me  
Oh my sweet love  
That our love is forever  
We'll always be together  
Oh my sweet love  
  
You say you'll always come through  
There's nothing that you won't do  
Oh my sweet love  
But I've heard it all before  
I can't beg you anymore  
Oh my sweet love  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the woman who knows exactly what she's doing  
You're the girl who ate the apple off the tree  
When you're good you're just crazy, when you're bad you're too much  
  
You say you'd never hurt me  
You'll never desert me  
Oh my sweet love  
That your words are always true  
I can depend on you  
Oh my sweet love  
  
When you get in the wind  
And all the storms begin  
Oh my sweet love  
When you're sad and dismantled  
And all your senses rattled  
Oh my sweet love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sweet love standing at my gate  
Oh my sweet love  
It sure would feel good to feel good again  
Oh my sweet love
