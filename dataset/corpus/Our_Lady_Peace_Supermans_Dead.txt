Do you worry that you're not liked  
How long till you break  
You're happy cause you smile  
But how much can you fake  
An ordinary boy an ordinary name  
But ordinary's just not good enough today  
  
Alone I'm thinking  
Why is superman dead  
Is it in my head  
We'll just laugh instead  
  
You worry about the weather and  
Whether or not you should hate  
Are you worried about your faith  
Kneel down and obey  
You're happy you're in love  
You need someone to hate  
An ordinary girl an ordinary waist  
But ordinary's just not good enough today  
  
Alone I'm thinking  
Why is superman dead  
Is it in my head  
We'll just laugh instead  
  
Doesn't anybody ever know that the world's a subway
