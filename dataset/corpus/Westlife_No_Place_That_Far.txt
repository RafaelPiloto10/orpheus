I can't imagine any greater fear  
Than waking up without you here  
And though the sun would still shine on  
My whole world would all be gone  
But not for long  
  
If I had to run  
If I had to crawl  
If I had to swim a hundred rivers  
Just to climb a thousand walls  
Always know that I would find a way  
To get to where you are  
There's no place that far  
  
It wouldn't matter why we're apart  
Lonely months, two stubborn hearts  
Nothing short of God above  
Could turn me away from your love  
I need you that much  
  
If I had to run  
If I had to crawl  
If I had to swim a hundred rivers  
Just to climb a thousand walls  
Always know that I would find a way  
To get to where you are  
There's no place that far
