Why's does it feel like night today?  
Something in here's not right today  
Why am I so uptight today?  
Paranoia's all I got left  
I don't know what stressed me first  
Or how the pressure was fed  
But I know just what it feels like  
To have a voice in the back of my head  
It's like a face that I hold inside  
A face that awakes when I close my eyes  
A face that watches everytime I lie  
A face that laughs everytime I fall  
(And watches everything)  
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim  
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
Hey yo  
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind  
But I find myself in places with names but no faces  
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees  
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed  
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall  
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all  
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name  
I need somebody to help me out of the flames  
  
All I'm trying to do is just master me  
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat  
But something keeps talking to me consciously  
Responsibly it keeps haunting me  
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya  
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia  
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose  
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse  
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead  
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin  
  
The face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin  
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!  
  
The sun goes down  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun goes down  
  
It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)  
I feel the light betray me  
The sun  
  
Can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin  
  
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back  
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head  
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within  
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin
