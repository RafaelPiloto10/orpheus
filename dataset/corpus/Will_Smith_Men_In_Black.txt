Hohh!  
  
Here come the Men In Black  
It's the MIB's, uh, here come the MIB's  
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black  
They won't let you remember  
  
Nah nah nah.  
The good guys dress in black, remember that  
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact  
The title held by me, MIB  
  
Means what you think you saw, you did not see  
So don't blink be what was there is now gone  
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on  
Walk in shadow, move in silence  
  
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence  
But yo we ain't on no government list  
We straight don't exist - no names and no fingerprints  
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back  
  
'Cause you never quite know where the MIBs is at  
Uh, eh  
  
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black  
Galaxy defenders.  
  
Oho oho oho  
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black  
They won't let you remember  
  
Aha, aha  
Now, From the deepest of the darkest night  
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight  
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom  
  
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up  
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses  
Hypnotizer, neuralizer  
Vivid memories turn to fantasies  
  
Ain't no MIBs, can I please  
Do what we say, that's they way we kick it  
D'ya know what I mean  
I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya  
  
We're your first, last and only line of defense  
Against the worst scum of the universe  
So don't fear us, cheer us  
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're fearless  
  
MIB's freezin' up all the flack  
What's that stand for? Men In Black  
  
The Men In Black  
The Men In Black  
  
Let me see ya just bounce it with me  
Just bounce with me  
Just bounce it with me  
Come on, let me see ya just slide with me  
  
Just slide with me  
Just slide with me  
Come on, let me see ya take a walk with me  
Just walk with me  
  
Take a walk with me  
Come on, and make your neck work  
Now freeze  
  
Ohhhhhhhhoh  
  
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black  
Galaxy defenders. Ohh, Ooohh  
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black  
They won't let you remember. Oh nohh  
  
Alright check it  
Let me tell you this in closing  
I know we might seem imposing  
But trust me, if we ever show in your section  
  
Believe me, it's for your own protection  
'Cause we see things that you need not see  
And we be places that you need not be  
So go on with your life  
  
Forget that Roswell crap  
Show love to the black suit, cause  
That's the Men In...  
That's the Men In...  
  
Here come the Men In Black, here they come  
Galaxy defenders. Galaxy defenders  
Here come the Men In Black, oho, here they come  
They won't let you remember. Won't let you remember  
  
Here come the Men In Black, ohh, here they come  
Galaxy defenders. Oho oho oho.  
Here come the Men In Black  
They won't let you remember
