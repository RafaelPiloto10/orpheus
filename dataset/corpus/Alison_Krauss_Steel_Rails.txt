Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind  
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back  
  
It's not the first time I've found myself alone and known  
If I really had you once, then I'd have you when I'm gone  
Whistle blows, blowin' lonesome in my mind  
Calling me along that never ending metal line  
  
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind  
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Sun is shining, through the open boxcar door  
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before  
I've lost count of the hours, days, and nights  
The rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind  
  
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind  
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back
