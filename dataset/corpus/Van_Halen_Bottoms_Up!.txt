I've been sitting here 'bout half the night.  
Oh, mama, fill my cup up.  
Said I came to waste some time.  
I think I'm gonna jump up.  
I'm singin', I'm dancin' most every night.  
And I want to do that with you babe.  
Let's do this bottle right.  
Oh, oh, baby, bottoms up.  
Pretty maids, all in a row, go on, set 'em up, up.  
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.  
I'm singin', I'm dancin' most every night.  
And I want to do that with you, babe.  
Let's do this bottle right.  
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.  
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.
