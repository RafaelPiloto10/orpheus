I'm singing Broadway and I love it!  
I'm singing Broadway and I'm proud!  
You can keep your Springsteen.  
Shove your Chaka.  
I really don't care for that kind of kaka.  
Ethel, Liza, Chita, that's my crowd, my crowd!  
  
Yes-sah, I'm singing Broadway and it's heaven!  
'Cause "Heaven" is a song from a Broadway show!  
Ah, just give me a part that's got laughter and tears  
And I'll beat it like Yul Brenner for the next thousand years!  
Ah, Broadway, Broadway, Broadway! Brrrrrravo!  
  
Ahhh, who needs a girl who's got flourescent hair,  
Or an ugly boy singing off key?  
Give me a broad who's got tits out to there,  
Belching it out to the balcony!  
  
AhhhAHHHHHHHH!!!!  
Yes, sir! I'm singing Broadway and it's heaven!  
I'll be singing Broadway, yes, 'til I die!  
Just tell me what could be better  
Than shaking your buns  
In front of a chorus  
Of thirty-five nuns?  
I'll climb every mountain  
And ford every river I see.  
A Lady and her muszack,  
Ha-that's ha-me! Yeah!
