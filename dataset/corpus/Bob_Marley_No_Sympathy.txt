I can't find  
  
[Chorus:]  
No love  
No sympathy  
What kind of love  
They've got for me  
  
I'm on my way  
To happiness  
Where I can find  
Some peace and rest  
  
When I'm in troubles yeah  
Only me only me feel the pain  
No one good word of advice  
From any of my so-called friends  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Might as well might as well  
I get out of hell  
Hell could never be made for me  
So I'm gonna search search  
'til I'm free  
  
No love no love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't find no love  
No no sympathy  
What kind(3x) of love  
They got(3x) for me  
  
They don't love themselves  
So they can't love no one else  
(2x)  
  
I just can't find(3x) no love  
I can't find(3x) no sympathy  
I can't find(3x) no love at all  
What kind of love(3x)  
People got for me  
  
I'm searchin'
