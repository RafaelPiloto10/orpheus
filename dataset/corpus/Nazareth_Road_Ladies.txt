Said, don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever get sad when you go out on the road?  
No, don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever get sad when you come here to seattle  
On a four day show of the tour  
And you got nothing but groupies and promotors to love you  
And a pile of laundry by the hotel door.  
Don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever make a young man blue?  
Don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever make a young man where he'll just wanna go back home?  
When the p.a. system eats it,  
And the band plays some of the most terriblest shit you've ever known.  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you.  
I swear someday I ain't never,  
I'm never gonna go out on the road again.  
I swear someday I ain't never, never, never, never,  
Never, never, never, never, never, never  
Gonna roam the country side.  
No more.  
I'm gonna hang up them ol' holiday inns, dude  
And watchin someone do it on the floor  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you.  
What the road ladies do to you!
