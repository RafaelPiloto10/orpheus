A red sun came rolling down a grey sky  
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then  
Started up singing sweet country lullaby  
You see that patch of city lights-  
Somewhere in there's Cotton Avenue-  
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight  
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes  
  
If you got a place like that to go  
You just have to go there  
If you got no place special  
Well then, you just go no place special  
  
I guess it's just the summer in the young blood  
Ripe and juicy in the young blood  
Teasing to go down to ...  
Cotton Avenue  
To hear the shiny shiny music  
See all the shiny people dancing to it  
Anytime you go to ...  
Cotton Avenue  
  
If you got a place like that to go  
You know you got to go there  
If you got no place special  
Well then, you just go no place special  
  
You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky  
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry  
To rhythm and blues  
On Cotton Avenue  
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street  
They got all the latest words  
They're dancing to the latest beat  
While they're hustling and sizing you  
On Cotton Avenue  
  
If you got a place like that to go  
You just have to go there  
If you've got no place special  
Well my dear  
You just so no place ... special
