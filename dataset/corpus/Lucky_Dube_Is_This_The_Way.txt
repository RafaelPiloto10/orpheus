Is this the way  
You want it to be  
Is this the way  
It's gonna be  
It's gonna be  
  
Oh my God, oh my God  
What we gonna do  
In this world  
In this world we live in  
In this world we live in  
  
I see these men  
Every day at the corner  
Of Queens and Commissioner  
Begging for a dollar every day  
Begging for a dime every day  
  
Trying to make a living  
Out there  
But it's so hard  
But it's so hard  
  
Begging for a dollar  
Begging for a dime  
Begging for a dollar  
Begging for a dime  
  
One of them  
Swallowed his pride  
His broken pride  
And came to me, he said  
I quit, I give up  
What are the rules  
What did I do to deserve this  
Begging for a dollar every day  
Begging for a dime every day  
Trying to make a living  
Out there  
  
Begging for a dollar  
Begging for a dime
