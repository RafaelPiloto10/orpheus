Luxury liner, forty tons of steel  
If I don't find my baby now  
I guess I never will  
I've been a long lost soul  
For a long, long time  
I've been around  
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind  
You think I'm lonesome, so do I  
So do I  
  
Well, I'm the kind of girl  
Who likes to make a livin' runnin 'round  
And I don't need a stranger  
To let me know my baby's let me down  
You think I'm lonesome, so do I  
So do I  
  
Luxury liner, forty tons of steel  
No one in this whole wide world  
Can change the way I feel  
I've been a long lost soul  
For a long long time  
I've been around  
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind  
You think I'm lonesome, so do I  
So do I
