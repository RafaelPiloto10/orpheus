I smell the fear that rains inside  
The thought of children who must oblige  
To tainted dreams and polluted seas  
The missing moon and melting trees  
  
A mist of doom and clouds of pain  
Toxic waste and acid rain  
The passing of our ignorance  
A lifetime spent in abstinence  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
  
Conditioning to hate and them to blame  
Their search for God is just the same  
Machines for hearts, how warped a view  
Forgetting that they're human too  
  
Waiting like a branded steer  
Who first will launch the burning spear  
When every day may be your last  
You think we'd learn from our past  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
  
I smell the fear that rains inside  
The thought of so many lives denied  
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag  
And rows and rows of body bags  
  
No time for tears as the night falls cold  
The days survivors crawl back in their holes  
As for the rest they're shipped back home  
Home to the rows of white tomb stones  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear
