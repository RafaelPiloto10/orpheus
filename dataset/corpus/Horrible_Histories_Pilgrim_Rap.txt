We're the pilgrim fathers  
You may have heard rather  
A lot 'bout our notions  
Crossing the ocean  
On the good ship Mayflower  
But it's true our journey  
Turned into quite a commotion.  
  
People report that we sported these hats  
But that's not true, I mean, would you?  
Anyway the main thing to say  
We began the usa  
Our little band of religion fans  
From the East Midlands.  
  
We all believed slowly  
That England was becoming less holy  
So set off for Holland  
Cause there we had friends  
But in the end seemed the Netherlands  
Would never be the land, we planned.  
  
Couldn't stand to remain on that terrain  
So again we rearranged  
To start a new nation with our congregation  
A new and calmer life took a farmer and a builder and his wife  
And a clerica, to find America.  
  
Oh it's a new world  
It wasn't new to the natives  
Still we thought we'd claim it  
Yeah, it's the new world.  
  
I still remember 9th of November  
The year 1620 and we saw plenty of land  
We thanked God when we found ground  
I kept calm but it didn't go as planned.  
  
Couldn't land on the sand  
A month later though, we made it  
New Plymouth man, we claimed it  
The natives said not  
But ran when we shot.  
  
Moved there it proved yeah  
That life would be tough  
Cause we didn't have enough  
Of the right stuff.  
Did you know had no seeds we could grow  
Although William Mullins had stacked  
126 pairs of shoes in his pack  
Now that's whack.  
  
A fishing rod, a plough,  
A pig, or a cow  
Would have been a much better idea  
But now there's no food for us to eat  
Does this mean that we'll meet with de feet!  
  
No fun in the new world  
I'm glad we've arrived here  
But will we survive here  
Yeah, in the new world.  
  
People were staving  
Our numbers halving  
And when the winter winds blew  
Even fewer live through  
It wasn't pretty in our new city  
But the natives took pity even though  
They didn't have to.  
  
Man called Squanto  
Showed us how to grow maize  
Catch eel for a meal  
Build shelter in the baze  
Tribe gave us a feast  
Our starvation ceased  
What they had done  
Turned us back from the dead  
To the living and to this day  
That's why we have thanks-giving.  
  
In Massachusetts built a colony it's true  
They say modern America was founded by our crew  
It's a new world  
But we can't call it England  
Let's call it New England  
Yeah, in the world.  
  
My home was in Plymouth  
Lets call it New Plymouth  
I got an idea let's call this New Hampshire  
Wait I'm from Newcastle  
Can we call it New Newcastle?  
Nah!  
It's a new world.
