Awful plastic boots that come above her ankle  
Dayglo mini skirts just like a pop art spangle  
Digs vanilla fudge buys lipstick by the pound  
Gets that 'English' look resembles Kath McGowan  
Have you seen her hair it's a style from heaven  
Ah! she's nowhere she thinking this is 1967?  
She's so square she's nowhere  
She's so square she's nowhere  
Take her to a disco and screaming Lord Sutch it!  
Everyone must look but nobody must touch  
What about her car? E type is the latest  
How about the Yardbirds? Jeff Beck is the greatest!!  
Have you seen her hair it's a style from heaven  
Ah! she's nowhere she thinking this is 1967?  
She's so square  
She's nowhere  
She's so square  
She's nowhere
