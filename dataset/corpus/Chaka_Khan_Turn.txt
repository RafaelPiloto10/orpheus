Chorus:  
  
Turn, Turn, Turn  
Turn, Turn, Turn  
Turn, Turn, Turn  
  
Verse 1  
  
Bring on all the seasons  
Repeat your earlier deeds  
Show the children your face  
Most of all teach them to...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Verse 2  
  
Bring on all the colors  
Don't let me forget for a moment  
What I have to do  
It's all so necessary for you to...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
We will rehearse long and hard  
For the big celebration  
Spread the leaders among us  
Like the heat's in the sun  
Like the blue is in the sky  
Like the peace in the eyes  
Of the believers of god  
  
Well if there's a will  
There's a way  
If we're strong it will pay  
Look at the babies all around us  
Like the moon in the night  
Like a bird takin flight  
Though this world is not right  
We got to show them the way...  
  
Repeat chorus
