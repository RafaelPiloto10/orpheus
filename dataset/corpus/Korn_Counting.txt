I can't bare to face what's growing in my head.  
Please get away from me.  
Take advantage of what I still guess you do.  
One day you'll pay for me.  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.  
  
You just see me as something you throw around.  
You were there for me (there for me).  
Beating down to the ground yes it always seems.  
You take more from me (from me).  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.  
  
It's funny how we get started.  
They get their money from the things on you.  
They get your money and the girls and the fame.  
I only do it for the fun.  
  
That's my game.  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.  
  
So I'm saying nothing.
