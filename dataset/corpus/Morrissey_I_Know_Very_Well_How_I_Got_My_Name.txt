A child in a curious phase  
A man with sullen ways  
Oh, I know very well how I got my name  
  
You think you were my first love  
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong  
You were the only one  
Who's come and gone  
  
When thirteen years old  
Who dyed his hair gold ?  
Oh, I know very well, I don't need to be told  
  
You think you were my first love  
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong  
You were the only one  
Who's come and gone  
  
You were the only one  
Who's come and gone
