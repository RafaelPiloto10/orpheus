My Monkey  
The World of Madness is a lot Bigger than the World of Sane  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkey's dead  
At least he looks that way  
But then again don't we all  
  
I'm the Pope, I'm ten times the pope, I'm a fifty times the Pope  
But I'm the Pope in the hills and in the mountains  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkey's dead...  
Yeah he's dead...  
Poor little monkey  
  
Lying down, on the ground, with his head stuffed under his arms  
My monkey my monkey my monkey bought the farm  
  
I play music, people are affected by the music I play  
That doesn't mean I direct the traffic  
That I put a knife in somebody's hand  
Tell them to go kill somebody...  
  
We are our own wicked gods  
With little g's and big dicks  
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise  
  
Heh heh yeah...  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkey's dead  
Dead... Dead my monkeys dead he's dead  
Now why why...  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkey's dead  
  
The primates scream of consonance is a reflection of his own minds dissonance  
  
Redrum!
