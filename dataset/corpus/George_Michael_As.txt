As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May  
Just as hate knows love's the cure  
You can rest your mind assured  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow  
But in passing will grow older every day  
Just as all is born is new  
Do you know what I say is true?  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Until the day is the day that are no more  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?  
Her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day?  
  
As today I know I'm living, but tomorrow  
Could make me the past  
But that I mustn't fear  
I know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  
Until we dream of life, and life becomes a dream  
Until the day is night, and night becomes the day  
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Until the day that is the day that are no more  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?  
Her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day?  
  
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May  
For now I know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  
Until we dream of life, and life becomes a dream  
  
Until the day is night, and night becomes the day  
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Until the day that is the day that are no more
