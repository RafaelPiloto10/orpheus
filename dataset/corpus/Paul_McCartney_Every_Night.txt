Every night I just want to go out,  
Get out of my head  
Every day I don't want to get up,  
Get out of my bed  
Every night I want to play out  
And every day I want to do ooh ooh oh oh  
But tonight I just want to stay in  
And be with you,  
And be with you.  
  
Ooh...  
Ooh...  
Believe me mama  
  
Every day I lean on a lamp post,  
I'm wasting my time  
Every day I lay on a pillow,  
I'm resting my mind  
Every morning brings a new day  
Every night that day is through  
Ooh ooh oh oh  
But tonight I just want to stay in  
And be with you,  
And be with you.  
  
Ooh...  
Ooh...  
Believe me mama ooh...  
Ooh...
