Anything for my baby  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby  
  
Oh  
I'm in love and it feels so good  
Cause I need her, don't mistreat her  
And I tell her so  
  
When I saw her and she looked my way  
I was lonely, she's my only  
And I've gotta say that  
  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby  
Crawl or kneel, anything for my baby  
  
In the morning when I raise my head  
She's beside me, she can hide me  
When I'm feelin' low  
  
If I'm thinkin' everything's all wrong  
My girl shakes me, she awakes me  
Then I really know that  
  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I'd wheel and deal anything for my baby  
Crawl or kneel, anything for my baby  
  
Don't you know that  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I would wheel and deal anything for my baby  
I would crawl or kneel, anything for my baby  
I'd do anything  
  
I would give anything for my baby  
I would die or live, anything for my baby  
I would t-t-t-t-take or give anything for my baby  
  
Yes, I would take anything for my baby  
I would build or break anything for my baby  
I would rob or take anything for my baby  
  
I would do anything for my baby  
I would steal anything for my baby  
I would wheel and deal
