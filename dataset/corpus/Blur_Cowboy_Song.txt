Gonna sail a bird like a private jet  
You're the one, you're the one  
In my head, oughta get us clear  
You'll find a song before too long  
I've got a healthy feeling,  
A sleepy feeling, a sleepy feeling  
Today is gone, the day is gone, today is gone  
Go to a store, to the golf floor  
A cowboy's song, a cowboy's song  
You're the one, you're the one  
A cowboy's song, you're the one  
I've got a healthy feeling,  
A sleepy feeling, a sleepy feeling  
It's all gone, today is gone, it's all gone  
I've got a sleepy feeling,  
A new slept feeling, a sleepy feel  
It's all gone, today is gone, today is gone
