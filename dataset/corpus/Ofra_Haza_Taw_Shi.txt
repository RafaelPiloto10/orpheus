The desert wind  
From the East  
Binding us together  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
The day has come to prove  
To prove your love  
Forever  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
Among the two  
I prefer you  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
Among the two  
You must come through  
Oh let me see you  
Set fire to the night  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Dance for me this dance  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Chant with me this chant  
So follow me  
Across the sand  
To where the music's playing  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
The sands will blow  
A thousand years  
The rythm still remains  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Dance for me Taw Shi  
Among the two  
I prefer you  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
Among the two  
You must come through  
Oh let me see you  
Set fire to the night  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Dance for me this dance  
Oh...oh...oh...oh...  
Chant with me this chant  
Oh, oh YAH YAH  
TAW SHI WA NADAR  
Oh, oh YAH YAH  
TAW SHI - YA YA YA  
TAW SHI - YA YA YA  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
TAW SHI - YA YA YA  
TAW SHI - YA YA YA  
Oh let me see you  
Set fire to the night  
TAW SHI - YA YA YA  
TAW SHI - YA YA YA  
I want to see you  
Set fire to the night  
Oh, oh YA YA YA!...
