In the shadows it awakes the desire  
But you know that you can't realize  
And the pressure will just keep rising  
Now the heat is on  
  
Its too late, there is no way around it  
You will see for yourself many times  
In the end you will give up the fight  
Unescapable  
  
'Cause you're losing your mind and you sleep  
In the heart of the lies  
  
Where is the edge  
Of your darkest emotions?  
Why does it all survive?  
Where is the light  
Of your deepest devotions?  
I pray that it's still alive  
  
It's the rule that you live by and die for  
Its the one thing you can't deny  
Even though you don't know what the price is  
It was justified  
  
So much more that you've got left to fight for  
But it still doesn't change who you are  
There is no fear you'll ever give in to  
You're untouchable  
  
'Cause you're losing your mind and you sleep  
In the heart of the night  
  
Where is the edge  
Of your darkest emotions?  
Why does it all survive?  
Where is the light  
Of your deepest devotions?  
I pray that it's still alive  
  
You can't stop yourself  
Don't want to feel  
Don't want to see what you've become  
You can't walk away  
From who you are  
Never give in  
  
Where is the edge  
Of your darkest emotions?  
Why does it all survive?  
Where is the light  
Of your deepest devotions?  
I pray that it's still alive
