Standin' in the doorway, forgot to say one thing  
You've always had the power to lift my wings  
I know I shouldn't need so much, an' we could say goodbye  
Oh yes I am a dreamer, I still see us flyin' high  
  
We can start over, darlin' it's clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
  
Somethin' brings us together, keeps tearin' us apart  
The wounded are much wiser, we'll just take it from the start  
  
We can start over, darlin' it's clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
  
We can start over, darlin' it's clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
Don't Walk Away  
Don't Walk Away!  
  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Oh, Don't Walk Away, Don't Walk Away  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, turn around, you won't be, you won't be alone
