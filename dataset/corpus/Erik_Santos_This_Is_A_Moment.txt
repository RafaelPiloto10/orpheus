This is the moment!  
This is the day,  
When I send all my doubts and demons  
On their way!  
  
Every endeavor,  
I have made - ever  
Is coming into play,  
Is here and now - today!  
  
This is the moment,  
This is the time,  
When the momentum and the moment  
Are in rhyme!  
  
Give me this moment  
This precious chance  
I'll gather up my past  
And make some sense at last!  
  
This is the moment,  
When all I've done  
All the dreaming,  
Scheming and screaming,  
Become one!  
  
This is the day  
See it sparkle and shine,  
When all I've lived for  
Becomes mine!  
  
For all these years,  
I've faced the world alone,  
And now the time has come  
To prove to them  
I've made it on my own!  
  
This is the moment  
My final test  
Destiny beckoned,  
I never reckoned,  
Second Best!  
  
I won't look down,  
I must not fall!  
This is the moment,  
The sweetest moment of them all!  
  
This is the moment!  
Damn all the odds!  
This day, or never,  
I'll sit forever  
With the gods!  
  
When I look back  
I will recall  
Moment for moment  
This was the moment  
The greatest moment of them all
