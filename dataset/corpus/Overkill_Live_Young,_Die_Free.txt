The distant sound of mercy ringing in my eyes.  
Far from the masses fades away.  
Closed my eyes and waited for the pain to pass,  
Recalled a little story heard today  
  
Yeah, I'm feeling trapped,  
So locked away,  
Caught in a downward spiral  
In, into the black,  
I won't be back,  
Yeah I'll be here a while  
  
Don't need to see, your face.  
Don't need to hear a word you say,  
Don't need to know, your name,  
Or why you're here  
  
Shadows of the past appear in front of me.  
Into the masses disappear.  
The sound of silence ringing for a greater good,  
To this point I can't believe my ears  
  
Yeah, coming unwrapped,  
Starting to fray.  
Walking the final mile  
In, into the black,  
I won't back,  
Choose to be here a while  
  
Then I saw your face,  
And I heard the words you said.  
Then I recalled your name,  
And why I'm here  
  
When I look into your eyes an' saw how much you cried,  
An' I had a revelation.  
The pain wouldn't pass, the scars they would last,  
Into God's creation.  
Blessed secrets holding me  
Then we all closed our eyes, an' laid down and sighed:  
  
Live young die free!  
  
A distant chime of mercy ringing one last time.  
Into the masses turns to clay  
Molded into what is now, the greater good  
To close the story yesterday  
  
Don't need to see your face,  
Don't need to hear a word you say.  
Don't need to know your name,  
Or why you're here  
  
Then a child of a liar put his hands into the fire,  
Called it discontention.  
And a man with the word repeated what he heard,  
Led to mass confusion.  
Blessed secrets, agony  
Then the child closed his eyes and laid down and died.  
  
Live young die free.
