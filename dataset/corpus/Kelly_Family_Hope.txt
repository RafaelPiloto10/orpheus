I remember a state of suicide  
Standing out a window opened wide  
Hold on hold on I heard a voice inside  
I've come back to my childhood happiness  
The grace of God has filled my emptiness  
Hold on hold on  
  
There is hope in my soul  
There is hope, there is hope for me now  
  
See my generation lost in lies  
Growing up in broken household fights  
Hold on hold on to the voice inside  
Hidden heroes don't get televised  
Daily saving their lost brothers lives  
Hold on hold on  
  
There is hope in  
Our soul  
There is hope, there is hope for us all  
  
No, no I didn't learn, no I didn't learn  
'til my hands got burned  
No we never learn, no we never learn  
Until our fingers burn  
There is hope in my soul  
There is hope, there is hope for me now  
There is hope in  
Our soul  
There is hope, there is hope, for us all  
  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
Purified hearts will feel the presence of God's eternal
