Now just look, the whole tow-own  
Has turned out today  
To say a last prayer for me  
And Lord only knows  
How surprised they would be  
If they knew I could see them  
And I could hear what they say  
Whoa, if they knew I could see them  
And I could hear what they say  
  
Some say I was a good ma-an  
Some disagree-ee-ee  
Some folks are sad  
So-ome are glad  
To see the last of me-ee-ee  
I know I was happy ma-an  
Most of my day-ay-ays  
And through it all  
If I had a time or two  
It was worth it to me  
  
I'm the last of my fam'ly  
So I'm takin' my name  
No children do I leave behi-i-ind  
To sing Rock Of Ages  
For an old warn out cowboy  
You can take away my body  
But the spirit is mine  
Woh, you can take away my body, yeah  
But the spirit is mine  
  
Some say I was a good ma-an  
And some disagree-ee-ee  
Some folks are sad  
And some are glad  
To see the last of me-ee-ee  
I know I was happy ma-an  
Most of my day-ay-ays  
And through it all  
If I had a time or two  
It was worth it to me  
  
Some say I was a good ma-an  
Some dis-a-gree...
