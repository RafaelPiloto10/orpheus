Sometimes I wonder who's makin' love to you now  
Now that it's been so long  
Yes, sometimes I wonder who's makin' love to you now  
Now that it's been so long  
Well, I don't know how or when you found out  
Where that love's been gone  
Remember that winter we went walkin' in the snow  
Now it's been and gone  
Yes, I remember that winter we went walkin' in the snow  
Snow that's been and gone  
And right across the country still I've got to go  
Wherever that love's been gone  
But any old way there's a smile on my face  
There's a smile that I just can't hide  
Though I'm missin' you now like I, like I never knew how  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  
Don't it make you wonder but I wouldn't worry no more  
Standing by the side of the road  
Oh, don't it make you wonder but I wouldn't worry no more  
Just standing by the side of the road  
Into the night you just pick up and go  
You will see where that love's been gone  
But any old way there's a smile on my face  
There's a smile that I just couldn't hide  
Though I'm missing you now like I, like I never knew how  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  
I couldn't forget you, I couldn't forget you  
I couldn't forget you if I tried  
I couldn't forget you, I couldn't forget you  
I couldn't forget you if I tried
