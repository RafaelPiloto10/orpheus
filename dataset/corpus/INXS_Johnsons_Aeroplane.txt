Four long lines one darker than the rest  
Each one has a purpose making borders on the land  
Farmer's pride you know he works real hard  
From a small aeroplane you can see the fields  
  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
  
A place to work and grow [Repeat: x4]  
  
Four long years one leaner than the rest  
The animals are fed and the pasture's dry  
Farmer's pride if the weather doesn't lie  
From a small aeroplane you can see the sea  
Lots of blue, very deep blue  
  
A place to work and grow [Repeat: x4]  
  
Johnson sees the fields from all the sides  
Steel machines and black tar roads  
Countryside where the spirit never dies  
In his face all the history shows  
Farmer's pride as the rains came down  
  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
Heart shaped hedges  
Japanese gardens  
  
A place to work and grow  
A place to work and grow
