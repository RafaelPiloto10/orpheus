I've seen it happen too many times  
And just where it starts I don't know  
You're traveling steady but you don't see the signs  
That tell you there's a fork in the road  
And you don't think it's right but you're both turnin' away  
And the ending is always the same  
When suddenly parallel lives drift apart  
And there's no one accepting the blame  
But girl you and I we got too much too lose  
By one of us saying goodbye  
And I see it clearly we're both meant to be  
But you got that look in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't go, don't go  
Cause you might regret everything  
When you wake up on your own  
Oh no, I'm not lettin' go  
And I never will surrender what we got together  
  
Layin' beside you I can't sleep at all  
Wonderin' what your thinkin' inside  
Will I wake up and find that  
You've made up your mind to  
Go it alone for awhile  
And don't say it's present when it's all in the past  
You gotta stop lookin' behind  
And take everything as it comes for today is  
The first day of the rest of your life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't go, oh never say goodbye, Don't go  
Oh no, you got that look in your eyes  
I've seen it before, you're gonna walk out that door  
  
[Chorus: x2]
