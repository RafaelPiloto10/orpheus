Too proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit, and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
Now it's gone away  
(There's nothing to fear)  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
It's gone away  
  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinstate your former state of mind  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinvent yourself with space and time  
  
Your name is kin to the winds, sister  
You're kin to the winds, sister  
But you've an alabaster frame  
  
And you're too proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit, and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
Now it's gone away  
(There's nothing to fear)  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
It's gone away  
  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinstate your former state of mind  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinvent yourself with space and time  
  
Your name is kin to the stars, sister  
You're kin to the stars, sister  
But now your perfect body's maimed  
  
Still you're to proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit, and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
Now it's gone away  
(There's nothing to fear)  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
It's gone away  
  
Concentrate
