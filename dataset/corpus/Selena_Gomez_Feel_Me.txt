[Verse 1]  
No one love you like I love you  
I never cheated, never lied  
I never put no one above you  
I gave you space and time  
And now you're telling me you miss me  
And I'm still on your mind  
We were one in a million  
Our love is hard to find  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Do you stay up late just so you don't dream?  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit lonely?  
Nights get a little bit colder?  
Heartbeat a little bit louder?  
Days get a little bit longer?  
Nights get a little bit colder?  
Heartbeat a little bit louder?  
  
[Verse 2]  
When you're running, who you run to?  
Where do you go to hide?  
When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night  
I won't be caught up in the middle  
Through your highs and your lows  
Baby, 'long as you're not with me, you'll always be alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit lonely?  
Nights get a little bit colder?  
Heartbeat a little bit louder?  
Days get a little bit longer?  
Nights get a little bit colder?  
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
