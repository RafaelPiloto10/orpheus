Wake up, wake up, my God,  
This is not a test and it's not too late to come lean  
Get it off your chest  
So steady your hand before your face and concentrate  
There's got to be some stable ground left to walk on  
  
So tear another page from the book  
Are you asleep or just alone  
Clear this room from your lungs  
And pull yourself together man  
  
On your back, you're sleeping in a bed of shame  
Let the light breathe some new life into this room  
It's what keeps you coming back  
Made up of instaiable taste  
Bury your head in your hands and sink into yourself  
  
Just what are you so afraid of  
You're staring truth in the face, so come on down  
  
You're busy living now aren't you  
You're busy making vows  
You're coming unglued  
Time is shorter than you kknow  
I know the light is blinding to the naked eye,  
So why don't you take steps away from being alone  
I swear it's not too late for you  
  
It's all worth reaching for the hand to pull you out  
Wake up and step outside your box  
Wake up
