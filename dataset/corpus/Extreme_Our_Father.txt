Oh daddy, please  
Take me with you where you goin'?  
Oh daddy, please  
Come find the time, come watch us growin'  
Oh daddy, please  
Don't leave there's so much that we want to know before you go  
Well I'm in need of someone to tie my shoes  
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Oh daddy, please  
I pray every night the doors will open  
Oh daddy, please  
This house is just a broken home  
Left all alone  
Well I'm in need of someone to tie my shoes  
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Let me tell you 'bout  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Oh daddy, no  
Oh daddy, no  
Don't run away, yea  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't you hear me  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Lets talk 'bout  
Our father  
Yea, yea  
Far father  
Yea, I know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Far father
