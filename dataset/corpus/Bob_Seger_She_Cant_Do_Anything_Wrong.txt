Sixteen years and she lets 'em show  
Little bitty queen dancin' on the floor  
High heeled shoes keep her right on time  
Body makes a little boy lose his mind  
And she knows  
She Can't Do Anything Wrong  
  
Music's hot and the night is loud  
Rhythm from the band burnin' through the crowd  
Little sixteen she's goin' strong  
She loves to rock and roll it all night long  
And she knows  
She Can't Do Anything Wrong  
  
Every daddy's son wants a closer look  
Every boy want to try to set his hook  
She likes playin' numbers if it takes all night  
If she goes home alone it'll be alright  
  
Workin' hard tryin' to make it last  
She's too young to even have a past  
The only child of a mother who prayed  
That her daughter wouldn't never turn out this way  
And she knows  
She Can't Do Anything Wrong  
  
Every daddy's son wants a closer look  
Every boy want to try to set his hook  
She likes playin' numbers if it takes all night  
If she goes home alone it'll be alright  
  
Sixteen years and she lets 'em show  
Little bitty queen dancin' on the floor  
She knows She Can't Do Anything Wrong
