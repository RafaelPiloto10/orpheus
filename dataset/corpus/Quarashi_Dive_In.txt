Someday I will dive me in. Someday I will take a spin.  
Someday I will make it right. Someday I will stop the fight.  
  
It has been thought, it's been thought  
  
I found a god that can teach. Take me along, once again on  
that trip. Bring it on and when I'm gone, bite your lip. Is it to  
good to be secure? Maybe I should, I think I should find the  
cure. It's been thought before.  
  
I found a god that can teach. Someday you will dive in.  
Someday you will dive in. It's been thought before. It's been  
thought before.
