Money is the anthem, of success, so before we go out,  
What's your address?  
  
I'm your National Anthem, God, you're so handsome  
Take me to the Hamptons Bugatti Veyron  
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon, hold me for ransom, upper echelon  
He says to "be cool" but, I don't know how yet, wind in my hair,  
Hand on the back of my neck  
I said, "Can we party later on?" he said, "Yes."  
  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Ooh yeah baby bow down, makin' me so wild
now)  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Sugar sugar, how now, take your body
downtown)  
Red, white, blue's in the skies, summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in
your eyes  
I'm your National Anthem  
  
Money is the reason we exist  
Everybody knows it, it's a fact-kiss, kiss!  
  
I sing the National Anthem,  
While I'm standing over your body hold you like a python  
And you can't keep your hands off me, or your pants on  
See what you've done to me give me Chevron  
You said to "be cool" but, I'm already coolest  
I said to "get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?"  
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds  
  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Ooh yeah baby bow down, makin' me so wild
now)  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Sugar sugar, how now, take your body
downtown)  
Red, white, blue's in the skies, summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in
your eyes  
I'm your National Anthem  
  
It's a love story for the new age,  
For the six page, we're on a quick, sick rampage  
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin', excessive buyin',  
Overdose and dyin' on our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage  
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake  
God can only, I need somebody to hold me  
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell  
Keep me safe in his bell, tower, hotel  
  
Money is the anthem of success  
So put on mascara, and your party dress  
  
I'm your National Anthem, boy put your hands up, give me a standing ovation,  
Boy you have landed, babe in the land of, sweetness and danger, Queen of
Saigon  
  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Ooh yeah baby bow down, makin' me so wild
now)  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Sugar sugar, how now, take your body
downtown)  
Red, white, blue's in the skies, summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in
your eyes  
I'm your National Anthem  
  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success
