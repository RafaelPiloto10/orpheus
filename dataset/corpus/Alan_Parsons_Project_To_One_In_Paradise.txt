If I could see the sky above  
And my mind could be set free  
As wild white horses reached the shore  
I'd stand alone and oversee  
  
And if the bush before me burns  
Should I turn my eyes away  
And still the voices I can hear  
As clear to me as light of day  
  
I believed in my dreams  
Nothing could change my mind  
Now I know what they mean  
How could I be so blind  
  
Cold sands of time  
(Winds that blow as cold as ice  
Sounds that come in the night)  
Shall hide what is left of me  
(Come from Paradise)  
  
I've been through times when no one cared  
(Words that were mine)  
I've seen clouds in empty skies  
When one kind word meant more to me  
(Shall last as a memory)  
Than all the love in Paradise  
  
I believed in my dreams  
Nothing could change my mind  
Till I found what they mean  
Nothing can save me now
