Naked in midwinter magic  
Lies an angel in the snow  
The frozen figure crossed by tracks of wolves  
An encounter symbolic yet truthful  
With a hungry choir of wolves  
An agreement immemorial to be born  
  
Dulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest  
Accompany all charming tunes  
Of a sacrament by a campfire  
A promise between the tameless  
And the one with a tool  
Tonight the journey from a cave begins  
  
I want to hunt with the tameless heart  
I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar  
We will honor the angel in the snow  
We will make the streams for our children flow  
  
Wrapped in furs beneath the northern lights  
From my cave I watch the land untamed  
And wonder if some becoming season  
Will make the angel melt in shame  
  
I want to hunt with the tameless heart  
I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar  
We will honor the angel in the snow  
We will make the streams for our children flow
