I have a heart that's made of wood  
And I am only biding time  
Only reciting memorized lines  
  
And I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
  
I have no love but only goals  
How very empty is my soul  
It is a soul that feels no thrill  
It is a soul that could easily kill  
  
And I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
Yeah yeah  
  
I am intrinsically no good  
I have a heart that's made of wood  
And I am only biding time  
Only reciting memorized lines  
  
And I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment  
No, no, I'm not fit to touch  
The hem of your garment
