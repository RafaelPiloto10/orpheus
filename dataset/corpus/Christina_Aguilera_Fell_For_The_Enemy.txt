It started as a game  
The bet was on my heart  
But when I looked away  
You caught me off guard  
The tricks were hard to catch  
But now I see right through  
No more hurting me  
No more loving you  
Just wasted all my time  
Empty promises and lies  
Now my fantasy has died  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me  
When you shot, I dropped to my knees  
How could this be?  
I fell for the enemy  
  
A fantastic debut  
Taking part in your masquerade  
I starred as a fool  
And while the music played  
I gave my heart to you  
Boy, how was I confused  
I was only being used  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me  
When you shot, I dropped to my knees  
How could this be?  
I fell for the enemy  
  
I ate the apple off of your tree  
I can feel the poison running through me  
I keep getting stronger  
Boy, you wish that I was weak  
But now you're never gonna break me  
'Cause I know you're the enemy  
  
I never asked for  
These broken pieces  
You left me with  
You took advantage  
Did so much damage  
Right when you hit  
You knew just what to target in me  
When you shot, I dropped to my knees  
How could this be?  
That I fell for the enemy  
  
I fell for the enemy
