Take all your goodness and shiness away  
I'll tell you the things I've been longing to say  
I'll break it to you just so you understand  
The force and control that you hold in your hands  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isn't always the same  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
(Oh you are loved)  
  
Live for the moment according to you  
And so when the time comes you know what to do  
Trust me, I'm giving no secret away  
I'm drowning in you but I want it that way  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Then fall into mine  
One step at a time  
You have no reason for doubting your feelings  
Love isn't always the same  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love  
You  
  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You are loved  
You I love

You are loved  
(Ooh you are loved)  
You are loved

You I love  
You  
  
Rise to my world, fly to my arms  
I love you  
I'll make it for good, I'll make it forever  
you know you are loved  
  
Make me the beat of your heart  
Love isn't always the same  
You are loved
