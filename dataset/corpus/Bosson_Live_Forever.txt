I will live forever  
If you always keep me in your mind  
And it doesn't matter, how far I am  
If I ever leave you  
I am gonna be there by your side  
If you ever need me, well here I am  
  
I'm gonna live forever  
Don't you ever forget  
That all the stars in heaven  
Will shine for me  
I'm gonna live forever  
No never forget  
That no one's lost in heaven's eternity  
  
Hold the fire burning  
Life was never meant to be the end  
There's no way I'm turning, by accident  
I don't need to prove it  
I'm just ready for another stair  
Though my heart is moving, my soul is here  
  
I'm gonna live forever...  
  
In everyone  
There's a burning flame  
Goes on and on  
Do remember and I'll stay  
  
I'm gonna live forever...
