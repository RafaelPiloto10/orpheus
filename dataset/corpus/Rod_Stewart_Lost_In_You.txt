Hey! Baby, you've been on my mind tonight  
I'm so low, I just had to sit down and write  
I spent all yesterday tryin' to figure out what I'm gonna say  
One letter from the heart is so hard to start, baby  
How's your momma, how's the weather, how's that son of mine? yeah!  
  
Hey! Baby, been a long time since we made love  
I'm stone cold, the bed's hard, and the work gets tough  
I'm never gonna leave you again  
This job ain't worth the pain  
No money in the world ain't worth bein' away from you  
Ooh, baby I don't sleep without you by my side  
Listen!  
  
I'm in love with you, woman, it's a common known, natural fact  
And I found what I'm lookin' for, but so much more than that  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
  
Hey! Baby, you don't know what you've done for me  
I'm so happy as any man can deserve to be  
I was livin' a life of sin  
God knows what a mess I was in  
Sure glad you found me, I ain't gettin' any younger  
Hey! Baby, I just hope it ain't all a dream  
  
I'm in love with you, woman, it's a common known, natural fact  
And I found what I'm lookin' for, but so much more than that  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you)  
I'm lost in you (I'm lost in you) hey!  
  
I miss you, baby (I miss you too)  
  
I miss your laughin' eyes  
I miss our baby cryin'  
I want to lay you out and kiss you all over  
I'm comin' home real soon  
Be ready,'cause when I do, I'm gonna make love to you like fifteen men!  
I'm lost in you, and I love it  
I'm lost in you, and I love it
