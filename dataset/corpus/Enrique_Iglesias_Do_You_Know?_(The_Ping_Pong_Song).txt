Do you know?  
And do you know?  
Do you know?  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you know what it feels like  
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?  
(Do you know, do you know, do you know?)  
Do you know what it feels like  
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?  
(Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya)  
  
If birds flying south is a sign of changes  
At least you can predict this every year  
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly  
I can't get it to speak  
Maybe if I knew all the things it took to save us  
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me  
Look in your eyes to see something about me  
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
If you just don't talk to me, babe  
  
It flows through my head  
The question is she needed  
And decide all the man I can ever be.  
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,  
I could never see us ending like this (Do you know?)  
Seeing your face no more on my pillow  
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me (Do you know?)  
But after this episode I don't see  
You could never tell the next thing life could be  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Do you know?  
Do you know?  
Do you know?  
Do you know?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know  
Do ya
