I'm fading out of sight  
My wheels are the only sound  
Runnin at the speed of a' light  
'N I can't slow down now  
  
Out on an open road  
Racin' to beat the night  
No matter where I'm goin'  
I guess I'll get alright  
  
So why don't I understand  
What's trippin' me up?  
It oughta be a simple thing  
  
Chorus:  
I can't hold on  
'N I can't return  
Its time to let go  
'N start to live and learn  
  
I took a one-way flight  
Too high to see the ground  
Now I know how long it takes  
A heart to come down  
  
Alone on the highway now  
Takin' it mile by mile  
I'd rather be a lonely man  
than an imprisoned child  
  
So why do I feel the strain  
That keeps trippin' me up  
Will it ever be a simple thing  
  
I can't hold on  
And I can't return  
Rivers will run  
'N bridges will burn  
I can't say just how  
But there's no lookin' back now  
  
When everything fades away  
And there's nothing left  
Then you got to keep rememberin'  
  
I won't slow down  
'N I can't return  
Its time to let go  
'N start to live and learn  
  
So why don't I understand  
What's trippin' me up?  
well it oughta be a simple thing  
  
I can't hold on  
'N I can't return  
Rivers will run  
'N bridges will burn  
I can't say just how  
but there's no lookin' back now  
I won't slow down  
'N I can't return  
As night turns to dawn  
The pages will burn  
I can't say just how  
But there's no lookin' back now  
I can't hold on  
'N I can't run  
Its time to let go  
'N start to live and learn
