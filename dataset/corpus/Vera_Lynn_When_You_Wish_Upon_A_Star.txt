When a star is born  
They possess a gift or two  
One of them is this  
They have the power to make a wish come true  
  
When you wish upon a star  
Makes no diff'rence who you are  
Anything your heart desires will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dream  
No request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
Fate is kind  
  
She brings to those who love  
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing  
  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true  
  
When you wish upon a star  
Makes no diff'rence who you are  
Anything your heart desires will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dream  
No request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
Fate is kind  
  
She brings to those who love  
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true
