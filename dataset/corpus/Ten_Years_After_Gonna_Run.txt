Gonna run, running from the city  
Gonna run, running to the country  
Gonna run, running from the city  
Gotta ease my aching mind, oh yeah  
  
Gonna hide, hiding from the smoke fumes  
Gonna hide, sing myself some new tunes  
Gonna hide, hiding from the smoke fumes  
Gotta clean myself inside, oh yeah  
  
Gonna run, runnin' from the ego  
Gonna run, to find out where the free go  
Gonna run, runnin' from the ego  
I want to free myself inside, oh yeah  
  
Run, run, run, I'm running  
Yes, I'm running, baby  
Running all night long  
Baby, I'm running  
  
Keep on running  
Yeah, time is flying  
Yeah, time is gone  
Yes, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Gotta keep trying
