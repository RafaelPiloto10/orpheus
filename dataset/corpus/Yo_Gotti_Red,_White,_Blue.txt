United States of America, nigga  
Land of the free  
Nigga what you'd do for your country?  
You know what I'd do for mine?  
Everything but go to war, nigga  
Yeah, I'm into it with niggas right around the corner from me  
I ain't gotta go out the motherfucking country to shoot them choppers nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
Colombians, Mexicans  
Even got some work from the Dominicans  
American, land of the free  
National anthem shit  
My country tis of thee  
Red, white, and blue  
Red, white, and blue  
Crip and Blood shit  
Nigga I salute  
Red, white, and blue  
Red, white, and blue  
Cocaine shit  
Nigga I salute  
  
Colombians and Mexicans, I'm tryna re-up  
Stop the beat let's get something understood -- I stay g'd up  
Maybach with my feet up, AK when I creep up  
My young niggas rep Blood Gang, my OGs rep Hoover  
All I got is shooters, all we do is shoot up  
Little bad bitch got no aim, she must work at Hooters  
Remember being in New York when the towers blew up  
Now I got a 911 Porsche with the blue guts  
Rims'll make you throw up, something to make you blow up  
Niggas getting little money, when you gon grow up?  
Louis from the toe up, street nigga, so what?  
Louis XIII and I just tell them bitches poor up  
Work  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voila, haha, 18 wheeler fulla  
Pounds of ? green and thirty bricks inside a Honda  
He don't speak any English, all he know is numbers  
That's my mans he plug me he gon get me through the summer  
He don't know my name, him there just a runner  
He pick it up and drop it off then he gets him yonder  
Land of the free, run up if you wanna  
Suicide mission, we got choppers in this Hummer  
Red, white, and blue, I'm no politician  
But I live in a white house so I feel presidential  
I pledge allegiance to the flag, United Streets of America  
In God we trust, in one we stand, I'll always be a hustler  
Work  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The block Frank Sinatra thirty thousand feet up in the air eating lobster  
Doing what I gotsta  
Catch me at the tables, hundred thousand a marker  
?  
Fucking with the wrong set, ain't even perform yet  
Short one to AC, Vegas we took the long jet  
Blue chip in the field, red one on the horn bet  
Money straight, work good, the neck ain't did me wrong yet  
They come in powder form 'til we rock 'em up  
Land of the free, but they tryna lock me up  
Ha, I'm in the trap 'til the sky change  
Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines  
Work  
  
[Chorus]
