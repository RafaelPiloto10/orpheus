Oh Sandy Grey, are you going away?  
Leave me a message before parting  
Time has changed you and the things that pain you  
Are the things you think of as you're starting  
Oh Sandy Grey, it's only this I'll pray  
That you might stay here one more day in laughter  
Won't you hang around and hold me, repeat all the lies you told me?  
Do your rambling after  
Oh Sandy Grey, what ever made you want to stay?  
And now what makes you want to be a-leaving?  
Is it the same thing they found when they laid your father down  
Or are your reasons even worth retrieving?  
Oh Sandy Grey, don't leave me just today  
Don't think on the road you'll be a-going  
Think of all the time and the days we've had to mind  
Of the future there's no way of knowing  
Oh Sandy Grey, I thought I heard you say  
That you ain't heard one word that I've been speaking  
There's no use in trying you escaping from my mind  
And I'll never see the world you're seeking
