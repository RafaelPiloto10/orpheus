(Dolly Parton)  
Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me  
Bobby's arms always comfort and console me  
When I'm in his arms held tight  
I know everything's alright  
Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms  
Chorus:  
Bobby's arms always welcome me inside  
Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry  
Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms  
And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms  
Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender  
Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender  
When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach  
And I always want to be in Bobby's arms  
Repeat Chorus
