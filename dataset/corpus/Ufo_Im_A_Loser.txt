Last train's eleven, it's now quarter past  
Why are you trying to make the evening move so fast  
I'm in real trouble but I can't go back home  
They locked the doors and I'm left out alone  
  
[Chorus]  
You can come to my place and sleep on the couch  
Lots of people do it and we won't leave you out  
Hard times out on the Street  
Hard times, hard to beat  
The painted lies they all hand you  
I'm a loser on the road  
I'm a loser on the road, yeah  
  
Huston station and it's cold as ice  
All night specials, they move you on  
But me and Ginger over there  
We got this thing where we really take care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a loser, I'm a loser  
I'm a loser
