[Verse:]  
Take me to the place lord  
Where there's nothing else but me and you  
Longing for your presence  
I know that you are calling me to you  
  
[Pre chorus]  
Here I stand  
And long for your embrace  
Nothing else  
Could ever take your place  
  
[Chorus]  
Come holy spirit  
Fall in this place  
I need more and more of you  
Fill me again with the power of your spirit  
Lord I'm crying out for  
More and more of you  
  
[Bridge]  
Lord I'm crying out for  
More and more of you (oh)
