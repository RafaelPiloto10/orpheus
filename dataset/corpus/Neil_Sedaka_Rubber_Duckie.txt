Rubber duckie, swimming in the tub  
You always watch me give my face a rub  
Each evening that's the thing to do  
We're always washing when the day is through  
I'll be happy soaking in the bubbles  
Then I wash my hair  
After I'm finished, I can say my prayers  
No one likes you when you're looking dirty  
This is surely true  
Oh, rubber duckie, I'm so in love with you  
Rubber duckie, we can have such fun  
Splashing in the water when the day is done  
Remember you must always try  
Not to get soap suds going in your eye  
I'll be happy soaking in the bubbles  
Then I wash my hair  
After I'm finished, I can say my prayers  
No one likes you when you're looking dirty  
This is surely true  
Oh, rubber duckie, I'm so in love with you, ohh
