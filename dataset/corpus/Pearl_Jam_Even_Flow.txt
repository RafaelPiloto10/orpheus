Freezin' rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again  
Oh Feelin' maybe he will see a little better set of days  
Oh hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar  
Oh dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane  
Even flow  
  
Thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh he don't know  
So he chases them away  
Someday yet he'll begin his life again  
Life again  
  
Kneelin' looking through the paper though he doesn't know how to read  
Prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything  
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on it's way, yeah  
Oh, ceilings, few and far between are the legal halls of shame  
Even flow  
  
Thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh, he don't know  
So he chases them away  
Someday yet he'll begin his life again  
Whispering hands, carry him away  
Him away, him away  
Yeah!  
Woo  
Oh yeah yeah
