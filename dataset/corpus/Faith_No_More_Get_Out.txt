What if there's no more fun to have?  
And all I got is what I've had?  
What if I have forgotten how?  
Cut my losses and get out now  
Get out, right now!  
  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
A new thing growing in me  
  
It is the hardest thing to  
To watch it grow on top of you  
And see you're just like everyone  
No fun!  
  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
A new thing growing in me  
There's something I don't want to see  
  
I don't speak that language anymore!  
My blood is not that color anymore!  
My blood don't shine the same way anymore!  
I cannot deny it anymore!  
No  
  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
Got a new thing growing in me  
There's something I don't want to see  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
A new thing growing in me
