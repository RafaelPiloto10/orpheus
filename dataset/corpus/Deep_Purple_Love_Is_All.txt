Everybody's got to live together  
All the people got to understand  
So, love your neighbour  
Like you love your brother  
Come on and join the band  
  
Well, all you need is love and understanding  
Ring the bell and let the people know  
We're so happy and we're celebratin'  
Come on and let your feelings show  
  
Love is all, well love is all,  
Love is all, can't you hear the call  
Oh, love is all you need  
Love is all you need at the Butterfly Ball  
  
Ain't you happy that we're all together  
At the ball in nature's countryside  
And although we're wearing different faces  
Nobody wants to hide  
  
Love is all and all is love and  
It's easy, yes it's so easy  
At the Butterfly Ball where love is all  
And it's so easy  
  
All you need is love and understanding  
Hey, ring the bell and let the people know  
We're so happy and we're celebratin'  
Let your feelings show  
  
Love is all, yes love is all at the Butterfly Ball  
Love is big, love is small  
Love is free, love is all  
At the Butterfly Ball  
  
When you back's to the wall  
When you're starting to fall  
You got something to lean on  
Love is everything  
It can make you sing at the Butterfly Ball  
Love is all, I say love is all, yes love is all  
At the Butterfly Ball
