I walk a lonely road  
The only one that I have ever known  
Don't know where it goes  
But it's home to me and I walk alone  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk alone  
  
By now you should've somehow  
Realized what you gotta do... I walk alone I walk alone  
I don't believe that anybody  
Feels the way I do... I walk alone I walk alone about you now  
  
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
'Til then I walk alone'  
  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah (in the background all the way to I'm walking down the
line)  
  
Every day I wake up and it's Sunday  
Whatever's in my head won't go away  
The radio is playing all the usual  
And what's a wonderwall anyway  
  
Backbeat the word was on the street  
That the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before  
But you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody feels  
The way I do about you now  
  
I'm walking down the line  
That divides me somewhere in my mind  
On the border line  
Of the edge and where I walk alone  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
  
Read between the lines  
What's fucked up and everything's alright  
Check my vital signs  
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you... I walk alone I walk alone  
By now you should've somehow  
Realized what you gotta do... I walk alone I walk alone  
  
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would  
Like to say to you  
I don't know how  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
  
By now you should've somehow  
Realized what you gotta do  
  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk a...  
  
Cuz maybe  
  
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me... Saves me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating... Saves me  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me... Saves me  
'Til then I walk alone'  
  
Sing with me (Sing!)  
Sing for the year (Sing It)  
Sing for the laughter sing for the tear (C'mon!)  
Sing it with me Just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away...
