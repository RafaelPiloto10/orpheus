J. bon jovi, dave stewart  
  
The kids round here look just like sticks  
They trade old licks with a beat up six  
I just smile and catch the groove  
  
Gothic girls all dress in black  
Serious as heart attacks  
It takes a little bit of getting used to  
  
The old man with the whiskey stains  
Lost the night forgot his name  
His poor wife will sleep alone again  
And it aint hard to understand  
Why shes holding on to her own hand  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Ive seen a lone,sloane ranger drive  
Seems her chauffeur took a dive  
And sold her secrets to the sun  
And later in a magazine  
I finally figured what it means  
To be a saint, not a queen  
  
Two lustful lovers catch a spark  
And chase their shadows in the dark  
Someones getting off tonight  
Of a big red bus thats packed so tight  
It disappears in a trail of light  
Somewhere someones dreaming baby its all right...  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
Midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones pinned dreams on me  
No ones asking me to bleed  
Im the man I want to be  
When chelsea girls sing...  
  
Its morning when I go to sleep  
In the distant dawn a church bell rings  
Another day is coming on  
A babys born, an old man dies  
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye  
I leave my soul and just move on  
And wish that I was there to sing this song  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones pinned dreams on me  
No ones asking me to bleed  
Im the man I want to be  
The man I want to be,the man I want to be  
Midnight in chelsea
