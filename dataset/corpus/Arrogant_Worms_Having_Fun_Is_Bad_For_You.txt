I used to go to all the parties  
And make love to all the beautiful ladies  
And I'd eat cheeseburgers with bacon and extra grease when I was  
Hungry  
And drink Windex Colladas until my skin turned blue  
But now,the times they are a-changing  
My lifestyle, it is rearranging  
For debauchery may be fun and entertaining  
But it is also very bad for you  
Do you know how many diseases you can get  
Making love to someone who has not had all their tests  
So nowadays, I am celibate  
And I wear a condom, in case I have dirty thoughts  
I never drive my car past the speed limit  
And I always wear my seat belt when I am in it  
I traded my Lambourghini for a Honda Civic  
Because it is more fuel-efficient and practical  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Being boring is the way to go!  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Having fun is bad for you!  
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes  
Because I found that they are a major cause of death  
The tar and nicotine have not killed me yet  
But if I got pregnant, they could hurt my baby  
I used to love my sorry complexion (sorry?)  
I tanned myself to perfection  
But the sun can give you a cancerous infection  
So now I'm white and pasty and I never leave the house  
I used to eat like there was no tomorrow  
But then I found cholesterol is full of sorrow  
The last thing I want to do is to have to borrow  
Somebody else's heart, because mine is full of fatty deposits  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Being boring is the way to go!  
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!  
Having fun is bad for you!  
Having fun is bad for you!
