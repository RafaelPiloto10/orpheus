Better than cream cheese and bagels  
Better than honey on bread  
Better than champagne and pretzels  
Better than breakfast in bed  
Better than chili rellenos  
Better than chocolate e'clairs  
Better than hothouse tomatoes  
Better than fresh Bartlett pears  
Better than dining a la carte  
Or simply gastronomic art  
  
Better than anything except being in love  
Better than making a million  
Better than being a queen  
Better than oil wells and gold mines  
Better than pastures of green  
Better than finding a horseshoe  
Better than losing your head  
Better than anything ever thought of  
Better than anything ever said  
Ah, ha, better than singing right out loud  
Or being, ha, spotted in a crowd  
Better than (better than anything) anything except being (except being) in
love  
  
Better than elephants, elephants are dancing  
Better than clowns on parade  
Better than peanuts and popcorn  
Better than pink lemonade  
Better than rides on the midway  
Better than seals blowing horns  
Better than men shot through cannons  
Better than fresh ears of corn  
  
Ah, better than balancing on a wire  
Or watching tigers jump through fire  
Better than anything except being in love  
Better than driving 'round the park  
Or watching fireflies after the dark  
Better than anything except being in love  
Hey, Diana?  
Yeah?  
  
Are you sure that love is even better than shopping?  
Well, there's a little sale on late floor at Barneys but it's still better  
Oh, come on, come on  
What about that thirty percent sale at Jimmy's shoes  
And Sachs Friends and Family Day? Ha?  
  
Still better  
Well, maybe close second  
Very close second  
Better, more better  
Better, better, better
