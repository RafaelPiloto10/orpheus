Beautiful  
Kind  
And gentle  
And loving  
And softness  
And sweetness  
And candy  
And gum  
  
Peppermint  
And pink flowers  
And bunnies  
And happy songs we can all hum  
Draw a smiley face on the sun  
It's fun  
  
Slow down and look around you (All around)  
Throw your to do list away,  
The clouds look like sheep and vice versa  
On a do nothing day (on a do nothing day)  
On do nothing day.  
  
Sunshine  
Cuddles  
And puppies  
Wet noses  
And safety  
And laughter  
And skip to and fro  
  
Holding hands  
Cherry snocones  
And rainbows  
And no place where we have to go  
So we're just gonna go with the flow  
Well you know  
  
Slow down and look around you (All around)  
Throw your to do list away  
The clouds look like sheep and vice versa  
On a do nothing day (On a do nothing day)  
Our do nothing daaaay
