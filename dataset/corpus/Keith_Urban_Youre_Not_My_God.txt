It's just a piece of paper,  
It says, "In God We Trust"  
A little sure felt good  
But a lot was not enough  
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll  
And I thought I had everything  
When I held the gold  
  
[Chorus]  
But you're not my god  
And you're not my friend  
You're not the one  
That I will walk with in the end  
You're not the truth  
You're a temporary shot  
You ruin people's lives  
And you don't give a second thought  
You're not my god  
  
Little white lies on a mirror  
Cut neatly in a roll  
Medicine that kept me from lookin' in my soul  
I thought you were the answer  
To all of my despair  
And you almost had me six feet down  
But I'm still breathin' air  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the cradle to the grave  
Temptations all around  
But no matter how good the fix  
It's gonna take you down  
Now some call it a weakness  
Some call it a sin  
But it's all the same behind each game  
I see your evil grin  
  
But you're not my god  
And you're not my friend  
You're not the one  
That I will walk with in the end  
You're not the truth  
You're a temporary shot  
You ruin people's lives  
And you don't give a second thought  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're not my god  
Oh oh oh you're not my god  
You're not my god  
Not my god  
Not my god  
You're not, you're not, you're not my god  
No you're not
