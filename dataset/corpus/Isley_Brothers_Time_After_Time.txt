What good are words I say to you?  
They can't convey to you what's in my heart  
If you could hear  
Instead  
The things I've left unsaid  
  
Time after time  
I tell myself that I'm  
So lucky to be loving you  
  
So lucky to be  
The one you run to see  
In the evening, when the day is through  
  
I only know what I  
Know  
The passing years will show  
You've kept my love so young, so new  
  
And time after time  
You'll hear  
Me say that I'm  
So lucky to be loving you
