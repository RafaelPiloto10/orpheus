I've traveled o'er the country wide a seekin' fortune fair  
I've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere  
From Portland East and Portland West and back along the line  
I'm goin' now to a place that's best that old home town of mine  
Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view  
Eight more miles on this old road and I 'll never more be blue  
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start  
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart  
  
There's sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all  
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall  
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land  
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand  
Oh eight more miles and Louisville...  
  
Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home  
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam  
The place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills  
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville  
Eight more miles to Louisville...
