Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil  
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak  
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too  
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.
