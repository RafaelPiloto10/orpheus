You sleep better when you're  
You eat better when you're  
You sing better when you're  
You need me more when you're straight  
Is this the weekend?  
Is that your girlfriend?  
She's green and innocent  
You smoke her like she's incense  
She's smilin'  
  
I'll wait 'til summer's over  
I'll love you through October  
I'll give you everything  
I'll trade you anything for her  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me  
Stay straight for me
