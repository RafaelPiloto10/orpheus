Took the last train  
  
Took the last train to st. Tropez  
Had in mind to dance the night away  
Experimented with a cognac high  
When in france you give everything a try  
  
Soon the crowd dwindled down to two  
Not a soul around but me and you  
You just smiled in french and took my hand  
Spoke the words I tried my best to understand  
You're tellin' me-  
  
Viens chez moi  
Ce soir va jamais terminer  
On va rester toujours ensemble-you're  
Tellin' me  
  
Come with me  
Tonight will last forever  
We wiii stay together always  
  
Wake the next day and found her note  
Love ya, goodbye that's all she wrote  
And every night down at the place we met  
I wait for her and those sweet words I  
Can't forget  
You're tellin' me-  
  
Viens chez moi  
Ce soir va jamais terminer  
On va rester toujours ensemble-'cause  
I want you to  
  
Come with me  
Tonight will last forever  
We wiii stay together always
