Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,  
I wonder why he's not with me tonight.  
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.  
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.  
  
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,  
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.  
You won't get more than you're living for,  
And it's too late to cry tonight.  
  
It doesn't seem much point in us carrying on,  
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone.  
I hear the death man has lost his mate,  
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate.  
  
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,  
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.  
You won't get more than you're living for,  
And it's too late to cry tonight.  
  
Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes,  
The dimness it has giving me won't let me realize.  
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through,  
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you.  
  
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,  
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.  
You won't get more than you're living for,  
And it's too late to cry tonight.
