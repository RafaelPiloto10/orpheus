Can't tell you the truth  
'Least I don't lie about that  
Kind of comfort in you  
Comes when you lie right back  
  
Safe from such a strange point of view  
To hear your own words on you  
  
How much do you go to be gone?  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Similar creatures we are  
Chasing the pipe dream down  
Love elusive so far  
Keeps us divided now  
  
Go, go on and write me love songs  
So I have something to sing when your gone  
  
How much do you go to be gone?  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down  
Do you know the way  
To be in one place but sway?  
Anyway the wind's blowin'  
  
You are love, you are love  
You are monsters and angels  
Untouched, unseen  
  
All in one, all in one  
I take all that you are  
'Cause you're just like me  
But you move and it's hard  
To stay close to a satellite  
  
So I lose sight of you  
Till you come round again  
I'm watching the wind  
  
Hey ay, hey ay, ay  
Anyway the wind's blowin'  
  
How much do you go to be gone?  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Don't wanna come down  
Do you know the way  
To be in one place but stay?  
Any way the wind's blowin'  
Any way the wind's blowin'
