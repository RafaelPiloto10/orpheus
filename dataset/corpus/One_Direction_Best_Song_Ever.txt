Maybe it's the way she walked (Wow)  
Straight into my heart and stole it  
Through the doors and past the guards (Wow),  
Just like she already owned it  
  
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"  
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh, oh, oh  
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think it goes oh  
  
Said her name was Georgia Rose, (Wow)  
And her daddy was a dentist  
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)  
But she kissed me like she meant it  
  
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"  
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh, oh, oh  
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think it goes oh  
  
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you,  
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me,  
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you, (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah)  
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced how we danced  
How we danced how we danced (1, 2, 1, 2, 3)  
  
How we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever (We danced, we danced, it
goes something like, yeah)  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can't remember  
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her  
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh, oh, oh  
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think it goes oh  
  
Best song ever,  
It was the best song ever  
It was the best song ever,  
It was the best song ever
