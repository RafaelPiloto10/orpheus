She was a girl from Birmingham  
She just had an abortion  
She was a case of insanity  
Her name was Pauline  
  
She lived in a tree  
She wasn't out when he killed her baby  
She sent the letters from the country  
She was an animal  
  
She was a bloody disgrace  
Bodies, I'm not an animal [Repeat: x 2]  
Dragged on a table in a factory  
Illegitimate place to be  
  
In a package in a lavatory  
Die little baby, screaming  
Bodies, I'm not an animal  
I'm not an animal  
  
It's an abortion  
Bodies, I'm not an animal  
Mummy I'm not an animal  
I'm not an animal [x3]  
(fucking bloody mess)  
  
Fuck this and fuck that  
Fuck it all and fuck her fucking brat  
She don't want to baby that looks like that  
I don't want to baby that looks like that  
Bodies, I'm not an animal [Repeat: x 3]  
  
Mummy I'm not an animal  
I'm not an animal [Repeat: x 3]  
(Mummy) I'm not an animal [Repeat: x 3]
