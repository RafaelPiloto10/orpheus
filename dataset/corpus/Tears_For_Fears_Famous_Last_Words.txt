After the wash  
Before the fire  
I will decay  
Melt in your arms  
As the day hits the night  
We will sit by candlelight  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
A for a heart  
B for a brain  
Insects and grass  
Are all that remain  
When the light from above  
Burns a hole straight through our love  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
And we will carry war no more  
All our love and all our of pain  
Will be but a tune  
The Sun and the Moon  
The wind and the rain  
Hand in hand we'll do and die  
Listening to the band that made us cry  
We'll have nothing to lose  
We'll have nothing to gain  
Just to stay this real life situation  
For one last refrain  
As the day hits the night  
We will sit by candlelight  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
And we will carry war no more
