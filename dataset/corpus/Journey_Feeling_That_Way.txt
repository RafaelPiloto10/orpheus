Opened my eyes to a new kind of way  
All the good times that you saved  
Are you feeling,  
You feeling that way too  
Or am I just,  
Am I just a fool  
  
When the summer's gone  
She'll be there standing by the light  
Once she's bee to where she's gone to  
She should know wrong from right  
  
A new road's waiting, you touched my life  
Soft and warm on a summer's night  
You're the only one, the only one I love  
The lovely one, I'm thinking of
