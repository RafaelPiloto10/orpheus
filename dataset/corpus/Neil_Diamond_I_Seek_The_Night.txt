I seek the night  
And I rest my head  
On my weary bed  
And I think about you  
  
And time's on my mind  
I've been thinking about  
What I'm doing without  
With a boy like you  
What's a girl to do  
  
Yesterday was more or less  
Just like the day before  
And time don't matter  
When there's nobody else around  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And all I believe is in now  
I believe and how my time has come  
  
Why sleep at all  
Just to rest my head  
On a lonely bed  
And to dream alone  
  
Time's on my mind  
And the last I heard  
He was like a bird  
Don't know where he flew  
And what's a girl to do  
  
What's a girl to do  
What's a girl to do
