You don't smile like you used to smile  
You don't laugh like you used to laugh  
You're trying to pretend but what for?  
I don't think you love me anymore  
  
You don't kiss like you kissed me before  
The spark of love isn't there anymore  
I love you everyday but what for?  
I don't think you love me anymore  
  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me  
It's plain to see, you don't love me anymore  
  
Your loving touch isn't there anymore  
You don't care like you cared before  
So darling, what am I waiting for?  
I don't think you love me anymore  
  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me  
And it's plain to see, you don't love me anymore  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me  
And it's plain to see, you don't love me anymore  
Made a fool of me, you're mean to me
