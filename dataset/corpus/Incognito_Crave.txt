If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if I were as blinded by the light  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if it were a, give me back my sight  
I will crave you tonight, I will crave you, come tomorrow  
I will crave you for always, time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you, back to you  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if the thunder strikes me down tonight  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if you kiss me in the broad daylight  
I will crave you tonight, I will crave you, come tomorrow  
I'll crave you for always, time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you, back to you  
I will crave you, crave you, I will crave you  
(If this ain't love, ooh, oh)  
Crave you  
(If this ain't love)  
I will crave you  
(Crave you, crave you if this ain't love)  
Crave you  
(This ain't love, oh)  
I will crave you  
(This ain't love, crave you, yeah)  
Crave you  
(This ain't love, this ain't love)
