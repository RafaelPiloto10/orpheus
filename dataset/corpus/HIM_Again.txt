Him again  
I've seen  
I see you've turned your back on love again  
And I feel  
And I feel your stumbling down that road again  
  
And I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah  
  
Will you see  
Me crying behind your back again  
And you hear  
My heart beat slowly down again  
  
And I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again  
I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah  
  
Oh baby yes I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again  
And I feel  
Despair kissing our lips again  
And I feel  
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah  
  
Despair holding our hearts again, oho  
That's right  
Yeah
