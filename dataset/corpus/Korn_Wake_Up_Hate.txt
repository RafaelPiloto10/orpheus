We got a fucked up reason to live  
Who really gives a fuck?  
We're gunna wake up hate  
We're gunna fuck you up  
  
I want to break everything  
I want to make it safe  
We're gunna wake up hate  
We're gunna wake it up  
  
You gotta get it straight  
We're gunna give it up  
We're gunna wake up hate  
We're gunna fuck you up  
  
I want to break everything  
I want to make it safe  
We're gunna wake up hate  
We're gunna wake it up  
  
I am the burden of my everything,  
An open scar  
I'll be reborn in hatred,  
Feeling I can't love no more  
  
I've had to suffer  
I cannot wait for more.  
No loving and no praying  
All my hate is for the taking  
  
We got a fucked up reason to live  
Who really gives a fuck?

We're gunna fuck you up  
  
I want to break everything  
I want to make it safe  
We're gunna wake up hate  
We're gunna wake it up  
  
I am the falling of my happiness  
It is no more  
Stop loving, I'm still hating  
Till I can not hate no more  
  
I've had to suffer  
I cannot wait for more.  
No loving and no praying  
All my hate is for the taking  
  
I'm, I am filthy  
Wasted piece of shit  
I am disgusting  
Take me, away
