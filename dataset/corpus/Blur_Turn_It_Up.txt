Kazoo, kazoo you are mine, kazoo kazoo every time  
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in (x4)  
Anyway you choose, anyway you choose at all  
Sometimes you get too much, some days it all gets too much  
  
Kazoo, kazoo you are mine, why do you turn your back on me?  
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in (x4)  
Anyway you choose, anyway you choose at all  
Some days you do too much, some days it all gets too much  
  
Kazoo, kazoo you are mine, kazoo kazoo every time  
Turn it up, turn it off, turn it in (x4)
