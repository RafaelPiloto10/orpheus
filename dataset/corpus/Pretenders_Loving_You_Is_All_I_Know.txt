I don't understand how the sun keeps shining  
And I don't understand why the seasons change  
And I don't have a clue what makes the river flow  
Loving you is all I know  
  
I can't tell you why stars come out in the evening  
And I can't tell you where they go when they're gone  
And I don't have a clue what makes a flower grow  
Loving you is all I know  
  
I don't know how the world keeps on spinning around  
I don't know why the sky don't come falling down  
I just know that I would die without your touch  
I don't know what a time just to reach the shore  
Just know that I'll need you for forever more  
Knowing that I guess I know it now  
  
I can't really say if there is a heaven  
But I feel like it's here when I feel you near me, baby  
If angels are real, they must know how I feel  
Cause loving you is all I know
