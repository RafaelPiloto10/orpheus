We Are His Heart  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Their lonely eyes stare out  
From the houses on my street  
Sometimes I turn away  
Before it starts to bother me  
But this time something's wrong  
I must have watched too long  
I can't erase their faces  
From my mind  
Chorus:  
We are His heart  
Is His heart beating?  
We are His hands  
Are His hands reaching?  
When will we realize  
That you and I  
Must do our part?  
It's time to start  
We are His heart  
Two thousand years ago  
Upon a distant hill  
A little boy gave all he had  
And multitudes were filled  
Where is that child today  
Who gave it all away?  
Where is that love?  
We cannot let it die  
Chorus  
Hands reach  
Reaching out in desperation  
In a dying world  
Their lonely voices cry  
I hear a heart beat  
I can feel it growing stronger  
We've got to reach out to them  
We just can't turn away again  
Where is that love?  
We cannot let them die
