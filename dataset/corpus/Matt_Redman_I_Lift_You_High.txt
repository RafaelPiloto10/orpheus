I lift you high and bow down low  
How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
I lift You high and bow down low  
How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
You must increase I must decrease, Lord  
I'll bow down and You will be adored

How high can You be?  
How low can I go?  
You must increase I must decrease, Lord  
I'll bow down and You will be adored
