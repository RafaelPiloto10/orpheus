Life is going around in circles  
Wonder will it ever end  
If I die, baby, will you miss me  
Or just find another friend  
  
Does it matter what I do  
Live life right or bear a grudge?  
Does it matter what I do  
Is there anyone to judge?  
  
I have been to many places  
I have journeyed through the mind  
Though I've found some different faces  
Another answer I can't find  
  
Does it matter what I do  
Is there anyone to say?  
Does it matter what I do  
Is there any other way?  
  
I have got what I once dreamed of  
As a child, so long ago  
But my life just goes in circles  
'Cause one answer I don't know  
  
Does it matter what I do  
Who will hear me if I cry?  
Does it matter what I do  
Does it matter if I die?
