There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind  
There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind don't be blind  
  
Said you I'm living in my fantasy  
But is you who are blinded from reality  
The material world mean so much to you  
You just can't get what I'm telling you  
  
There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind don't be blind  
  
Cause in a town called sorrow there was joy  
Yes and there I met the painless tear  
Freed he expressed emotions that egos fear  
My life is full of colors yeah my mind is clear  
  
There's a rainbow in the sky rainbow in the sky  
  
Found I mercy in every sunrise  
I am born again from the womb of the night  
All I have I have left behind  
Minds' eye eyes eye a light will shine  
  
There's a rainbow in the sky all the time don't be blind don't be blind  
Rainbow in the sky rainbow in the sky
