Ten coaches roll into the dust  
Chrome windows turned to rust  
'Hand on inside they know they must  
Hanging on the green backed words "In God we trust"  
  
No one knew if the spirit died  
All wrapped to go like Kentucky Fried  
Trying to read the flight of birds  
Low on fuel, getting low on words  
  
And she comes out like a white shadow  
She comes out like a white shadow  
  
Each one drawn to empty spaces  
Outsiders, borderline cases  
It's hard to tell black from white  
When you wake up in the middle of the night  
  
Weighed down by the absence of sound  
Broken now by the cry of a hound  
Looking for movement within the haze  
Light can be deceptive with her rays  
  
And she comes out like a white shadow  
And she comes out like a white shadow  
She comes out like a white shadow
