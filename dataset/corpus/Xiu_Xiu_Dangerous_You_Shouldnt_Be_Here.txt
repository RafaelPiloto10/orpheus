A witch has come from under the ocean  
And with a pointed and sharp finger  
Snatched my baby by the crook of her jaw  
And hooked her breath away  
And bloated and cut her soft,  
Dearest skin and face  
Her hair has gone from black to green  
She used to complain when I used  
Too much water to wash her hair  
I can't imagine what it was like for her  
To have died swallowing the sea  
I want to pause and offer  
Your lonely grave farewell but it is covered in mud  
It is nowhere there is no way  
To light an altar for you  
Everything is too wet  
Tight around my neck  
Tie me with this rotten wire  
That snaps its quiet snap  
I've poured my life into this world and here I am
