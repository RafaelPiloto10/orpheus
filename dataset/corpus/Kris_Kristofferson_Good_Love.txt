Damn the way you always bring me down  
Can't you say a single thing that's true  
You could take a perfect day and turn it right around  
I'm afraid there ain't no way to please you  
  
It's okay, 'cause it don't matter now  
Go your way and i'll go my way too  
Find some new somebodies who you'd rather be around  
Maybe they can see their way to please you  
  
Chorus:  
Darlin', good love shouldn't feel so bad  
This fighting might feel righteous, but it's wrong  
We just make each other mad and lonesome  
So tell me why the hell we tried so long  
  
One more line and i'll be down the road  
Do me one more dirty, girl I'm gone  
Ain't it you who used to say, life's too short to live this way  
Baby, I believe that life's too long  
  
Chorus:  
Darlin', good love shouldn't feel so bad  
This fighting might feel righteous, but it's wrong  
We just make each other mad and lonesome  
So tell me why the hell we tried so long
