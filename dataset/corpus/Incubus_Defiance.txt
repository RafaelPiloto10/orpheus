You almost had me there  
It was the batting lashes that gave you away  
You're bold beyond repair  
And there's an absence today, of defiance  
  
Our most awakened inclination  
And your elegant aberration  
  
Something's happening  
And all the rebels and devils have come to naught  
To hear your sirening  
And who would unring, oh, your bell?  
  
Defiance, our most awakened inclination  
Defiance, your elegant aberration
