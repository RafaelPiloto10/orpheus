I know it doesn't seem that way  
But maybe it's the perfect day  
Even though the bills are piling  
And maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling  
  
But if we'd only open our eyes  
We'd see the blessings in disguise  
That all the rain clouds are fountains  
Though our troubles seem like mountains  
  
There's gold in them hills  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
Every now and then life says  
Where do you think you're going so fast  
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes  
It's a case of cruel to be kind  
  
And if we'd get up off our knees  
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees  
And we'd see the new sun rising  
Over the hills on the horizon  
  
There's gold in them hills  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose faith  
Give the world a chance to say...  
  
A word or two, my friend  
There's no telling how the day might end  
And we'll never know until we see  
That there's gold in them hills  
  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
There's gold in them hills...  
There's gold in them hills...
