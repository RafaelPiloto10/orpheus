There's a place called Downtown  
Where the hippies all go  
And they dance the charleston  
And they do the limbo  
Yeah the hippies all go there  
'Cause they want to be seen  
It's like a room full of pictures  
It's like a psychedelic dream  
  
Downtown  
Let's go downtown  
Downtown at night  
Downtown  
Let's have a party  
Downtown at night  
  
Yeah it's right around the corner  
Up and down the hill  
When you hear the band playin'  
It's gonna give you a chill  
Give your money to the gateman  
Young blood in his eye  
Hold on to your baby  
When you slip into the sky  
  
Downtown  
Let's go downtown  
Downtown tonight  
Downtown  
Hear the band playin'  
Downtown all right  
  
Jimi's playin' in the back room  
Led Zeppelin on stage  
There's a mirror ball twirlin'  
And a note from Page  
Like a water-washed diamond  
In a river of sin  
Goin' down like a whirlpool  
When you get sucked in  
  
Downtown  
Let's go downtown  
Downtown tonight  
Downtown  
Hear the band playin'  
Downtown all right  
  
Downtown  
Let's go downtown  
Downtown tonight  
Downtown  
Let's have a party  
Downtown all right
