Please don't say  
What I think  
You're about to say  
Don't take  
The mood away  
By asking questions  
You already know  
The answers to  
No  
You're not my only girl  
I ain't tryna be your man  
We had an understanding  
So then why are you acting  
Like you  
No longer understand  
  
Don't fall in love  
Girl  
I'm not the one  
No emotions, babe  
We just having fun  
All I'm gonna do  
Is hurt you  
(Baby  
Please don't fall) (2x)  
  
It's kinda why  
I didn't wanna start this  
In the first place  
(Just a physical thing)  
But you lied to me  
Said it's cool  
If we do our thing  
Girl  
You know I never ever  
Lead you  
On that's wrong  
I change my ways  
Baby  
Why can't we just  
Stay this way  
Don't fall in love  
Don't fall in love  
Girl

No emotions, babe  
We just having fun  
All I'm gonna do  
Is hurt you  
(Baby  
Please don't fall) (2x)  
  
Baby

Don't fall in love  
Baby

All I'm gonna do  
Is hurt you  
Baby  
Please  
Don't fall in love  
  
Don't fall in love  
Girl
