Well, I came home late one night  
And much to my surprise  
I was thrown  
Right across the kitchen floor  
She hit me right between the eyes.  
Now I'm living  
In the doghouse, doghouse  
Doghouse, doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse.  
  
I was out with a friend of mine  
We were feeling mighty fine  
And we sure was movin' fast  
And I didn't make it back on time  
And she put me  
In the doghouse, doghouse  
Doghouse, doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse.  
  
I had a big tall red  
With one of my friends  
He was feeling mighty fine  
When I came home late that night  
She hit me right between the eyes  
And she put me  
In the doghouse, doghouse  
Doghouse, doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse.  
  
She put me in the doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse,  
I'm living in the doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse.  
  
So if you find yourself  
In a party mood  
Let your conscience be your guide  
Don't be like me and let Lefty win  
Or you'll find yourself outside  
Living in the doghouse, doghouse  
Doghouse, doghouse,  
Doghouse, doghouse.
