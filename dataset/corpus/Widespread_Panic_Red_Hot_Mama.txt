Red hot mama from Louisiana  
Thumbin' her way to Savannah  
She been cooped up too long  
  
Red hot mama lookin' to the city  
Taxi dancers and big time spenders  
She's been groovin'  
  
Red hot mama was gettin' down  
Scoping the places where fun to be found  
She was smokin'  
  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
  
Red hot mama was really bad  
She was badder than bad, bad as she want to be  
  
Red hot mama was a real gas  
Doin' it good and doing it fast  
She was smokin'  
  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me
