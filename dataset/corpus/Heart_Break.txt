The dust is gathering where I stand  
Now I know there's a crack in this plan  
After a while there just ain't no more  
Magic, man  
  
I got a need  
I got to know  
Give me the truth who is running my show  
Tell them I'm sorry but I just had to go  
  
My patience ran out  
I gotta run  
Out of a habit that used to be fun  
  
I just wanna break  
Shake it, shake it, shake it off  
Take off, break it off  
Break, break  
  
Break me outta here  
You know what it's about  
Let me out, get me out  
Break  
  
I go no more respect for the big man  
Pulling me down to what he understands  
He can't get his mind around no bigger plans  
No one is going to tie me to this machine  
Giving me formula force fed dreams  
Getting more hold on me than it seems  
  
My patience ran out  
I gotta run  
Out of a habit  
That used to be fun  
  
I just gotta break  
Shake it, shake it, shake it off  
Take off, break it off  
Break, break  
  
Break me out of here  
You know what it's about  
Let me out, get me out  
Break
