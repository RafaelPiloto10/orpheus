I'm waiting for a boat to help me out of here  
Waiting for a boat to help me out  
The boat that reached my shore was a toy boat  
Waiting for a boat to help me out  
  
I'm dreaming of a lake I've never seen before  
Dreaming of a lake I've never seen  
The lake I've seen last was a picture lake  
Dreaming of a lake I've never seen  
  
You who are  
You who are  
Help me out, help me out  
Help me out of here  
  
I'm thinking of a castle on atop a hill  
Thinking of a castle on atop a hill  
The castle I've been to was full of flies  
Thinking of a castle on atop a hill  
  
You who are  
You who are  
Help me out, help me out  
Help me out of here  
  
You who are  
You who are  
Help me out, help me out  
Help me out of here  
  
I'm waiting for a boat to help me out of here  
Waiting for a boat to help me out  
The boat that reached my shore was a toy boat  
Waiting for a boat to help me out  
  
You who are  
You who are  
Help me out, help me out  
Help me out of here  
  
You who are  
You who are  
Help me out, help me out  
Help me out of here
