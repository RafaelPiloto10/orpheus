I know that I'm not crazy  
If I were I wouldn't talk about it  
I'm homesick for your love  
'Cause I know I can't live without it  
  
If you need a guarantee I'm gonna love you everyday  
Say no more about it because you've got it in every way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna hold out one more day  
I won't let her take you away  
I'm gonna hold out somehow someway  
I don't want to see the day when you say goodbye  
  
I wish I could get you out of my system  
I say in my mind but my heart won't listen  
I need a fix or two  
'Cause I'm in the habit of you  
  
And if a guarantee is what you need  
To keep me by your side  
Say no more about it  
Because my love I just can't hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna hold out one more day  
I won't let her take you away  
I'm gonna hold out somehow someway  
I don't want to see the day when you say...  
  
All you need in your life  
All you need in your heart  
All you need from a friend  
Is love  
  
All you need from your mother  
All you need from your lover  
All wee need from another  
Is love  
  
I'm gonna hold out one more day  
I won't let her take you away  
I'm gonna hold out somehow someway  
I don't want to see the day when you say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]
