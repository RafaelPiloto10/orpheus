I see you're dressed to kill  
I know I can't wait until  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
  
I see you're dressed in black  
I guess I'm not coming back  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
  
Born and raised  
On the wrong side of town  
You get so high  
That you can't come down  
(Yeah)  
  
I see the road is rough  
You know I'm not giving up  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
  
I know where the lady goes  
I know she got a ring on her toes  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
  
Born and raised  
On the wrong side of town  
You get so high  
That you can't come down  
  
I'm going higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
I'm gonna be there  
When that light's gonna shine  
I'm gonna be there  
When her heart kindles next to mine  
I'm gonna be  
Here she comes  
Yeah here she comes  
  
I see you're dressed to kill  
I know I can't wait until  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
  
I see you're dressed in black  
I guess I'm not coming back  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
  
Born and raised  
In the wrong side of town  
You get so high  
You can't come down  
  
I'm gonna be there  
Higher, higher, higher  
Gonna get higher, higher, higher  
Gonna get higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
  
I'm gonna be there  
When that light's gonna shine  
I'm gonna be there  
When that light's gonna shine  
  
Hallelujah, here she comes  
Here she comes
