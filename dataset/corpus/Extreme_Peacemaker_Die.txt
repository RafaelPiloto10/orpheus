Blessed are the warmongers

Eeh ah  
I have a dream this afternoon  
That the brotherhood of man  
Will become a reality in this day  
With this faith  
I will go out and  
Carve the tunnel of hope  
Through the mountain of despair  
With this faith  
I will go out with you and  
Transform dark the yesterdays  
Into bright tomorrows  
With this faith  
We will be able to achieve this new day  
When all of the God's children  
Black men and White men  
Jews and Gentiles  
Protestants and Catholics  
Will be able to join hands  
And sing with the Negroes  
In the spiritual head  
(Peacemaker die)  
Free at last, free at last  
(Peacemaker die)  
Thank God Almighty  
We're free at last  
I don't know why?  
Peacemaker die  
Peacemaker die  
Peacemaker die  
(Peacemaker die)  
Peacemaker die  
Peacemaker die  
I don't know why? Yeah  
Peacemaker die  
Just one last time
