I want to run  
I want to hide  
I want to break down the walls the hold me inside  
I want to reach out  
And touch the flame  
Where the streets have no name  
  
I want to feel  
The sun on my face  
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace  
I want to take shelter from poison rain  
Where the streets have no name  
  
Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name  
  
We're still building and burning down love  
Burning down love  
And when I go there  
I go there with you  
Where the streets have no name  
  
The city's aflood  
Our love turns to rust  
We're beaten and blown by the wind  
Trampled in dust  
I'll show you a place  
High on a desert plain  
Where the streets have no name  
  
Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name  
  
We're still building and burning down love  
Burning down love  
And when I go there  
It's all I can do  
Where the streets have no name  
  
Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name
