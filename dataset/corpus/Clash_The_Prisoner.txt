The prisoner meets the Muppet hi-fi  
North of Watford junction  
We get in but we don't have fun  
An' we leave before the truncheons  
So it's back to watch the day to day  
Saga of working people  
Hanging out the washing and clipping coupons  
And generally being decent  
  
Johnny too bad meets johnny be good  
In the Charing Cross Road  
That's the only thing that happened today  
Says the west end jungle code  
And all the Germans and all the French  
Jam themselves down the tube  
And re-enact the second world war  
While the rude boys get rude!  
  
And I look to my left  
And I look to my right  
And I'm looking for a man  
I'm looking for a sign  
I don't want to be the prisoner  
  
The prisoner lives in Camden Town  
Selling revolution  
The prisoner loads his tracking arm up  
With self-disillusion  
Your mother does the washing up  
Your old man digs the garden  
You're only free to dodge the cops  
An' bunk the train to stardom
