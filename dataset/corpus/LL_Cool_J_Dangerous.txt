His realm is a new horizon of cuts  
They expand from his hand as he conducts  
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography  
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography  
  
The lyrical virtual also makes his return  
All adversaries should be concerned  
LL Cool J is back again  
Let me allow to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator  
  
He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves  
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave  
English revision he endure any collision  
Like a searcher with a scalpel, he'll make the head decision  
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate  
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best  
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter  
All you sucker DJ's will scatter  
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy  
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name  
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain  
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains  
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change  
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry  
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous  
  
"I need a beat"  
  
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished  
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished  
My scenario, four-door stereo  
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio  
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J  
Say: "Ole", to what we just played  
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade  
And all competitors will be slayed  
Any comment is a compliment  
No groups' talent can be the equivalent  
Of mine and his combined  
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme  
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass  
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place  
A performance underrated, it's not narrated  
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated  
He's dangerous  
  
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second  
I called an old phrase from my last record  
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels  
Except I came hear to raise some hell  
Searchin' up sykes and cuts like the blade  
He the scuser dry-smudge and make Coolay  
I drink at steady, the record turns many  
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete  
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved as the record revolves  
DJ's dissolve, usually, physically, mentally  
He's an innovator, greater, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader  
Sometime I gotta check what I invest  
All Farmers Boulevard is where I rest  
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego  
Such palms kill a France, say, en Italiano  
The mouth protects and I'll inject into your ears  
A new concept cuts soon in silence to be unfair  
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail  
I'm dangerous
