I heard you come home late last night  
You moved so quietly  
Key in the door, light up the stairs  
But were you thinking of me?  
Don't want to lose you, don't want to harm you  
I just want to feel all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night?  
  
I listened to all your promises  
And lived with all those lies  
Pretending that I'm the only one  
When I've seen it in your eyes  
Maybe I need you, maybe it ain't true  
Maybe it's still all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night?  
How can I ask you who you were with last night?  
  
It's down to the feeling you get when you're with someone who really matters  
It's down to the love that you can show someone who really cares  
It's not up to you, it's not up to me  
Takes two people to agree  
It's down to the feeling you get when you're with someone who really matters  
  
Lately you and I ain't talked the way that lovers do  
Should accept the fact that maybe you've found someoe new  
If I could lose you, if I could hug you  
I'd still like to feel all right  
  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night
