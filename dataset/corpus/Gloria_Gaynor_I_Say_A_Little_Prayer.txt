The moment I wake up  
Before I put on my makeup  
I say a little prayer for you  
While combing my hair now  
And wondering what dress to wear now  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me  
  
I run for the bus dear  
While riding it I think of us dear  
I say a little prayer for you  
At work I just take time  
And all through my coffee break time  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me  
  
My darling believe me  
For me there is no one  
But you  
Please love me too  
I'm in love with you  
Answer my prayer  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me
