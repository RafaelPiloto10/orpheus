If you want to leave  
I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go, darlin'  
Maybe, it's better that way  
  
I'm gonna be strong, gonna be fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door and see if I care  
Go on and go now  
  
But don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I won't miss your arms around me  
Holding me tight, so tight, real tight  
And if you ever think about me  
Just know that I'll be all right  
  
I'm gonna be strong, gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive and I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
  
But don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
  
I wish I could cry out loud  
That I love you baby  
I wish I could say to you  
Don't go, don't go, don't go  
  
But don't turn around  
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know
