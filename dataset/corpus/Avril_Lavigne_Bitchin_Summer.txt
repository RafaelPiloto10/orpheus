Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Everyone is waitin' on the bell  
Couple seconds, we'll be raisin' hell.  
The sun is shinin' down, school is finally out.  
Nothin' matters, so we might as well.  
  
Everybody's bakin' in the sun,  
Come and party, do it while we're young.  
Move your body, when you hear the drum.  
So put your hands up!  
  
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,  
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
I'll pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be, be a bitchin' summer.  
Bitchin' summer  
Bitchin' summer  
  
Throwin' empty bottles in the fire  
Whiskey's got us singin' like a choir  
We're all gonna run, when the police come.  
But in the mornin' we're so alive.  
  
Everybody's bakin' in the sun,  
Come and party, do it while we're young.  
Move your body, when you hear the drum.  
So put your hands up!  
  
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,  
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
I'll pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.  
Bitchin' summer  
Bitchin' summer  
  
Right-right-right near the beach  
Te party don't stop  
If we don't get harassed by the motherfuckin' cops  
Quarter tank of gas  
About a half a pack  
My cell phone's dyin' but there's no turnin' back  
I can feel the breeze  
Steerin' with my knee  
Drummin' on the dashboard  
Bumpin' to the beat  
Hit the windshield wiper  
Searchin' for my lighter  
I gotta get right before this all nighter  
  
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,  
We'll be livin' fast, kickin' ass together  
Like high school lovebirds  
Gonna have a blast make it last forever  
I'll pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.  
Bitchin' summer  
Bitchin' summer  
  
Pick you up at the liquor store  
Hurry up, we can fit one more.  
It's now or never  
It's gonna gonna be be a bitchin' summer.
