You're spinning out of control again  
Your life feels like a sinking ship  
You're wondering how it came to this  
  
Is it too late?  
Is it too far?  
For Him to reach you  
And come to where you are  
  
Step out on the edge  
Don't be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
You're in the wreckage underneath  
Your hope is buried somewhere deep  
You're wondering how long it will keep?  
  
It's never too late  
Never too far  
For you to reach out  
And take a hold of love  
  
Step out on the edge  
Don't be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
Don't back down from the fight  
He'll shelter you tonight  
Just hold on for the change  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
There's a place, there's a place you can run  
When you fall, and it's all come undone  
You'll be safe in the raging storm  
So just let go  
'Cause you are held in His arms  
  
Step out on the edge  
Don't be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
Oh oh  
  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in a hurricane
