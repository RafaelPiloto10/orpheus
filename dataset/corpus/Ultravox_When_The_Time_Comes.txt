So you think it's over  
So you think that down's  
The only way out  
A sad excuse for lovers  
With your head held high  
And your heart still full of doubt  
It's just like you to scorn  
The only one who'll mourn  
The day he doesn't love you  
Chorus:  
When the time comes I'll cry  
On the day you cut the thread  
When my heart tears I'll cry  
So you gave up giving  
And you sit and smile  
When the awkward silence falls  
Deny the life you're living  
Just a fleeting love  
That you only half recall  
It's just like you to make  
A passion turned to hate  
The day he doesn't love you  
(Chorus)  
Still we're here together  
Feeling helpless as our heaven turns to hell  
The taker and the giver  
Washed in anger  
When we think how far we fell  
It's just like you to take  
The step than makes the break  
The day he doesn't love you  
When the time comes I'll cry  
When the time comes I'll cry  
When the time comes I'll cry  
When the time comes I'll cry
