Played live as intro into Starseed in 2003  
  
Sleep  
  
Sleep tonight  
  
And may your dreams  
  
Be realized  
  
If the thunder cloud  
  
Passes rain  
  
So let it rain  
  
Rain down on him  
  
So let it be  
  
So let it be  
  
Sleep  
  
Sleep tonight  
  
And may your dreams  
  
Be realized  
  
If the thundercloud  
  
Passes rain  
  
So let it rain  
  
Let it rain  
  
Rain on him
