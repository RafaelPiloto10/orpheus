Roses of red fall on my head  
He smiled then turned away  
Roses of red grow in my heart  
They bloom when he passes me by  
'Cause he he makes me happy  
And he he makes me fly  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
If you want paradise  
Then look at my eyes  
I'm as clear as the sky when it's blue  
If you want paradise  
Then look at me twice  
'Cause I'm not a normal red rose  
And he he makes me crazy  
And he he makes me fly  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
I know that he doesn't know me  
He's just too different no no  
I know he knows and he knows I know  
We're just too different no no  
Roses of red fall on my head  
He smiled then turned away  
Roses of red fall in my heart  
They bloom when he passes me by  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
Oh oh oh ...  
Smiled and turned away
