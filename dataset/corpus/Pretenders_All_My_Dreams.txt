All my dreams  
Still relive you  
If this is what you left for me  
I forgive you  
Never do I despair  
When I kneel to say my prayers  
When slumber fills my head  
I'll be visiting your bed  
  
All my dreams  
Recollect you  
And so darling in a way  
Our love remains new  
Funny little things  
You touch my fingers and fondle my rings  
Then tenderly without violence  
We make love in perfect silence  
  
Come, come into my room again  
Come, come again  
Oh come, come into my gloom again  
End this solitude again  
  
I finally took that picture down  
I'd been staring at it for hours and hours  
Slipping in and out of consciousness  
But what I can't figure out  
Why did you do that?  
Disappear on me like that?  
Oh baby please come back where I can touch you  
Right here where I can see you  
  
Come, come into my room again  
Come, come again  
Oh come, come into my gloom again  
Break, break this solitude again  
  
All of my dreams of your affection  
Never have I known  
Such sweet perfection  
No drug-induced bliss  
Could ever reach the heights of this  
Eternal and so pure  
Help me to endure  
All my dreams
