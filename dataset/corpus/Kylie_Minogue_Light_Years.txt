Listen can you hear the distant calling  
Far away but we'll be with you soon  
Rocketing to outer space in orbit  
Take us to the pop stars on the moon  
  
Uh  
Travel in light years  
Uh  
Travel in light years  
  
Have yourself a taste of foreign glamour  
Speeding on our way to something new  
Missing for a night but gone forever  
The crew are here to take good CARE of you  
  
Uh  
Travel in light years  
Uh

Please fasten your seat belts.  
My name is Kylie.  
I'll be your purser.  
The exits are located at the front and the rear of the craft.  
  
Get up to get down at discoteca  
Take a breath and take the plunge my dear  
Maybe things that you don't know are better  
I'll take you in my capsule out of here  
  
Uh  
Travel in light years  
Uh  
Travel in light years  
  
Thank you for flying KM Air.  
We hope you had a pleasant flight.  
Please fly with us again.
