I had Cadillac's in my future  
Debutantes in my past  
I made a deal with the devil for a whole lot of money  
Thinkin' it would last and last  
But a fool and his money are bound to part  
And what goes up must come down  
So take my advice, don't trust the roll of the dice  
Keep your feet on solid ground  
  
I used to have money one time  
Life of adventure and crime  
I used to have money one time  
Lots of women and wine  
But who's gonna tell a fool? Who's gonna tell a fool?  
Who's gonna tell a fool? That he ain't cool  
  
Now thems were hard times back in the eighties bous  
People barely had enough to get by  
But oh not me foot loose and fancy free  
There was nothing to myself I'd deny  
So fellas listen to my story now  
Though you have heard this tale befo'  
Take care of your needs and watch out for your greeds  
Or that wolf will be at your door  
  
I used to have money one time  
Life of adventure and crime  
I used to have money one time  
Now I ain't got a dime  
But who's gonna be the fool? Who's gonna be the fool?  
Who's gonna be the fool? It still ain't cool.  
  
Who's gonna tell a fool? Who's gonna tell a fool?  
Who's gonna tell a fool? It still ain't cool
