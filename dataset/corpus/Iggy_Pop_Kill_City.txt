Well I live here in kill city where the d--?-- meets the sea  
I live here in kill city where the d--?-- meets the sea  
It's a playground to the rich, but it's a loaded gun to me  
Well I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy  
I'm sick of keeping quiet and I am the wild boy  
But if I have to die here first I'm gonna make some noise  
(chorus)  
give it up -- ? turn? before you  
give it up -- ? turn? before you  
give it up -- ? turn? before you  
give it up -- ? turn? before you  
Yeah the sea is fascination man and everything's for free  
The sea is fascination man and everything's for free  
Until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees  
(chorus)  
give it up -- turn before you  
give it up -- turn before you  
give it up -- turn before you  
give it up -- turn before you  
give it up -- turn before you  
give it up -- turn before you
