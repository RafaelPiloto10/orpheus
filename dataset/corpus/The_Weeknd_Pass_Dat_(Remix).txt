[Chorus: Starrah]  
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt  
After blunt after blunt after, hey  
Cup after cup, gotta double that up  
I've been waitin' on this all day  
Nigga pass that shit, yeah  
Nigga pass that shit  
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt  
After blunt after blunt after, hey  
Cup after cup, gotta double that up

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]  
Smoke a little, smoke a little, smoke a little, all days  
I double that cup like the mixtape days  
I'm the same nigga, crack that shit  
Yeah, then pass that shit  
I pour up, I pour up, I pour up, I pour up some more  
Your shit too pink to be sipping so goddamn slow  
Nigga crack that shit  
Yeah  
Then pass that shit  
If you're not with me, I feel bad for your team  
You should cut them off, you can follow your dreams  
Now the tour is done, I'mma have me some fun  
Mix up that xan with a kickstand  
Strip club lit up cause the wristbands  
Your friends so low if you ain't my dog  
Don't talk to mine if you ain't my dog  
Mulsanne on deck with the emblem  
I own that shit, no rental  
We fuck up we fuck up we fuck up we fuck up the run  
My niggas come quick with that lambo, that's the shit  
Yeah that's the shit  
  
[Chorus: Starrah]  
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt  
After blunt after blunt after, hey  
Cup after cup, gotta double that up

Nigga pass that shit, yeah  
Nigga pass that shit  
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt  
After blunt after blunt after, hey  
Cup after cup, gotta double that up  
I've been waitin' on this all day

[Verse 2: Jeremih]  
What you women talkin' 'bout?  
I only wanna get up there  
A bad bitch rollin' up some good  
Light it up and hand me it  
All I wanna do, trouble up  
Extendo doubled up  
Tired as fuck ain't no more work  
Ease my mind, that's where it hurt  
Pull up in somethin' that go skrrt  
Fishtailin' like we Dirk  
Feel like Ray J for the purp  
Come and let me hit it first  
I'ma pass it if it's some gas  
I'ma pull up, might forget to ask  
Smokin' Ivory, passin' plenty tabs  
Roll the 'Wood up so it can last  
  
[Chorus: Starrah]  
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt  
After blunt after blunt after, hey  
Cup after cup, gotta double that up  
I've been waitin' on this all day  
Nigga pass that shit, yeah  
Nigga pass that shit  
Bunt after blunt after blunt after blunt  
After blunt after blunt after, hey  
Cup after cup, gotta double that up  
I've been waitin' on this all day  
Nigga pass that shit
