I was staring out the window  
The whole time he was talking to me  
It was a filthy pane of glass  
I couldn't get a clear view  
  
As he went on and on  
It wasn't the outside world I could see  
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
I was never focused on just one thing  
My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft  
It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view  
  
But I'm as good as asleep  
I bet you didn't know  
It takes a lot of it away if you do  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
Because the fact in fact  
Whatever's in front of me is covering my view  
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact  
I only see what I'm looking through  
  
I had to break the window  
It just had to be it was in my way  
Better that I break the window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
So again I've done the right thing  
I was never worried about that  
The answer's always been in clear view  
But even when the window's clean  
I still can't see for the fact  
That when it's clean it's so clear  
I can't tell what I'm looking through  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
I had to break the window  
It just had to be it was in my way  
Better that I break the window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
I had to break the window  
It was in my way  
Better that I break a window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
Or miss what I should see  
Or breaking him or her or me
