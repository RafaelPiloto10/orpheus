Pain, sorrow, tears  
Long, lonely years  
With love  
Having passed me by  
I could live a lie for you  
But truth is the road I choose  
Knowing all I need to do  
Is give to you  
  
Down, down down  
Where your dreams are found  
They're sleeping inside of us all  
They're sleeping inside of us all  
  
Nights, winters, years  
Pain, sorrow, tears of mine  
Cannot hold me now  
I'm a fool to fall for you  
But here  
In the morning light  
Tell me how can love be wrong  
And feel so right
