Do do do do do do do do do do  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la  
If it was up to me  
Well I'd lash out  
Freak out  
Scene on me  
I'd lose my sympathy  
If it was up to me  
  
I'm calling you away  
And promise you  
I'll be okay  
With everything that I've got  
I can explain to you some way  
  
That I've been waiting for love  
Waiting for love  
And I told you it'd be worth it  
Waiting for love  
  
I've gotta make it slow  
And yes I need  
And yes you go  
But I don't wanna know  
I gotta make it slow  
  
You  
Kissed me once for good luck  
And you told me it's true  
Uh oh oh oh uh oh oh oh  
Gotta tell you it's luck  
But I've never been down  
And I'm never gonna waste my time  
My time  
  
Last night I saw you talk  
You asked me for a talk  
And I was never there  
But I could never see  
If you would only be anywhere  
  
And I told you how to work it  
  
Waiting for love  
Waiting for love  
And I told you it'd be worth it  
Waiting for love  
Waiting for love  
I've been waiting for love  
And I told you it'd be worth it  
Waiting for love  
You said that I am perfect  
Ohh  
Waiting for love
