I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls  
With vassals and serfs at my side,  
And of all who assembled within those walls  
That I was the hope and the pride.  
I had riches all too great to count  
And a high ancestral name.  
  
But I also dreamt which pleased me most  
That you loved me still the same,  
That you loved me  
You loved me still the same,  
That you loved me  
You loved me still the same.  
  
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,  
That knights upon bended knee  
And with vows no maidens heart could withstand,  
They pledged their faith to me.  
And I dreamt that one of that noble host  
Came forth my hand to claim.  
  
But I also dreamt which charmed me most  
That you loved me still the same  
That you loved me  
You loved me still the same,  
That you loved me  
You loved me still the same.
