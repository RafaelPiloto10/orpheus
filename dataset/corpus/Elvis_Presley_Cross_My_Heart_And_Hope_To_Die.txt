I can't explain about last night  
Though things didn't look just right  
Please believe me there was nothing wrong  
I thought about you baby all night long  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie, mmm  
  
Talk about a piece of rotten luck  
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck  
She couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree  
Very hard to handle like a Model T  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie  
  
Please believe me when I say  
Wild horses couldn't drag me away  
From you 'cause I don't have to look too hard  
To see what I've got in my own back yard  
So be forgiving and forget  
Don't say my alibi's all wet (?)  
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb  
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie  
  
I wouldn't tell you no lie  
No no no no no no  
I wouldn't tell you no lie
