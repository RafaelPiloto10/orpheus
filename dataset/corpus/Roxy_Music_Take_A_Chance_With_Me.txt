As they say, two can play  
But keep that song away from me  
In my time too much love  
Has made me sad for so long  
I was lost, can't you see  
Through the long lonely night  
  
Heaven knows, I believe  
Won't you take a chance with me  
Sometimes I get so blue  
People say I'm just a fool  
All the world, even you  
Should learn to love the way I do  
  
I was blind, can't you see  
Through the long lonely night  
Heaven knows, I believe  
You can take a chance with me
