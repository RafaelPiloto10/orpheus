Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry he home x 2  
  
I looked over Jordan and what did I see  
Coming for to carry he home  
A band of angels coming after me  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
If you get there before I do  
Coming for to carry me home  
Tell all my friends I'm coming too  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Coming for to carry me home
