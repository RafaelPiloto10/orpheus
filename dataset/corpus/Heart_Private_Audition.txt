How are you?  
You can start anytime  
Got an appointment to keep for seven nights I couldn't sleep  
I'm in a state of disbelief it's my big chance on magic street  
I followed this fashion doll down the famous hall  
"Ginger won't be long at all", she said, "Take a number, you'll be called"  
I said, "I'm gonna show him what I can do  
Now it's just between us two"  
In the grand tradition, private audition  
I said, "I'm gonna show him what I can do  
And now it's just between us two"  
In the grand tradition, private audition, yeah  
Wish I knew then, what I know now  
I don't know what I did wrong I thought I really laid it on  
But when he called out for some more, I gave him my standard encore  
I gave him the Swanee River the good ship Rockin' Rye  
The Stars and Stripes Forever and the good old pal of mine  
But that ain't what he was on about, he was casting for his couch  
He said, "Come baby, show me what you can do  
And now it's just between us two"  
In the grand tradition, private audition  
You said, "Baby, baby, show me what you can do  
And now it's just between us two"  
It's a grand tradition, private audition, yeah
