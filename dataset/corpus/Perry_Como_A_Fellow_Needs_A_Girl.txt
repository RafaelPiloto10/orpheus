A fella needs a girl to sit by his side  
At the end of a weary day  
To sit by his side and listen to him talk  
And agree with the things he'll say!  
  
A fella needs a girl to hold in his arms  
When the rest of the world goes wrong  
To hold in his arms and know that she believes  
That her fellow is wise and strong!  
  
When things go right and his job's well done  
He wants to share the prize he's won  
If no one shares and no one cares  
Where's the fun of a job well done, or a prize you've won?  
  
A fella needs a home, his own kind of home  
But to make this dream come true  
A fella needs a girl, his own kind of girl  
My kind of girl is you!  
  
A fella needs a girl, his own kind of girl  
My kind of girl is you
