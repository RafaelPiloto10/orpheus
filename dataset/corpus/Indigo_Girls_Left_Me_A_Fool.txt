Everybody loves you and they want to know your story  
You go riding out a mystery concealed in all your glory  
But when it comes to flesh and bones you remind me of Shalot  
Only made of shadows even though you're not  
  
I remember how I spent all my energy and time  
With affected conversation trying to pry inside your mind  
You are as beautiful as truth and empty as a shell  
And I came to you one night and it made me feel like hell  
  
Oh, to reach through all your surface  
Just to find an empty pool  
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side  
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool  
Left me a fool  
  
Everybody loves a hero an image to create  
Antithesis of everything inside theirselves they hate  
But you'd better close your eyes when it's time for them to die  
Cause you'd hate to think the life we built upon them was a lie  
  
Oh, to reach through all your surface  
Just to find an empty pool  
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side  
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool  
Left me a fool  
  
I resign myself to silence I will never blow your cover  
No one ever has to know who the hero took for lover  
But it comes to mind as you blaze on as brilliant as a star  
How many you've left behind, how many casualties there are  
  
To reach through all your surface  
Just to find an empty pool  
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side  
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool  
Left me a fool
