I wasn't ready  
I gave myself to you  
Look at the damage  
See what you put me through  
I don't want to do what you want me to anymore  
I won't feel better 'til I'm walking out of that door  
Once you could stop me  
Now I can say you won't  
I will be going  
I'm just afraid I don't  
Know how I'm gonna get away from you  
And I know I'm never gonna stay with you  
Don't want to ever spend another day with you  
Look at the damage you've done  
Two can turn back into one  
You hurt me so much  
You'll never do that again  
It's time to leave you  
This has to come to an end  
But I don't know how I'm gonna get away from you  
And I know I'm never gonna stay with you  
Don't think there's any other way to say to you  
Look at the damage you've done  
Look at the damage  
Look at the damage  
Look at the damage you've done  
Two can turn back into one  
Woah oh  
Woah oh  
Oh I know  
Yes I know  
Talking to you
