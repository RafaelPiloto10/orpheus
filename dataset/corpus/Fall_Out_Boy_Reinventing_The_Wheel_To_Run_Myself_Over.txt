I could walk this fine line between elation and success  
But we all know which way I'm going  
So strike the stake between my chest  
Well "You have to prove yourself"  
You'll have to prove it to me  
  
So now you're waiting up for him  
You're wasting time every time  
  
I can't do it by myself  
  
I can't wake up to these reminders of who I am:  
A failure at everything  
18 going on extinct  
I know my place  
It's nowhere you should roam
