You take a hammer, you get some nails, you build a home  
Find a woman put that woman in that little home  
But without love, true, true love in that home  
Yes, without love, that little home just ain't a home  
You cheat a little, you leave your baby all alone  
You bend the nails, you walk the boards in that little home  
'cause without love, true, true love in that home  
Yes, without love that little home can't be a home  
Yes, without love in that home  
There ain't a hammer big enough  
So when your nights of fun are through  
Don't be surprised to find yourself there all alone  
'cause without love, true, true love in that home  
Yeh, without love that little home just can't be a home  
Yeh, without love that little home just can't be a home
