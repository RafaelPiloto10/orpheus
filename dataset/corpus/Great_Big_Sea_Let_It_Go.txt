Hey man, you don't know what you're missing  
You count your curses and forget about the blessings  
Don't you think you should learn a little lesson  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Hey man, what makes you so special  
Can't seem to find the angels for the devils  
Don't you think that if you learned to love a little  
You'd live a whole lot more  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it go, let it go  
This is smaller than you know  
No bigger than a pebble lying on a gravel road  
Let it go, let it go  
Got to leave it all behind you  
Give the sun a chance to find you  
Let it go  
  
Lift you head, there's no time for crying  
You made your bed but don't think its fit to lie in  
Wasted on the ground when you know you should be flying  
What are you waiting for?  
  
How can a man not see  
It seems so clear to me  
You've just got to live and learn  
Smile at the simple stuff  
This road ain't long enough  
To miss a single turn
