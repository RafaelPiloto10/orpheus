A slap in the face  
It is endowed  
The light of my life  
Is put out somehow  
I'm lying in pieces of  
Emotions, you control  
You're feeding my sympathy  
The lie unfolds  
  
[Chorus]  
Feeling this hostility, I pray  
Begging, make this evil go away  
Conveying the things I only fear  
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears  
  
The lines that I traced  
Around the scars they swell  
In plain with sedative  
To numb this spell  
I'm lying in pieces of  
Emotions, you control  
You're feeding this cancer  
It's taken hold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feeling, animosity  
When no one else is around  
Blindly, I scream into the air  
Eating my heart off the ground  
  
[Chorus]
