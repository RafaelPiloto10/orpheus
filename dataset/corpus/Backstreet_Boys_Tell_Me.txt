Backstreet Boys - Tell me  
  
(Yeah)  
You can tell me what you want  
  
Girl you struck me like the sun  
So just tell me how you wanna be done  
I know you a couple of weeks  
You seem like you don't play stupid tricks  
  
Sweety you are so beautiful  
I can imagine you must feel wonderful  
I like to know what I need to do  
How to behave, oh how to please you  
I can't take it, oh come home  
Let me feel those hips  
You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you  
  
So let me put my ego on the side (whatever you wish)  
I ain't got no pride  
Girl I became your biggest fan  
I could be your perfect man  
  
Chorus  
You can tell me what you want  
You can tell me what you need  
I will do whatever you want  
Just don't make my heart bleed  
Girl don't you understand  
That your wish is my command  
So baby drop the match  
Show me what's the task  
And tell me everything you want  
  
Girl you told me what was in the past  
All the relationships that never last  
No man ever let you be free  
And oh you're fed up with the jealousy  
  
I'll give you all the freedom that you need  
Baby you and I will succeed  
I like to know what I need to do  
How to behave, oh how to please you  
I can't take it, oh come home  
Let me kiss those lips  
You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you  
  
Don't want violated things and make you mad  
Don't want violated things that make you sad  
Let me just find it right here pretty lady  
We can make it baby  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
What if we loose all the money baby  
What if there's nothing but you and me  
Tell me what would you do pretty lady  
Would you at least take care of me  
  
You can tell me how you deal the stress  
When everything becomes a big mess  
We stay strong and fight it off  
Or would you pack your shhh, and take off..  
  
Spend your life with me baby  
Spend your life with me baby girl  
Spend your life with me baby  
Spend your life with me baby girl  
(2x)  
  
Chorus (2x)
