Caught in the heat of the night.  
There when things ain't goin right  
No, no, no, you will remember me...  
  
I came along to see your face,  
But the only thing I got from you,  
Was telling me it's fantasy,  
That you would always be with me,  
I can tell you that it's true  
I'm waiting here,  
But it's alright  
It's alright with me,  
You better believe me now.  
  
I guess it's like a mountain side,  
You gotta climb it to the top,  
Floating in a sea of dreams  
The only thing that you can see  
Is the view above the clouds.  
I'm waiting here,  
But it's alright,  
Still it's alright with me,  
You better believe me now.
