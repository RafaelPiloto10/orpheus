Jimi:  
"yeah, thank you very much. I'd like to do this song dedicated  
To maybe A soldier in the army. Singin' about his old lady that  
He dreams about and humpin' A machine gun instead or it could be  
Could be A cat maybe tryin' to fall in love with that girl baby,  
But A little bit too scared. That's where the problems come from  
Sometimes isn't it? I meen the cat is really insecure A little bit  
So the call girls groupies and they call girls this. And they call  
Passive people hippies and bla bla, woof, woof, all down the line  
That's because their not in love man that's what's happening. That's  
The other half of A man, is woman. And we'd like to play A thing called  
Izabella, and don't you ever forget it. "
