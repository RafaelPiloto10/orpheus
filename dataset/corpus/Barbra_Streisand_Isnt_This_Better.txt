Fanny  
I loved the man  
Truly i did  
When he would touch me i act like a love-hungry kid  
Isn't this better  
Somebody nice somebody new  
Someone who lets me react as i normally do  
Isn't this better  
Better  
Passion is fine but passion burns fast  
Passions design seems never to last  
Better a match better a blend  
Who needs a lover i need a friend  
Now i am calm save and serene  
Heartache and hurt are no longer a part of the scene  
Isn't this better  
The way it should be  
Better for him  
And also much better for me  
Isn't this better  
Better

Much better for him
