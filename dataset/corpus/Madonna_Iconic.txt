[Intro: Mike Tyson]  
I'm the best the world has ever seen.  
(And the best ever! )  
'M somebody you'll never forget cause I work hard and sweat in my tears.  
(Can't be stopped! )  
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back  
  
[Verse 1: Madonna]  
If you try and fail, get up again  
Destiny will choose you in the end  
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice  
Someone else will speak for you instead  
  
[Verse 2: Madonna]  
What you want is just within your reach  
But you gotta practice what you preach  
You paid with sweat and tears to overcome your fears  
Never let the fire inside you leave  
  
[Hook: Madonna]  
I can, Icon, two letters apart  
One step away from being lost in the dark  
Just shine your light like a beautiful star  
Show the world who you are, who you are  
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees  
There's another part that's underneath  
Baby, don't you know you were  
Meant to be, want to be, meant to be  
Iconic, iconic, ironic, iconic  
  
[Verse 3: Madonna]  
Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great  
Say I have to fight and I can't wait  
Standing in the wings, a butterfly that stings  
I will rise above because it's my fate  
  
[Hook: Madonna]  
I can, Icon,two letters apart  
One step away from being lost in the dark  
Just shine your light like a beautiful star  
Show the world who you are, who you are  
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees  
There's another part that's underneath  
Baby, don't you know you were  
Meant to be, want to be, meant to be  
Iconic, iconic, ironic, iconic  
  
[Bridge: Madonna]  
Born to be a superstar, that's exactly what you are  
Born to be a superstar, that's exactly what you are  
  
[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]  
Alright  
Firefly chain, wanna catch you  
Wanna put you in a net for their light glow  
Yellow brick highway, paparazzi pile-up on the high road  
They just turned the sun into an idol  
They just wanna see how high the sky go  
Just to find how it feel to fall bad  
Madonna said I remind her of Michael  
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head  
Put it on your wall  
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws  
Put me in a descant in the Synagogue  
Firefly gold, wanna catch ya  
Wanna catch you when your lights go dim  
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo  
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen  
You an icon

There's another part that's underneath  
Baby, don't you know you were  
Meant to be, want to be, meant to be  
Iconic, iconic, ironic, iconic
