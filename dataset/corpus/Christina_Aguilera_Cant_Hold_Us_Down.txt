So-what am I not supposed to have an opinion  
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women  
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind  
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled  
  
When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act  
So he does what every little boy would do  
Makin' up a few false rumors or two  
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity  
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy  
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say  
  
[Chorus]  
This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth  
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls, shout out loud  
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can, never will  
Can't hold us down  
  
Nobody can hold us down  
Never can, never will  
  
So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying  
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'  
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing  
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing  
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society  
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score  
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore  
I don't understand why it's OK,  
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named  
All my ladies come together and make a change  
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang  
  
[Chorus]  
This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth  
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls, shout out loud  
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can, never will  
Can't hold us down  
  
Here's something I just can't understand  
If the guy have three girls then he's the man  
He can even give her some head, or sex her off  
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore  
But the tables about to turn  
I bet my fame on it  
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it  
It's aight though, you can't hold me down  
I got to keep on moving  
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac  
Do it right back to him and let that be that  
You need to let him know that his game is whack  
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back  
  
You're just a little boy  
Think you so cute, so coy  
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things  
You're just a little boy  
All you do is annoy  
You must talk big to make up for smaller things  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Uh, oh oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Can't hold us down  
  
Yeah, we here, we back again, yeah,  
Lil Kim and Christina Aguilera  
  
Can't hold us down
