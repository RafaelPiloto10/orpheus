Peaches and cream  
  
The light was on, and everything I felt was strong  
I watched as your mascara ran  
Didn't get far on that golden tan  
  
I heard you sigh, but I don't wanna see you cry  
You looked just like a walking dream  
Sweeter than peaches and cream  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you want me let me know  
I can show you how  
If you've got nowhere to go  
I can show you now  
  
I'm yours to tame, and I don't even know your name  
I like to touch your perfect skin  
I can't stop once I begin  
  
To show you more than I have ever shown before  
If you could read what's on my mind  
Give me yours and I'll give you mine  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We could be, we could see  
More than we know  
We should be, we should see  
More than we know  
And I'd like to know  
  
(Chorus)(Twice)  
  
Sweeter than peaches and cream (If you want me let me know)  
Sweeter than peaches and cream (I can show you how)  
(Repeat and fade)
