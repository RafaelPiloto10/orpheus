Performed by Prince  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Don't know when I'll be coming back  
Got my future  
All planned out  
Got my bags packed  
Things don't always turn out right  
That's just the way it goes  
Before I leave you there's just a few things you should know  
  
Don't talk 2 strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
And one day he'll make everything alright  
Don't cross on yellow  
you always got to wait 4 a green light  
Remember god he made you  
One day he'll make everything alright  
  
Alright  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Don't worry you'll be just fine  
When it comes 2 good luck  
I just know, I just know you'll always be the first in line  
Nobody'll ever love you as much as I do  
That doesn't mean other people won't love you 2  
Don't talk 2 strangers  
Don't forget 2 say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
And one day he'll make everything alright  
Don't cross on yellow  
you always got to wait 4 a green light  
Remember god he made you  
And one day he'll make things alright  
  
Alright  
Make everything alright  
Alright  
  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Got my future all planned out  
Before I go  
Don't talk 2 strangers  
Don't forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
One day he'll make everything alright
