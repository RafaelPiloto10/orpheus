It seems like yesterday  
But it was long ago  
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights  
There in the darkness with the radio playing low  
And the secrets that we shared  
The mountains that we moved  
Caught like a wildfire out of control  
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove  
And I remember what she said to me  
How she swore that it never would end  
I remember how she held me oh so tight  
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then  
  
Against the wind  
We were runnin' against the wind  
We were young and strong, we were runnin'  
Against the wind  
  
The years rolled slowly past  
And I found myself alone  
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends  
I found myself further and further from my home  
And I guess I lost my way  
There were oh so many roads  
I was living to run and running to live  
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed  
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time  
Breaking all of the rules that would bend  
I began to find myself searching  
Searching for shelter again and again  
  
Against the wind  
A little something against the wind  
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind  
  
Well those drifter's days are past me now  
I've got so much more to think about  
Deadlines and commitments  
What to leave in, what to leave out  
  
Against the wind  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind  
Well I'm older now and still runnin'  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
  
Still runnin'  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
I'm still runnin'  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
Still runnin'  
Runnin' against the wind  
Runnin' against the wind  
See the young man run  
Watch the young man run  
Watch the young man runnin'  
He'll be runnin' against the wind  
Let the cowboys ride  
Let the cowboys ride  
They'll be ridin' against the wind  
Against the wind ...
