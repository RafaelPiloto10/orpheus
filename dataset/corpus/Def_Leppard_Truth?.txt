I've been burning  
And dousing the flames  
I feel the whiplash  
Of the backlash on my face  
I melt to sleep at night  
But I wake to trip the day  
Never for you never for me  
Would I kiss your feet of clay  
  
I'm still alive and so should I  
Soak up the wave of compromise  
Am I the victim of youth  
Is this the truth  
Why don't you tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
  
There's no conscience  
In charity or shame  
The voice deceives me  
But believe me it's the same  
I see the black in white  
And the color in the gray  
Better for me better for you  
Gonna bleach it all away  
  
I'm still alive and so should I  
Soak up the wave of compromise  
Am I the victim of youth  
Is this the truth  
Why don't you tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
  
Left hand gives  
And the right hand takes away  
  
Why don't you tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
I'm still alive and so should I  
Soak up the wave of compromise  
I see the scars, I hear the lies  
So what's the truth  
Why don't you tell me
