I was born in Little Rock  
I had a childhood sweetheart  
We were always hand in hand  
He wore high top shoes and shirt tails  
Chaka wore her pigtails  
I knew I loved him even then  
  
Well you know my papa disapproved  
My mama boo hoo hooed  
But I told 'em time and time again  
Don't you know  
  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
He's been my inspiration  
And shows appreciation  
For the love I gave him through the years  
Like a sweet magnolia tree  
My love blossoms tenderly  
My life grew sweeter through the years  
I know that  
  
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
That's why we've made it through the years  
  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
All through thick and thin  
My love just won't end  
'Cause my I love my baby, love my baby, oh  
  
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
That's why we've made it through the years  
  
When I was knee-high to a chicken  
The love bug bit me  
And I'm still, still in love  
  
If the distant mountain crumble  
Love won't tumble  
I'll still be standin' there  
  
Can't go nowhere, I'm on fire...
