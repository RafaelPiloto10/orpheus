Close to my skin  
I'm falling in  
Someone whos been  
  
Sittin by the phone  
I'm left alone  
In another zone  
  
John says to live above hell and  
My will is well  
  
No one is waiting  
For me to fail and  
My will could sail, yeah  
  
Its such a waste to be wasted  
In the first place  
I want to taste the taste of  
Being face to face with common grace  
To meditate on the warmest dream  
And when I walk alone I listen  
To our secret theme  
  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That can see right through  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
  
Sailin for the sun  
Cause there is one  
Knows where I'm from  
I care for you  
I really do, I really do  
  
Come closer now  
So you can lie  
Right by my side  
  
Sittin alone in the sun  
I wrote a letter to you  
Gettin over myself, yeah  
  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That can see right through  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That was made for you  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
  
Close to my skin  
Someone whos been  
I'm falling in  
  
Disasters are  
Just another star  
Fallin in my yard  
  
John says to live above hell  
My will is well  
  
Long to be with  
Someone to tell  
I love your smell
