I keep forgetting you don't love me no more  
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more  
I keep forgetting that you told me that you  
Didn't want me around anymore  
But these stupid old feet  
Just head for your street  
Like they've done so many times before  
And this stubborn old fist  
At the end of my wrist  
Keeps knocking on your front door  
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more  
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more  
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights  
Ant those heartbreaking things that you said  
Though it's plain as can be  
You're finished with me  
I can't believe our love is dead  
Though I know in my heart  
We've drifted apart  
I just can't get it through my head
