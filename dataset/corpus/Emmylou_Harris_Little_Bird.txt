If I had a bird, a little bird  
I would teach that bird to sing your name  
Prettiest song that you have ever heard  
And your indifferent heart I will claim  
  
So be off, my little bird  
Fly away, fly away  
And when my love you see  
Only then, my little bird  
Cry away, cry away, and bring that heart to me  
  
If I had a moon in the sky  
I would light the world and pull the tide  
And when the moon is full like my heart  
It will surely pull you to my side  
But in the darkest night I pine away  
Pine away until your face I see  
So throw your light, my lovely moon  
Shine away, shine away, and pull his heart to me  
  
If I had a wagon made of gold  
Pretty painted horses numbered four  
With a silver harness I would hitch them up  
And drive that wagon to your door  
And if my hand you choose to hold  
Ride away, ride away with the pretty horses four  
But, darlin', if you heart's still cold  
Hide away, hide away till trouble you no more  
Trouble you no more
