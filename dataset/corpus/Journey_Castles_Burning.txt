Jimmy wanted her the moment that she stumbled his way  
With a cocktail in her hand, she knew how she'd win the game  
There were beautiful in all the right places  
She keeps her rendezvous with soup opera faces  
She started rumors that were driving him crazy  
He couldn't stop the things they'd say  
  
And they live for, passion, love and pain  
In a rage of jealousy and fame  
And they watch their dreams go up on flames  
  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Wo... burnin'...  
  
In the kingdom of pretenders love is not what it seems  
Jimmy cried and then he punished her  
No one heard her scream  
On the outside, it's all crimson and clover  
On the inside, they know it's over  
  
And the band of lawyers that steal the show  
As they watch their world go up in smoke  
  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Wo... burnin'... burnin'... burnin'... burnin'...  
  
When we return a story of a 5 alarm fire  
Late last night in the prestigious Hollywood hills  
Where one of the most controversial marriages in the  
Entertainment industry went up in smoke, arson is suspected  
It is still under investigation...  
  
You know I love you, you know you're my girl,  
I'd never hurt you... no  
  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Burnin'... burnin'  
  
All is fair in love and war, but war is hell...  
In the heart of the night, in the middle of the big bad city
