Heavenly arms reach out to hold me  
Heavenly arms entice you to dance  
In a world of ill will, the dancers are still  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Heavenly arms, soft as a love song  
Heavenly arms bring a kiss to your ear  
In a world that seems mad, all the dancers seem sad  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia,  
Heavenly arms come to my rescue  
Only a woman can love a man  
In a world full of hate, love should never wait  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Heavenly arms, strong as a sunset  
Heavenly arms, pure as the rain  
Lovers stand warned of the worlds impending storm  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia  
  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)  
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)  
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)  
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)
