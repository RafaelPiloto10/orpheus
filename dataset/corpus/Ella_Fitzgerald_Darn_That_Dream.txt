Darn that dream I dream each night  
You say you love me and hold me tight  
But when I awake and you're out of sight  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn your lips and darn your eyes  
They lift me high above the moonlit sky  
Then I tumble out of paradise  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn that one-track mind of mine  
I can't understand that you don't care  
Just to change the mood I'm in  
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare  
  
Darn that dream and bless it too  
Without that dream I never have you  
But it haunts me and it won't come true  
Oh, darn that dream
