You don't love me this I know  
Don't need a bible to tell me so  
I hung around a little too long  
I was good but now I'm gone  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
Any way the wind can blow  
That's where I'm gonna go  
I'll be gone like a five and dime  
It'll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know  
  
The shoulder I've been leanin' on  
Is the coldest place I've ever known  
There's nothin' left for me round here  
Looks like it's time to disappear  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
The old wall down in Jericho  
Maybelle on the radio  
I'll be gone like the five and dime  
It'll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know  
  
You don't love me, this I know  
Don't need a bible to tell me so  
It's a shame and it's a sin  
Everything I coulda been to you  
  
Your last chance Texaco  
Your sweetheart of the rodeo  
A Juliet to your romeo  
The border you cross into Mexico  
I'll never understand why or how  
Oh but baby its too late now  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know
