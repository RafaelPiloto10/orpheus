I went down to dock number ten  
To see what just came in.  
They seemed a little bit mysterious,  
I think I'm gonna get delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS  
  
I got nailed in a raid last night,  
They tried to haul me off to jail.  
Things were looking kind of serious  
Till everybody got delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS  
  
I fell into a hand of cards  
And almost blew the night away.  
Things were looking kind of furious  
Till everybody got delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS  
  
I overloaded and I saw the light,  
Decadence was on my mind.  
Everything was getting ridiculous  
Till everybody get delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS
