The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
I can't remember a worse December  
Just watch those icicles form!  
What do I care if icicles form?  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Out with the fire off with the sweater  
I got a heater couldn't be better will be  
So confess all through the storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm
