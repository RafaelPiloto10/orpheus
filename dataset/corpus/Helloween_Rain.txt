How can I see what Im leaving for?  
How can I give what I gave before?  
How can you tell me that you want me to stay?  
How can I stay when Im trying to say,  
That I cant live without the rain,  
Yes I cant live without the rain.  
  
How can I feel what Im trying to feel,  
How can I move when Im heel to heel,  
Youre always shouting about the doubt in my eye,  
But I cant answer cos my eyes are so dry.  
Now I cant live without the rain.  
Yes I cant live without the rain.  
  
I cant live without the rain,  
Thats falling on my head,  
Rain thats falling on my head.  
  
Rain thats falling,  
Rain thats falling,  
Rain thats falling on my head.  
  
Id started thinking back to you when,  
Id like to send a line but then again,  
How can I write you when there aint no light,  
Im feeling tight tonight but thats alright.  
Now I cant live without the rain,  
Yes I cant live without the rain.
