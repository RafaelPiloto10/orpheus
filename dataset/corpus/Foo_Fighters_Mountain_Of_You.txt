I can't wait til it's light out,  
There's some things I should get them done,  
Tried inhaling some white out,  
Ended up with some bleeding gums.  
  
Anything I left in the closet,  
Shouldn't have a hard time getting out,  
If I had the time I could make it,  
Seems to be the chances are chasing,  
  
All the substance I've done without,  
And all the luck that I've hated,  
Aside from all of the petty doubt,  
Can't believe I have made it.  
  
I'm afraid of the dark now,  
It's the sign of a patsy,  
Round the time of the door brow,  
We should let it come in,  
  
Never put your face in the water,  
It hurts your eyes when they open up,  
Not that any different could matter,  
It's just a different conspirit.  
  
If there's one thing I could laugh about,  
Solve this mess I've created,  
I've tried a part of the sacred cow,  
  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
  
If there's one thing I could laugh about,  
Solve this mess I've created,  
I've tried a part of the sacred cow,  
  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you
