If Beale Street could talk  
Beale Street could talk  
Married men would have to  
Take their beds and walk  
Except one or two  
Who never drink booze  
And the blind man on the corner  
Who sings the Beale Street Blues  
I'd rather be here  
Than any place I know  
I'd rather be here  
Than any place I know  
It's gonna take the sergeant  
For to make me go  
Goin' to the river  
Maybe by and by  
Goin' to the river  
And there's a reason why  
Because the river's wet  
And Beale Street's done gone dry  
Goin' to the river  
Maybe by and by  
Goin' to the river  
And there's a reason why  
Because the river's wet  
And Beale Street's done gone dry  
Because the river's wet  
And Beale Street's done gone dry  
Because the river's wet  
And Beale Street's done gone dry
