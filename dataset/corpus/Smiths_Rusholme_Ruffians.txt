The last night of the fair  
By the big wheel generator  
A boy is stabbed  
And his money is grabbed  
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine  
  
She is famous  
She is funny  
An engagement ring  
Doesn't mean a thing  
To a mind consumed by brass (money)  
  
And though I walk home alone  
I might walk home alone...  
...But my faith in love is still devout  
  
The last night of the fair  
From a seat on a whirling waltzer  
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye  
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)

And though I walk home alone

...But my faith in love is still devout  
  
Then someone falls in love  
And someone's beaten up  
Someone's beaten up  
And the senses being dulled are mine

This is the last night of the fair  
And the grease in the hair  
Of a speedway operator  
Is all a tremulous heart requires  
A schoolgirl is denied  
She said : "How quickly would I die  
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"  
La...

So...scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen  
(This means you really love me)

Oh...

I just might walk home alone
