I've seen the Ides of March  
And I've seen the fall of Rome  
I've seen all kinds of stuff  
But I never see my home  
If my life-line is  
These million miles of track  
One thing I know by now  
There is no turning back  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
If every venture was  
A path to no avail  
I'd still be rolling down  
This never ending trail  
If we had a destination  
In our sights  
We would be helpless as  
We passed it in the night  
From a moving train (hear the engine running)  
From a moving train (you can get on board)  
From a moving train (hear the motor humming)  
From a moving train (see, you've gotta see the light)  
And if by chance you find a woman  
That you might love along the way  
You better hold her tight  
Tell her everything's alright  
Or she might jump along the way  
From a moving train (hear the engine running)  
From a moving train (you can get on board)  
From a moving train (hear the motor humming)  
From a moving train (see, you've gotta see the light)  
From a moving train (hear the engine running)  
From a moving train (you can get on board)  
From a moving train (hear the motor humming)  
From a moving train (see, you've gotta see the light)
