My plane set down in nashville at a quarter after 2  
A little while and I'd be on my way back home to you  
While I was waitin' for my flight, got out and looked around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
I met some entertainers and they had an extra girl  
I told them I was just a tourist out to see the world  
From one place to another, yes we really made the rounds  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Next day they all took me in just like they did before  
I guess I'm trying to tell you I won't be home anymore  
Now this may sound poetic, but I'm happy as a clown  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
Remember how I used to sit and drink and play guitar  
And I'd get up and sing for all those folks at jody's bar  
Well I found out it ain't too bad, the way I pick and sound  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
You know that nest egg that we buried in the bank awhile  
Take it out and spend it darlin', dress yourself in style  
You have always been a swinger and now I won't be around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
I've got myself a little shack out on ol' hickory lake  
And now and then I get a gig and buy myself a steak  
Why'know, they published one of my old songs, they're showing it around  
Nashville is a groovy little town  
You remember all those tranquilizers that I used to take  
Well I'm not on those anymore, I'm on old hickory lake  
So when you start cryin' here's the best one-liner I have found  
What else you got? yes, nashville is a groovy little town
