Ah, hey, ah oh  
  
Baby, baby yeah, are you listenin'?  
Wondering, where you've been, all my life  
I just started living  
Oh, baby are you listenin' oh?  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you  
  
Baby, can ya hear me?  
When I'm crying out, for you,  
I'm scared oh, so scared,  
When you're near me  
I feel like I'm standing with an army  
Of men armed with weapons, hey oh  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you  
  
I love lying next to you  
I could do this for eternity,  
You and me, were meant to be in holy matrimony  
God knew exactly what he was doing  
When he lead me to you  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you,  
I adore you
