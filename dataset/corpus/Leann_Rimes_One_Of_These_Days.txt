Wish someone would tell me when  
I won't think of you again.  
  
I'll get past the emptiness and  
Let a little happiness back in.  
  
Pretending I don't care,  
Leaves me half way there.  
  
One of these, one of these days  
I'll be completely over you.  
Heaven knows how long it will take.  
And one of these, one of these days  
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away  
One of these days  
  
One of these days  
Some how, some way  
  
Ever since you've been gone,  
Time has a way of dragging on and on.  
  
Friends drive by for company,  
But I'm not much company for long.  
  
Oh I'll get past what was,  
If I live long enough  
  
One of these, one of these days  
I'll be completely over you.  
Heaven knows how long it will take.  
And one of these, one of these days  
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away (some way)  
  
One of these days  
Some how, some way  
  
One of these, one of these days  
I'll be completely over you.  
Heaven knows how long it will take.  
And one of these, one of these days  
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away  
One of these days  
  
One of these days (one of these days)  
One of these days (some how, some way)  
One of these days (one of these days)
