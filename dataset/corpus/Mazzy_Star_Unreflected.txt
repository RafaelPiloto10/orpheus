Once it's life's fortunate  
Isn't this so  
The unreflected feeling  
Of a shortened final soul  
The life that cuts the cold  
Now is in your past  
In our memories  
We don't have much to say  
We don't have much to say  
We don't have much  
Follow anybody  
Is that what you do  
Maybe it transfits  
Done something else with you  
Now we know what we'll be in the past  
Another story  
Another life that's left  
Another life that's left
