Don't sleep 'til the sunrise, listen to the falling rain  
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, don't worry 'bout your pain  
Don't cry unless you're happy, don't smile unless you're blue  
Never let that lonely monster take control of you  
  
[Chorus]  
Be glad that you are free  
Free to change your mind  
Free to go most anywhere, anytime  
Be glad that you are free  
There's many a man who's not  
Be glad for what you had baby, what you've got  
Be glad for what you've got  
  
I know (my?) heart is beating, my drummer tells me so  
If you take your life for granted, your beating heart will go  
So don't sleep until you're guilty, cause sinners all are we  
There's others doing far worse than us, so be glad that you are free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soldiers are a marching, they're writing brand new laws  
Will we all fight together for the most important cause?  
Will we all fight for the right to be free?  
Free (Be glad that you are free)  
Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)  
Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere,anytime)  
I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah (Be glad that you are free)  
There's many a man who's not (There's many a man who's not)  
Glad for what I had baby, (Be glad for what you had and)  
Glad for what I got, oh yeah (for what you've got)  
Oh I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free,yeah (Be glad that you are free)  
Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)  
Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere, anytime)  
(Be glad that you are free)  
(There's many a man who's not)  
I'm so (Be glad for what you had and for)  
(what you've got)
