Life's a garden, life is king  
Life is all and everything  
Life is golden, life is fair  
Like a rainbow in your hair  
Life's a once fantastic light  
Life is shining in the night  
Life's a fire from above  
Life is you and life is love  
Life is golden, life is king  
Life is all and everything  
Nothing to believe in  
It's just there, without a care  
And no religion than the enigma of love  
Life is king  
Life's a poison much too strong  
Makes you running on and on  
Life's a drug  
And not your friend  
Life will kill you in the end  
Life is smooth and life is friction  
Life is such a contradiction  
Life is god  
And god needs lives  
Life's a billion battle cries  
Life is golden
