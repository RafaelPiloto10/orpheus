With her hair up in his fingers  
The fish and chips smell lingers  
Under amber streetlamps  
She holds the law in her hands  
The moistness of the damp night  
Falls silent through the lamplight  
Although she's only fourteen  
She really knows her courting  
And up the railway sidings  
There's him and her  
They're lying  
Hand in hand they whisper  
You're my missus and I'm your mister  
The moon as white and virgin  
And she was on the turning  
Remember your first nibble  
When best friends were so little  
  
They really trooped the colors  
When walking with each other  
And all her mates would giggle  
As ladylike she'd wiggle  
All along the high street  
They'd splash out on an ice cream  
He'd sometimes really treat her  
But he'd done his mother's meter  
  
Well he went off to borstal  
He said that he was forced to  
Rob the flats of hi fi's  
'cause she was ill  
And she would cry  
Each morning she got sicker  
Her mother sometimes hit her  
If she'd have known the story  
She would have been so sorry  
  
He received a letter and admitted it  
There was nothing else to do but get rid of it  
Lonely in his dormitory  
He'd sit and stare  
If this is for real  
And is it really fair  
  
Summer came so they went  
Down to the coast in his tent  
She cooked upon his primus  
And sampled local cider  
She told him in his rucksack  
I think i want that chance back  
To be perhaps the one who  
Will forever love you
