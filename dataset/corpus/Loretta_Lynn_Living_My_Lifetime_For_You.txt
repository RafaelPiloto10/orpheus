Many heartaches have passed since we met  
There's a kind that a heart can't forget  
And the sweet memories are too few  
While I'm living my lifetime for you  
I'm living my life for you  
You're living to break me in two  
I'd die while you're being untrue  
Still I'm living my lifetime for you  
[ guitar ]  
If ever there should come a time  
When you feel that you'd like to die  
Well you've made me feel that way too  
But I'm living my lifetime for you  
I'm living my life for you...
