You always said you loved me  
And I always believed yu did  
But now you say you're leaving  
And taking both of the kids  
  
[Chorus]  
4 minus 3 equals zero  
Your leaving just don't add up  
It's all over for me if you go  
Cause I'll be nothing without your love  
  
The babies are sleeping in the bedroom  
They don't know you're packing their clothes  
At least they didn't see me crying  
When you said that's the way love goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
4 minus 3 equals zero  
Cause I'll be nothing without your love
