Hell yeah nigga, ay yo  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class  
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh  
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast  
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash  
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school  
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes  
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard  
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard  
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus  
My only love was for extras, and overs  
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz  
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz  
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping  
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking  
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine  
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn  
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98  
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake  
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change  
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James  
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab  
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad  
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected  
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas  
  
[Hook: x2]  
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes  
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses  
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead  
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads  
  
[P.O.P.:]  
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights  
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life  
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories  
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies  
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up  
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck  
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this  
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit  
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R  
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR  
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory  
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me  
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout  
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye  
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow  
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[Bun B:]  
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough  
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough  
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty  
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty  
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block  
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks  
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch  
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch  
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college  
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge  
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go  
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show  
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast  
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass  
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G  
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B
