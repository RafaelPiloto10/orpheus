Out of nowhere into sight  
Out of darkness into light  
You come running pushing time  
Out of reason  
Out of rhyme  
Bits and pieces of your past  
Cling like shadows to your heels  
And your heart is learning fast  
How it feels  
  
With your secrets in your eyes  
And your feelings in disguise  
You come running in your fright  
Seeking shelter from the night  
And you search each passing face  
For a sign someone could care  
But they rush by in their race  
To nowhere  
  
And you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone your arms can hold  
Who will let you tell what begs to be told  
Then you ask yourself what good are your dreams?  
In a world where nothing is what it seems  
  
Bits and pieces of your past  
Chill your soul like winter rain  
But the time will come at last  
When a love will ease your pain  
If you let me I will try  
If you let me I'll be near  
If you let me when you cry  
I will hear  
  
Oh, oh and you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone your arms can hold  
Who will let you tell what begs to be told  
And you ask yourself what good are your dreams?  
In a world where nothing is what it seems  
  
And you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone that your arms can hold  
Who will let you
