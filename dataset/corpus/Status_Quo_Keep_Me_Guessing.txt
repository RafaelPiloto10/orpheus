I've been told a rumour that's been going round  
You got a reputation and it won't lay down  
But while you're feelin' the way you do  
You can keep me guessing like I keep on guessing 'bout you  
I keep on hearing you done me wrong  
Don't make no difference, it won't be long  
I'll play your games, You're soon gonna see  
You can fool yourself, you can fool yourself  
You can fool yourself, oh no, no you can't fool me  
Oh, oh, I know what you want  
I know what you want and that's all right, baby  
Oh, oh, I know what you want  
I know what you want, you give it all right  
Oh, oh, I know what you want  
I know what you want and that's all right, baby  
Oh, oh, I know what you want  
I know what you want, you give it all right  
Your mama gave you some good advice  
If you love this man then you won't look twice  
Baby, and if you're feeling the way you do  
Gonna keep me guessing, gonna keep me guessing  
Gonna keep me guessing like I keep on guessing 'bout you  
Gonna keep me guessing  
Gonna keep me guessing
