Staring death between the eyes  
Doesn't seem so far away  
So much pain in long goodbyes  
There is much I need to say  
  
You've been shadowing my door  
A tempest wind that never dies  
Every sorrow washed ashore  
No more tears to fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it go  
Gonna make your life whole  
Let it go  
  
Time to lose the crooked smile  
Cast your grief upon the ground  
Got no time for vain illusion  
Cause it's killin' me inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You should know  
It t be the anger you hide  
Your pride  
Maybe someone has stepped on your pride  
Every night  
It'll keep you awake every night when you're old  
Your heart  
Your heart has been painfully bruised  
Something to lose  
You still t have something to prove  
Let it go  
Is it worth all the time you misuse for your sad demise  
  
When there's vengeance in your heart  
What comes next is up to you  
Better to think before you start  
Or you can dig that grave for two  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You should know  
It t be the anger you hide  
Your pride  
Maybe someone has stepped on your pride  
Every night  
It'll keep you awake every night when you're old  
Your heart  
Your heart has been painfully bruised  
Someone to lose  
You t still have someone to prove  
Let it go  
Is it worth all the time you misuse for your sad demise
