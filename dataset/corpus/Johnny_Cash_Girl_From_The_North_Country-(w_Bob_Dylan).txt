If you're travelin'  
To the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy  
On the borderline  
  
Remember me  
To one who lives there  
For she once was  
A true love of mine  
  
See for me  
That her hair's hangin' down  
It curls and falls  
All down her breast  
  
See for me  
That her hair's hangin' down  
That's the way  
I remember her best  
  
If you go  
When the snowflakes fall  
When the rivers freeze  
And summer ends  
  
Please, see for me  
If she's having a coat so warm  
To keep her from  
The howlin' winds  
  
If you're travelin'  
To the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy  
On the borderline  
  
Please, say hello  
To the one who lives there  
For she once was  
A true love of mine  
  
If you're travelin'  
In the north country fair  
Where the winds  
Hit heavy on the borderline  
  
Remember me  
To one who lives there  
She once was  
A true love of mine  
  
True love of mine  
A true love of mine  
True love of mine  
True love of mine  
  
True love of mine  
A true love of mine  
She once was  
A true love of mine
