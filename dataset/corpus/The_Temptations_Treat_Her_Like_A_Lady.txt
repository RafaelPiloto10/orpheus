Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-  
Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-  
Ooh, yeah, baby  
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-  
Mmm-  
  
Now I-m the kinda guy who don't believe  
That chivalry is dead, no  
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated  
With the utmost respect, mmm-hmm-  
  
Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away  
I want to get to know ya, well  
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame  
Just come and look me over  
  
You'll find a heart  
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for  
How could anybody ask for much more, woo-hoo-  
  
Now I like openin' doors  
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor  
Treat her like a lady  
(Treat her like lady])  
Light her cigarette if she smokes  
Even (Help her with her coat), well  
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)  
  
In this world of liberation  
It's so easy to forget, mmm-  
That it's so nice to have a man around  
To lend a helping hand, you can bet, bet you can, baby  
  
When I was young, my mama used to say, Boy  
A woman's like a flower, with love on her you shower  
Ever since that day, her words never went away  
I always will remember to treat my baby tender  
  
You'll find a heart  
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for  
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa-ooh-ooh-  
  
Now I like openin' doors  
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor  
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)  
Light her cigarette if she smokes  
Even (Help her with her coat), oh, whoa  
Treat her like a lady  
(Treat her like lady)  
  
Compliment her in her hair  
Even help her with her chair  
Treat her like a lady  
(Treat her like lady)  
She's a bad son-
