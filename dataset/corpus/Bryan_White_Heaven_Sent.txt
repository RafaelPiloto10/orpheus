One lonely night  
I sent a prayer  
Send me someone  
Someone to care  
Out of the blue  
Suddenly you  
Heaven sent  
  
One magic touch  
One stolen kiss  
My only dream  
My every wish  
That's when I knew  
That it was truly  
Heaven sent  
  
And every star in the sky  
They knew that I  
Had waited my whole life through  
And as I held you tight  
They shined even brighter  
So glad I'd finally found you  
And through the years  
Never forget  
The love we'd found  
The night we met  
And how we knew  
That it was truly  
Heaven sent
