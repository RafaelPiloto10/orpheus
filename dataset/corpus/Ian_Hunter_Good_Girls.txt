(honest john plain)  
It's cold outside - it looks like rain  
To make matters worse, I missed me last train  
Now I was thinking she'd show me a bed  
To my surprise got shown the door instead  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
She said she wants a fella with a gti  
Always home on time, steak and kidney pie  
She made it quite pretty, it was plain to see  
There's no place here for a rocker like me  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Girls like peggy-sue, maggie-may and sheena too  
Where have all the good girls gone?  
Girls like my dear old mum, who never stopped me having fun  
Where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Where've they gone?  
Where have all the good (3) girls gone? (2)  
So she throws me out in the pouring rain  
Girls like that give girls a bad name  
Why can't I find a girl just like betty d.  
With an hourglass figure like norma jean  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Where 've they gone?
