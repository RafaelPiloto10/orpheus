Oh, well, well, well, you've blown my clouds away  
My rains have gone and my sunshine's here to stay  
And I feel so good I could really get down today  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
If you say I can stay, baby, you know I will  
I could stay here all evenin' listenin' to the music you play  
Those same sweet songs of a golden yesterday  
Squeezin' and teasin' and pleasin' the evenin' away  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
If you say I can stay, baby, you know I will  
I will wake up in the morning and do the same sweet things  
Rockin' with the record that the same sweet people sing  
All the clouds from the west go east, you confess it is spring  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
I want you to want you to love you of your own free will  
Baby, you're so beautiful to want me here to stay  
I would be here forever but I gotta die someday  
But I will be lovin' you, baby, when I pass away  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
I will love you like a lover loves a lover always
