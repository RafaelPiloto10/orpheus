One of these days and it won't be long  
You're gonna look for me and I'll be gone  
'Cause I believe (I believe, yes I believe)  
I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Well I believe to my soul now,  
Tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it, I believe it)  
  
Well you're goin' 'round here with your head so hard,  
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod  
'Cause I believe (I believe, yes I believe)  
I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Well I believe to my soul now  
Tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it, I believe it)  
  
Last night you were dreaming and I heard you say  
"Oh, Johnny" when you know my name is Ray  
That's why I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
I say I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Whoa I believe to my soul now  
Tryin' to make a fool of me (I believe it)
