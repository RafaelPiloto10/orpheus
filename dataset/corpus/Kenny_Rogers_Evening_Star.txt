If you never rode West of the Arizona border  
You can turn the other way boy but you never get far  
You be living a lie if you wanna see the wonders of the age  
You must follow the evening star  
  
Evening star  
Shine a little Heaven  
On a stranger with no dream  
Where you are  
  
You can see the loneliness I mean and if I gotta fight  
I can never play somebody else's game, I can follow the evening star  
Starlight, you never need somebody else's name  
If you follow the evening star  
  
Have you ever known a sunset when the sky's on fire  
How you end another day boy you've been searching too far  
Like the desert I rode on any memory is lost in the restless wind  
I just lie beneath the evening star  
  
Evening star  
Shine a little Heaven  
On a stranger with no dream  
Where you are  
  
Have you ever held a woman in the California moonlight  
Put your money on a good night if you never been there  
It's a sight for sore eyes if you wanna see the wonders of the age  
Making love beneath the evening star  
  
Evening star  
Shine a little Heaven  
On a stranger with no dream  
Where you are  
  
You can see the loneliness I mean and if I gotta fight  
I will never play somebody else's game, I can follow the evening star  
Starlight, you never need somebody else's name  
If you follow the evening star
