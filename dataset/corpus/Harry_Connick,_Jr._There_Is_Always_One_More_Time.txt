If your whole life somehow  
Wasn't much 'til now  
And you've almost lost  
Your will to live  
No matter what you've been through  
Long as there's breath in you  
There is always one more time  
  
If your dreams go bad  
Every one that you've had  
don't you think that your dreams  
Can't come true  
Because it's funny about dreams  
Just strange as it seems  
Becouse there is always one more time  
  
Turnin' corners  
Turnin' corners  
Only a state of mind  
Only a state of mind  
Keeping your eyes closed  
Keeping your eyes closed  
Worse than being blind  
Worse than being blind  
  
If better a heart out there  
If better a heart out there  
Looking for someone to share  
Looking for someone to share  
I don't care if it's been  
I don't care if it's been  
Turned down time and time again  
Turned down time and time again  
  
And if we meet some day  
And if we meet some day  
Please don't walk away  
No, no don't walk away  
  
'Cause there is always always one more time  
One more time  
'Cause there is always one more time.
