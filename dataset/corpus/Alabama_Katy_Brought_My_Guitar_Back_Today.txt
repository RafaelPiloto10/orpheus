Katy brought my guitar back today  
I left it there to play when I'd stay over  
And I remember all those nights  
Sittin' in the fireplace light  
How she loved to hear me play  
And Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
I've seen it make her cry over and over  
She told me when I wasn't there  
And she would wake up feelin' scared  
She'd hold it in her arms and be okay  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
We had our stormy times like anybody else  
Oh, more than once I broke her heart  
And when I couldn't tell her I was sorry by myself  
I could tell her with an old guitar  
But I'm afraid this time things have gone too far  
  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
I guess that means this time it's really over  
And as I sit and play it now  
The songs all seem so sad somehow  
I wish that I'd 've left it in the case  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
And I remember all those nights  
Sittin' in the fireplace light  
How she loved to hear me play  
But Katy brought my guitar back today
