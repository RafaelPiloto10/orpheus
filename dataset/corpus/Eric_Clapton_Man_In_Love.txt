You're always in my hair, you keep me feeling fine.  
I celebrate every time I realize you're really mine  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm a man in love,  
Yes I'm a man in love.  
I tell it everywhere I go,  
I want the whole world to know  
That I'm a man in love.  
  
I used to be so sad, like a dog without a bone  
And then you gave me something baby I had never known.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I love to see you walk up and down the street,  
You look so pretty baby from your head down to your feet.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, the minutes seem like hours, and the hours seem like days  
And the days they seem like years every time you go away.  
  
[Chorus]
