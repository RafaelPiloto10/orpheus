I'm crazy for this little lady  
I'm freaking for my little baby  
'Cause she makes me feel good  
She's so fine  
Don't need all my other ladies  
I'm beggin' for this little lady  
'Cause I tell you she's cool  
She's divine  
I know she's a super lady  
  
I'm weak and I've gone hazy  
I'm crazy for that lady  
She's chic but she's not shady  
Sophisticated lady  
And she makes me feel good  
She's so fine  
  
Never knew there was such a lady  
That would make me want to straighten  
Out my life at this time but I find  
I'm thinkin' 'bout this little lady  
'Cause you know she's no fool  
She's refined  
I know she's a super lady  
  
I'm weak and I've gone hazy  
I'm crazy for that lady  
She's chic but she's not shady  
Sophisticated lady  
And she makes me feel good  
She's so fine  
  
Yeah  
Don't you know she blows my mind  
All the time  
'Cause she makes me feel good  
Like real woman should  
Yeah  
She's so fine  
Yeah  
  
I'm weak and I've gone hazy  
I'm crazy for that lady  
She's chic but she's not shady  
Sophisticated lady  
And she makes me feel good  
She's so fine  
  
Yeah  
Don't you know she blows my mind  
All the time  
'Cause she makes me feel good  
Like real woman should  
Yeah  
All the time  
Yeah  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
