Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave no man's land behind  
And God is a pet and the devil's a toy, and I'm a danger in your paradise  
Here I go  
Here I go  
Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave crimson roses behind  
With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side, I spread roses,  
Roses in your paradise  
  
Here I go, with a toy in my hand and a pet at my side, here I go  
Here I go, I'm a danger in your paradise  
  
And life is a pretty, impolite bastard  
I spit at you, I spit at you, I spit at you, bastard  
I want to cut out your chameleon tongue  
I'm a danger in your paradise  
  
Here I go...  
  
Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave crimson roses behind  
With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side  
I spread roses, roses in your paradise  
And life is a pretty, pretty gigolo  
I caress you, I caress you, gigolo  
And God is a pet and the devil's a toy  
And I'm a danger in your paradise
