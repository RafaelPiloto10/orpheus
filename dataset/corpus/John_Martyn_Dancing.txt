Oh darling, it's gonna be late when we get back home  
Can you wait till we get back home?  
We don't go walking and a-reeling and a-rocking round the whole round town  
Walking and talking round the whole round town  
Don't go rolling and a-rocking round the whole round town  
Let another man take you home  
Let another man take you home  
Oh darling, I wanted to leave but I had to stay  
Boys wouldn't let me run away  
Been walking and a-reeling and a-rocking round the whole round town  
Been walking and talking round the whole round town  
Been rolling and a-rocking round the whole round town  
Let the morning bring me home  
Let the morning bring me home  
?This is? alright, go out all night  
?This is? alright, go out all night  
I tell you there's been no romancing  
There's been no fancypantsing  
I've been dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing  
Oh darling, I want you to try to understand  
If you're leading the life of a music man  
You've got to walk around and reel around and rock around the whole round town  
Walk around, talk around the whole round town  
Go rolling and a-rocking out the whole round town  
Till the morning takes you home  
Till the morning takes you home  
?This is? alright, go out all night  
?This is? alright, go out all night  
I tell you there's been no romancing  
There's been no fancypantsing  
There's been life-enhancing, take-a-chancing, dancing, dancing, dancing,
dancing, dancing
