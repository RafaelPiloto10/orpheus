Forward yesterday makes me wanna stay  
What they said was real makes me wanna steal  
Living under house guess I'm living I'm a mouse  
All's I gots is time got no meaning just a rhyme  
  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,  
I like to steal  
  
I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)  
  
Feeling uninspired think I'll start a fire  
Everybody run bobby's got a gun  
Think you're kinda neat then she tells me I'm a creep  
Friends don't mean a thing guess I'll leave it up to me.  
  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'guess I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,  
I like to steal  
  
I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)  
Angst
