Try and keep it simple,  
Not too far away,  
Movin' slow, so simple,  
  
Never felt this way.  
  
Movin' sweet, so simple,  
Takin' time to say,  
The way to being, to being simple  
Never felt this way.  
  
Don't be lonely,  
Oh, my friends, forget the past.  
Sweet as sugar,  
When you're movin'  
When you're movin' slow at last  
It's what I like to do.  
  
How could it be so simple?  
To forget the way,  
A way to being, to being simple  
Never felt this way.  
  
Don't be lonely,  
No, no, no, forget the past.  
Sweet as sugar,  
When you're movin' slow  
Your movin' slow at last  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely  
It's what I like to do.  
  
Sweet as sugar, sugar, sugar  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Movin' slow, movin' slow at last  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Sweet as sugar.
