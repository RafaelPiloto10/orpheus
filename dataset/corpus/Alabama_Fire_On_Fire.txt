He was a stranger in a little town  
She was sittin' alone in a crowd  
Listening to the old jukebox playin' a song  
From the moment we walked through the diner door  
She felt something like never before  
A feelin' so strong right from the start  
It wouldn't stop - it was more than a spark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each others eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire just won't die  
  
It was gettin' late but they had all night  
They sat there talkin' 'bout their lives  
He was sellin', she uas gettin' ready to buy  
That ole neon light was glowin' dim  
But he could see by the way she was lookin' at him  
Tonight would be different, somethin' had changed  
His lonely heart was feelin' a flame  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
[Bridge]  
She needed him, he needed her  
And they both knew, without a word  
There was no question, there was no doubt  
There was no way they could put it out  
  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each other's eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire, fire on fire  
Fire on fire just won't die  
  
Tag  
Fire on fire  
Just won't die  
Fire on fire
