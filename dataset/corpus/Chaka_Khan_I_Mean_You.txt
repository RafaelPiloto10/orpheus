If you have to do me this way  
I can't stay  
I can't - no - no  
There's a price that you'll have to pay  
And I mean you  
I mean you  
  
  
I can't let you push me around  
On the ground  
I can't - hey - no  
I'm not some new clown that you found  
  
And I mean you  
I mean you  
I mean you, yeah you, there's only me  
I mean you, yeah you  
What are you gonna do  
  
I can't let you push me around  
On the ground  
I can't - hey - no  
I'm not some new clown that you found  
I mean you, I mean you  
You can try to walk on anyone you choose  
And you haven't got a thing to lose but me!  
  
I can't  
  
If you have  
And I mean you  
I mean you  
I mean you, yeah you, there's only me  
I mean you, yeah you  
What are you gonna do  
  
I can't
