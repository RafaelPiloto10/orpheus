Sun goes down night moves in  
I don't need the pain again  
Those x-ray eyes  
It's a fascination  
All lined up ready to go  
Fully loaded overflow  
High heeled mood

Man-you-lip-you-lator it's so easy when heads meet  
Exploring but nightmares speak  
Rumors fly idle speculation  
  
Man-you-lip-you-lator tryin' to operate on you  
Sticky situation I'd love to fall into  
You're a man-you-lip-you-lator with a low low attitude oh  
Like to love ya later 'cause I'm an operator too  
Full alert def con 4  
Seal the windows lock the door

It's a natural reaction  
Man-you-lip-you-lator tryin' to operate on you ooh  
Sticky situation I'd love to fall into  
  
Take it to the left  
Move it to the right  
Hold me oh so tight
