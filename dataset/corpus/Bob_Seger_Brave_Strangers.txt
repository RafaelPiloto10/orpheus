Nights were warm  
Dreams were easy  
No one standing overhead  
Conversation didn't mean much  
We were hungry but could not be fed  
Radio blasting silly little love songs  
We only listened for the beat  
Taking our chances  
Out there on the mean streets  
Hiding in the shadows from the heat  
We weren't lovers just brave strangers  
As we fought and we tumbled through the night  
We were players not arrangers  
As we jammed till the dawn's early light  
Swimming in the big lake  
Taking it easy  
Taking any comfort we could find  
Didn't need the real truth  
Didn't need the meaning  
Straight ahead ignoring every sign  
Every sign  
And oh I remember I know you do too  
Oh that one evening  
I know you do too  
Baby  
I know you remember it too  
The moon was high  
Moon was flying high  
We were hiding in the backwoods  
Hiding out in the backwoods  
With the moon flying high  
My hand was shaking  
And you took my hand  
And it went all right  
And it went all right  
It went all right  
So we walked out hardly speaking  
Disappearing in the night  
Saw each other a few times after  
But we never really got it right  
We weren't lovers just brave strangers  
As we rolled and we tumbled through the night  
We were players not arrangers  
And we jammed till the dawn's early light
