(Love is made of this, love is made of this)  
You touched me and I know love that's undyin'  
No need denyin', love is made of this  
Your lips and my lips together in one kiss  
You are my happiness, love is made of this  
You're what I long for, you're what I pray for  
To make my life complete  
So darling take me, oh darling make me  
As you would have me to be  
Your hand and my hand, together we will stand  
My heart's at your command, love is made of this
