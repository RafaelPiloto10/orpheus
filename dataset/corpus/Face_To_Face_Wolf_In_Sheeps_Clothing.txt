You've got your reputation  
I've got anonymity  
I've got my self-respect  
You can't take that from me  
  
You've got to protect your interests  
You've got your enemies  
I've got a hundred reasons  
To expose your treachery  
  
There is no happy ending  
Only what remains to be  
  
I want an explanation  
I want an apology  
You ruined everything  
You tried to run away but you can't  
I want to hear the answer  
I want the opportunity  
You wasted so much time  
You tried to run away but you can't  
  
You had your way of speaking  
I was full of naivete  
We had a common interest  
And a trust based on a need  
I've got my own ideas  
I've got my integrity  
You've got your binding contracts  
You've got your misery  
  
Your power and position  
Your hunger and your greed  
Walk on the backs of others  
Toward the goals you will achieve
