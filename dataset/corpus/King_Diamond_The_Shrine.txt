The night is rising my eyes.  
Even in the dark I know I'm alive.  
I am burning for you, yeah you know its true.  
Voices are calling in the night.  
Breaking the changing sleep of night.  
I see your face I can't deny it.  
Darkness you are a holy shrine.  
The night, awake us tonight.  
This is where we all meet. The ones left behind.  
I am burning for you, yeah you know it's true.  
Voices are calling in the night.  
Breaking the changing sleep of night.  
I see your face I can't deny it.  
Darkness you are a holy shrine.  
Darkness you are a holy shrine.  
The night, awake us tonight. This is where we all meet.  
The ones left behind.  
I am burning for you, yeah you know it's true.  
Voices are calling in the night. Breaking the changing sleep of night.  
I see your face I can't deny it.  
Darkness you are a holy shrine. I am burning for you.  
Darkness you are a holy shrine. I am burning for you.
