If what you said last night is true  
Then you don't know me as well as you should  
No one could ever be so wrong  
And if this look I wear fools you  
Well I got a good reason  
You see I'm really not so strong  
I need love like every other man  
Get scared when you turn away  
I need love I will do all I can - stay  
Now I've seen sorrow felt no pain  
I never felt nothing at all  
It's not the way I want to be  
And when you're gone these empty hours  
Cut me again  
What does it take to make you see  
I need love like every other man  
Get scared when you turn away  
I need love and I'll do all I can please stay  
Somebody up there likes me  
Cause they've opened up the door  
You won't see me chasing rainbows anymore  
I need love like any other man  
Get scared when you turn away  
I need love I'll do all I can please stay
