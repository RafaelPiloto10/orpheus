Every time the rain comes down  
I close my eyes and listen  
I can hear the lonesome sound  
Of the sky as it cries  
  
Listen to the rain  
Here it comes again  
Hear it in the rain  
  
Feel the touch of tears that fall  
They won't fall forever  
In the way the day will flow  
All things come, all things go  
  
Listen to the rain, the rain  
Here it comes again, again  
Hear it in the rain, the rain  
  
Late at night I drift away  
I can hear you calling  
And my name is in the rain  
Leaves on trees whispering  
Deep blue seas, mysteries  
  
Even when this moment ends  
Can't let go this feeling  
Everything will come again  
In the sound falling down  
Of the sky as it cries  
Hear my name in the rain
