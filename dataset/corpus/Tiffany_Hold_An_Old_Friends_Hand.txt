Another year and I'm still here  
The grass just will not grow on this old hill  
Still I just can't let it go,  
I don't believe it's cause I'm cold  
Or partial to the crazy life I'm caught in  
Sometimes I fell the hand of time  
Moving like its body was broke  
And it's then I miss your sighs  
And the tender words you spoke  
  
Hey, that's okay - come on around and get yourself together  
Won't you come on around and hold an old friend's hand  
Babe, I promise not to throw you  
You don't have to stay, I just want to hold you  
Won't you come on around  
And hold an old friend's hand  
  
Another year is dead and gone  
The sun don't want to shine on this old hill  
Or anything that's mine  
I don't believe it hurts to grow  
Even when the crop you sow is a failure  
Sometimes I wish I had no pride  
I'd go off and sell my soul  
But how do you say goodbye  
To the only truth you've known  
  
Hey, that's okay - come on around and get yourself together  
Won't you come on around and hold an old friend's hand  
Baby baby, I promise not to throw you  
You don't have to stay, I just want to hold you  
Won't you come on around  
And hold an old friend's hand  
  
Oh babe, honey everybody makes mistakes  
We feel a lot of life that way  
Don't you think by now I know that?  
Look what's brought us both back  
Now - while the leaves still dance on the wind  
While the moon and the clouds come spinning  
Will you whisper my name again?  
Again and again and again  
  
Hey, that's okay - come on around and get yourself together  
Won't you come on around and hold an old friend's hand  
Around and around with you I've been  
Flat on the ground and up again  
Nobody know for sure just when  
Everything changes
