I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
I love you and you alone were meant for me  
Please give your loving heart to me  
And say we'll never ever part  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever you are in sight  
All because I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me, baby  
I've given you my heart  
[Instrumental interlude]  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever, whenever, whenever you are in sight  
All because I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
I've given you my heart  
For sentimental reasons  
I've given you my heart
