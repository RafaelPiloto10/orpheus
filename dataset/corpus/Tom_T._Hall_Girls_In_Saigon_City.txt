There's a place called Da Nang Village cross the ocean far away  
In deep concern for one young woman that's where I abide today  
Today I got a dear-John-letter from that young woman in the USA  
  
When I was called I knew I'd lose her it don't matter anyway  
There are girls in Saigon City waiting there with open arms  
On my leave I may go see them in this other world called VietNam  
  
Stateside girls should take this warning be faithful cause you can't tell  
On the streets of Saigon City they have many things to sell  
There are girls in Saigon City...
