Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you know it's dark outside?  
Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you care about my pride?  
Where do you think you're going?  
I thing you don't know  
You got no way of knowing  
There's really no place you can go  
  
I understand your changes  
Long before you reach the door  
I know where you think you're going  
I know what you came here for  
And now I'm sick of jocking  
I know I like you to be free  
Where do you think you're going?  
I think you better go with me girl  
  
You say there is no reason  
But you still find cause to doubt me  
If you ain't with me girl  
You're gonna be without me  
  
Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you know it's dark outside?  
Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you care about my pride?  
And now I'm sick of jocking  
I know I like you to be free  
Where do you think you're going?  
I think you better go with me girl
