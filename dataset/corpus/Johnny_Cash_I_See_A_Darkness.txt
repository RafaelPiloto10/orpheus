Well, you're my friend  
And you can see  
May times we've been out drinking  
Many times we've shared our thoughts  
Did you ever, ever notice, the kind of thoughts I got  
Well you know I have a love, for everyone I know  
And you know I have a drive, for life that won't let go  
But sometimes the opposition come rising up in me  
This terrible imposition, comes blacking through my mind  
  
And then I see a darkness  
Oh no, I see a darkness  
Do you know how much I love you  
Cause I'm hoping some day soon  
You'll save me from this darkness  
  
Well, I hope that someday soon  
We'll find peace in our lives  
Together or apart  
Alone or with our wives  
And we can stop our whoring  
And draw the smiles inside  
And light it up forever  
And never go to sleep  
My best unbeaten brother  
That isn't all I see  
  
And then I see a darkness  
Oh no, I see a darkness  
Do you know how much I love you  
Cause I'm hoping someday soon  
You'll save me from this darkness
