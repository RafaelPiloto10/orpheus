[Speaks:]  
Empty is the sky before the sun wakes up.  
Empty is the eyes of animals in cages.  
Empty, faces of women mourning  
When everything's been taken from them.  
Me, don't ask me about empty.  
  
[Sings:]  
Empty is a string of dirty days  
Held together by some rain.  
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again.  
Empty is the color of the fear  
Long about September when the days  
Go marching in a line toward November.  
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night  
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light.  
Empty is me.  
Empty is me.
