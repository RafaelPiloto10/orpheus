Tell me I'm mad  
How should I know?  
Tell me I'm mad  
I have been here for so long  
  
Help me paint a picture  
They say it's a lie  
Tell me I'm mad  
You're a fine one to decide  
  
Burn me in the fires of wild heaven  
Like it never, never, never would stop  
Tell me I'm mad  
Tell me I imagined that  
  
Was it something I didn't say  
Or was it something I said?  
Leave that stuff alone  
Use me instead  
  
I know I'm always falling off the edge of the world  
I got space in my bed  
You've got Egypt in your head  
I've got a head full of Troy  
Chandeliers and Charlemagne  
Fireworks and toys
