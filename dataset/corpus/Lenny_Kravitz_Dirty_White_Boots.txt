Come up to my room  
No matter the weather  
Drop the window shade  
And take off your sweater  
  
You are all I need  
To make me feel better  
Let your hair hang down  
And give me that leather  
  
Come on  
Put a record on  
And your dirty white boots, come on  
You know you turn me on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
  
We're gonna get it on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
Come on, come on  
  
You know these games we play  
They give me such pleasure  
The girls in magazines  
Cannot even measure  
  
There's nothing you won't do  
I don't have the pressure  
Take your knickers down  
And give me that treasure  
  
Come on  
Put a record on  
And your dirty white boots, come on  
You know you turn me on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
  
We're gonna get it on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
Come on, come on  
  
Girl I need you right here next to me  
You're the one that brings me ecstasy  
Girl I need your love in every day  
You're the only one who could make me stay  
  
Come on  
Put a record on  
And your dirty white boots, come on  
You know you turn me on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
  
We're gonna get it on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
Come on, yeah  
  
Come on  
Put a record on  
And your dirty white boots, come on  
You know you turn me on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
  
We're gonna get it on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
Come on, come on  
Yeah!
