I cannot bathe you in a river gone black  
I cannot hold you in a poison rain  
If I can't see you through the air that we breathe  
What will love in the future be?  
  
I want to watch my children laugh as they run  
I want to hold their children on my knee  
And tell them stories of a vanishing sun  
Of how it used to be  
  
In my lover's life I want to share  
I want to see the world now through her eyes  
And about everything she sees, I care  
The time has come to rise  
  
I cannot bathe you in a river gone black  
I cannot hold you in a poison rain  
If I can't see you through the air that we breathe  
What will love in the future be?  
Will we make it a different story?  
Is there love in the future for you and me?  
  
We're looking for answers in outer space  
When will we discover the earth is a sacred place?  
  
Chorus
