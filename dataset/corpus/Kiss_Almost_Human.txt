Ahh, ha  
I'm almost human, can't help feelin' strange  
The moon is out, I think I'm gonna change  
You're so smooth and tender, a living, breathing dream  
I've got to have you, baby, I'm listenin' for your scream  
  
I'm almost human, I'm almost a man  
I'm almost human, ooh  
  
I'm almost human, baby please don't run away  
Cause wherever you run I'll be a scream away  
I'm very hungry and you're what I'm thinkin' of  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, so hungry for your love  
  
I'm almost human, oh, almost a man  
I'm almost human, whoo  
  
I'm very hungry and you're what I'm thinkin' of  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, so hungry for your love  
  
I'm almost human, I'm almost a man  
I'm almost human, I'm almost human  
I'm almost human, I'm almost human  
I'm almost human, almost, almost, almost a man  
I'm almost human  
  
Almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost human  
I'm almost human, I'm almost human  
I'm almost human, almost a man  
I'm almost human, almost, almost, almost  
I'm almost human
