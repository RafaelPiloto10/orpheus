Daylight is breaking again.  
I hide in the dark.  
I'm watching the rain.  
You're out of touch.  
You're out of reach.  
What can I say,  
I never wanted it this way.  
  
Love sleeps all alone.  
The cold telephone,  
I know the heart.  
Yes, I know the kind.  
The kisses of fire, turning to grey.  
I never wanted it this way.  
I always wanted you to stay.  
  
Wash my pain away, cause I'm half a woman, half a shadow.  
  
Love always change with the trees,  
the spring and the leaves,  
the waves on the sea.  
Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray.  
I never wanted it this way.  
I always wanted you to stay.  
  
Oh I need you, yes I need you.  
Give me a reason to believe.
