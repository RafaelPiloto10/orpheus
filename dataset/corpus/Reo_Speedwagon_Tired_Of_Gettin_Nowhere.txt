[Chorus]  
I'm tired of gettin' nowhere, wish I was inspired, but it's just not there  
I hope this doesn't last, 'cause I'm tired of gettin' nowhere fast  
  
Woke up this morning and went back to sleep  
The sun was pourin' and the rain was gettin' deep  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do  
'Cause everywhere I turn, I wind up headin' back to you  
  
I don't know how long I will lay here in this bed  
Staring at the ceiling, going crazy in my head  
Got to find some meaning, some kind of reason to go on  
The only one I had was you and now you're gone, and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My friends all tell me I should mellow out  
Surely I've got better things to think about  
Must be something I can find to help me lose these blues  
But the only thing that's on my mind, is standing in your shoes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'd think by now I'd be exactly where I want to be  
Got what I need, know what I need to know  
I'm all dressed up but without you there's nowhere to go  
  
Ooh, you'd think by now I'd be exactly where I want to be  
Got what I need, know what I need to know  
I'm all dressed up but without you there's nowhere to go  
  
And I'm so tired of gettin' nowhere  
Wish I was inspired, but it's just not there  
I hope this doesn't last, 'cause I'm tired of gettin'  
Tired of gettin', tired of gettin' nowhere  
  
I'm tired of gettin' nowhere, so real tired of gettin' nowhere  
Tired of gettin' nowhere, tired, tired of gettin'  
I'm tired of gettin' nowhere, ooh yeah, won't you say it, ooh yeah  
Tired of gettin' nowhere fast - get some rest!
