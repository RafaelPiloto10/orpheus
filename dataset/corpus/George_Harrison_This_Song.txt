This song has nothing tricky about it  
This song ain't black or white and as far as I know  
Don't infringe on anyone's copyright, so...  
  
This song we'll let be  
This song is in E  
This song is for you and...  
  
This tune has nothing Bright about it  
This tune ain't bad or good and come ever what may  
My expert tells me it's okay  
  
As this song came to me  
Quite unknowingly  
This song could be you could be...  
  
This riff ain't trying to win gold medals  
This riff ain't hip or square  
Well done or rare  
May end up one more weight to bear  
  
But this song could well be  
A reason to see - that  
Without you there's no point to... this song
