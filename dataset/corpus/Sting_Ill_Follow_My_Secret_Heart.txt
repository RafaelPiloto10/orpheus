Written by noel coward  
Don't be afraid I'll betray you  
And destroy all the plans you have made  
But even your schemes must  
Make room for my dreams  
So when all I owe you is pain  
I'll still have something of my own  
A little prize that's mine alone  
I'll follow my secret heart  
My whole life through  
I'll keep all my dreams apart  
Till one comes true  
No matter what price is paid  
What stars may fade above  
I'll follow my secret heart  
Till I find love  
No matter what price is paid  
What price is paid  
I'll follow my secret heart  
Till I find love
