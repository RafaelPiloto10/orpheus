One More time  
I lie half awake, late at night  
I reach out to touch you  
Feel you by my side  
And I reach, and I reach,  
But I never get to feel you  
Will I ever get to feel you again, again  
Just one more time  
One more moment  
To take you in my arms  
One more chance  
One more kiss  
Before I wake to find you gone  
One more time  
Before I have to face another day,  
And my heart breaks again  
It's only a dream  
But it's all so real  
Don't want it to end  
But I know it will  
So I pray, and I pray  
Every night I'm on my kness  
Begging for the chance to see you  
Again, again  
Just one more time  
One more moment  
To take you in my arms  
One more chance  
One more kiss  
Before I wake to find you gone  
One more time  
Before I have to face another day,  
And my heart breaks again  
Oh one more time  
Before I have to face another day,  
And my heart breaks again  
Again
