As daybreak breaks the mist upon the earth  
It came to pass that beauty settled there forever more  
And as the steam clings close to things to come  
It came to pass that solid rock did part for humble life  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  
Now there's hope reborn with every morning  
See the future clearly at its dawning  
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness  
As water slips into the sea  
The father's sad to see it free  
As shadows creep towards their master night  
It came to pass that trees defied the wind who shook their leaves  
And as the peace descended all around  
It came to pass that nature's creatures came to face the world  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  
Now there's hope reborn with every morning  
See the future clearly at its dawning  
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness  
As water slips into the sea  
The father's sad to see it free  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  
Now there's hope reborn with every morning  
See the future clearly at its dawning  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
