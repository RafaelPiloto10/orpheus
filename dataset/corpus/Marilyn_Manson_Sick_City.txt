Sick city, yeah, restless people  
Sick city burn their houses down  
To make the sky look pretty  
What can I do?  
I'm just a person  
This is a lie we always seem to hear  
You just sit and things get worse  
Watch tv and drink your beer  
Walking all alone  
Not going anywhere  
Walking all alone  
Nobody seems to care  
Restless as wind  
This town is killing me  
Gotta put an end to this  
Restless misery  
And I'm just one of those restless people  
That can never be satisfied with living  
In this sick ol' sick ol' sick sick sick city  
Might be too late for me to say goodbye  
Might be too late to watch this sick ol' city die  
Go on the road,  
Yeah im gonna try to say  
Sick city so long farewell  
Goodbye and die
