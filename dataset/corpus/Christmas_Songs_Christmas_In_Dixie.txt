By now in New York City.  
There's snow on the ground.  
And out in California.  
The sunshine's falling down.  
And maybe down in Memphis,  
Graceland's all in lights.  
And in Atlanta, Georgia,  
There's peace on earth tonight.  
  
Christmas in Dixie.  
It's snowing in the pines.  
Merry Christmas from Dixie  
To everyone tonight.  
  
It's windy in Chicago.  
The kids are out of school.  
There's magic in Motown.  
The city's on the move.  
In Jackson, Mississippi  
To Charlotte, Caroline.  
And all across the Nation,  
It's a peaceful Christmas time.  
  
Christmas in Dixie.  
It's snowing in the pines.  
Merry Christmas from Dixie,  
To everyone tonight.  
And from Fort Payne, Alabama...  
Merry Christmas tonight
