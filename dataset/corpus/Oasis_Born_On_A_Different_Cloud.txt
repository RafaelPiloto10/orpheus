Born on a different cloud  
From the ones that have burst 'round town  
It's no surprise to me  
That you're classless, clever and free  
  
Loaded just like a gun  
You're the hero that's still unsung  
Living on borrowed time  
You're my sun, and you're gonna shine  
  
Talking to myself again  
This time I think I'm getting through  
It's funny how you think  
It's funny how, it's funny how when you do...  
  
Born on a different cloud  
From the ones that have burst round town  
It's no surprise to me  
That you're classless, clever and free  
  
Lonely soul  
Busy working overtime  
Nothing ever gets done  
Especially when your hands are tied  
  
Lonely soul  
Baking up your mother's pride  
Nothing ever gets done  
Not until your war's won  
  
Born on a different cloud  
You're born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
Born on a different cloud  
  
Na na na na na na na
