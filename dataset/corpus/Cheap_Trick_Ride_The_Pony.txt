Come to me, I'm your boogie man  
Come to me, let me take your hand  
Smile, you waited for some floor  
Come to me, understand  
Baby, don't you want some more  
I've got what you need, what you're dyin' for  
  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
  
Dance with me, I'm the rhythm king  
Dance with me, and shake that thing  
Babe, I feel like I could die  
'Cause I've never been so high, higher than the sky  
  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, ride the pony  
Ride the pony, yeah, satisfy your funk  
  
Move a little closer  
What's holding that thing together  
Let me scoot between your thighs  
Got a pistol in my pocket  
Just waiting for you, hey  
  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, ride the pony  
You got to ride the pony, yeah, satisfy your funk  
  
Dance with me, I'm the rhythm king  
Dance with me, I'll do most anything  
  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk  
Ride the pony, yeah, ride the pony  
  
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk
