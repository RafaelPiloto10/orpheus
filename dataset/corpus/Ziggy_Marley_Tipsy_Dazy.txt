Miss Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy  
Say one minute everything seem fine  
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy  
The next minute we're in a puss and dog fight  
That's not really right  
  
Seems as the day grow old  
Our love grow cold  
Remember you been told  
Love can't be bought nor sold  
  
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy  
Say one minute everything's just right dynamite  
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy  
Next minute we're in this great big fight  
That ain't my style of life  
  
When everything seem secure  
I can't just be too sure  
'Cause you can wake up one day  
Not in love any more  
Hey! Remember you've been told  
Love can't be bought nor sold  
Seems as the days grow old  
Our love grow cold  
  
Tipsy Dazy topsy turvy saying  
One minute everything seem right  
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy  
Next minute we're in this great big fight  
That's not really right  
Once more can't say you never been told  
Love can't be bought or sold  
  
But it seems as tehm days grow  
Our heat grow cold  
Tipsy Dazy your're topsy turvy  
One minute everything just fine really divine  
Tipsy Dazy you're really turvy  
Next next minute next minute next minute yea

One minute we're in a great big fight
