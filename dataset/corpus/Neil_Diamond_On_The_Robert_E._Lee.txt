Hey  
Look at the way she's wavin' her sail  
It's a wondrous sight to see  
People hurry on down from every town  
Have a look at the Robert E. Lee  
Proud and strong and made to be free  
Can't go wrong on the Robert E. Lee  
  
Got the sun in my eyes  
And the wind in my face  
And it's good just to be alive  
Gonna set out tonight for New Orleans  
I won't sleep till I arrive  
  
And if I'm lucky,  
I'll find a young lady under the stars  
And we'll dance the night away  
  
Somebody wake me and say it's a dream  
Leadin' me far from my home  
And haven't you noticed  
Despite what it seems  
You can't deny it's you and I alone  
  
Maybe spend my life just workin' the land  
Maybe livin' from day to day  
But I'm free tonight in New Orleans  
If I like it, I just might stay  
  
Proud and strong and made to be free  
Can't go wrong on the Robert E. Lee  
  
Got the sun in my eyes  
And the wind in my face  
And it's good just to be alive  
Gonna set out tonight for New Orleans  
I won't sleep till I arrive
