What are we doing in this place alone is our desire to relive our past this
strong  
  
True love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong  
  
Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control  
  
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold  
  
If we live our past in the present our future will be gone  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong  
  
[ fiddle ]  
  
Line with temptation we raced into the past  
  
On a road too small to let the past and the present pass  
  
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong  
  
Long ago we let the flame...  
  
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
