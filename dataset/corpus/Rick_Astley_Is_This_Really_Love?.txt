There are times when a woman makes you laugh and cry  
Nobody knows when she is telling lies  
I just want to hear the truth from you  
So don't play those games you always do  
You don't have to hide the way you feel  
Tell me if your love for me is real  
  
[Chorus]  
Is this really love  
Is this the real thing  
Is this really love  
Can it be the right thing  
  
I was born in a prison there was no way out  
If you want to be heard you got to scream and shout  
You don't know the kind of mess I'm in  
Nobody else is going to save my skin but  
You have got the key to set me free  
If you want my love then rescue me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You don't have to hide the way you feel  
Tell me if your love for me is real  
  
[Chorus: x2]
