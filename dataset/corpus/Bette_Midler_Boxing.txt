Howard, the strangest things  
Have happened lately when I  
Take a good swing  
And all my dreams  
They pivot and slip.  
I drop my fists  
And they're back, laughing.  
  
Howard, my intentions  
Become not to lose what I've won.  
Ambition has given way  
To desperation and I,  
I've lost the fight from my eyes.  
  
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.  
Now I'm told,  
You're growing old.  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years I'd be through.  
Has boxing been good to you?  
  
Howard, now I confess  
I'm scared and lonely and tired.  
Everyone says I'm made of clay,  
That I've had my day,  
That I'm not cut out for this.  
I just know what to say.  
And I say,  
  
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.  
Now I'm told,  
You're growing old.  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years I'd be through.  
Has boxing been good to you?  
  
Well, sometimes I punch myself  
Hard as I can.  
Yelling, nobody cares!  
Hoping someone will tell me how wrong I am,  
Howard.  
  
Boxing's been good to me, Howard.  
Now I'm told,  
You're growing old.  
The whole time we knew  
A couple of years I'd be through.  
Has boxing been good,  
Has boxing been good,  
Has boxing been good?
