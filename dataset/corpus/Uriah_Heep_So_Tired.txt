Well, I've been on the road  
For a year or more  
And I've done a lot of things  
I never did before  
Now I want everyone  
To listen to my song  
And you can tell me  
When you've heard it  
If you think I'm wrong  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
Yes, I'm so tired  
And I'm so uninspired  
Please help me  
  
Well I've seen 'em rise  
And I've seen 'em fall  
And I use to think that  
I was having a ball  
But I was kiddin' myself  
For a long long time  
But now I got myself a spoon  
And I'm feeling fine  
  
But I'm so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
Yes, I'm so tired  
And I'm so uninspired  
Won't you please help me  
  
Where can you go  
Where can you go  
When there is no one  
To show a guiding light  
What did you say  
What did you say  
Have you been thinking about me  
Day and night  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
And I'm so, so tired  
I'm so uninspired  
Please help me  
Won't you please me
