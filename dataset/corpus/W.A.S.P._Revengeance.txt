Why's my blood race  
Why I gnash my teeth  
Sand man's come here  
With his misery  
You wrought with pain  
As you slash my flesh  
Wrath's revenge lives again  
  
Cane killed abel did his brother's deed  
Cursed all time  
Damned to spread his seed  
Pricks to blind  
  
Thorns in my side  
Oh, slay they brother's life  
I'll kill your pain on the seeds of cane  
I ain't no stranger giving love  
Don't ya plead  
Oh won't ya bleed for me  
Hells be raining from above  
  
I'm coming home  
Vengence be they name  
I'm coming home  
Revengeance scream my name  
  
Oh your God's got you dying to be  
Oh your marty's in the sand  
I'll hunt you down like the dogs that you be  
You Armageddon's in my hands  
Come to me I'll set you free  
Come to me will you die for me
