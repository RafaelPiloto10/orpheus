The brick jail doors that closed behind are cracking  
The school boy told the woman in the street  
Last night I heard the bells of summer rapping  
The word vows of a mother incomplete  
  
The emptiness of summer must begin it  
The nagging of the mother of the wild  
Convinced me that I had no way to win it  
She took it from my hand and then she smiled  
  
The coldness of the closeness of the moonbeam  
The walking in the dawn to greet the night  
The water and the flower is a bad dream  
The stocking drawn reveals the end of sight  
  
It's over 'cause it's older than the midnight  
The school boy told the woman on the street  
The joining of the weekend, Monday daylight  
Will leave the black rose meeting incomplete
