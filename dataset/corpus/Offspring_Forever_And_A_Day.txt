Look at me while I look at you  
Seeing eye to eye we can never do  
You try to tell me what is right  
I may not know a lot but I know one thing  
  
[Chorus]  
If you've got the answer  
Then I don't want to know  
If you've got the answer  
Just keep it your own  
  
I wonder why our world is ablaze  
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say  
I try to have an open mind  
But your brain and mouth must not be connected  
  
If you've got the answer  
Then I don't want to know  
If you've got the answer  
Just leave me alone  
  
I would be patient but it takes so long  
I don't want all this misinformation  
All the words that you say  
Lean on me while I lean on you  
If we destroy each other  
We might save a life or two  
A little sun, a little shine  
Separates us both by forever and a day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you've got a vision  
Then I don't want to see  
If you've got a notion  
Don't waste it on me
