Hey, I'll move out of the way for you  
Hey, I'll move out of the way for her too  
I never thought we'd end up here in separate cages  
It doesn't go like this, you've left out some pages  
  
Hey, when was the last time you laughed  
And did you mean it when you did?  
I'm just wondering, the sound in your voice it's abounding  
It's astounding how you live so close to your cure  
  
I never know what to do with my love  
I never know what to do with my hands  
So I'll put them behind my back  
I'll put them behind my back  
Behind my back  
  
Hey, don't you know what I mean when I say  
Hey, see it in my face, I'm breaking  
I've waited for so long just to know  
That you'd wrap yourself around me if you couldn't let go  
  
I never know what to do with my love  
I never know what to do with my hands  
So I'll put them behind my back  
(Put them behind my back)  
I'll put them behind my back  
(Behind my back)  
Behind my back  
(Put them behind my back)  
  
Can I move out of the way tomorrow?  
Can I move into the way tonight?
