Paint them a picture Jane  
And you can hang it on the wall  
Tell them it's me they see  
Don't tell them why I'm small  
  
If they ask you why I'm crying  
Just tell them someone is dying  
And that he was just a friend  
Don't let em see that you pretend  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Put it in a frame  
One with lots of colors  
Sign it with your name  
Sign your name  
Sign your name  
  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Like the one you painted for me  
Tell them that I'm in love  
But don't tell them they will see  
If they ask you why I'm crying  
Just tell them someone is dying  
And that he was just a friend  
Don't let em see that you pretend  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Put it in a frame  
One with lots of colors  
Sign it with your name  
Sign your name  
Sign your name
