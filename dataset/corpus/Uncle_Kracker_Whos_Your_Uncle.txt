Who bring's it to you  
Whoooooohhh  
  
I laid cuts with Jay and rocked rhymes with Run  
A couple mil in the bank and I ain't even done  
I got platinum plaques, I write platnum tracks  
I got it all from raps and that's the platinum face, Uh  
All that and there ain't nothing I fear yet  
Sippin champagne up in company leer jets  
Five star meals, Caribbean vacations  
Everything's plush deluxe accommodations  
Nationwide, the stations vibe  
To the cat who covers tracks like the lace on thighs  
My ace is high, there ain't gonna be no guessin  
And I'm the illest mother fucker on the block no question  
I ain't destined I don't fuck with fate  
Self made millionaire while your bussin plates  
You see I've already done everything you want to do  
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you  
  
Detroit to Texas  
Texas to LA  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
Brooklyn to the bayou  
Across the southern plains  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
  
I shot dice with the devil on many occasion  
Drank shots with God in an old gas station  
A couple accountants, that count my statements  
Cribs all paid for, no car payments  
Rocked in basements for gas and beer  
And now I get all that and big loot to appear  
I couldn't steer so I got me a chauffer  
Hired a chef cause I was tired of stouffers  
I got over and people showed envy  
Cause I couldn't choose between a Lincoln and a Benzy  
Fendi shades and topless maids  
I don't worry about clothes cause their custom made  
I drink crushed up grapes that have been aged for years  
Your smokin OP's, drinkin three-two beer  
I've already done everything you want to do  
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you  
Detroit to Texas  
Texas to LA  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
Brooklyn to the bayou  
Across the southern plains  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
  
Detroit to Texas  
Texas to LA  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
Brooklyn to the bayou  
Across the southern plains  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?
