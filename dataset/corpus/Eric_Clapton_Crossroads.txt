I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.  
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees.  
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Save me if you please."  
  
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.  
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride.  
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by.  
  
I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.  
I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side.  
You can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside.  
  
You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown.  
You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown.  
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down.
