In this dirty old part of the city  
Where the sun refuse to shine  
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'  
  
My little girl you're so young and pretty, yeah  
And one thing I know is true  
You're gonna die before your time is through  
  
You see my daddy in bed a dyin'  
You see his hair is turnin' gray  
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away  
  
My daddy's been workin' workin' every day  
Workin' slavin' his life away  
Workin' oh yeah my daddy's been  
Work work work, oh yeah  
  
We gotta get outta this place  
If it's the last thing we ever do  
We gotta get outta this place  
Girl there's a better life for me and you  
Me and you, babe  
  
My daddy's been workin'  
Workin' slavin' his life away  
Workin' ah workin' every day  
Work work work, oh yeah  
  
We gotta get outta this place  
If it's the last thing we ever do  
We gotta get outta this place  
Girl there's a better life for me and you  
For me and you babe  
  
We gotta get outta this place  
If it's the last thing we ever do  
We gotta get outta this place  
Girl there's a better life  
  
I said girl there's a better life  
Girl there's a better life for me and you  
There's gotta be a better life for me and you
