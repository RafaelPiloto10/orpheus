This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
If Christ was in Texas  
The hammer, the sickle, the only son  
This is your creation  
The Atom of Eden was a bomb  
If Jack was the baptist  
We'd drink wine from his head  
  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
  
I am a revolution  
Pull my knuckles down, if I could  
I am a revelation  
And I'm nailed to the Holy Wood  
  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
  
We are dead and tomorrow's canceled  
Because of things we did yesterday  
We are dead and tomorrow's canceled  
Crucify us in our space  
In our space  
In our space  
In our space  
In our space  
In our space  
In our space  
In our space  
  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
This is evolution  
The monkey, the man, and then the gun  
  
...flies are waiting
