In the morning light  
Half awake and half asleep  
Have you ever laid there thinking  
Was it all a dream?  
But you reach out and she's there  
Every moment, everywhere  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have you ever felt  
How far a heart can fall  
Have you ever stayed up waiting  
For a telephone call  
Just to hear her say hello  
'Cause you miss each other so  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What it's all about  
  
And when she's far away  
Have you ever felt the need to stray  
And tried and then discovered  
It just doesn't pay  
'Cause with her, you can be true  
And with her, you can be you  
Have you ever been in love?  
  
Have there been times to laugh  
And times you really want to cry  
Finding reasons to believe her  
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied  
And when in times of doubt  
Have you ever tried to work it out  
But still she leaves you wondering  
What its all about  
  
And when the night comes down  
Can you call your house a home  
Do you dream you're still together  
And wake up alone  
Have you ever been in love  
The way that I'm in love  
Have you ever been in love?  
Have you ever been in love?
