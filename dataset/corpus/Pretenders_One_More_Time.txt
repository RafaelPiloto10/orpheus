You believed in me  
When you had nothing to gain  
You stood by me  
You walked out in the falling rain  
To find me  
Waiting in the shadows behind me  
  
Baby, please...please  
Won't you do it one more time  
Do it one more time  
Do it one more time  
Please  
Do it one more time  
  
You stayed when no one else would  
When I was delayed  
You understood  
I've done some low things  
Alright, but you said I was good  
I couldn't forgive myself  
But you could  
  
Won't you please...please  
Won't you do it one more time  
Do it one more time  
Do it one more time  
Please  
Won't you do it one more time  
  
I know I've made you promises  
Then I forget  
I've let you down when, darling,  
I'm forever in your debt  
In my darkest hour  
I've turned you out  
But when the mood has passed  
You came back in spite of me  
Saying, "This love, this love was meant to last"  
  
Oh baby  
Won't you please  
Won't you do it one more time  
Do it one more time with feeling  
Oh, baby, please  
Won't you do it one more time  
One more time, please  
Won't you do it one more time  
  
With feeling...
