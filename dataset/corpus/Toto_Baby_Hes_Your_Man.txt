Well it's two a.m.  
You're just getting in  
Soon you'll be creepin' into bed  
Later you'll pretend  
You were out with a friend  
But I'm still inside your head.  
  
I don't understand  
You say I'm your man  
When it's clear you're seein' another  
You can call me a fool for just loving' you  
But girl I'll never find another.  
  
If you think he'll love you better  
Your every wish is his command  
Baby he's your man  
  
Baby he's your man.  
  
Well, you spoke your mind  
But I still can't find what's wrong with you and me  
I got something' to say and baby come what may  
Baby we were never meant to be.  
  
So I want you to know  
I can't let him go  
'til find a love that's real  
I don't like this game  
I don't need this pain  
I'm just saying what I feel  
I know he can love me better  
My every wish is his command  
  
Baby he's your man  
  
Baby he's your man  
  
Baby he's your man
