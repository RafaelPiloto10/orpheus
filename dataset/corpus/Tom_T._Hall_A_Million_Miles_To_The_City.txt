Yeah, I remember it now, we were kids back then livin' down on the farm  
We were told that the city could only bring us harm  
"How far is the city?" somebody said, and "oh, that's a great big town."  
Barbara said, "why, it's a million miles," and the story got around  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a million miles to the city  
From the hills and valleys we know  
It's a million miles to the city  
And someday we all want to go  
  
There was a town nearby, but a town is a town, and a city...well, that's  
Something else  
Our daddy had been to a city but he never was much help  
  
"Why the buildings are taller than oak trees." ah, but we knew better than
that  
Ain't nobody could climb that high, the cities were wide and flat  
  
[Chorus]  
Well now time has passed and we have grown and traveled far and wide  
The cities have changed the kids we were, we see it in each others eyes  
But I'd love to go back to those hills again, to the boy I used to be  
Where the leaves and the wind and the whippoorwills were part of the land like
me  
  
[Chorus x2]
