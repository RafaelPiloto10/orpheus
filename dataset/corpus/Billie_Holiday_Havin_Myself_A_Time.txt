I'm having myself a time  
I mean I'm having what I want  
Wanting what I have  
Doing what I like  
And liking what I do  
And I'm having myself a time  
  
I never could save a dime  
And so I'm living like a lord  
Acting like, a loon  
Lying in the sun  
And sighing in the moon  
And I'm having myself a lime  
  
When I hum songs  
They're all dumb songs  
Without reason nor rhyme  
But I'm certainly in my prime  
I friend I'm happy as a bird, flying up above  
Walk a little love and get a little love  
And I'm having myself a time  
  
But I'm certainly in my prime  
I mean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above  
Walk a little love and get a little love  
And I'm having myself a time
