There's an S under my clothes  
On my chest where nobody else can see  
I light up when the doors are closed  
I am free, yeah  
And I wish I could make my move  
I can tell that you're really into me  
And I don't got a thing to lose  
In my dreams, in my dreams  
  
I'm a badass  
Jumping off the moving train  
I'm a Jane Bond  
Putting all them guys to shame  
I'm a wild card  
And I'm gonna steal your game  
You better watch out  
  
I'm a fire starter  
Make your blood run faster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
I'm a fire starter  
I'm a sweet disaster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
  
I might look all in innocent  
But the embers are burning inside of me  
And I'm ready to take that step  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
I'm a badass  
Jumping off the moving train  
I'm a Jane Bond  
Putting all them guys to shame  
I'm a wild card  
I'm about take my aim  
You better watch out  
  
I'm a fire starter  
I'm a sweet disaster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
I'm a fire starter  
I'm a sweet disaster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
  
I'm so high I'm burning up  
Kiss your lips I'm waking up  
There's nothing murder be a fighter  
  
There's an S under my clothes  
On my chest where nobody else can see  
Yeah  
  
I'm a fire starter  
Make your blood run faster  
I'm a hearts like water  
I'm a fire starter  
I'm a sweet disaster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
  
I'm a fire starter
