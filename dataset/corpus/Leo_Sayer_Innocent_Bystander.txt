Standing by the railway station  
Waiting for your train  
But the train never comes  
No, the train never comes  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes I think I'm going out of my head  
  
Running down the track  
Trying to reach the end  
But the end never comes  
No, the end never comes  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes I think I'm going out of my head  
  
I've been waiting for the sun  
But it always hides behind the sky  
And time rolls by before my eyes  
That's the story of my life  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head  
Aaah - aaah  
Aaah  
Aaah  
  
I've been waiting for the sun  
But it always hides behind the sky  
And time goes by before my eyes  
That's the story of my life  
And I think I'm going out of my head  
Yes, I think I'm going out of my head  
Well I Think I'm going out of my  
  
I think I'm going out of my  
I think I'm going out of my  
I think I'm going out of my  
I think I'm going out of my head
