And so there comes a time,  
We must both make up our minds,  
Is our angel singing true,  
Is it me is it you ?  
  
I just got to know it now,  
Rode somewhere, some place, somehow  
Is our love as deep as blue  
Is it me is it you ?  
Is it me is it you ?  
  
I'm lost in your love  
Don't think I ever stopped  
I got the feeling that's the reason why  
And the question's loud and clear  
  
Should we stay or should we bend  
It just gets deeper in the end  
I know you want to know it too  
Is it me is it you ?  
Is it me is it you ?
