Oh I'm on my way I know I am,  
Somewhere not so far from here  
All I know is all I feel right now,  
I feel the power growing in my hair  
  
Sitting on my own not by myself,  
Everybody's here with me  
I don't need to touch your face lo know,  
And I don't need to use my eyes to see  
  
I keep on wondering if I sleep too long,  
Will I always wake up the same (or so)?  
I keep on wondering if I sleep to long,  
Will I even wake up the same or something  
  
Oh I'm on my way I know I am,  
But times there were when thought not  
Bleeding half my soul in bad company,  
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop  
  
I'm not making love to anyone's wishes,  
Only for that light I see  
Cause when I'm dead and lowered low in my grave,  
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me  
  
And if I make it to the waterside,  
Will I even find me a boat (or so)?  
And I if I make it lo the waterside,  
I'll be sure to write you note or something  
  
Oh I'm on my way I know I am,  
Somewhere not so far from here  
All I know is all I feel right now,  
I feel the power growing In my hair  
  
Oh life is like a maze of doors  
And they all open from the side you're on  
Just keep on pushing hard boy, try as you may  
You're going to wind up where you started from  
You're going to wind up where you started from
