How do I get closer to you  
When you keep it all on mute  
How will I know the right way to love you  
  
Usually the Queen of figurin' out  
Breaking down a man is no work out  
But I have no clue  
How to get through to you  
  
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry  
I keep knockin' on wood, hopin' there's a real boy inside  
  
But you're not a man  
You're just a Mannequin  
I wish you could feel that my love is real  
But you're not a man  
  
I wish I could just turn you on  
Put a battery in and make you talk  
Even pull a string for you to say anything  
  
But with you there is no guarantee  
Only expired warranty  
A bunch of broken parts  
And I can't seem to find your heart  
  
I'm such a fool  
I'm such a fool  
I'm such a fool  
This one's outta my hands  
I can't put you back together again  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause you're not a man  
You're just a Mannequin  
I wish you could feel that my love is real  
But you're not a man  
You're just a, a toy  
Could you ever be a real, real boy  
And understand  
But you're not a man  
  
If the past is the problem  
Our future can solve them baby  
I could bring you life if you let me inside baby  
It'll hurt but in the end you'll be a man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause you're not a man  
You're just a Mannequin  
I wish you could feel that my love is real  
But you're not a man
