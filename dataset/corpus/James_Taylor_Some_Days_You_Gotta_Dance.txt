It was about five till five on Friday  
We were all getting ready to go  
And the boss man started screaming  
And his veins began to show  
  
He said you and you come with me  
Cause you're gonna have to stay  
My heart was thumping, I was jumping  
I had to get away  
  
[Chorus]  
Some days you gotta dance  
Live it up when you get the chance  
Cause when the world doesn't make no sense  
And you're feeling just a little too tense  
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
  
Well, I was talking with my baby  
Over a small glass of tea  
He asked the loaded question  
He said how do you feel about me  
  
My mind was racing, I was pacing  
But the word just wouldn't come  
And there was only one thing  
Left to do I feel it coming on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance
