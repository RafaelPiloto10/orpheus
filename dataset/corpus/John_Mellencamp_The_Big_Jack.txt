I know you and you know me  
We met many years ago  
In the halls of some ivy covered university  
Where we both used to go  
Now we stand outside the Denmark Hotel  
With Japanese men in their business suits  
It's midnight, you're talking to some Frenchman  
About who does what to you know who  
  
You want the big jack  
You want the sky to crack  
You want something that's going to give you  
The big jack  
You want the big jack  
Hell we all want that  
You want something that's going to give you  
The big jack  
  
You say you want to go somewhere  
Where your ideals were much more than luxuries  
ANd just like some great old paining  
You set there so smug  
With your hands between your knees  
  
You want the big jack  
You want the sky to crack  
You want something that's going to give you  
The big jack  
You want the big jack  
Hell, we all want that  
You want something that's going to give you a  
Heart attack  
  
So go back down to that Mississippi town  
Where you come from  
Have a big time tonight  
I can still see you in your father's coat  
On the delta shore  
That he once owned  
I want to be your father's coat  
I want you girl to marry me  
  
I want the big jack  
I want the sky to crack  
I want something that's going to give me  
The big jack  
I want the big jack  
Hell, we all want that  
I want something that's going to give me a  
Heart attack  
I want the big jack  
Yeah, we all want that  
We want something that's going to give us the big jack  
I want the big jack  
I want the sky to crack  
I want something that's going to give me the big jack
