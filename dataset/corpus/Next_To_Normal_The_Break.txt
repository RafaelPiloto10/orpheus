Diana:  
They told me that the wiring  
Was somehow all misfiring  
And screwing up the signals in my brain.  
  
And then they told me chemistry -  
The juice and not the circuitry -  
Was mixing up and making me insane.  
  
What happens if the burn has healed  
But the skin has not regrown?  
What happens if the cast at last comes off  
And then you find the break  
Was always in another bone?  
  
They tried a millions meds and  
They strapped me to their beds and  
They shrugged and told me that's the way it goes.  
  
And finally you hit it.  
I asked you just what did it.  
You shrugged and said that no one really knows.  
  
What happens if the medicine wasn't really in control?  
What happens if the cut, the burn, the break  
Was never in my brain, or in my blood, but in my soul?  
  
What happens if the cut, the burn, the break  
Was never in my brain...  
Or in my blood...  
But in my soul?
