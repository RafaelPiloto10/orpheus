Love, look what you've done  
You stole my heart  
While I was waiting  
But now that you're gone  
I guess I'll keep holding on to memories  
Longing to tell you  
All of my dreams  
With you beside me  
Wanting to hold you  
That's all I need But how? It's over?  
And now I know what a fool I've been  
You told me you loved me  
And that love never ends  
I can't pretend  
It's hard to say goodbye  
Time, time be my friend  
When will this end  
This empty feeling  
Now, I'll follow the sun  
I guess I'll just carry on  
Without you...  
Longing to tell you  
All of my dreams with you beside me  
Wanting to hold you  
That's all I need  
But how? It's over...  
And now I know what a fool I've been  
You told me you loved me  
And that love never ends  
I can't pretend  
It's hard to say goodbye...  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye...
