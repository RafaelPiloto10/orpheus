Mama I don't ever want to see you cry  
If then they knew him  
They'd have passed right by  
Oh Joseph's a man of many women, feel no way  
Oh always remember you are the first of them  
  
So oh Mama  
If they could see where we are coming from  
The other day  
Then they would know just where they belong  
If they could see where you're coming from  
Just the other day  
They would know just where they belong  
  
Let stumbling blocks fall out of your way  
Lord know, Lord knows your reward shall be great  
They were broken off through their lack of faith  
But because of your faith you are still in place  
Woe Mama, if they could see where you're coming from  
Just the other day  
Then they would know just where you are coming from  
If they could see where you are coming from  
Just the other day  
Then they would know just where they belong  
  
Ah my children  
Oh Mama  
Fret not for me  
I know Jah will be there  
Eternally  
  
If they could see where we are coming from  
Just the other day  
Then they would know just where they belong  
If they could see where we are coming from  
Then they would know just where they belong  
  
Mama I don't ever want to see you cry  
Ain't no lie  
If then they knew him  
They would have passed right by  
So many called but you were chosen  
And so you will remain outspoken  
Oh Mama  
If they could see where we are coming from  
Just the other day  
Then they would know just where they belong  
  
Mama I don't ever want to see you cry  
Ain't no lie  
If then they knew him  
They would have passed right by  
So many called but you were chosen  
And so you will remain outspoken  
Oh Mama  
If they could see where we are coming from  
Just the other day  
Then they would know just where they belong  
  
If they could see where we are coming from  
Just the other day  
Then they would know just where they belong  
Then they would know  
Yes they would know
