Green shadow, water weight all over-all over me  
The end will shelter me away  
Can we meet again, meet and meet and meet again  
Can ya fill the can if ya can't fill me?  
  
Who ya following?  
Who ya starting to move like?  
Who ya falling for, who ya falling for?  
Whose lies?  
Who ya following, who ya falling for?  
This sound's on your side  
  
Secret blue purple pink and green right over it  
Hold on 'cuz the coldest hasn't fought yet  
Well if we meet again, meet and meet and meet again  
Can ya catch the can if you can't will it?  
  
How will you want something to hit with  
Spinning again and again and again and again  
What's your crime  
What's your crime  
Well how will you want  
How will she fall  
How will she spin  
She's spinning again and again and again and again  
What's your crime  
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your  
What's your crime, crime, crime  
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your  
What's your crime
