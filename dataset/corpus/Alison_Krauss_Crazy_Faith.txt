I lit my love and watched it burn:  
Asking nothing in return.  
Except the lessons I will learn.  
From holding crazy faith.  
  
I've been touched by that bright fire.  
Down to the root of my desire,  
While the smoke, it rises higher.  
Glowing crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:  
It tells me.  
  
Am I a fool for hanging long?  
Would I be a fool for being long gone.  
When is daylight gonna dawn,  
On my crazy faith.  
  
The questions will not let me sleep,  
The dance is buried way too deep.  
But the bottom lover, lover's keep,  
Made by crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:  
It tells me.  
  
Love you're losin', those you love,  
Let the hope fly from the glove.  
Do not search the skies above.  
Search your crazy faith.  
  
Love is lightning, love is ice.  
It only strikes the lucky twice.  
Once or you will know the price.  
And once for crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so.
