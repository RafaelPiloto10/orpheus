I tell you what!  
  
They don't mess with me, I'm a wild man, son  
I got me my very own anti tank gun  
I got a jack rabbit with it, guess he was a mean one  
Yeah, I've always been a sportsman  
  
Now, there wasn't much left when I got to him  
Them big old shells didn't just go through him  
Just lumps of fur and that was it  
Guess you could say he sure took a hit, alright  
  
Yeah, you want to see my fire power, see my collection  
Cause that's my thing, man, perfection  
Now I'm talking power in the barrel of a gun  
I'll blow anything I want to kingdom come  
  
Ba ba boom  
Ba ba ba ba bomb  
And I'll blow anything I want  
To kingdom come  
  
Yeah, all you got to do is squeeze on the trigger  
And a little bitty human get a whole lot bigger  
Cause there's a time for talking and a time to shoot them down  
  
And this mama-jama don't pussy foot around, alright  
  
Yeah, let them laugh, let them say we're strange  
Me and my buddies on the rifle range  
But you won't be laughing when it hits the fan  
You're going to want to be a survivor, man  
  
Yeah, you got to see my fire power, see my collection  
Cause that's my thing, man, perfection  
Now, I'm talking power in the barrel of a gun  
I'll blow anything I want to kingdom come  
  
Ba ba boom  
Ba ba ba ba bomb  
And I'll blow anything I want  
To kingdom come  
  
Ba ba ba ba boom  
I say we ought to drop the bomb  
Yes, and I'll blow anything I want  
To kingdom come
