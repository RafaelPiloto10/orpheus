Rocky Mountain Way  
  
Spent the last year the Rocky Mountain way  
Couldn't get much higher  
Out to pasture, I think it's safe to say  
It's time to open fire  
'Cause we don't need the ladies  
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad, oh no  
And the Rocky Mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
  
Tellin' us this and tellin' us that  
Changin' it day by day  
He says it doesn't matter  
Bases are loaded and Casey's at bat  
Changin' it play by play  
It's time to change the batter  
'Cause we don't need the ladies  
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad, oh no  
And the Rocky Mountain way  
Is better than the way we had
