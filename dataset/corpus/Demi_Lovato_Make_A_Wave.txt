They say the beat of a butterflie's wings  
Can set off a storm in the world away  
What if that ride in the smallest of things  
Can power the strongest hurricane?  
What if it all begins inside?  
We hold the key that turns the tide.  
  
Chorus:  
Just a pebble in the water (ohh)  
Can set the sea in motion (ohh)  
A simple act of kindness (ohh)  
Can stir the widest ocean  
If we show a little love  
Heaven knows what we could change (oh yeah)  
So throw a pebble in the water (oh yeah)  
And make a wave, make a wave.  
Make a wave, make a wave.  
  
The single joys that you take and send  
And you can thrust your hand with someone in need (help somebody)  
Don't fool yourself and say you can't  
You never know what can grow from just one seed (yeah).  
  
So come with me and seize the day  
This world may never be the same.  
  
Chorus:  
Just a pebble in the water,  
(Just a pebble in the water)  
Can set the sea in motion,  
(Can set the sea in motion)  
A simple act of kindness (ohh)  
Can stir the widest ocean  
If we show a little love,  
(If we show a little love)  
Heaven knows what we can change,  
(Heaven knows what we can change)  
So throw a pebble in the water,  
(So throw a pebble in the water)  
Make a wave, make a wave.  
  
Just show a little love  
You never know what we can change  
Just throw a pebble in the water (ohh)  
Make a wave, make a wave.
