Ride the wild one cowboy in the rodeo  
Love like crazy juliet and romeo  
Living only to consume  
Bruising hearts collecting gloom  
Seems no place to hide away  
From the hammer and caress  
Dress with passion  
Fashion for the parking lot  
Make some action  
Pushing time out of the clock  
Take away identity  
Parcel up what's left of me  
Water down the youthful drop  
Call the sane insanity  
  
All I want is to live with you  
All I want is to cry with you  
  
Dance til sunrise  
Reggae til the cows come home  
Fight the bigot  
Champion you're not alone  
I can sort of work things out  
Juggling the fear and doubt  
Even when it's watertight  
In the end I have to say  
  
I can sort of work things out  
Juggling the fear and doubt  
Even when it's watertight  
In the end I have to say I have to say  
  
Ride the wild one cowboy in the rodeo  
Love like crazy Juliet and Romeo
