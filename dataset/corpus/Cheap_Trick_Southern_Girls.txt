I've been north,  
I've been east to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words  
And you show it  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I'll know  
Waste no time getting  
So close to you  
And you'll never run way  
When you find out why I wanted to find you  
  
Ooh baby need some brand new shoes  
Get out on the street  
You got nothing to lose  
You rock me and your crazy  
And everyone says it, yeah yeah  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
  
I've been up I've been down  
I've been weak I've been strong  
But I never met someone like you  
And you'll never run away  
When you find why I wanted to find you  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I'll know  
Waste no time getting  
So close to you  
All you Southern girls  
Got a way with your words  
And you show it  
  
Oh baby need some brand new shoes  
Get out on the street  
You got nothing to lose  
You rock me and your crazy  
And everyone says it, yeah yeah  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
  
You think this boy, he loves you  
Southern girls  
You make it hard oh, so hard  
I've been north, I've been east to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words  
And you show it  
  
Oh baby need some brand new shoes  
Get out on the street  
You got nothing to lose  
You rock me and your crazy  
And everyone says it, yeah yeah  
  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
Southern girls
