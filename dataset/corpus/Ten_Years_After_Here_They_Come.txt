Here they come, and they fly with the power of the sun  
Here they come, and they're going to touch everyone  
Far, far, have they come  
  
Here they come, and the fire on their wings doesn't burn  
Here they come, and they know everything we must learn  
Round, round, we must turn  
  
Watch out, you, sinners  
Don't you know that your time has come?  
Watch out, you, winners  
Now it's the same for everyone  
  
Here they come, and the stars in their eyes seem to glow  
Here they come, and the fear in our hearts starts to go  
Now, now, now we all know
