I don't mind the sparrows stealin' my seed  
The crow gettin' fat on my corn  
But that beady eyed buzzard hangin' 'round my gal  
Is gonna wish he never was born ( never was born! )  
Let the hungry old hawk take a chicken or two  
And only the rooster will cry  
But the beady eyed buzzard hangin' 'round my gal  
Is gonna wish he knew how to fly!  
Better start flyin'  
You better high tail it outta town!  
You're headin' straight for trouble  
If you keep on a circling 'round!  
You can fill up your pockets with ma seed an' ma corn  
Take my horse, load the wagon up too!  
But you beady eyed buzzard stay away from my gal  
Or else it's gonna be . . . the end of you!  
( Better start flyin' . . . )  
You better high tail it outta town!  
You're headin' straight for trouble  
If you keep on a circling 'round!  
You can fill up your pockets with ma seed an' ma corn  
Take my horse, load the wagon up too!  
But you beady eyed buzzard stay away from my gal  
Or else it's gonna be . . . the end of you!  
. . . the end of you!
