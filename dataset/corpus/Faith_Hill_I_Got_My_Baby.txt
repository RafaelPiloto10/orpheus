Diggin' around  
Feelin' so down  
Floatin' around like a feather  
Nothin' but me  
  
And all of my dreams  
Trying to hold it together  
Those were long days  
Long days indeed  
  
Could not avoid  
I felt no joy  
No relief  
  
Everyone knows  
When that's how it goes  
It's usually bound to get better  
So when you arrived  
  
I looked in your eyes  
And all I could see was forever  
What a fine day  
A fine day indeed  
  
When you showed up I fell in love  
Now look at me  
  
I got my baby  
I got those good times  
Don't lack no sunshine  
Baby I got you  
  
Darlin', I find you're blowin' my mind  
Every time that I hold you  
Better than gold  
The deeper we go  
  
Nobody knows it like I do  
These are sweet days  
Sweet days indeed  
A love that flows  
Will always grow  
Now can't you see  
  
I got my baby  
I got those good times  
Don't lack no sunshine  
Baby I got you  
  
Red hot and no blues  
Got no more bad news  
I got my baby  
Baby, I got you  
  
And on and on  
Oh what a love affair  
And on and on  
Oh, I will always be there  
Yeah  
Oh baby  
  
I got my baby  
I got those good times  
Don't lack no sunshine  
Baby I got you  
  
Red hot and no blues  
Got no more bad news  
I got my baby  
Baby, I got you  
  
I got my baby  
I got those good times  
Don't lack no sunshine  
Baby I got you  
  
Yes, I do  
Red hot and no blues  
Got no more bad news
