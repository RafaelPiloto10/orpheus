I think you wanna come over  
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine  
Are you drunk? Are you sober?  
(Think about it)  
Doesn't matter  
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it  
I don't know what you're waiting for  
  
Feel my temperature rising  
It's too much heat  
I'm gonna lose control  
Do you want to go higher?  
Get closer to the fire  
I don't what you're waiting for  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna party  
(Yeah)  
'Cause anybody just won't do  
Let's get this started  
(Yeah)  
'Cause everybody wants to party with you  
  
Boy you got a reputation  
But you're gonna have to prove it  
I see a little hesitation  
Am I gonna have to show ya  
That if it feels right  
Get on your mark  
Step to the beat boy  
That's what its for  
  
Put your arms around me  
When it gets too hot we can go outside  
But for now just come here  
Let me whisper in your ear  
An invitation to the dance of life  
  
I'm gonna party  
(It's a celebration)  
'Cause anybody just won't do  
Let's get this started  
(No more hesitation)  
'Cause everybody wants to party with you  
  
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?  
You look familiar  
You wanna dance?  
Yeah  
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on  
What are you waiting for?  
  
I'm gonna party  
(It's a celebration)  
'Cause anybody just won't do  
Let's get this started  
(No more hesitation)  
'Cause everybody wants to party with you  
  
Come join the party  
(It's a celebration)  
'Cause anybody just won't do  
Let's get this started  
(No more hesitation)  
'Cause everybody wants to party with you  
  
Boy you got it  
(It's a celebration)  
'Cause anybody just won't do  
Let's get it started  
(No more hesitation)  
'Cause everybody wants to party with you  
Boy you got it  
'Cause anybody just won't do  
Let's get it started  
(No more hesitation)  
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
