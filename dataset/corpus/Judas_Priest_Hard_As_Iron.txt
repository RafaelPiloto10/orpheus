Whipcrack, stings the sky  
Don't mess with me I'm danger  
The meanest one alive  
  
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale  
The more that you resist  
The more pain you'll feel  
  
I'm blazing on to glory  
There's thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever I'll remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel  
  
Untouched, cold as ice  
I'll turn your blood to water  
Strangle in my vice  
  
Shock waves, bones to dust  
You're messin' with a mine field  
So expect the worst  
  
I'm blazing on to glory  
There's thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever I'll remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel  
  
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry  
Is victory, is victory  
  
I'm blazing on to glory  
There's thunder in my veins  
And nothing stands before me  
Forever I'll remain  
  
Hard as iron  
Sharp as steel  
Stop for no man  
You better beg and kneel
