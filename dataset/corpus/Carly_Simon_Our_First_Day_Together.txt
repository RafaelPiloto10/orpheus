Our first day together  
Was after we'd been close in dreams  
Was after we'd shared hell and heaven  
And all the places in-between  
And all the places in-between  
  
After we'd spent nights together  
And breathed secrets without words  
After we'd made promises  
That could but might not have been heard  
Might not have been heard  
  
Knowing me the way you do  
Then why did you just say  
That our first day together  
Was today?
