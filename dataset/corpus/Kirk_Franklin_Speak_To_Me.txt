[chorus 2x]  
Speak it to me lord Jesus me need to hear from you  
If you don't speak lord Jesus me don't know what to do  
  
Me wake up in the mornin and I see the bright sunshine  
living without you jesus I could have no peace of mine  
your name i keep on callin like a melody so sweet  
if i could touch the hymm of his garment my life would be complete.
