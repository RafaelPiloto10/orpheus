[Brendon]  
It's getting late, and I  
Cannot seem to find my way home tonight  
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole  
Falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone  
What would my head be like  
If not for my shoulders  
Or without your smile  
May it follow you forever  
May it never leave you  
To sleep in the stone,  
May we stay lost on our way home  
  
[Brendon]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Nate]  
If I should die tonight  
May I first just say I'm sorry  
For I, never felt like anybody  
I am a man of many hats although I  
Never mastered anything  
When I am ten feet tall  
I've never felt much smaller, since the fall  
Nobody seems to know my name  
So don't leave me to sleep all alone  
May we stay lost on our way home?  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon]  
Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
It could leave, it could leave, come the morning  
  
[Nate]  
Celebrate the night  
It's the fall before the climb  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
Shall we sing, shall we sing, 'til the morning  
  
[Brendon]  
If I fall forward, you fall flat  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
And if the sun should lift me up  
Would you come back? C'mon!  
  
[Music interlude]  
  
[Brendon]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
So c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon screams] yeah yeah yeah!  
  
[Brendon]  
It's getting late and I, cannot seem to find my way home tonight.
