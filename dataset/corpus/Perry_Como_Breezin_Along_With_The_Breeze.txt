I'm just breezin' along with the breeze,  
Trailing the rails, I'm a roamin' the seas.  
Like the birdies that sing in the trees,  
Pleasin' to live, livin' to please.  
  
The sky is the only roof I have over my head,  
And when I'm weary, mother nature makes me a bed.  
I'm just goin' along as I please,  
Breezin' along with the breeze.  
  
The sky is the only roof I have over my head,  
And when I'm weary, mother nature makes me a bed.  
I'm just goin' along as I please,  
Breezin' along with the breeze.
