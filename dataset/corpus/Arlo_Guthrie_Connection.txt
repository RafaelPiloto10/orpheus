Everything seems to be going in the wrong direction  
The doctor wants to give me more injections  
He's given me shots for a thousand rare infections  
And they don't know if they'll Iet me go  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Connection  
No I just can't make no connection  
And all I want to do  
Is just to get back to you  
  
My bags they get a very close inspection  
I wonder why it is that they suspect 'em  
They're just tryin' to add me to their collection  
And I don't know if they'll let me go  
  
[CHORUS]
