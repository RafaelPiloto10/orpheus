In the days before you were young  
We used to sit in the morning sun  
We used to turn the radio on  
What happened?  
We'd see our lies in the eyes of fate  
And take our cradles to the grave  
But even then we're never saved  
From danger  
  
And if you ever leave me come  
I will be there waiting  
Waiting for you know I will  
I love you for ever  
I'll never say never  
  
But I've only got two hands  
And I'll never learn to dance  
I'll never get a second chance  
Whatever  
I'll take the breath away from your sighs  
And wipe the tears away from your eyes  
And hope the fire never dies  
Inside you  
  
And if you ever leave me come  
I will be there waiting  
Waiting for you know I will  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you...  
  
In the days before you were young  
We used to sit in the morning sun  
We used to turn the radio on  
What happened?
