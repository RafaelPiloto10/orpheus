Verse 1:  
Take my heart  
Lord will you take my heart  
As I surrender to Your will  
I confess You are my righteousness  
And until You move me I'll be still  
And know that You are God.  
  
Chorus:  
You hold my world in Your hands  
You hold my world in Your hands and  
I am amazed at Your love  
I am amazed that You love me  
You hold my world in Your hands  
You hold my world in Your hands and  
I'm not afraid my world is safe  
In Your Hands Oh  
In Your hands  
  
Verse 2:  
Take my life  
Lord will You take my life  
You are the reason that I live  
I believe You have forgiven me  
And by Your grace I will forgive  
And know that You are God  
And know that You are God  
  
Chorus:  
  
(Same as above)  
  
Vamp:  
  
You won't let go of me  
You won't let go of me  
You won't let go of me  
You  
Won't let go Never let go  
You will take care of me  
You will take care of me  
You will take care of  
Me  
You will take care Always take care  
You hold my world in Your hands  
You hold my world  
And you won't let go  
  
I take no credit
