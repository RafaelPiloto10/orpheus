In the jungle I run tonight  
Find no peace to logical life  
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah.  
  
Faces, numbers I recognize  
You don't fool me with cynical lies  
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear  
Only solutions  
Oh, it won't be long, it won't take too long  
  
Modern times drive me insane  
Explanations I can't explain  
Leaves me standing in the rain, oh yeah  
  
Solving mysteries with nothing to lose  
Magic leaves you without any clues  
There's only so much one man can do, oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear  
Only solutions  
Oh it won't be long, it won't take too long  
Only solutions  
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear  
Now that the sun is shining  
Clear vision, clear vision  
  
In the jungle I run tonight  
Find no peace to logical life  
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah  
  
Faces, numbers I recognize  
You don't fool me with cynical lies  
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah  
  
Only solutions  
It's my point of view  
Only solutions  
Oh, clear vision  
Only solutions  
No second thoughts  
Only solutions  
No, no, no contradictions  
  
People reason  
People reason  
No escape
