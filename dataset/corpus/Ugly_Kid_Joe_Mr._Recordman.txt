[Chorus]  
Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am?  
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?  
  
I've takin' a likin' to your game  
I think we all, we feel the same  
Is this a dream or is it real  
You say you want to cut a deal?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't need much time to think about  
I'm sure that you have got the clout  
I only hope that you're my friend  
And stand by me until the end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sell a lotta records 'n' tour 'round the world,  
Make a lotta money 'n' meet lotsa' girls  
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?  
  
It sound like music to my ears  
I've dreamed of this for many years  
  
Sell a lotta records 'n' tour 'round the world,  
Make a lotta money 'n' meet lotsa' girls  
Have a lot of fun and hang with my bro's  
'Cause these boys and this band is all that I know  
  
If not for the money and not for the show  
Are you here for me or here for the dough?  
Mr. Recordman, do you really give a damn?
