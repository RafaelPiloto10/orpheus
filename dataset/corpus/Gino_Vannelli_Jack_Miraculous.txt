My my my what a marvelous life  
Wear your patent leather shoes  
Gotta win and never lose  
Oh then why oh why Jack I cry  
Save your life and flee today  
Why why why such a glorious guy  
Easy friends are easy foe  
Who you never know  
Oh then my oh my oh Jack you'll die  
Save your life and run away  
What are my chances of living  
If I were to stay close to you  
Jack all this crime and no giving  
I couldn't do for you  
What are my chances of living  
If I were to stay close to you  
Jack all this crime and no giving  
I couldn't see for me  
What a life  
Damn your patent leather shoes  
Come the time to pay your dues  
Oh then fly and fly dear Jack goodbye  
Save your life and run away  
Today
