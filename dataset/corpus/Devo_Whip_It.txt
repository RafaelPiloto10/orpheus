Crack that whip  
Give the past the slip  
Step on a crack  
Break your momma's back  
  
When a problem comes along you must whip it  
Before the cream sits out too long you must whip it  
When something's going wrong you must whip it  
  
Now whip it into shape  
Shape it up  
Get straight  
Go forward  
Move ahead  
Try to detect it  
It's not too late to whip it  
Whip it good  
  
When a good time turns around you must whip it  
You will never live it down unless you whip it  
No one gets their way until they whip it  
I say whip it whip it good  
I say whip it whip it good
