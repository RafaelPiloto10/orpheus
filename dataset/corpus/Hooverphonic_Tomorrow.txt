It all comes down to winning, but defeat is no shame  
Why do you lose interest when there's nothing more to gain  
'Cause evil attracts, but our love will be a fact  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
'Cause time is up  
And so are we  
But still there's a chance to avoid defeat  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
Just a little more effort do try to succeed  
There's nothing in life that's impossible to beat  
'Cause evil attracts, but our love will be a fact  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
'Cause time is up  
And so are we  
But still there's a chance to avoid defeat  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
Time is up  
And so are we  
But still there's a chance to avoid defeat  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow
