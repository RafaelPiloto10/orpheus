(Oh friends, don't matter if you're a man or a woman. If you're in love  
with somebody, these are the words that you got to learn to say. Now  
listen carefully. Here it comes)  
I'll be loving you always  
with a love that's true, always  
When the thing you've planned  
needs my helping hand,  
I will understand, always, always  
  
Days may not be fair, always  
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year, but always.  
  
I said that I'll be loving you, always  
with a love that's true, always.  
When the thing you've planned  
needs my helping hand,  
I will, I will understand, always, always  
  
(Oh that's pretty  
that's pretty too  
Oh darling)  
  
The days may not be fair, always  
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just a second, or a minute, or an hour,  
Not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower,  
Not for just the summer and the winter going sour,  
But always, always, always  
  
(OK if you don't want to quit, let's try it one more time)  
  
I'll be loving you, always  
with a love that's true, always.  
When the thing you've planned  
needs my helping hand,  
I will understand, I will, I will understand, always, always  
  
The days may not be fair, always  
(Don't worry, baby)  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year, but always.
