You got to stop, it's much too deep for me  
I was mistaken, yes I don't understand  
And my decision, if I choose not to choose  
There's nobody on this line but me  
I got a free will that I ain't even used yet  
I got a free will and I ain't gonna use it  
'til I know what I'm doing  
There's an itch in my brain (and I can't get at it)  
There's an itch in my brain (and I can't get at it)  
There's an itch in my brain (and I can't get at it)  
And I can't stop thinking 'til I scratch it  
I'm still dancing, I'm just a change machine  
Don't have to tell me I'm only waving my arms  
But there's so much smoke and so little fire  
And there's nobody on this line but me  
I got a free will and it's making me crazy  
I got a free will and I ain't gonna use it  
'til I know what I'm doing  
I got a free will and I'm dying to keep it  
I got a free will and I ain't gonna use it  
'til I know what I'm doing
