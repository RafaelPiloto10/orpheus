I don't care what they say  
I won't stay in a world without love  
  
Please lock me away  
And don't allow the day  
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness  
I don't care what they say, I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
Birds sing out of tune  
And rain clouds hide the moon  
I'm ok, here I stay with my loneliness  
I don't care what they say, I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
So I wait, and in a while  
I will see my true love smile  
She may come, I know not when  
When she does, I'll lose  
So baby until then  
  
Lock me away  
And don't allow the day  
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness  
I don't care what they say, I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
(Please lock me away)  
(And don't allow the day)  
(Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness)  
I don't care what they say, I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
So I wait, and in a while  
I will see my true love smile  
She may come, I know not when  
When she does, I'll lose  
So baby until then  
  
Lock me away  
And don't allow the day  
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness  
I don't care what they say, I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
I don't care what they say, I won't stay  
In a world without love (forget him)
