All the journeys of this great adventure  
It didn't always feel that way  
I wouldn't trade them because I made them  
The best I could, and that's enough to say  
  
Some days were dark  
I wish that I could live it all again  
Some nights were bright  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
All the highlights of that headlong flight  
Holding on with all my might  
To what I felt back then  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again  
  
All the treasures, the gold and glory  
It didn't always feel that way  
I don't regret it - I'll never forget it  
I wouldn't trade tomorrow for today  
Some days were dark  
I wish that I could live it all again  
Some nights were bright  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again  
  
The days were dark  
And the nights were bright  
I would never trade tomorrow for today  
  
All the highlights of that headlong flight  
Holding on with all my might  
Some days were dark  
I wish that I could live it all again  
Some nights were bright  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to steal  
Oh I wish that I could...  
  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again
