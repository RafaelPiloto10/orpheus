Well, you can stake that claim,  
Good work is the key to good fortune  
Winners take that praise  
Losers seldom take that blame  
If they don't take that game  
And sometimes the winner takes nothing  
We draw our own designs  
But fortune has to make that frame  
  
We go out in the world and take our chances  
Fate is just the weight of circumstances  
That's the way that lady luck dances  
Roll the bones  
  
Why are we here?  
Because we're here  
Roll the bones  
Why does it happen?  
Because it happens  
Roll the bones  
  
Faith is cold as ice,  
Why are little ones born only to suffer  
For the want of immunity  
Or a bowl of rice?  
Well, who would hold a price  
On the heads of the innocent children  
If there's some immortal power  
To control the dice?  
  
We come into the world and take our chances  
Fate is just the weight of circumstances  
That's the way that lady luck dances  
Roll the bones  
  
Jack, relax.  
Get busy with the facts.  
No zodiacs or almanacs,  
No maniacs in polyester slacks.  
Just the facts.  
Gonna kick some Gluteus max.  
It's a parallax, you dig?  
You move around  
The small gets big. It's a rig.  
It's action, reaction,  
Random interaction.  
So who's afraid  
Of a little abstraction?  
Can't get no satisfaction  
From the facts?  
You better run, homeboy,  
A fact's a fact  
From Nome to Rome, boy.  
  
What's the deal? Spin the wheel.  
If the dice are hot, take a shot.  
Play your cards. Show us what you got,  
What you're holding.  
If the cards are cold,  
Don't go folding.  
Lady Luck is golden,  
She favors the bold. That's cold.  
Stop throwing stones,  
The night has a thousand saxophones.  
So get out there and rock,  
And roll the bones.  
Get busy!
