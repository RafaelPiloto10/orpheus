Hear the song of a fool  
How the fool broke a rule  
Is he really a fool?  
  
Yes, fools rush in where angels fear to tread  
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head  
Though I see the danger there  
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care  
  
Fools rush in where wise men never go  
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?  
Yes, when we met, I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in  
  
Yes, fools rush in where angels fear to tread  
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head  
  
Only fools walk in where wise men never go  
Wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?  
Yes, when we met, I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool walk in  
Yeah, this is a song of a fool
