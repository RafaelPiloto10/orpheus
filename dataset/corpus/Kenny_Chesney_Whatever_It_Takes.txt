Well, I've been drawing little hearts in the morning paper  
Lookin' for a house an' a couple of acres  
You'll be mine some time, sooner or later and I can't wait  
  
Like a busy ol' bee savin' up it's honey  
Honey I'm savin' up all my money  
To have you I'll do anything I have to, whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane, have it paint your name up in the sky above  
I tell the world I'm yours, put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.  
  
Well I've been yellin' your name from a lookout mountain  
Tossing my pennies in a downtown fountain  
Makin' my wishes I'm hopin' they're countin' for love's sake  
  
I swim upstream in a ragin' river  
Walk through fire do you get the picture  
I swear I bare anything to get there Whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane, have it paint your name up in the sky above  
I tell the world I'm yours, put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane, have it paint your name up in the sky above  
Yeah I tell the world I'm yours, put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.  
Well if it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.
