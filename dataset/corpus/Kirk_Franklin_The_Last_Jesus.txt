I see you, I need you, but I don't know your name  
I touch you, say I love you, but that's all you get for today  
It's easy, so easy, to tell you it's gon' be okay  
When I don't walk shoes, haven't been through what you been through  
Instead I push you away  
Sunday everyone looks like you  
But if our lives are cold inside tell me what's the use  
  
If I say I love Jesus, but you can't see my Jesus  
My words are empty, if they can't see Jesus in me  
No more excuses, I give myself away  
Because I may be the only Jesus they see  
  
Too busy, forgive me, I've got problems of my own  
It's easier to say your help is on the way  
But I was your help all along  
We're shouting, we're dancing, but can the world see a change  
Am I just too selfish to see, the love they need you put inside of me  
  
If we say we love Jesus, but they can't see our Jesus  
Tell me what's the use if they can't see Jesus in you and me  
No more excuses, we give it all away  
Because we may be the only Jesus they see  
  
If I am your hands and Your feet, and if your church is built inside of me  
Where did we go wrong, we been here too long, we can't see your face anymore  
It's not the same anymore  
  
Have mercy on us Jesus, please forgive us Jesus  
I lost my purpose, if they can't see You in me  
See I lied too long, and I change it all today  
Because I may be, because I may be  
  
The only Jesus they see, the only Jesus they see, the only Jesus they see
