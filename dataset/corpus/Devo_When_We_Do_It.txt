When we do it  
(the great big it)  
I hope it's we and not just me  
When we do it  
Something happens  
And it's bigger than the both of us  
And for a second  
There's no trouble  
And the world outside goes away  
The clock on the wall  
Between us stops  
Then the world outside blows away  
You make me lose my body  
And nothing could be better  
You make me lose my body  
It's like we've died and gone to heaven  
You make me lose my body  
When we do it  
(the universal it)  
I know it's we and not just me  
When we do it
