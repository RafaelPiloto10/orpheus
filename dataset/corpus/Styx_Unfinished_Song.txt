Where am I going  
How do I get there  
What should I bring along  
Are people kind there  
Is peace of mind there  
Will I finally belong  
  
Cause you know ships sail their courses  
And heroes ride horses  
They know where they belong  
But I travel in circles  
Quickly to nowhere  
Singing my unfinished song  
  
Some poets say that  
There'll come a day that  
I'll find a place for me  
Why aren't I there yet  
Why can't I share yet  
Why can't my heart be free  
  
Cause you know ships sail their courses  
And heroes ride horses  
They know where they belong  
But I travel in circles  
Quickly to nowhere  
Singing my unfinished song
