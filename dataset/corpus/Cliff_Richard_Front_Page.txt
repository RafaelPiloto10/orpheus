You can't sleep and you just can't eat  
Keep on moving around looking for her shadow  
You've been through it once, well, we all should know  
When you lie awake, it takes so long for the night to go  
You gotta heartbreak  
It's not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But it's not the page, page news  
Six lonely days you wonder when you'll wake  
From these dreams of the past, well, there's no time like the present  
You think right now, there can be no one else  
You say first love is best, well, we all must learn to grow  
You gotta heartbreak  
It's not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But it's not the page, page news, no, no  
Don't rush love, you must take your time  
Try to play it cool, got to read between the lines  
If you don't she will fly away  
To some far off place where she won't receive your telephone calls  
You gotta heartbreak  
It's not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But it's not the page, page news  
It's just a heartbreak  
It's not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But it's not the page, page news
