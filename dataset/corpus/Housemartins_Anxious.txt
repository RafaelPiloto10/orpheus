I was walking by the river, I was asking myself questions  
But the answers I came up with didn't fit  
Some have breakfast in bed some aren't properly fed  
The way they talk about it makes me want to spit  
  
And they're raising all their eyebrows at the raising of the pound  
Whilst they raise another city to the ground  
And we're opening the doors and walking 'round on all fours  
Looking for a sense in lost and found  
  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
  
I really thought I'd have my tongue ties if I stood up to shout  
But all they did was listen without their ears  
And I thought I'd be beheaded if I stuck my neck out  
But they just gave me a hanky for my tears  
  
I have confidence in confidence, I hope that hope pulls me through  
But I think a little more is needed now  
We've got to form a congregation and sink down the nation  
Batter all the sinners to the ground  
  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious  
Anxious, Don't they know it is wrong, it makes me anxious
