Yea, its 'bout to get real hard for these niggas to move man  
Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin'  
Goin' to war is still a scary issue  
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol  
Like a military issue  
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two  
Catch a gun case an' bounce, still they'll barely frisk you  
'cause, I proved I move the retail  
Make the smoothest grooves wit female  
And I remove the rules on V12's  
You never ain't never seen it move this smooth on Sprewell's  
I'm a hustler, he's just a middle man to me  
The way I pass the rock, could make Jason Kidd a fan of me  
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin'  
Still I had you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin'  
So watch what you say to them, crackers  
I'll put a couple g's on yer head, like you play for the packers  
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets  
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics  
You got some sticky weed, pass it  
If not put it out, I'm pushin' it before they put it out  
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal, footed out  
Blastin' a do-did-it, first before they put it out, clue  
Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers  
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers  
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain-a  
Get metal in ya mouth, like braces and retainers  
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change  
Tryin' a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained  
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain  
Have her suckin' long enough to leave a nigga body drained  
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin' stupid people  
That'll run up shootin' in front of a group of people  
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you  
Ride up on yer Coupe creep you  
Why you let a groupie deep you?  
'cause even if you reppin' like a man of steel  
You gon' still need a weapon when you land a deal  
One for watch you slippin' like you steppin' on banana peels  
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon 'cause you scanned a mil'?  
I crept in and got handed meals  
Now the white and black rides look like salt, pepper on a bannon grill  
Think I wouldn't hold a Pepsi in my hand for mil's?  
You must be fuckin' stupid, nigga  
Yeah  
Brooklyn stand the fucker  
Every project, rebourse, Kings Borough  
Push wig, for grain  
Fill it in, brown fill  
Lengston you, LG  
Linda, bandi, steflo, Brooklyn  
All believe, Glym wall  
Abyss fill, faragay  
Mossly  
Talkin' stumlo, Guonas  
Rosawell  
I'm just the project nigga myself
