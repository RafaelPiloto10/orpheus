Have a holly jolly Christmas  
It's the best time of the year  
Well  
I don't know if there'll be snow  
But have a cup of cheer  
  
[Chorus]  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet  
  
Ho ho the mistletoe  
Hung where you can see  
Somebody waits for you  
Kiss her once for me  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didn't hear  
Oh, by golly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
This year  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didn't hear  
Oh, by golly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
This year
