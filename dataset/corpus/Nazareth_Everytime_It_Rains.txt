No feeling when you told me goodbye  
No reason when you're living a lie  
Don't tell me what I already know  
I'm living memories of long ago  
I fool myself, I deny it all  
Wanna hide it away  
  
Lost moments never caring enough  
I was never good at playing it tough  
Still living in my own little world  
Still believing you're the only one  
It's always hard, never easier  
To face another day alone  
  
Every time it rains I fall apart  
I start to remember  
Every single time it rains  
I think of you.
