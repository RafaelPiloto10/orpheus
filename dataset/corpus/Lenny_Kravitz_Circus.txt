One day while I was searching  
For what I'll never find  
She walked into my story  
Said she could change my mind  
  
This is the final offer  
She said to make it quick  
Don't lose out on this wonder  
So I had to place my bet  
  
Welcome to the picture show  
Watching your life  
Never know which way to go  
It might not be right  
So you better be strong  
  
What kind of circus is this ?  
What kind of fools are we ?  
When is the final curtain ?  
What can I do to set me free ?  
  
Welcome to the real world  
You better be strong  
Never know which way to go  
It might end up wrong  
So you better be strong  
  
Too many games we have to play  
They always change the rules  
You and me just trying to get along  
What can I do ?  
Got to be strong  
  
She walked into my daydream  
She told me how it had to be  
  
Welcome to the picture show  
Watching your life  
Never know which way to go  
It might not be right  
Yeah yeah  
  
Welcome to the real world  
You got to be strong  
Never know which way to go  
It might end up wrong  
Yeah yeah  
  
Welcome to the picture show  
It might end up wrong  
So you better be strong  
You got to be strong  
You better be strong.
