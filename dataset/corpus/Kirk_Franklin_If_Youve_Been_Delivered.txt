If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord,  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat]  
Here's the Knowledge, get your pen and paper  
A spiritual caper, You'll be calling me later  
Seeking Godly wisdom that's 2000 years in the making  
I'm taking the lesson that holds your deliverance  
Asking me how God can save a man, raise a man  
The enemy he pays your man  
So why you judging me and your buggin me  
Just remember me ain't no fearing me  
You'll hearing me  
If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord,  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat]  
You can shout to this, bounce to this  
Clap to this, as long as you don't question this  
Radical, acrobatical, Jesus Christ fanatical  
Sabbatical taker, innovator, in love with the Creator  
Since I was a baby I know folk hate me  
But lately don't really matter what you say  
Them silly games you try and play  
I represent the One who healed me  
Gods people can you feel me  
If ya been delivered stand up on your feet and praise the Lord,  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [repeat]  
All the people on the left  
All the people on the right  
Clap your hand  
make my praise the high praise  
I want to lift Him up [repeat]
