(Christmas)  
The snow's coming down  
(Christmas)  
I'm watching it fall  
(Christmas)  
Lots of people around  
(Christmas)  
Baby please come home  
(Christmas)  
The church bells in town  
(Christmas)  
All ringing in song  
(Christmas)  
Full of happy sounds  
(Christmas)  
Baby please come home  
  
They're singing "Deck The Halls"  
But it's not like Christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun we had last year  
  
(Christmas)  
Pretty lights on the tree  
(Christmas)  
I'm watching them shine  
(Christmas)  
You should be here with me  
(Christmas)  
Baby please come home  
  
They're singing "Deck The Halls"  
Not like Christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
All the fun we had last year  
  
(Christmas)  
Oh if there was a way  
(Christmas)  
I'd hold back this tear  
(Christmas)  
Oh but it's Christmas day  
(Please)  
Please  
(Please)  
Please  
(Please)  
Please  
(Please)  
Please  
(Please)  
Please  
(Please)  
Please  
Oh come home  
Oh babe  
You know I need you  
Oh come home  
I gotta have you  
You know I need you  
(Christmas)  
Whooaa  
  
I gotta have you  
It's Christmas, Christmas,  
Christmas, Christmas yeah
