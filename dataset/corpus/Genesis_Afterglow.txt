Like the dust that settles all around me,  
I must find a new home.  
The ways and holes that used to give me shelter,  
Are all as one to me now.  
But I, I would search everywhere  
Just to hear your call,  
And walk upon stranger roads than this one  
In a world I used to know before.  
I miss you more.  
  
Than the sun reflecting off my pillow,  
Bringing the warmth of new life.  
And the sounds that echoed all around me,  
I caught a glimpse of in the night.  
But now, now I've lost everything,  
I give to you my soul.  
The meaning of all that I believed before  
Escapes me in this world of none, no thing, no one.  
  
And I would search everywhere  
Just to hear your call,  
And walk upon stranger roads than this one  
In a world I used to know before.  
For now I've lost everything,  
I give to you my soul.  
The meaning of all that I believed before  
Escapes me in this world of none,  
I miss you more.
