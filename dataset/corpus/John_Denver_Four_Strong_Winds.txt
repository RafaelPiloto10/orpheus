Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
  
Guess I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall  
Got some friends that I can go to working for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
  
If I get there before the snowflies, and if things are going good  
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter, nothing much for you to do  
And the wind sure blows cold way out there  
  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
Yes our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
But I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.
