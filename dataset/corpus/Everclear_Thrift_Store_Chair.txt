Baby go to bed  
And put out the light  
We both know  
If we talk anymore  
We are going to end up  
In a great big fight  
  
You can have your way again  
Yeah you believe  
What you want to believe  
  
You can walk all over me tomorrow  
But tonight  
Can't we just pretend to sleep  
  
I think we're headed for a big fall  
I think we're headed for a bad time  
  
I'm going to go downstairs  
And sit in that chair you like  
  
I want to put a John Prine record on  
Yes I need to slow down for awhile  
  
Yeah I wish we had never bought  
A king size bed  
  
The only damn thing  
That it's ever been good for  
Is plenty room for the real good sex  
  
I lay in bed in the dark  
And all that I can see  
Is the distance that grows between us  
You seem so far from me  
  
Yes I think we are headed for a real big fall  
I think we are headed for a bad time  
  
I'm going to go downstairs  
I'm gong to sit by myself  
All alone in the middle of the night  
  
I'm going to put a John Prine record on  
I think we need to slow down for awhile  
  
I'm going to go downstairs  
Smoke cigarettes  
In that thrift store chair you like  
  
I'm gonna put a John Prine record on  
I think we need to slow down for awhile  
  
We need to slow down for awhile
