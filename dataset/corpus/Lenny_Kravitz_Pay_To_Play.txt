She said I want the money  
I know you want it honey  
Your skies will not be sunny  
If you don't bring it home to me  
Don't want to hear your crying  
'Cause baby I'm not trying  
To wait for your dreams to fly in  
Then she smiled and said to me  
  
Well I don't believe in what you do  
And I don't believe in what you say  
I don't believe in you  
You've got to pay the price  
If you want to play  
  
Well I don't believe in what you do  
And I don't believe in what you say  
I don't believe in you  
You've got to pay the price  
If you want to play  
  
You told me that you loved me  
Was it just a charade ?  
Were you not thinking of me ?  
When are we going to get paid?  
I have been waiting all the time  
And I'm about to fade  
You better make that money  
Do you hear what I am saying ?  
  
Well I don't believe in what you do  
And I don't believe in what you say  
I don't believe in you  
You've got to pay the price  
If you want to play  
  
Well I don't believe in what you do  
And I don't believe in what you say  
I don't believe in you  
You've got to pay the price  
If you want to play
