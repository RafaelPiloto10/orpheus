Us and them  
And after all we're only ordinary men.  
Me and you  
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do.  
  
'Forward' he cried from the rear  
And the front rank died.  
The general is sat and the lines on the map  
Move from side to side.  
  
Black and blue  
And who knows which is which and who is who.  
Up and down  
And in the end it's only round and round. And round.  
  
'Haven't you heard it's a battle of words'  
The poster bearer cried.  
'Listen son' said the man with the gun,  
'There's room for you inside.'  
  
"Well I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick
sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he got off
light, 'cause I coulda given 'im a thrashin' but I only hit him once. It's
only the difference between right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't
cost nothing do they, eh?"  
  
Down and out  
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.  
With, without.  
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?  
  
Out of the way, it's a busy day  
I've got things on my mind.  
For want of the price of tea and a slice  
The old man died.
