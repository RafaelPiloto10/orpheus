Here I am late again for the last time  
And like I promised, I just told her goodbye  
Please believe me 'cause this time, it's really over  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie  
Didn't I come and tell you about her  
How temptation lured she and I  
Now I know it was only fascination  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie  
I had to let her down easy as slow as I could  
After all, she's got feelings too  
But it took a little longer than I thought it would  
But this time, she knows we're really through  
She wanted to hold me forever  
And this lipstick shows her final try  
And these tears on my shoulder are proof that she failed  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie
