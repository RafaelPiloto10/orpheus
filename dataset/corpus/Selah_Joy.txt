Every breath of air was a silent prayer  
I was longing for your face  
And I wondered why  
All the years went by  
Without a single trace  
  
Anticipating, Lord we've been waiting  
Just watching the days come and go  
But now we know  
  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
  
Set the captives free  
Tell the broken reed  
Hope has been restored  
And the one who cries  
For the wandering child  
Her tears are not ignored  
  
Father in Heaven  
You gave us reason to see past  
The pain of today  
We Celebrate  
  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
Joy  
And the angels sing  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
He is the promised One  
  
Unending hope for all time  
When the King of the ages arrived  
  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
Joy  
And the angels sang, there was  
Joy  
Let the whole world know this  
Joy  
Our King has finally come  
Joy  
Here is the promised One  
  
Joy (let the angels sing)  
Joy (let the angels sing)  
Joy  
  
We've waited so long for this day to come  
The One the Father sent to save us  
We've seen with our own eyes we've seen  
The Promised One  
  
You gave us reason to see past the pain of today  
We've waited so long for this day to come  
We've seen with our own eyes  
The Promised On
