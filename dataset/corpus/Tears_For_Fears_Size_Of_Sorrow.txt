Bathe in another man's grave  
In time we'll follow  
Save all your thoughts for these days  
Don't steal, just borrow  
Well, a high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
Pain, I can understand pain  
Sometimes you just swallow  
Say we can make it okay  
Don't steal, just borrow  
Well, the high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
Well, the high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
High wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
High wire, high wire, high wire  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
High wire, high wire, high wire
