He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun  
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying  
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me  
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.  
  
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying  
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed  
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow  
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow  
  
Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer  
For I believe Satan lives, in the souls of the dying  
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me  
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.  
  
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer  
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying  
When Death Calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes  
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn  
  
Don't look in those sunken eyes  
Don't look and you'll stay alive  
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister  
Can't die until Satan says you die  
And Satan takes your soul  
In the face of death or your toungue will blister  
  
Don't look in those sunken eyes  
Don't look and you'll stay alive  
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister  
Can't die until Satan says you die  
The Devil takes your soul  
With all his wrath he calls the reaper  
  
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying  
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed  
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow  
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow  
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying  
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn, burn, burn  
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer  
When Death Calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down
