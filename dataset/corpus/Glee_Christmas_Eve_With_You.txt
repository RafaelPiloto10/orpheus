I never saw a reindeer fly  
Make it's way across the sky  
But I know if I close my eyes my wishes will come true  
Like the one I've saved for you  
  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Don't care it's cold outside  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
Through the good times and bad  
Happy and sad  
I'm still holding on  
I know what I have  
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you  
With you, yeah  
  
The simple things like goin' home  
And friends they say you're not alone  
Songs of joy they keep you strong make everything okay  
Oh and Santa's on his way (on his way) yeah  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Don't care it's cold outside  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
Through the good times and bad  
The happy and sad  
I'm still holding on  
I know what I have  
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
The sleigh bells are ringing, they're getting real close  
I think I hear Rudolph  
Just up the road  
Candle lights and hearts full of hope  
The stars shining bright some things never change  
  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
My arms are open wide  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
Through the good times and bad  
The happy and sad  
I'm still holding on  
I know what I have  
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you  
  
Let it snow, let it snow  
The fire's burning bright  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
It's not just the gifts  
Under my tree  
The best things in life  
Are totally free  
And waitin' for me is Christmas eve with you  
Is Christmas eve with you
