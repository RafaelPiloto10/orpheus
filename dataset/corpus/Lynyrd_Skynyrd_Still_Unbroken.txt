Broken bones, broken hearts  
Stripped down and torn apart  
A little bit of rust  
I'm still runnin'  
Counting miles, counting tears  
Twist of roads, shifting gears  
Year after year  
It's all or nothing  
  
But I'm not home  
I'm not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Ain't much left  
Though there's so much that's been stolen  
Guess I've lost everything I've had  
But I'm not dead, at least not yet  
Still alone, still alive, still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
  
Never captured, never tamed  
Wild horses on the plains  
You can call me lost, I call it freedom  
I feel a spirit in my soul  
It's something Lord I can't control  
I'm never giving up while I'm still breathing  
  
I'm not home  
I'm not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Ain't much left  
Though there's so much that's been stolen  
Guess I've lost everything I've had  
I'm not dead, at least not yet  
Still alone, still alive, still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
  
I'm still unbroken  
  
Still unbroken  
  
Like the wind, like the rain  
Keeps on running through my veins  
Like a river pouring down into the ocean  
I'm out here on the street  
But I'm standing on my feet  
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken  
  
I'm not home  
I'm not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Ain't much left  
Though there's so much that's been stolen  
Guess I've lost everything I've had  
But I'm not dead, at least not yet  
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
I'm still alone, still alive, I'm still unbroken  
  
I'm still unbroken  
  
I ain't never going down  
  
I'm still unbroken  
Oh
