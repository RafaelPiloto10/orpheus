Happiness, the guests are all in line  
Happiness, they say I look devine  
Happiness, the never ending list  
Happiness, there must be more than this  
  
Everyone is celebrating  
Blessings and flowers shower over my head  
My heart is syncopating  
What do I really know about the man in my bed?  
  
Everything's burning, dancing and turning  
Spinning around, I'm nearly falling apart  
Can I be certain? Open the curtain  
Break down the walls between my head and my heart  
  
Happiness, it's written in the books  
Happiness, your fortune and your looks  
Happiness, you tie it on your wrist  
Happiness, there must be more than this  
  
Everyone's drunk and happy  
Swaying deep in a trance  
Feet are stomping, hands are clapping  
Saying life is a dance  
  
Everything's burning, dancing and turning  
Wine like a rive flowing rapid and red  
Can I be certain? Open the curtain  
Break down the walls between my heart and my head  
  
Every night and day we grow  
To be the sum of you and me  
Is more than 2 alone but can I love you now  
Will we be happy?  
Heart and head, I'm wondering
