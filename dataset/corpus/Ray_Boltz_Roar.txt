Roar  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Luke Renner  
When they led Him out  
To be sacrificed  
He followed like a lamb  
Oh, but keep your eyes  
On the eastern skies  
A lion is coming again  
Chorus:  
Are you ready to see The face of Jesus?  
To fall on your knees  
When He turns and sees us?  
To cry out, He is worthy forevermore?  
Are you ready to hear  
The Lion of Judah roar?  
What a day it will be  
When His Majesty comes and claims  
His children as His own  
When He shakes His mane  
Even death and pain  
Will kneel at His throne  
Chorus  
The day, the day will come  
When every tongue will confess  
That He is the Lord  
So, are you ready to see  
The face of Jesus?  
To fall on your knees  
When He turns and sees us?  
To cry out, He is worthy forevermore?  
Are you ready to see The face of Jesus?  
To fall on your knees  
When He turns and sees us?  
To cry out, He is worthy forevermore?  
Are you ready to hear  
Yhe Lion of Judah roar?
