Blue, ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream now I know that is real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold someone new  
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
And that is why I'm lonely all the time  
  
So please take the treasured dreams that I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday my crazy arms may old someone new  
Right now I'm so lonely all the time  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold someone new  
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
And that is why I'm lonely all the time
