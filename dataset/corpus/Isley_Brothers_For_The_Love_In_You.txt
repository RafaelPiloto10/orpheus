Yeah  
Well, well, well  
Yeah... Hey...  
Yeah  
Hey... Hey...  
Ooh  
  
Driftin' on a memory  
Ain't no place I'd rather be  
Than with you, yeah  
Lovin' you, well, well, well  
  
Day will make a way for night  
All we'll need is candlelight  
And a song, yeah  
Soft and long, well, ooh  
  
Glad to be  
Here alone with a lover unlike no other  
Sad to see  
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah  
  
I wanna be livin'  
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am  
All that I'm givin'  
Is for the love of you, alright now, ooh  
  
Lovely as a ray of sun  
That touches me when the mornin' comes  
Feels good to me, yeah  
My love and me, well  
  
Smoother than a gentle breeze  
Flowin' through my mind with ease  
Soft as can be, well  
When you're lovin' me, when you're lovin' me, ooh  
  
Love to be  
Ridin' the waves of your love, enchanted with your touch  
And it seems to me  
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well  
  
I wanna be livin'  
For the love of you, alright now  
All that I'm givin'  
Is for the love of you, you got me, girl  
  
I wanna be livin'  
For the love of you, alright now  
All that I'm givin', givin'  
Is for the love of you, oh, yes, I am  
  
Paradise I have within  
Can't feel insecure again  
You're the key, well  
And this I see, for I see  
  
Now and then I lose my way  
Confusin' words to try and say  
What I feel, yeah  
Love is real, oh, love is real, ooh  
  
I might as well  
Sign my name on a card which could say it better  
Time will tell  
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do  
  
I know that I'm livin'  
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am  
I know that I'm livin'  
For the love, love of you  
  
Every, every day I'm livin'  
For love of you  
I'm livin' for the love  
Each and every day  
  
I'm, oh, whoa, I'm, oh, yes, I am  
I wanna say it one more time  
Said I'm livin'  
For the love  
  
Each and every day I'm, oh, whoa, I'm  
Lord knows I am  
Right that there  
Said I'm livin'  
For the love, love of you  
Ooh, ooh
