I've been around these vicious lies too  
Too long to be neglecting the truth  
I'm getting closer and I'm fully armed.  
  
I'm about to hunt you down through  
The big black hole right behind you  
And I'm about to cut your wings away  
  
'Cause I've been finding out  
Where you've broken in  
And I will take you out  
When I close you in  
  
I'm killing them all  
I put my soul on the line  
I purify sins  
That I committed in life  
I'll follow them all  
And I'll be bringing them down  
Wherever they go  
I'm right behind  
There's nowhere to go  
Your head on the line  
There is no rope  
You're running out of time  
So where will you go  
When I will murder your soul  
  
I'm about to do it your way  
I will make your world unsafe  
I never thought you'd get this far  
?  
  
You don't believe what all the signs say  
I don't believe in judgment day  
But you won't be leaving here unharmed  
  
'Cause I've been finding out  
Where you've broken in  
And I will take you out  
When I close you in  
  
I'm killing them all  
I put my soul on the line  
I purify sins  
That I committed in life  
I'll follow them all  
And I'll be bringing them down  
Wherever they go  
I'm right behind  
There's nowhere to go  
Your head on the line  
There is no rope  
You're running out of time  
So where will you go  
When I will murder your soul  
  
You can't feel the pain  
I scream in vain  
You sink away  
To the bottom  
  
You can't break your chains  
Break away from here.  
  
I'm killing them all  
I put my soul on the line  
I purify my sins  
That I committed in life  
I'll follow them all  
And I'll be bringing them down  
Wherever they go  
I'm right behind  
There's nowhere to go  
Your head on the line  
There is no rope  
You're running out of time  
So where will you go  
When I will murder your soul
