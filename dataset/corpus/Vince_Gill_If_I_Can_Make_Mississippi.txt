If I can make Mississippi  
Then I'll be alright  
These ol' white lines are lonely  
On this two-lane tonight  
I've got just enough whiskey  
To keep me warm till the mornin' light  
If I can make Mississippi  
Mississippi tonight  
I headed out west  
To seek my fortune and fame  
I sure made a mess  
It took it all but my name  
Why I ever left?  
I can never explain  
If I can make Mississippi  
Through this pouring rain  
If I can make Mississippi  
Then I'll be alright  
These ol' white lines are lonely  
And the headlights are bright  
I've got just enough whiskey  
To keep me warm till the mornin' light  
If I could make Mississippi  
Mississippi tonight  
She said, she would wait  
She said our love was strong  
Well, I'm just so afraid  
I've been gone for too long  
When I walk through that gate  
Will she be there or long, long gone?  
If I can make Mississippi  
If I can make it back home  
If I can make Mississippi  
If I can make it back home
