Show me a sign that I love you  
Blow me your mind cause you always do  
Remind me to tell you that I've come to  
Believe in the beauty, the power of you  
  
Woman dissolved into the sea  
The body of water is calling me  
The god of my daughter is always free  
There's nothing to solve when you're solving me  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company  
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me  
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company  
  
Throw me a line I could use one  
A special design because I'm your son  
Two thousand below where I feel my love  
The body of water where I come from  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company  
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me  
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company  
  
I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal  
Fire from the other side out there  
Formations flow like streams  
I'm made with a life to spare  
Get the jizz, Mr. Sism got a rhythm  
Technology of a prayer  
Scientist to the prism of faith  
And hope so I am there  
  
Baby I'm home, you can come here  
The science of love is becoming clear  
Invisible love with the color still  
A meet to a place in the atmosphere  
And I may believe  
  
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company  
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me  
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company
