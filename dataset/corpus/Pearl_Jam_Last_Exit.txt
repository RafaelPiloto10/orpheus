Lives opened and trashed..."Look ma, watch me crash..."  
No time to question...why'd nothing last...  
Grasp and hold on...hold tight and fast...  
Soon be over...and I will relent...  
Let the ocean swell dissolve 'way my past  
Three days and maybe longer won't even know I've left  
Under your tongue...I'm like a tab...  
I will give you what...you're not supposed to have...  
Under my breath...I swear by sin...  
For better or for worse...a best we began...  
Let the sun climb, oh, burn away my mask  
Three days, and maybe longer, shed my skin at last...shed...shed...  
Let the sun shine, burn away my mask  
Three days, and maybe longer, won't ever find me here  
Let the ocean dissolve away my past  
Four days, and not much longer...  
Let my spirit pass...  
Ooh...  
This is, this is...(3x)  
My...last exit
