What's so wrong?  
Why the face so long  
Is it over?  
And where you going that  
You no longer belong here?  
And distance tells you that  
Distance must come between love  
Where have you been luv?  
When the mistake we made  
Was in never having planned to fall in love, luv  
  
Singing this song  
Singing along  
Makes it easier for me to see you go  
But in doing so  
I'm letting you go  
It only serves to show me  
That I'm still in love with you  
  
Singing this song

So what's so wrong?  
Why the face?  
So long  
Are you changing?  
And where you been to that  
You no longer remember?  
And distance tells you that  
Distance must come between love  
Where have you been luv?  
  
It's just the chance we took  
Having never planned to fall in love, luv  
Having never planned to fall in love, luv  
Having never planned to fall in love, luv  
Luv
