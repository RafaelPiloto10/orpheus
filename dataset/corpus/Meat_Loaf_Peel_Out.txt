Every day of my life they say the same old thing  
Hey boy! Oh boy, you better wait for your turn  
And every day of my life I get the same old line  
Hey boy! Oh boy, when are you going to learn  
I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green  
I want to go on all colors that I see in between  
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs  
I want to run all the way across a double white line  
  
But every day of my life I see the same old road  
Hey girl! Oh girl, we gotta pull up our routes  
And every day of my life I see the same old dream  
Hey girl! Oh girl, I need a dream I can use  
  
I want to go on the red, I want to go on the green  
I want to go on all colors that I see in between  
I want to run all the tolls, I want to run all the signs  
  
My body is the car and my soul is the ignition  
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we  
  
[Chorus:]  
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! We're sick and tired of waiting in line  
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out! Nobody's taking our time  
  
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!  
  
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind  
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime  
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime  
  
And every night of my life there's something holding me back  
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, I know it's time to cut loose  
And every night of my life I dream of someone like you  
Hey girl - what is it boy - oh girl, you got a dream I can use  
  
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind  
  
My body is the car and my soul is the ignition  
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we -  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
Peel out!
