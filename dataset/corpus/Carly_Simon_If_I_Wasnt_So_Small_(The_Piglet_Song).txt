It's not as if I want to rule the world  
Or even the forest  
Or even one tree  
I suppose I could be happy  
If I could be helpful  
With just a little bit of noticing me  
  
If I wasn't so small  
I could be like Tigger  
Figure out ways to help  
Some of those in need  
Indeed I could volunteer  
As the friend that you would want right near  
More like Rabbit and Pooh and Eeyore  
  
I'd be useful and helpful  
The one you would call  
Can I walk around my shadow  
Once before it disappears into the sun  
Run circles around the bees  
Bring the heffalump to his knees  
Catch the pollen before the sneeze  
I'd be needed and useful  
More each passing day  
  
I may be small  
But in the biggest, helpfulest way
