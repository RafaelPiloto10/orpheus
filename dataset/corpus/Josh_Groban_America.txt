Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together  
I've got some real estate here in my bag  
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies  
And walked off to look for America  
  
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh  
Michigan seems like a dream to me now  
And it took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw  
I've gone to look for America  
  
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces  
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy  
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera  
  
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat  
We smoked the last one an hour ago  
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine  
And the moon rose over an open field  
  
Cathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping  
I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why  
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike  
They've all gone to look for America  
All gone to look for America  
All gone to look for America
