Life ain't all that easy I can testify to that  
It's been up and down and round and round to get to where I'm at  
If you could see how I'm living in this old car I drive  
Well you'd probably wonder and even ponder why I even want to stay alive  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I could complain about taxes or the weather we're having today  
Go on and on about things that are wrong from New York to L.A.  
Well that's just not my nature to sit around feeling sad  
We're only here for awhile so why not smile hey living ain't all that bad  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
When I look around there's lots of folks worse off than me  
So I just thank the good Lord and ask him please  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
Give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Give me one more day  
Show me the way and give me one more day  
Give me one more shot
