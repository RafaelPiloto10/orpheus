He's seen too much of life  
And there's no going back  
The loneliness calls him  
And the edge which must be sharpened  
He's losing it. And he knows.  
But there's a fighter in his mind and his body's tough  
The years have been unkind but kind enough  
  
The smell of the earth  
It's his favourite smell  
But he's somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell  
To the place where he hurts and he's scared  
And there's no one to tell  
And no one who doesn't listen  
  
"You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
And I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress I'm allowed  
For now."  
  
"You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
I wouldn't trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet ocean cloud is a mistress I'm allowed  
For now."  
  
"Only me and the sea  
We will do as we please."  
  
He remembers the day he was marched to the front  
By the physical knuckle head teacher of games  
"Look lads" he declared, "This boy's a cream puff  
No guts and no muscles  
No spine and no stuffing"  
The whole schoolroom sniggered  
And silently thanked God it wasn't them..  
  
But time is revenge. All the bullies grow weak  
And must live with faithless women who despise them  
I'll be in Barbados in a couple of weeks  
With a rum on the table and yarns by the yard  
A story to tell and a story to save  
..unless she changes her mind  
I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen to much of life so the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my boat tonight  
  
The wind changed  
I felt it run beneath my ear  
Like silk drawn across my neck  
A dream of your legs  
Defying gravity in love  
  
The medium wave  
Brought signals here from far away  
Your tender voice riding on the sea spray  
Something in the air  
For those who know the signs  
Something in the air  
A storm..  
  
When I was alive  
When I was alive  
Don't wanna remember  
When I was alive  
  
Watch me watch me  
Paint this picture  
Stretchin Hurtin Cursin  
Watch me  
Takin it Takin it Takin it Takin it....  
Watch me. Watch me. God above..  
  
Between two planets  
In between the points of light  
Between two distant shorelines  
Here am I  
  
Between two planets  
In the black daylight of space  
Between two heavenly bodies  
The invisible man.  
Ripping out the radio  
I want to be alone  
  
"You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
I wouldn't trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress I'm allowed  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my bones tonight..
