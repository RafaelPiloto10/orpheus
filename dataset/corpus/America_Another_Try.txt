Hey, daddy just lost his pay  
What did he do it for  
It never made it through our door  
He drank the whole week away  
And what can a family say  
There must be a better way  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try  
  
Pick up the telephone  
Tell him you want him home  
To sit and watch the evenings pass  
And readin' the leaves of grass  
  
I'm caught in a closing door  
It's pinning me to the floor  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try  
  
I'm caught in a closing door  
It's pinning me to the floor  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try  
  
When we're old and gray  
And the things we say are the things we really mean  
So why cause a scene  
When things ain't what they seem  
'cause the end result's the same  
Now what can a family say  
There must be a better way  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try
