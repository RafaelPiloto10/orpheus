I'm lost for words which is strange for me  
Stretched out like elastic bands  
I'm lost for words and no longer see  
Why they've slipped right through my hands  
What a lunch you made  
With a stew so thick  
That I was afraid  
I might chew a brick  
Then I talked to you  
With my flapping tongue  
Choking on my words  
  
I'm lost for words in the letters I write  
Smudged with a bleeding pen  
I'm lost for words that I never liked  
But I want to use my  
Abandoned words which is strange for me  
Stretched out like elastic bands  
I'm lost for words and no longer see  
Why they've slipped right through my hands
