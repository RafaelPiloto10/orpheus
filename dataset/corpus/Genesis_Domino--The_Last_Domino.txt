In silence and darkness  
We held each other near that night  
We prayed it would last forever  
  
Blood on the windows  
Millions of ordinary people are there  
They gaze at the scenery  
They act as if it is perfectly clear  
Take a look at the mountains  
Take a look at the beautiful river of blood  
  
The liquid surrounds me  
I fight to rise from this river of hell  
I stare round about me  
Children are swimming  
And playing with their boats  
Their features are changing  
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone  
  
Now see what you've gone and done  
Now see what you've gone and done  
  
Now you never did see  
Such a terrible thing  
That was showed last night on the tv  
Maybe if were lucky  
They will show it again  
Such a terrible thing to see  
  
There's nothing you can do  
When you're next in line  
You've got to go domino  
  
Now I'm one with the living  
And I'm feeling just fine  
I know what I must do  
Play the game of happiness  
And never let on  
That it only lives in a song  
  
There's nothing you can do  
When you're next in line  
You've got to go domino  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what you've begun  
  
In silence and darkness  
Hold each other near tonight  
For will it last forever  
  
There's nothing you can do  
When you're next in line  
You've got to go domino
