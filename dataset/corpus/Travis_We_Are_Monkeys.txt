People think they're funny when they haven't the wit  
Others think they're gorgeous but inside they feel shit  
Many think they're brainy but they haven't a clue  
And I think I'm clever 'cause I'm singing this to you  
  
[Chorus]  
We are wrong, we are wrong  
We are all so, so wrong  
We are monkeys  
We are false, we run true  
We should be in the zoo with our uncles  
And if you don't believe  
Go and climb up a tree and you'll love it  
You're a fool to believe anymore  
So believe you're a monkey  
  
All the clever monkeys telling us what to do  
Telling us to stay in line and join the monkey queue  
Thinking that they're special cause they went to private zoo  
One day soon they're gonna end up in a monkey stew  
  
[Chorus]
