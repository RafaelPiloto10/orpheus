Verse 1: Here I am  
Down on my knees again  
Surrendering all  
Surrendering all  
Find me here  
Lord as you draw me near  
I'm desperate for you  
I'm desperate for you  
I surrender  
  
Drench my soul  
As mercy and grace unfold  
I hunger and thirst  
I hunger and thirst  
With arms stretched wide  
I know you hear my cry  
Speak to me now  
Speak to me now  
  
Chorus: I surrender  
I surrender  
I want to know you more  
I want to know you more  
(beat interlude)  
  
Bridge: Like a rushing wind  
Jesus breathe within  
Lord have your way  
Lord have your way in me  
Like a mighty storm  
Stir within my soul  
Lord have your way  
Lord have your way in me  
  
I surrender  
I surrender  
I want to know you more  
I want to know you more
