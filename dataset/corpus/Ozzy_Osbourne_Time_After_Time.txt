Time after time  
I guess that love is blind  
I couldn't read your mind  
Line after line  
Line after line  
It was written in your eyes  
I guess it's no surprise  
Time after time  
I can hear them whispering  
Shadows in the rain  
Thinking how it might have been  
Time after time  
Line after line, you broke me  
Day after day  
I watched love fade away  
I wanted love to stay  
Day after day  
The games we play  
The foolish things we say  
The pain won't go away  
Day after day  
Candlelight are shimmering  
Shadows on the wall  
Thinking how it might have been
