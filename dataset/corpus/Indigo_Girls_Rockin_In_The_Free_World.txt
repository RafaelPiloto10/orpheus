Theres colors on the street  
Red white and blue  
People shuffling their feet  
People sleeping in their shoes  
Theres a warning sign on the road ahead  
Theres a lot of people saying wed be better off dead  
Don't feel like saton but I am to them  
So I try to forget it any way I can  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
  
I see a woman in the night  
With a baby in her hands  
Under an old street light  
Next to a garbage can  
And she puts the kid away  
Cause she wants to get a hit  
She hates her life  
And what shes done to it  
One more kid that will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
  
We got a thousand points of light  
For the homeless man  
A kinder gentler machine gun hand  
We got department stores and toliet paper  
Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer  
The man in power says to keep our hope alive  
Fuel to burn roads to drive  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world
