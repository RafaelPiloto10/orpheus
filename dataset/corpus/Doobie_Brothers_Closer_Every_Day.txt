Patrick Simmons  
I just looked in the mirror, was that me  
I'm older now than I used to be  
The sky above me, lord, it's turnin' red  
There's a hard rain fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
  
The road I'm standin' on, it twists and turns  
The soles of my feet, lord, they're 'bout to burn  
The reaper beckons, and he points the way  
Oh, lord, I'm gettin' closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day
