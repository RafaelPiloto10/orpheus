Charlene-2: When a dictator gets deposed,  
And then he's thrown into the DOC...  
Doofenshmirtz-2: Oy vey!  
Charlene-2: His wife is thrown in right beside him  
Under key and lock.  
So to avoid a situation  
With such limited appeal...  
Doofenshmirtz-2: Me and Mrs. Doofenshmirtz,  
We struck a little deal.  
  
Charlene-2: We told everyone around us  
We had split.  
Doofenshmirtz-2: Yes, we were through!  
So, if they came to haul me off,  
They wouldn't get her, too.  
Charlene-2: There's that and then there's also tax  
Advantages, of course.  
Doofenshmirtz-2 and Charlene-2: All the convoluted reasons  
We pretend to be divorced.  
  
We get double the amount  
Of discount coupons in the mail.  
We have twice the junk to offer  
In our annual yard sale.  
We each have our separate bathrooms,  
Bedrooms, living rooms, and dens,  
We see each other all the time  
But through a telescopic lens.  
  
Charlene-2: We don't agree on restaurants  
Or where to holiday.  
Doofenshmirtz-2: But now for those activities  
We go our separate ways.  
Doofenshmirtz-2 and Charlene-2: We spend so little time together,  
Conversation's never forced.  
All the convoluted reasons  
We pretend to be divorced.
