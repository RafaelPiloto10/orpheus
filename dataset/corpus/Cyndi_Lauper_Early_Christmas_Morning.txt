Listen to the children sing  
Watch them dancing all 'round the Christmas tree ...  
Waiting for the opening  
Early Christmas morning ...  
  
All around the world is sleeping  
Little children there's no peeping  
Wait and see what Santa's bringing  
Early Christmas morning ...  
  
Icicles and breakfast cakes ...  
Friends and family we will celebrate  
Sounds that joy and laughter make  
Early Christmas morning ...  
  
All around and far off places  
Angels waken smiling faces  
Wrapping us with love and graces  
Early Christmas morning ...  
Early Christmas morning ...
