Hey, hey, hey  
La, la, la, la, la  
Hey, hey, hey  
La, la, la, la, la  
  
You come from here  
I come from there  
  
You rock out in your room  
I rock a world premiere  
  
We're more alike than  
Anybody could ever tell  
(Ever tell)  
  
Friday, we're cool  
Monday, we're freaks  
  
Sometimes we rule  
Sometimes we can't even speak  
  
But we can kick it up and  
Let loose and l-o-l (l-o-l)  
  
It may seem cliche  
For me to wanna say  
That you're not alone  
  
And you can call me uncool  
But it's a simple fact  
I got your back  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
'Cause we're one and the same  
We're something more than ordinary  
One and the same  
I think we're almost legendary  
You and me the perfect team  
Chasing down the dream  
We're one and the same  
Hey, hey, hey  
La,la,la,la,la  
  
I'm kind of like you  
You're kind of like me  
  
We write the same song  
In a different key  
  
It's got a rhythm  
You and me  
Can get along  
(Get along)  
  
And it may seem cliche  
For me to wanna say  
That you're not alone  
  
And you can call me uncool  
But it's a simple fact  
I still got your back  
  
'Cause we're one and the same  
We're anything but ordinary  
One and the same  
I think we're almost legendary  
You and me the perfect team  
Shaking up the scene  
We're one and the same  
  
'Cause we're one and the same  
We're anything but ordinary  
One and the same  
We're something more than momentary  
  
'Cause we're one  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
'Cause we're one  
I think we're almost legendary  
We're anything but ordinary  
You and me the perfect team  
Chasing down the dream  
Oh, you and me the perfect team  
Shaking up the scene  
We're one and the same  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
La, la, la, la, la  
Hey, hey, hey
