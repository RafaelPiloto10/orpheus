You can be my alphabet  
And I will be your calculator  
And together we'll work out on the escalator  
  
I will time you as you run up to down  
And you will measure my footsteps as I pleasure this town  
The mean of our heights is divided by the  
Nights  
Which is timed by the daggers in the root of all our fights  
  
The pass of your poem is to sway me in your knowing  
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it  
  
(Chorus:)  
Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your
love.  
  
I am a dash and you are a dot, when will you see that I am all that you've
got?  
  
I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago, but to you I'm just a novel that
you wish you never wrote  
  
I'm greater than x, and lesser than y  
  
So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?  
  
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard  
While I'm sitting here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt  
  
(chorus)  
  
You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion  
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?  
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs  
It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again  
  
And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one  
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one  
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one  
And if I'm four words then I am needing of your love.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia  
Oooh Academia, Academia, Academia
