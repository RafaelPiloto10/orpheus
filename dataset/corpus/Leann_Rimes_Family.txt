Mama's crying again, her baby's nowhere to be found  
The world has gone taken her away  
Daddy went and ran off with some white trash half his age  
Left me at home to pay for his mistakes  
My sister held my hand when that bad boy broke my heart  
Ain't no miles ain't no man could ever tear us apart  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now here I stand on roots that deep  
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed  
We're best of friends and worst enemies  
We're all to blame, we're all the same  
Make no apologies  
This is my family  
  
I can't forget the night that Uncle William passed away  
We were forced to recognize his weird disease  
I ran away and ran around with a man twice my age  
Ain't it funny how some things never change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you try to shame my name  
'Cause 'till the death I will defend  
Yeah this blood runs through my veins  
It's where I start and where I'll end  
Now here I stand on roots that deep  
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed  
We're best of friends and worst enemies  
We're all to blame, we're all the same  
Make no apologies  
This is my family
