I can do what I want  
I'm in complete control  
That's what I tell myself  
I gotta a mind of my own  
I'll be alright alone  
Don't need anybody else  
I gave myself a good talking to  
No more bein' a fool for you  
But I see ya  
And all I remember  
How you make me want to surrender  
Damn your eyes  
For taking my breath away  
Makin' me want to stay  
Damn your eyes  
For gettin' my hopes up high  
Making me fall in love again  
Damn your eyes  
It's always the same  
You say that you'll change  
Somehow you never do  
I believe all your lies  
The look in your eyes  
You make it all seem true  
I guess I see what I want to see  
Or is it my heart just deceivin' me?  
Because with that look I know so well  
I fall completely under your spell  
Damn your eyes  
For takin' my breath away  
For makin' me want to stay  
Damn your eyes  
For gettin' my hopes up high  
For makin' me fall in love again  
Damn your eyes  
You keep deliberately deceivin' me  
Makin' me see what I want to see  
Damn your eyes  
For takin' my breath away, hey  
For makin' me want to stay  
Damn your eyes  
For getting'my hopes up high  
For making me fall in love again  
Damn your eyes  
Damn your eyes  
For taking my breath away  
Damn damn your eyes  
For getting my hopes up high  
For making me fall in love  
Fall in love again  
Damn damn your eyes
