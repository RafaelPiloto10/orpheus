As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may  
Just as hate knows love's the cure  
You can rest your mind assure  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow  
But in passing will grow older every day  
Just as all that's born is new  
You know what I say is true  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)  
Always  
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)  
Always  
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)  
Always  
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing  
No no her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day  
  
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning  
And the seasons know exactly when to change  
Just as kindness knows no shame  
Know through all your joy and pain  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As today I know I'm living  
But tomorrow could make me the past  
But that I mustn't fear  
For I'll know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)  
Always  
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)  
Always  
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)  
Always  
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)  
Did you know you're loved by somebody  
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)  
Always  
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)  
I'll be lovin' you forever  
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)  
Always  
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)  
Always  
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)  
Always mm mm  
  
We all know sometimes life hates and troubles  
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space  
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double  
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed  
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it  
You're not helpin' to make this earth  
A place sometimes called hell  
Change your words into truths  
And then change that truth into love  
And maybe our children's grandchildren  
And their great grandchildren will tell  
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
