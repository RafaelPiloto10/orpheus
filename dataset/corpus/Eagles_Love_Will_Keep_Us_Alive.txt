I was standing  
Alone against the world outside  
You were searching  
For a place to hide  
  
Lost and lonely  
Now you've given me the will to survive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
  
Don't you worry  
Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride  
The world is changing  
Right before your eyes  
Now I've found you  
There's no more emptiness inside  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
  
I would die for you  
Climb the highest mountain  
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do  
  
I was standing  
Alone against the world outside  
You were searching  
For a place to hide  
Lost and lonely  
Now you've given me the will to survive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive  
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive
