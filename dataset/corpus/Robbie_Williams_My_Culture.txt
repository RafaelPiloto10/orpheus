I'm the sub-total of my ancestors  
I carry their DNA  
We are representatives of a long line of people  
And we carried them around either with  
This long line of people  
That goes back to the beginning of time  
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people  
And we say bring together the lines of me  
  
When I look back over the years  
At the things that brought tears to my eyes  
Papa said we have to be wise  
To live long lives  
Now I recognize  
What my father said before he dies  
Vocalize things I've left unsaid  
Left my spirit unfed for too long  
I'm coming home to my family  
Where I can be strong  
Be who I planned to be  
Within me my ancestry  
Givin' me continuity  
  
Would it be remiss to continue in this way  
Would you rather I quit  
Come with that other shit  
Making people's hips sway  
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous  
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep  
Like a lifeline, I light lines  
'Cause my compassion is deep  
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep  
And this is who I happen to be  
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be  
  
This is what my Daddy told me  
I wished he would hold me  
A little more  
Than he did  
But he taught me my culture  
And how to live positive  
I never want to shame  
The blood in my veins and bring pain  
to my sweet grandfathers face  
In his resting place  
I made haste to learn and not waste  
everything my forefathers earned in tears  
For my culture  
  
Fall back again  
Crawl from the warm water  
(For my culture)  
Water to air  
You're on your feet again  
Your feet again.  
  
Hello Dad,  
Remember me?  
I'm the man you thought I'd never be.  
I'm the boy who you  
Reduced to tears  
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years  
Yeah, that's right  
My name Rob  
I'm the one  
Who landed the popstar's job  
I'm the one who  
You told look, don't touch  
I'm the kid  
Who wouldn't amount too much.  
  
I believe in the senses that I sound  
I have always been too loud  
Won't you help me drown it out?  
And When I feel  
What I'm feeling is so real  
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel  
Always digging in my heels  
Now I got the faith to  
  
Fall back again  
Crawl from the warm water  
Water to air  
You're on your feet again  
Your feet again.  
  
Ha, lace up your booty  
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude  
Feed freakin' for loot  
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now  
And your forefathers further know how  
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred  
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread  
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best  
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth  
  
This is what my Daddy told me  
I wished he would hold me  
A little more  
than he did  
But he told me my culture  
And how to live positive  
I never want to shame  
The blood in my veins and bring pain  
To my sweet grandfathers face  
in his resting place  
I make haste to learn and not waste  
everything my forefathers earned in tears  
For my culture  
  
Fall back again  
Crawl from the warm water  
Water to air  
You're on your feet again  
Your feet again  
(For my culture)  
  
Fall back again  
Crawl from the warm water  
Water to air  
Your on your feet again  
Your feet again  
(For my culture)
