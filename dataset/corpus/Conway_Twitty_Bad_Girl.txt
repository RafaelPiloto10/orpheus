She's not a bad girl she's just a sad girl  
Please don't blame her for what she's done to me  
I know it doesn't look too good for her  
And I suppose she's done the things you say  
And I guess it's true I tried more than I should for her  
But it's not her fault that she turned out that way  
She's not a bad girl...  
[ guitar - steel ]  
Once she was the kind of girl you'd have her be  
But I was foolish then and didn't care  
The first of us to ever slip around was me  
And to place the blame on her just isn't fair  
She's not a bad girl...  
Please don't blame her for what she's done to me
