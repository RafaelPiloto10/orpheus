We come to your mountain  
The hill of the Lord we would ascend  
And journey into your holy place  
To feast in your presence  
And bring our devotions to you, God  
We come as a kingdom of your priests  
  
To minister at your holy throne  
Where thousands of angels joyfully sing  
  
We're climbing up the mountain of the Lord  
Towards your holy place  
And every step is praise  
Encountering the glory of your name  
Your throne of holiness  
The wonders of your grace  
  
Come, come let us worship  
Come let us recognize what a sacred thing we do  
Come, let us bow down  
God, as we bring our hearts  
Let them please the heart of you  
We enter your santuary
