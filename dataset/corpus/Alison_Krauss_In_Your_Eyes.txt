In your eyes, I see gentle rain  
Springtime comes, in love again  
Puts me back on my feet again  
And in your eyes, I feel no pain  
and in my mind, I saw love walk past  
A lovers dream within my grasp  
I never knew I could fall so fast  
But in your eyes I found love at last  
I found your love waiting at my door,  
I found a dream come true  
I've never known a love like this before  
And if you take me there, I'll be waiting for you  
I found your love waiting at my door,  
I found a dream come true  
I've never known a love like this before  
And if you take me there, I'll be waiting for you  
In your eyes, I see gentle light  
It gives me hope, it gives me life  
It gives me love when I hold you tight  
And in your eyes I found love tonight  
And in your eyes I found love tonight
