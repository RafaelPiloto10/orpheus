You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love,  
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.  
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony,  
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.  
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.  
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.  
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.  
Oo love me.  
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly  
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.  
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within,  
Don't let this feeling end,  
Let it go on and on and on now baby.  
  
Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes,  
I care not for myself but for those  
Who've never felt the joy we've felt.  
Whenever you are near,  
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me  
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love.  
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me  
Whispering how much you care,  
A thousand violins fill the air now.  
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end,  
Keep standing close to me,  
Oo so close to me, baby, baby.  
  
Baby, baby, I Hear A Symphony, a tender melody.  
Ah it goes on and on and on and on and  
on and on and on and on and  
on and on and on and on and
