I guess you think  
That if you snap your fingers  
I'll forget  
I'm supposed to jump for joy  
'Cause you say you regret  
Being so bad  
Don't go away mad  
Now just go away  
  
Remember how you told me  
You had some new interest  
And with out a fuss  
You dropped me  
As if I was just yesterday's fad  
Don't go away mad  
Now just go away  
  
You talked to me  
One day feel like coal  
You once used me  
While you played the field  
I played the fool  
  
So forgive me if I doubt you  
When you say you need me  
I'll get over thinkin' bout you  
And of everything we might have had  
Don't go away mad  
Now please go away  
Before I ask you to stay
