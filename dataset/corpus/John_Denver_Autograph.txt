Here I am closing my eyes again  
Tryin' so hard not to see all the things that I see  
Almost willing to lie again  
I swear that it just isn't so, it just isn't me  
We are never alone, even though we'd like to be  
Then I go and open my eyes again  
Love in your eyes is the thing that I'd most like to see  
I'd be willing to die again  
to know of a place and a time that it always will be  
  
Chorus: This is my autograph  
Here in the songs that I sing  
Here in My cry and my laugh  
Here in the love that I bring  
To be always with you  
And you always with me  
  
Say a prayer and open your heart again  
you are the ove and the light that we all need to see  
always willin' to shine and then  
Peace on this Earth is the way that it always can be  
  
Chorus
