I ran into your best friend today  
Twelve nights since you ran away  
I asked about you and she said, can't say, can't say  
I'm feeling lonely and it seems to stay  
It's been a while since I felt that way  
Well, I can tell you there's no room to play this game  
  
All I know is what I'm missing  
What I'm missing is your kissing  
Are you listening?  
  
Don't go, don't go telling me you're all right  
There's no room for getting uptight  
Don't go saying that you're okay  
When you're lonely  
Baby, don't go telling me we're over  
When you know you're my one and only lover  
And I won't go saying that we're okay when we're  
Lost without each other  
'Cause we're lost without each other  
'Cause we're lost without each other  
  
I didn't mean to start the last big fight  
You never should have hung up that night  
All I want to do is make things right  
Make it right  
Listen, with all the choices that we chose to make  
And all the promises we chose to break  
We were busy making big mistakes yesterday  
  
All I know is what I'm missing  
What I'm missing is your kissing  
Are you listening?  
  
Don't go, don't go telling me you're all right  
There's no room for getting uptight  
Don't go saying that you're okay  
When you're lonely  
Baby, don't go telling me we're over  
When you know you're my one and only lover  
And I won't go saying that we're okay when we're  
Lost without  
  
I can tell you one thing  
We're not better on our own  
I'm tired of running from my feelings  
Are you listening?  
  
All I know is what I'm missing  
What I'm missing is your kissing  
Are you listening?  
  
Don't go, don't go telling me you're all right  
There's no room for getting uptight  
Don't go saying that you're okay  
When you're lonely  
Baby, don't go telling me we're over  
When you know you're my one and only lover  
And I won't go saying that we're okay when we're  
Lost without each other  
Lost without each other
