We're building fires that will burn until morning  
The smell of books and hot stone surrounds us  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we make  
We feel the steam as it rises around us  
Up from the soil that is cracking its back  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we sing  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
We're building fires that will burn until morning  
The smell of books and hot stone surrounds us  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we make  
To feel the pulsing from chanter to mountain  
Down through the vein and into the grain  
Strong is the shoulder that moves to the time  
Here is the land it can break  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we sing  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long
