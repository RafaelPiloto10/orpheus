Take your medication, Roman  
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay  
You need to know your station, Roman  
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain  
Take a little break, little break from your silencing  
There is so much you can take, you can take  
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday, Roman holiday, a Roman holiday  
  
You done, you tired? You suck at life?  
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice  
Worship the queen and you might get passed  
Keep it real, these bitches couldn't wipe my ass  
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari  
I am the ultimate Svengali  
These bitches can't even spell that  
You, you hoes buggin', repel that  
Let me tell you this, sister  
I am, I am colder than a blister  
Cause my flow's so sick and I'm a lunatic  
And this can't be cured with no Elixir  
Cause y'all know who the fuck, what the fuck I do  
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew  
Quack quack to a duck and a chicken too  
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo

This right here is gonna make a bitch die  
And this right here is gonna make a bitch cry  
And if we being honest I am such a great guy  
And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock  
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under  
No them bitches ain't eating, they dying of hunger  
Motherfucka I'm me, who the fuck is this ho?  
And yes, maybe just a touch of tourettes  
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my barrettes
