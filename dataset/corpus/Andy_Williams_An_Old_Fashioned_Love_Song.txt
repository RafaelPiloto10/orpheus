Just an old fashioned love song  
Playin' on the radio  
And wrapped around the music  
Is the sound of someone  
Promising they'll never go  
You'll swear you've heard it before  
As it slowly rambles on and on  
No need in bringing 'em back  
'Cause they've never really gone  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me  
  
To weave our dreams upon  
And listen to each evening  
When the lights are low  
To underscore our love affair  
With tenderness and feelings  
That we've come to know  
You'll swear you've heard it before  
As it slowly rambles on and on  
No need in bringin' 'em back  
'Cause they've never really gone  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me  
  
Hit it!  
Wooh! Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me  
  
Just an old fashioned love song  
Comin' down in three part harmony  
Just an old fashioned love song  
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me (fade)
