J. Bon jovi  
  
You said you loved to watch me sleep  
You put your head down on my chest  
To hear my breath  
  
Go on, take my last breath from me  
I don't want to live no more  
And cut my eyes so I can't see  
I can't see you looking back as you walk out the door  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
I was a lover lost in sea  
You found me washed up on the beach  
You took me home, you gave me breakfast  
I said Id offer you protection, but you didn't charge a fee  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
Cold, cold heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
What are you hiding underneath that shirt  
If youre the one to run babe  
Then you don't feel the hurt  
  
Her hair so brown, and eyes so green  
You used to say I made good company  
Shed bring me wine and sip her tea  
Then youd give yourself what you could give to me  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
Cold, cold heart  
Your cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
Whats it gonna take
