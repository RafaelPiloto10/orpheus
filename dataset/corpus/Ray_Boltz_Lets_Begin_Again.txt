I can still remember  
When we said our wedding vows  
We gave the Lord our hearts and our home  
But lately we've been so busy  
It's changing us somehow  
I wonder if that's why we feel alone  
Chorus:  
Let's begin again  
Trust in Him and not our feelings  
Let's leave the loneliness behind  
Take my hand and then  
We can find a new beginning  
Let's begin again  
While there's still time  
Jesus made a promise  
If two of us agree  
The Father up above would hear our prayer  
He is still the healer  
Of hurting families  
And there is hope as long as He is there  
Repeat chorus twice
