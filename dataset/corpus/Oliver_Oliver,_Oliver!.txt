(Mr. Bumble) Oliver, Oliver  
Never before has a boy wanted more  
Oliver, Oliver  
Won't ask for more when he knows what's in store  
There's a dark, thin winding stairway without any banister  
Which we'll throw him down  
And feed him the cockroaches served in a canister  
  
Oliver, Oliver  
What will he do when he's turned black and blue  
He will rue the day somebody named him Ol-i-ver  
  
(Both) Oliver, Oliver  
Never before has a boy wanted more  
Oliver, Oliver  
Won't ask for more when he knows what's in store  
There's a long, thin winding stairway without any banister  
Which we'll throw him down  
And feed him the cockroaches served in a canister  
  
(Widow Corney) Oliver, Oliver  
What heavens pray will the govenors say  
  
(Widow Corney) They will lay the blame on the one who named him  
  
(Mr. Bumbble) Ol-i-ver
