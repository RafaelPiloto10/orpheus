Waiting in the wings your courage sings  
Before you falter  
It's just another way to say  
What's there but never shows  
  
It's just another day to lay  
Your sins before the altar  
And where it's going to end  
This time around nobody knows  
  
Every time it seems  
That you have gained an understanding  
Those devils at your heels  
Reach up and try to tip the scales  
  
Waking from a dream  
You see it's all been  
Done without you  
And every vain attempt to make it stay  
Is destined to fail  
  
Fury rages through your restless days  
Shades of time that's gone before  
Empty cages where the prisoner plays  
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore  
  
Evermore  
Evermore  
  
Long before we come of age  
We yearn to leave the garden  
And wrestle with a myth  
The hand of fate has faintly drawn  
  
But somewhere on the way  
We feel our hearts begin to harden  
And see just as we learn to turn around  
The garden is gone  
  
Fury rages through your restless days  
Shades of time that's gone before  
Empty cages where the prisoner plays  
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore  
  
Evermore  
Evermore
