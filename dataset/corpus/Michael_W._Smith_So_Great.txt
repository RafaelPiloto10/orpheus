Young and old, rich and poor  
Weak and strong, everyone  
Come and rest, you are safe  
In the arms of Jesus  
  
For He is good  
For He is faithful  
  
So great, so great  
And Your love endures forever  
To the end of the age  
Oh, Your love endures forevermore  
  
Beautiful majesty  
Glorious, Holy One  
Rugged cross, sovereign grace  
Oh, the blood of Jesus  
  
For He is good  
For He is faithful  
  
So great, so great  
And Your love endures forever  
To the end of the age  
Oh, Your love endures forever  
  
So great, so great  
And Your love endures forever  
To the end of the age  
Oh, Your love endures forevermore  
  
To the end of the age  
Oh, Your love endures forever  
Oh, Your love endures forever  
Oh, Your love endures forevermore  
  
Your love endures forever  
Your love endures forever  
You are good, You are faithful  
Your love endures forever  
Your love endures forever  
Forever and ever
