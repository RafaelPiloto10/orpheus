Baby, I'll be there  
To lift you up  
I'll dry your eyes  
Oh, when you cry  
When you're alone  
And nobody's there to take you through the night  
Oh, when nothing's right  
Call out my name  
Oh, don't be ashamed to say you need a hand  
I understand, baby  
  
Sometimes the night can be so dark and cold  
No one beside you  
And no one to hold  
Hold on, hold on  
  
When you cry  
I will dry your eyes  
When you fall  
I'll lift you up high  
You just reach  
For these arms of mine  
I promise they won't let you go  
And I'll make you smile  
When you cry  
  
You're always strong  
Always got a hand to lend to someone else  
Don't need no one else  
What about those times  
When that heart inside is crying out for love  
For someone, baby  
  
Someone to lean on when the tears start to fall  
Lean on me I'll see you through it all  
Just hold on, hold on  
  
When you cry  
I will dry your eyes  
When you fall  
I'll lift you up high  
You just reach  
For these arms of mine  
I promise they won't let you go  
And I'll make you smile  
When you cry  
  
Hold on to me  
When you're not feeling strong  
Hold on, baby, hold on  
  
When you cry  
I will dry your eyes  
When you fall  
I'll lift you up high  
You just reach  
For these arms of mine, baby  
I promise they won't let you go  
When you cry  
  
When you cry  
When you cry  
Oh, baby  
Yeah
