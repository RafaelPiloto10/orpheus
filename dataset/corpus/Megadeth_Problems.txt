Too many problems, oh why am I here?  
I need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear  
And I can see there's something wrong with you  
Oh, what do you expect me to do?  
At least I gotta know what I want to be  
Don't come to me if you need pity  
Are you lonely, you got no-one  
You got your body in suspension  
That's a problem, problem, problem  
The problem is you  
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray  
You don't do what you want and you fade away  
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five  
It's too much fun of being alive  
I'm using my feet for my human machine  
You work for me, living for the screen  
Are you lonely, all needs catered  
You got your brains dehydrated  
  
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you  
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem  
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you  
Well, what you gonna do with your problem  
The problem is you, problem  
  
I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic  
You work for me, just stay ecstatic  
Don't you give me any orders  
To people like me, there is no order  
  
Bet you thought you had it all worked out  
Bet you thought you knew what I was about  
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems  
But you are the problem  
  
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you  
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?  
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem  
The problem is you, you got a problem  
Oh what you gonna do?  
They know a doctor, gonna take you away  
They take you away and they throw away the key  
They don't want you and they don't want me  
You got a problem the problem is you  
Problem, well, what you gonna do?  
Problem, have you got a problem?  
Problem, well you got a problem  
  
[Repeat: x17]  
Problem
