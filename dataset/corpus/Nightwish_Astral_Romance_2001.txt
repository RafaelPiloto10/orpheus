A nocturnal concerto  
Candlelight whispers me where to go  
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide  
As I wander on this path of the night  
  
Embroidery of the stars  
Undress my feelings for this earth  
Send me your salva to heal my scars  
And let this nakedness me my birth  
  
Macrocosm poured its powers on me  
And the hopes of this world I now must leave  
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago  
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe  
  
The distance of our bridal bed  
Await for me to be dead  
Dust of the galaxies take my hand  
Lead me to my beloved's land  
  
The constant longing for your touch  
This bitter ocean of hatred and pain  
This loneliness I need to be who I am  
  
The oceans are alone as I  
Somebody take away this gift of mine  
No charisma for the beast! But still I love you forevermore  
  
Come to me  
Deliver me from you  
And from all the days of the Earth  
  
No last words to say  
Only memories remain  
A farewell then, my path goes forever
