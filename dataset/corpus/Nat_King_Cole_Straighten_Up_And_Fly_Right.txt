The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air  
The monkey thought that everything was on the square  
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back  
The monkey grabbed his neck and said "now listen, jack"  
  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
"ain't no use in jivin' "  
"what's the use in dabbin' "  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
  
The buzzard told the monkey "you're chokin' me"  
"release your hold and I'll set you free"  
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said  
"your story's fetchin' but it sounds like a lie"  
  
"straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
  
"straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."
