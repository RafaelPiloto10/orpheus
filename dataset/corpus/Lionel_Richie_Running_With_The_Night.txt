The heart of the city street was beating  
Light from the neons turned the dark to day  
We were too hot to think of sleeping  
We had to get out before the magic got away  
  
[Chorus]  
We were running with the night  
Playing in the shadows  
Just you and I, 'til the morning light  
(We were running, running with the night)  
  
You were looking so good girl, heads were turning  
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out  
The fire was in us, we were burning  
We were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
We were so in love you and me  
On the boulevard wild and free  
Giving all we got, we laid it down  
Taking every shot, we took the town  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just you and I (we were running)  
We were running with the night  
Playing in the shadows  
Just you and I, girl it was so right (We were running)  
Girl so right (running with the night)  
So right
