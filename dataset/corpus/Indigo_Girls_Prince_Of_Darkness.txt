My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark  
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark  
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark  
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark  
  
I don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense  
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence  
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve  
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave  
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar  
And he gave it a ten dollar raise  
And when I needed my mother and I called her  
She stayed with me for days  
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain  
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine  
Someones got his finger on the button in some room  
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom  
But I tried to make this place my place  
I asked for providence to smile upon me with his sweet face  
Yeah but Ill tell you  
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark  
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark  
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark  
(By grace, my sight grows stronger)  
And I do not feel the romance I will not be  
(And I will not be a pawn for the prince of darkness any longer)  
  
Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age  
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage  
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve  
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve  
Oh the cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing  
I couldn't hear them for the thunder  
I was half the naked distance between hell and heavens ceiling  
And he almost pulled me under  
Now someones on the telephone, desperate in his pain  
Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine  
Someones got his finger on the button in some room  
No one can convince me we aren't gluttons for our doom  
But I tried to make this place my place  
I asked for providence to smile upon me with his sweet face  
But Ill tell you  
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark  
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark  
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark  
(By grace, my sight grows stronger)  
And I do not feel the romance I do not catch the spark  
(Grows stronger)  
By grace  
(My place is of the sun)  
My sight  
(And this place is of the dark)  
Is growing stronger  
(I do not feel the romance)  
I will not be a pawn  
(I will not be)  
For the prince of darkness any longer
