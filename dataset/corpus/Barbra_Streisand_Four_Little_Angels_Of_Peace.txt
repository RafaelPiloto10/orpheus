Performed by barbra streisand  
Four little angels of peace are we  
Loving our neighbors so peacefully  
There's really no harm if we do not disarm  
For we always in close harmony  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
With fall or with friend  
We will fight to the end  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Though we butchered the boss  
And I've own made the choice  
And slaughter the irish no end  
Though I'm injured and poor  
Slaying hoard upon hoard  
We're but playing the part of a friend  
Yes, our arms we ain't twist  
But we'll be elected for peace  
Except in the case of the crook  
We conquered both spears  
Now we're up to our ears  
Just trying to keep what we took  
Three little angels of peace are we  
Living together so blissfully  
Oh, we never fight unless  
We're on the right  
But we're always in the right, you see?  
Three little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
Until we are wrecks  
We'll break each other's necks  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
In japan we've the right  
In a generous night  
But the emperor knows peace is finer  
It isn't our fault it's a case of absurd  
We're picked down and buried by china  
Oh, how we're deplored  
I glad did it for the world  
We're a nation of poets and thinkers  
Also, though we bound without pity  
And lay west to his city  
It's because all the chinese are stinkers  
Two little angels of peace are we  
Living together in amity  
We'll sign any pack saying we won't attack  
But it's just a mere formality  
Two little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We try to keep calm  
When we gas, we bump  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Now I know that our war  
Is a thing to have horror  
And that peaceful fill out  
When we hope we have  
With our love from the start  
I atrocious did all my part  
To civilize nearly the hope we have  
Though you call me sadistic  
Imperialistic  
My armies required a quarry  
And though we may slave  
What's a splendid day today  
After all that we'll say that we're sorry  
Though I fall for the urge  
Of a nice bloody purge  
And living my way I was carrying on  
Though I clean up my schmutz  
Would I hear nazi putz  
It is all for the sake of the aryan  
My ambitions are small  
I want nothing at all  
My plans wouldn't be any littler  
Now that austria's nazi  
It will be hazy-gazy  
To put the whole world under hitler  
Four little angels of peace are we  
Drinking with older of saintity  
Though we slaughter the meek  
We confirm every week  
And we talk it over peacefully  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We'll shout and we'll shell  
We'll get each other's hell  
Just for peace, peace, peace...
