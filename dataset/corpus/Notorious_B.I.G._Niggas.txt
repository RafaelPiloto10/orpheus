Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick  
and kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get  
with the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees  
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's  
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots  
on the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you  
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos  
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose  
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox  
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks  
Just in case a nigga wanna act out  
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out  
That's a real nigga for ya

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths  
just in case dread wanna riff  
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very  
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried  
That's a real nigga for ya  
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer  
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say  
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway  
Up North found first stop for the town  
of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill  
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover  
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the ruler

Money hoes and clothes  
Blunt smoke comin out the nose, is all a nigga knows  
Flippin on foes, puttin tags on toes  
Watchin the stash grow, clockin the cashflow  
The neighborhood gravedigga  
Gettin paid so much, all the bitches wanna see a nigga  
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid  
or since I got loot I wanna knock boots  
I'd rather beat my dick than trick  
and if she don't suck then we don't fuck  
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck  
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck  
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes  
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?  
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy  
from Bed-Stuy, puttin the swellin on your eye  
and your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin  
And when Jake come, I'm leavin!
