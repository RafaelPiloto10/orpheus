Well, it's knowin' that your door is always open  
And your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up  
Stashed behind your couch  
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or somethin' that somebody said 'cause  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards  
And the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
I dip my cup of soup  
From some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard  
My beard a roughenin' coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're wavin' from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind
