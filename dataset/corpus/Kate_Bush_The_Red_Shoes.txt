Oh she move like the Diva do  
I said "I'd love to dance like you"  
She said "just take off my red shoes  
Put them on and your dream'll come true  
With no words, with no song  
You can dance the dream with your body on  
And this curve, is your smile  
And this cross, is your heart  
And this line, is your path  
  
Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be  
But it's gonna be no illusion  
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it  
But it's gonna be really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya"  
  
Oh the minute I put them on  
I knew I had done something wrong  
All her gifts for the dance had gone  
It's the red shoes, they can't stop dancing  
And this curve, is your smile  
And this cross, is your heart  
And this line, is your path  
  
"Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be  
But it's gonna be no illusion  
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it  
But it's gonna be really happening to ya"  
  
She gotta dance, she gotta dance  
And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off  
These shoes do, a kind of voodoo  
They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off  
  
Feel your hair come tumbling down  
Feel your feet start kissing the ground  
Feel your arms are opening out  
And see your eyes are lifted to God  
With no words, with no song  
I'm gonna dance the dream  
And make the dream come true  
I'm gonna dance the dream  
And make the dream come true  
  
She gotta dance, she gotta dance  
And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off  
These shoes do, a kind of voodoo  
They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off  
Call a doctor, call a priest  
They're gonna whip her up like a helicopter  
  
Really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
  
You gotta dance
