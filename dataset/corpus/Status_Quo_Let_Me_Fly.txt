  
I've been so lonely  
I can't find anyway  
So long since I lost my way  
I've got a feeling  
You're gonna run away one day  
Why does it always seem to be me  
  
Chorus:  
So let me fly  
Let me fly like a bird in the sky  
Let me fly-y-y away  
I wanna climb really high  
All the time in the sky  
Wanna stay up there all the day  
So let me fly  
Let me fly like a bird in the sky  
Let me fly  
Getting away  
So after today  
Let me fly away  
  
You say you're alright  
You don't care anyway  
I'm listening you're trying to say  
You think I'm crazy  
You're thinking you got everything right  
But you're fooling no one else but yourself  
  
Chorus:  
  
If you get lonely  
And can't get along by yourself  
If you're finding  
You're needing me  
Don't wait forever  
For to come a following you  
I'll wait here you come back by yourself  
  
And we can fly  
We can fly like a bird in the sky  
We can fly-y-y away  
We wanna climb really high  
All the time in the sky  
Wanna stay up there all the day  
So let me fly  
Let me fly like a bird in the sky  
Let me fly  
Getting away  
So after today  
Let me fly fly fly away
