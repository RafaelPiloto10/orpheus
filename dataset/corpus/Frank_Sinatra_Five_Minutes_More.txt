Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more  
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms  
  
Here am I, begging for only five minutes more  
Only five minutes more of your charms  
  
All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date  
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late  
  
Give me five minutes more (Here am I begging for), only five minutes more  
(Let me stay, let me stay)  
Let me stay, let me stay (stay) in your arms
