Well it's 1969, okay  
All across the U.S.A.  
It's another year for me and you  
Another year with nothing to do  
Well, it's another year for me and you  
Another year with nothing to do  
  
Last year I was 21  
I didn't have a lot of fun  
And now I'm gonna be 22  
I say "oh my" and "boohoo"  
Yeah now I'm gonna be 22  
Oh my and boo hoo  
  
It's 1969, okay, all across the U.S.A.  
It's another year for me and you  
Another year with nothing to do  
Another year with nothing to do  
Well it's 1969  
1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, baby  
And it's 1969, baby  
Baby  
Baby  
Baby
