(La boheme)(Oh, sweet little lady)  
  
  
RODOLFO  
O soave fanciulla, o dolce viso  
Di mite circonfuso alba lunar,  
In te ravviso il sogno  
Ch'io vorrei sempre sognar!  
  
MIMI  
(Ah, tu sol comandi, amor!)  
Fremon nell'anima dolcezze estreme,  
Ecc Nel baccio freme amor!  
(oh come dolci scendono le sue  
Lusinghe al cor...Tu sol comandi, amor!)  
No, per pieta! Sei mia! V'aspettan gli amici...  
Gia mi mandi via? Vorrei dir...ma non osso,  
Di. Se venissi con voi? Che? Mimi!  
Sarebbe cosi dolce restar qui. C'e freddo fuori.v  
Vi staro vicina! E al ritorno? Curioso!  
Dammi il braccio, o mia piccina...  
Obbedisco, signor! Che m'ami...di'...lo t'amo.  
  
RODOLFO e MIMI  
Amor! Amor! Amor!  
  
SYNOPSES  
Mimi and Rodolfo are getting acquainted fast. Outside, Rodolfos' friends call
him to join them. He would rather stay with Mimi, but she shyly suggests they
all go out together. "Tell me you love me," he pleads. She holds back, at
first, but as this duet ends, they sing together for the first time, and their
first word is "Love."  
  
ENGLISH TRANSLATION  
RODOLFO  
Oh! sweet little lady! Oh, sweetest vision,  
With moonlight bathing your pretty face!  
The dream that I see in you is the dream I'll always dream!  
  
MIMI  
(Oh, you rule alone, Love!)  
Deep in my soul trembles the deepest of passions, etc.  
Our kisses shudder with love!  
(How gently now his words of praise make their way  
Into my heart...You rule alone, oh love!)  
No, I beg you! You're mine now! Your friends are still waiting.  
So soon must I leave you? I would like...I can't say it...  
Speak! What if I went along? What? Mimi!  
How sweet instead to stay behind here. It's freezing outside.  
I'd be right beside you! What about later? Who knows, sir?  
Take my arm, my dear young lady...As you say, my dear sir...  
Do you love me, say! I certainly do.  
  
RODOLFO and MIMI  
Love! Love! Love!
