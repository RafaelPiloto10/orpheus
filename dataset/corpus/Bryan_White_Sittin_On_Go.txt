I'm waiting on the green light to make you mine  
But your heart's just taking its own sweet time  
You want to be sure if you'll sink or swim  
Well grab ahold of me and just jump on in  
You're playing it safe  
But baby I'll wait  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, whenever you're ready  
I could be yours in a second or so  
Oh, baby come and get me  
My heart's sittin' on go  
Ooh, it's off to the races  
All you've gotta do is let me know  
Oh, I'm ready and waiting  
My heart's sittin' on go  
  
You oughta give in now instead of resisting  
'Cause I'm not above a little arm twisting  
I'm bettin' it's only a matter of time  
Before you and me are standing at the finish line  
You're having your doubts  
But you'll come around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're playing it safe  
But baby I'll wait  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My heart's sittin' on go  
My heart's sittin' on go
