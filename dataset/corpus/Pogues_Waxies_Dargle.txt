Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan  
"Will ye go to the Waxies dargle?"  
Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan,  
"I haven't got a farthing.  
I went up to Monto town  
To see Uncle McArdle  
But he wouldn't give me a half a crown  
For to go to the Waxies dargle."  
  
What will ya have?!  
I'll have a pint!  
I'll have a pint with you, Sir!  
And if one of ya' doesn't order soon  
We'll be chucked out of the boozer!  
  
Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan  
"Will ye go to the Galway races?"  
Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan,  
"I'll hawk me aul' man's braces.  
I went up to Capel Street  
To the Jewish moneylenders  
But he wouldn't give me a couple of bob  
For the aul' man's red suspenders."  
  
Chorus  
  
Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan  
"We got no beef or mutton  
If we went up to Monto town  
We might get a drink for nuttin'"  
Here's a nice piece of advice  
I got from an aul' fishmonger:  
"When food is scarce and you see the hearse  
You'll know you have died of hunger."  
  
Chorus x2
