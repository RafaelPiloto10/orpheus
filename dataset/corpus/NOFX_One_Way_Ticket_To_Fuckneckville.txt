No sleep 'til Fuckneckville, it's kind of funny you may not realize it until  
Phone call stop, can't get laid, you find out where the parties were some time
the next day  
  
One way ticket to seclusion, now your losin'  
One way ticket to alienation, you're an inside joke  
  
Is everybody supposed to be impressed with your ability to make us feel less
significant than you  
We're all chippin' in the purchase you a one way first class ticket outta town  
  
Millions sold, a mega star, there's a million assholes with ten million
guitars  
Enjoy it now, soon it ends, suddenly you find yourself without any friends  
  
One way ticket to isolation, you can hang with you  
You've been given a citation for excessive social faux pas and obnoxiousness  
  
Go ahead keep telling us your fifteen-minute stories about what you had for
breakfast then for lunch  
We're all chippin' for one big humble pie, we're gonna smash it in your face  
Go ahead tell us about your last great sold out concert and how your new
record's gonna top the charts  
We don't care 'bout your expenses, we just wanna have a laugh at your expense
