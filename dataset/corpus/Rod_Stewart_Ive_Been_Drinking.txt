I'm drinkin' again  
Thinkin' of when  
You left me  
That happened once so long ago  
  
I've been havin' a few  
And wishin' that you  
Were right here by my side  
  
Well, I'm makin' the rounds  
And settin' them up  
A total stranger to myself  
I'm just makin' a fool of myself  
  
I'm just hopin'  
That you'll come right back once, someday  
But I know, I know, I know  
That there's no second time around  
  
Now, listen  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
  
Sure I know I can borrow a smoke  
Or sit here all night long and tell a joke  
But after all is said and done, who's gonna laugh  
Who's gonna laugh at a broken, a broken heart?  
  
I've been drinkin' again  
And thinkin' of when  
Of when you left me  
And that weren't so long ago  
  
I've been havin' a few  
You know that you know  
And wishin' that you  
Were here right by my side  
  
Now listen one time  
  
I've been drinkin' again  
I've been drinkin' again  
Sometimes I can't help myself
