Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Oh yeah,  
The diggers and the tower cranes,  
The diggers and the tower cranes.  
  
Don't want demolition,  
Don't want your compensation,  
It's not just bricks and mortar,  
We are lambs to slaughter.  
  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Oh yeah,  
The diggers and the tower cranes,  
The diggers and the tower cranes.  
  
Must we live in fear,  
From those who shed no tears?  
Our one and only shelter,  
Your games, your helter skelter.  
  
Motorways and office blocks,  
They're standing on the spot  
Where stood a home,  
Crushing on the memories of people,  
Who have since turned to stone.  
(Ahh)  
They've turned to stone,  
(Ahh)  
They've turned to stone.  
  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Oh yeah,  
The diggers and the tower cranes,  
The diggers and the tower cranes.
