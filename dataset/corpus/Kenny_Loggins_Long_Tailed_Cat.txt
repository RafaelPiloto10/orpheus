A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair  
Now he don't realize that there's a danger there  
But he don't care no rock 'n' roll chair is gonna boogie on his day  
'Cause when his tail took a low down, syncopate, yeah  
  
I'm going down to Orleans town, to get a pound of feed  
Be back home in just 'bout a half of week, yeah  
You may be a symphony, babe, but I believe in song  
Got a catchy melody so you can sing along  
  
Oh, they say, you know they're talking bout the girls that work up town  
I don't realize the amount of danger now  
No swinging tail, no rock 'n' roll girl is gonna boogie woogie on my day  
'Cause I made my time on a Dixie holiday, yeah  
  
I'm going down to Orleans town on a Dixie holiday  
To get myself a tonk of that harmony, yeah  
You may be a symphony, baby but I believe in song  
It's got a catchy melody so you can sing along  
  
Everybody sing along, along  
Don't know what you sing along  
Well you're gonna sing along, along  
  
All you sing is oh my, oh my my  
Your daddy's getting older and the cows are going dry  
Gotta go bye, go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday  
  
Oh my, oh my my  
Your daddy's getting older and the cows are going dry  
You gotta go bye, go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday  
  
Oh my, oh my my  
Your daddy's getting older and the cows are going dry  
You gotta go bye, go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday  
  
Oh my, oh my my  
Daddy's getting older and the cows are going dry  
You gotta go bye, go bye bye  
On a Dixie holiday  
  
Oh, we're leaving on a Dixie holiday  
Heading for the Dixie holiday, yeah yeah, yeah
