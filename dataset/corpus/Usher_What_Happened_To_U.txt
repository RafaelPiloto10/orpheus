When you give it up, you get it on  
What happened to you yeah  
From the beginning I knew what I was getting  
But I was with it, and I'll admit that  
She was clear it was a kinda thing  
It wouldn't be easy for me to let it go  
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time  
I got a head, some got left behind  
The world is yours, just sign this dotted line  
  
And in no time, I hear, money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts, damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I've faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys  
I stayed only mine, mind was on the money  
Had whatever, whenever, heart throb forever  
Black, young, and clever  
  
When you give it up, you get it on  
Love would be the only reason to look back  
And once you turn it on, you can't turn it off  
But picture me complaining with all this  
  
Money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I'm faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
  
What sense does it make to have everything and nothing  
At the same time  
Where are you  
I need you, yeah  
I'm looking for you,  
Girl, come and share all this  
  
Money, clothes, fancy cars  
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys  
Sold out concerts damn I've been working hard  
Private jets to France, many women  
I didn't have a ball  
You can say I've made it  
But I'm faded 'cause I miss you  
Can we go back  
But the issue is time we can't get back  
What happened to you, yeah, come back  
'Cause I miss you, can we go back  
What happened to you  
I'm happy for you, wherever you are
