Can you feel me?  
Can you feel me?  
  
I don't want to open my eyes  
Cause if I do, I'll have to leave you and I don't understand why  
my heart wont do what i tell it to  
  
Wash over me with anything but your tears  
Wash over me with anything but my fears  
  
Come on, come on  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms?  
Can you hear me begging to stay?  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms?  
Can you beg me, beg me to stay  
  
I don't want to say goodbye cause if I do  
I may not leave you  
And I don't ever want to cry cause  
Without that I may never breathe you  
  
Wash over me with anything but your tears  
Wash over me with anything but my fears  
  
Come on, come on  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Can you hear me begging to stay?  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms?  
Can you beg me, beg me to stay  
  
Why don't you warm up these lips,  
With your fingertips  
Oh my body just aches at the thought of you saying,  
Good-bye  
Oh, when you look at me with them gorgeous eyes  
You know that I can't pretend, is this the end? it feels so right  
So  
  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms?  
Can you hear me begging to stay?  
Can you hear me?  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms?  
Your arms, no  
Can you beg me, beg me to stay  
Can you feel me?  
Can you feel me?  
Can you feel me?  
Can you feel me?  
  
Beg me to stay  
Can you feel me  
Can you beg me to stay, stay, stay?  
I don't want to open my eyes cause if  
I do I may not leave you  
I don't want to open my eyes cause if  
I do I may not leave you
