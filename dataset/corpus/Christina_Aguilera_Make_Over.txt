I can't believe what you did to me  
Down on my knees and I need to break free  
All these years you violated me  
(violated me)  
I don't know why I can't feel inside  
I try to hide can't make it alright, it's overkill  
Now I'm ready to fight  
(ready to fight)  
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
I just want to get away  
Savin' all your bullshit for another day  
  
Feeling confined like I'm bin' force fed  
My visions blurry and I'm lost in regrets  
It's overloaded and I'm outta control  
(outta control)  
So sick and tired of bein' so misused  
(so misused)  
You're taking me down with all your mental abuse  
And I said, I gotta get you outta my head  
Everybody's always trying to look me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to get away  
Saving all your bullshit for another day  
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me  
  
Leaving the house around quarter to five  
Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride  
And I feel so high, and I feel so alice  
Let my hair down feel the wind on my skin  
Crossin' the border where my new life begins  
And I close my eyes and take it all in  
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over  
(Don't make me over)  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You want to break me down [Repeat: x3]
