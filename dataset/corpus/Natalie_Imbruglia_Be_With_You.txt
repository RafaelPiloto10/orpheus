Don't you see the light has changed  
And nothing looks the same?  
Just shadows in the ground  
And if you listen hard enough you'll hear  
  
That I don't wanna dream  
If anything will change  
And all I know is I don't wanna live  
If I don't wanna be with you  
  
Come in here I'll keep you safe  
There's too much going on  
Underneath the stars  
And if I hold you close enough you'll feel  
  
I don't wanna dream  
If anything will change  
And all I know is I don't wanna live  
If I don't wanna be with you  
  
I don't wanna hurt you  
I don't wanna smile  
If you don't know that I don't wanna live  
If I don't wanna be with you  
  
I just wanna be with you  
Take it all and take our time  
I want to see the world with you  
I just want you by my side if you don't mind  
  
I don't wanna dream  
If anything will change  
And all I know is I don't wanna live  
If I don't wanna be with you
