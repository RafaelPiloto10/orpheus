I'm never gonna say I'm sorry,  
I'm a clown for everyone  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
I'm always here like a sun  
  
I'm a looser, that is a fact for sure  
I'm happy even if you don't want  
To invite me out for a dance tonight  
I'm not normal, I know, I don't care  
I'm never gonna say  
  
I'm always here like a sun, I'm always here  
Like a ghost I follow your steps so true  
You don't have to bribe me or fill me up  
Give me just a minute to shine with you  
I will make you so happy, make you laugh  
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry for  
  
The essence of my soul  
There's so many ways to change my life  
'Cause I want to, oh  
I'm like a clown, I'm fun for everyone,  
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
