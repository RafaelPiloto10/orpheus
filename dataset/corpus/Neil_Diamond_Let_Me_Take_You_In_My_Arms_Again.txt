You'll be better off, I know  
With another kind of man  
All I've got is what I feel  
And what I feel is what I am  
  
But let me take you in my arms again  
Let me take you in my arms and then  
Let me see behind your smile  
Let me love you like a child  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
I'm like a train that's rollin' on a track  
Like a train that's got no turnin' back  
Let me keep you from the storm  
Let me make you safe and warm  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
You'll be better off, I know  
With another kind of man  
All I've got is what I feel  
But what I feel is what I am  
  
Let me take you in my arms again  
Won't be easy, but I'll learn to bend  
Like a ship without a sail  
On a sea without a trail  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
You'll be better off, I know  
With another kind of man  
All I've got is what I feel  
But what I feel is what I am  
  
Let me take you in my arms again  
Won't be easy, but I'll learn to bend  
Like a ship without a sail  
On a sea without a trail  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
But let me take you in my arms again  
Let me take you in my arms and then  
Let me see behind your smile  
Let me love you like a child  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
Let me take you in my arms again  
Let me take you in my arms and then  
Let me see behind your smile  
Let me love you like a child  
Let me take you in my arms  
  
Let me take you in my arms again
