I was alone  
You were alone  
Parallel lines that touched one another  
Just feeling our way  
Lost in the dark  
Drawn to each other  
So much to say  
So much to do  
So much of you for me to discover  
Like what makes you laugh  
What makes you cry  
How does a friend become a lover, too?  
I've waited all of my life to find  
Someone who'd need my heart  
And read my mind  
To light my days and warm my nights  
Someone I know I could call  
My someone for all my life  
Looking at you  
Looking at me  
Loving the look of love that I see there  
I find when I look deep in your eyes  
Reflections of me there  
I've waited all of my life to find  
Someone who'd need my heart and read my mind  
To light my days and warm my nights  
Now all at once in your arms  
Everything's new  
All that I feel tells me it's true  
All that I ask is all of my life with you
