"Ladies and Gentlemen, we interrupt our program of Dance Music,  
To bring you a special bulletin from the intercontinental radio news.  
Our very own pop princess, now Queen of Pop,  
Has a special announcement she will like to make"  
  
You're on,  
I think I'm ready for my close up,  
Yeah  
  
You don't like me  
I don't like you, it don't matter (who?)  
Only difference  
You still listen, I don't have to (who?)  
In one ear and  
Out the other, I don't need you (who?)  
Your words don't stick  
I ain't perfect, but you ain't either (who?)  
  
If your feeling froggy leap (oh)  
I ain't even losin' sleep (oh)  
There's more to me than what you see (oh)  
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry  
  
Mr. Photographer  
I think I'm ready for my close-up (tonight)  
Make sure you catch me from my good side (pick one)  
These other (ha) just wanna be me  
Is that money in your pocket?  
Or you happy to see me?  
  
[Chorus]  
Kill the Lights!  
(Take 'em out, turn 'em off, break 'em down)  
Kill the Lights!  
(Don't be scared, make a move, see me now?)  
Kill the Lights!  
(I feel you, watching me, watching you)  
Kill the Lights!  
You can't handle the truth  
What happened to you?  
I kill  
The lights pure  
The lights satis  
The lights faction  
I kill  
The lights lights  
The lights camera  
The lights action  
I kill  
The lights pure  
The lights satis  
The lights faction  
I kill  
The lights lights  
The lights camera  
The lights action  
  
All the flashin', tryin' to cash-in  
Hurts my eyes  
All the poses, out of focus  
I despise  
  
Eff me over, your exposure  
Not the best  
You want me bad, I want you out  
Release this stress.  
  
Mr. Photographer  
I think I'm ready for my close-up (tonight)  
Make sure you catch me from my good side (pick one)  
These other just wanna be me  
Is that money in your pocket?  
Or you happy to see me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're the star now, welcome to the big league  
They all want a pic, they all wanna see, see, see  
What you're made of, what you're gonna do  
Is life gonna get the best of you?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
