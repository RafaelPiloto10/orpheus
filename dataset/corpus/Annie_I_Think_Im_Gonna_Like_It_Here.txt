Soap... No, bubbles, I think.  
  
Grace

The tennis court is in the rear

I think I'm gonna like it here.

When you wake Ring for Drake  
Drake will bring your tray  
When you're through Mrs. Pugh  
Comes and takes it away.  
  
Grace and servants  
  
No need to pick up any toys  
  
Annie  
  
(spoken)  
That's okay, I haven't got any anyway.  
  
Grace  
  
No finger will you lift my dear  
  
All  
  
We have but one request  
Please put us to the test  
  
Annie  
  
I know I'm gonna like it here  
Used to room in a tomb  
Where I'd sit and freeze  
Get me now, holy cow  
Could someone pinch me please.  
  
Grace  
  
(spoken)  
She didn't mean it.  
(Singing)  
We've never had a little girl  
  
All  
  
We've never had a little girl
