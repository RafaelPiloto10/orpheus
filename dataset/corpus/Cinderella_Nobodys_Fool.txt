I count the falling tears  
They fall before my eyes  
Seems like a thousand years  
Since we broke the ties  
I call you on the phone  
But never get a rise  
So sit there all alone  
It's time you realize  
  
I'm not your fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
I'm no fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
Never again, no, no  
  
You take your road, i'll take mine  
The paths have both been beaten  
Searchin' for a change of pace  
Love needs to be sweetened  
I scream my heart out, just to make a dime  
And with that dime i bought your love  
But now i've changed my mind  
  
I'm not your fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
I'm no fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
Never again, no, no  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
I'm no fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
  
I count the falling tears  
They fall before my eyes  
Seems like a thousand years  
Since we broke the ties  
Ohhh  
  
I'm not your fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
I'm no fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
I'm no fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
I'm no fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
No, nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
No, nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool  
Nobody's fool
