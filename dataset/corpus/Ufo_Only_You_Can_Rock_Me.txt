Who's taking time out, we'll take a shine out  
We're the boys we got nothing to lose  
I've had enough now of school and stuff now  
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Come on back now do it again  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
  
Come on the street now on every corner  
Breaking out and we're doing what we want to  
Just like a jewel shines in the night  
She burns so hot out under the street light  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We are here and there's no end  
We keep on coming again  
We are here and there's no end  
We just keep coming again  
  
Who's taking time out, we take a shine out  
We're the boys we got nothing to lose  
I've had enough now of school  
  
And stuff now  
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Come on back now, do it again  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We are here and there's no end  
We'll keep on coming again  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We are here and there's no end  
We'll keep on coming again
