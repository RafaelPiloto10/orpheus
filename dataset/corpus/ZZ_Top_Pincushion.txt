I been stuck, so I asked her why  
She gave me acupuncture as her alibi  
Shook my soul, and stole my dough  
Left my condition down a deep dark hole  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she ask  
I get nailed every now and then  
I get my mojo working but I'm pinned again  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she asks  
I'm gettin' pricked around and punctureated  
I let my ya ya down, I got penetrated  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she asks  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she asks
