Mississippi Queen - you know what I mean  
Mississippi Queen - she taught me everything  
  
Way down around Vicksburg around Lousisiana way  
There's a cajun lady called the Mississippi Queen  
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine  
While the rest of those dudes where gettin' their kicks  
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was gettin mine  
  
Mississippi Queen - if you know what I mean  
Mississippi Queen - she taught me everything  
  
This lady she asked me if I would be her man  
You know that I told her I'd do what I can  
To keep her lookin pretty, buy her dresses that shine  
While the the rest of them dudes was makin their bread  
Buddy beg your pardon I was losing mine  
  
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine  
While the rest of those dudes where gettin there kicks  
Brother beg your pardon I was gettin mine  
  
Ohhhhh Mississippi Queen  
Look out, Helter Skelter!  
Wouah ha ha ha  
  
"Okay, put it up, let's see what we got"  
"Man, that one note is a fucking bitch..."
