Am I  
Am I still tough enough?  
Feels like I'm wearing down (down down down down)  
Is my viciousness losing ground (ground ground ground ground)  
Am I taking too much?  
Did I cross the line? (line line)  
I need my role in this  
Very clearly defined  
  
I need your discipline  
I need your help  
I need your discipline  
You know once I start I cannot help myself  
  
Now it's starting up  
Feels like I'm losing touch  
Nothing matters to me  
Nothing matters as much  
I see you left a mark  
Up and down the skin (skin skin)  
I don't know where I end  
Or where you begin  
  
I need your discipline  
I need your help  
I need your discipline  
You know once I start I cannot help myself  
  
I cannot stop myself  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
I need your help  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Because once I start I cannot stop myself  
  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
I need your help  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Because once I start I cannot stop myself  
  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Once I start I cannot stop myself  
I need your discipline  
And you know  
Cannot stop myself  
Once I start I cannot stop myself
