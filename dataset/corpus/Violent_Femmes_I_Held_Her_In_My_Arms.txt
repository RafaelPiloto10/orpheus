  
  
I'm gnawing on the knowledge  
  
That I have been burnt  
  
And I'm learning things that I  
  
Should've already learnt  
  
Everyone I ever knew  
  
Was so kind and coy  
  
I was with a girl  
  
But it felt like I was with a boy  
  
I can't even remember  
  
If we were lovers  
  
Or if I just wanted to  
  
But I held her in my arms  
  
I held her in my arms  
  
I held her in my arms  
  
But it wasn't you  
  
I will not kill  
  
The one thing that I love  
  
In this world of wreckage  
  
I look above  
  
Help me Lord  
  
Help me understand  
  
What it means to be a boy  
  
What it means to be a man
