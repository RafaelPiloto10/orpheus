[Chorus]  
If it happens again I'm leaving  
I'll pack my things and go  
If it happens again  
There'll be no looking back  
I won't say I told you some  
  
You did what you were told  
And you took the strain  
Been left out in the cold  
Got yourself to blame  
But believe me,  
If it happens again I'm leaving  
If it stays the same I'm gone  
When you're stabbed in the back  
And there's salt in the wound  
The it's time to move along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No more spanners in the works,  
All the works been done  
Had your face rubbed in the dirt  
On show for every one  
But believe me  
If it happens again I'm leaving  
If it stays the same I'm gone  
When compromise is the song you sing  
It's been going on to long  
  
[Chorus]
