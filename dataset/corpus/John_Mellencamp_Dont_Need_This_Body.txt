This getting older  
Ain't for cowards  
This getting older  
Is a lot to go through  
Ain't a gonna need this body  
Much longer  
Ain't a gonna need this body  
Much more  
  
Well I can't see much  
Like I used to  
And I can't run like the wind  
I don't sleep more  
Than just a few hours  
I can't remember where I've been  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't a gonna need this body much longer  
Ain't a gonna need this body much more  
I put in a ten million hours  
Washed up and worn out for sure  
  
Well all my friends are  
Sick or dying  
And I'm here all by myself  
All I got left  
Is a head full of memories  
And a thought of my upcoming death  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know one thing  
I'll die easy  
And I know my life  
Is not in vain  
Because I loved  
And I fought with many  
And the people they loved me just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This getting older  
Well it ain't for cowards  
This getting older  
Is a lot to go through
