Your the devil in me that I brought in from the cold  
Your body's still young and your mind is very old  
Your comin' on strong and I like the way  
The visions we had are just fading away  
You're part of the life that I never had  
You said that man it's just too bad  
  
I see the animals and ask when the summer starts to call  
I hear there's happiness around which is banging down the hall  
Your part of my mind that's been and gone  
She said she'd return and it won't be long  
She's part of the life that I never had  
She said that man it's just too bad  
  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can see  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can be  
  
Your comin' on strong  
Your comin' on strong  
  
Your comin' on strong  
Your comin' on strong  
  
Your the devil in me that I brought in from the cold  
Your body's still young and your mind is very old  
Your comin' on strong and I like the way  
The visions we had are just fading away  
You're part of the life that I never had  
You said that man it's just too bad  
  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can see  
I want the whole of my life to be something that I can be  
  
Your comin' on strong  
Your comin' on strong  
  
Your comin' on strong  
Your comin' on strong
