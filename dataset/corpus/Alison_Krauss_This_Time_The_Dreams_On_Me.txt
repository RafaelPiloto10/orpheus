Somewhere, someday we'll be close together  
Wait and see  
Oh, by the way  
This time the dream's on me  
  
You'll take my hand  
And you'll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand  
This time the dream's on me  
  
[Chorus]  
It would be fun  
To be certain that I'm the one  
To know that I, at least  
Supply the shoulder you cry upon  
  
To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but  
This time the dream's on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but  
This time the dream's on me
