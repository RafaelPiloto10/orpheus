I confess, I'm messed up  
Dropping "I'm sorry's" like you're still around  
And I know you dressed up  
Said "hey kid you'll never live this down"  
  
And you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with  
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances  
  
I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming  
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"  
  
I don't blame you for being you  
But you can't blame me for hating it  
So say, what are you waiting for?  
Kiss her, kiss her  
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late  
  
Write me off, give up on me  
Cause darling what did you expect  
I'm just off a lost cause  
A long shot, don't even take this bet  
  
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights  
Get all the sighs and the moans just right  
  
I'm just always on  
You said you'd keep me honest  
(you're always on)  
But I won't call you on it
