We'll be fighting in the streets  
With our children at our feet  
And the morals that they worship will be gone  
And the men who spurred us on  
Sit in judgment of all wrong  
They decide and the shotgun sings the song  
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution  
Take a bow for the new revolution  
Smile and grin at the change all around  
Pick up my guitar and play  
Just like yesterday  
Then I'll get on my knees and pray  
We don't get fooled again  
The change, it had to come  
We knew it all along  
We were liberated from the fold, that's all  
And the world looks just the same  
And history ain't changed  
'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war  
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution  
Take a bow for the new revolution  
Smile and grin at the change all around  
Pick up my guitar and play  
Just like yesterday  
Then I'll get on my knees and pray  
We don't get fooled again .  
No, no! I'll move myself and my family aside  
If we happen to be left half alive  
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky  
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie  
Do ya?  
There's nothing in the streets  
Looks any different to me  
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye  
And the parting on the left  
Are now parting on the right  
And the beards have all grown longer overnight  
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution  
Take a bow for the new revolution  
Smile and grin at the change all around  
Pick up my guitar and play  
Just like yesterday  
Then I'll get on my knees  
And pray We don't get fooled again Don't get fooled again No, no!  
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Meet the new boss Same as the old boss
