Good morning blues, blues how do you do  
Babe, I feel alright but I come to worry you  
  
Baby, it's Christmas time and I want to see Santa Claus  
Baby, it's Christmas time and I want to see Santa Claus  
Don't show me my pretty baby, I'll break all of the laws

Don't send me nothing for Christmas but my baby back to me
