[Normani:]  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
[Lauren:]  
And I don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
[Ally:]  
Oh, I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
[Camila:]  
Make my wish come true, yeah, yeah  
[Dinah Jane:]  
All I want for Christmas is you  
  
[Ally:]  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
Don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
[Camila:]  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day  
  
[Dinah Jane:]  
Oh, I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
[Ally:]  
All I want for Christmas is you, you baby  
  
[Normani:]  
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
[Ally:]  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
[Lauren:]  
I won't make a list and send it  
To The North Pole for St. Nick  
[Camila:]  
I won't even stay awake  
To hear those magic reindeer click  
  
[Dinah Jane:]  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do?  
[All:]  
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby  
  
[Ally:]  
Woah, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air  
[Dinah Jane:]  
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
[Ally:]  
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?  
Won't you please bring my baby to me?  
  
[Lauren:]  
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
[Ally:]  
I just wanna see my baby,  
Standing right outside my door  
  
[Camila:]  
Oh, I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
[Dinah Jane:]  
Make my wish come true  
[Ally:]  
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you baby  
  
[All:]  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby
