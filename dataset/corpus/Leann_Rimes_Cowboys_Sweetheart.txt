I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
I want to learn to rope and to ride  
I want to ride o'er the plains and the deserts  
Out west of that great divide  
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'  
While the sun sinks in the West  
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
That's the life I love the best  
  
I want to ride Old Paint goin' at a run  
I want to feel the wind in my face  
A thousand miles from all the city lights  
Goin' a cowhand's pace  
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd  
While the moon shines down from above  
I want to strum my guitar and yodelay-hee-hoo  
Oh that's the life that I love  
  
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
I want to learn to rope and to ride  
I want to ride o'er the plains and the deserts  
Out west of that great divide  
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'  
While the sun sinks in the West  
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
That's the life I love the best
