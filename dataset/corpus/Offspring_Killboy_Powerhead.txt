He's a pistol grip  
And a lightning rod hammer step  
He always busts his knuckles  
When he's wrenchin' up his shit  
  
He just a Killboy Powerhead yeah  
You know I saw his woman  
She was writing his name in blood  
You know I saw his woman  
  
Hard as a rock  
She said she was his baby  
Who looked just like the Hoover Dam  
You know I saw his woman  
  
Hard as a rock  
He just a Killboy Powerhead  
  
Killboy Powerhead  
Killboy Powerhead  
Killboy Powerhead yeah
