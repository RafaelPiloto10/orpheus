I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  
The mist is lifting slowly  
I can see the way ahead  
And I've left behind the empty streets  
That once inspired my life  
And the strength of the emotion  
Is like thunder in the air  
'Cause the promise that we made each other  
Haunts me to the end  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know I'll find you somehow  
Somehow, somehow  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  
The secret of your beauty and the mystery of your soul  
I've been searching for in everyone I meet  
And the times I've been mistaken, it's impossible to say  
And the grass is growing underneath our feet  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know I'll find you somehow  
Somehow, somehow  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Yes, I know you're out there somewhere  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yes, I know it's going to happen  
I can feel you getting near  
And soon we'll be returning  
To the fountain of our youth  
And if you wake up wondering  
In the darkness I'll be there  
My arms will close around you  
And protect you with the truth  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know I'll find you somehow  
Somehow, somehow  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you
