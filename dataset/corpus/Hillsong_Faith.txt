I'm reaching for the prize...  
I'm giving everything...  
I give my life for this...  
It's what I live for.  
  
Nothing will keep me from...  
All that you have for me...  
You hold my head up high...  
I live for you...  
  
Greater is He that's living in me  
Than he that is in the world.  
  
Faith...I can move the mountain...  
I can do all things through Christ, I know  
Faith...Standing and believing...  
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me
