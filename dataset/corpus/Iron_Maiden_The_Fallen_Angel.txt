Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game  
Demons are inside you and they're making their play  
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time  
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind  
  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know I am the only one  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be it's the end of our world?  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be it's the end of our world?  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Beaten fallen angel but I've risen again  
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray  
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way  
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day  
  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know I am the only one  
You and only god would know what could be done  
You and only god will know that I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be it's the end of my world?  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face all this on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be it's the end of our world?  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be it's the end of our world?  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one  
  
Could it be it's the end of our world?  
All the things that we cherish and love  
Nothing left but to face this all on my own  
Cause I am the chosen one
