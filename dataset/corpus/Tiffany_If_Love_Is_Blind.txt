People say that you're no good for me  
People say it constantly  
I hear it said so much I repeat it in my sleep  
  
Maybe I am just a fool for you  
Maybe you're no angel too  
But all that talk is cheap  
When I'm alone with you  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
Not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
  
All the world is crazy anyway  
What's it matter what they say  
If I'm the one that's wrong  
Then let in be my mistake  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
I'm not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
  
You wouldn't be with me tonight if I didn't feel I was right  
What will it matter anyhow a hundred years from now  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
I'm not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you
