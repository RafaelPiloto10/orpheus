She's back real late yet she don't seem to care  
She hangs around outside in late night air  
Burning tears upon a smiling face  
And she's caught in the fires of spring  
  
The ice of loneliness you've known so long  
For good or not seems to have been and gone  
Your Phoenix flies you high on crazy wings  
And you're caught in the fires of spring  
  
You've been before but never been so fast  
Your only hope is that it's gonna last  
You know the pain and yet you love it's sting  
And you're caught in the fires of spring
