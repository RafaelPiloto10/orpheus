Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?  
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?  
I'm gonna shoot my baby, I caught her messin round with another man  
  
  
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your baby down  
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your baby down  
Yes I did I shot her, I went and put her in the ground  
  
  
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to now?  
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to now?  
I'm heading way down South where I can be free  
I'm heading Mexico way, no hangman's about to put a leash around me
