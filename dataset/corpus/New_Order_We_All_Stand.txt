Three miles to go  
Three miles to go  
At the end of the road  
There's a soldier waiting for me  
  
I've got three miles to go  
Three miles to go  
At the end of the road  
There's a soldier waiting for me  
  
At the end of the road  
At the end of the road  
At the end of the road  
  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me  
Life goes on and on  
  
It's a red sky tonight  
It's a red sky tonight  
At the end of the road  
Where all futures go  
At the end of the road  
There's a soldier waiting for me  
He's got three miles to go  
Three miles to go  
At the end of the road  
At the end of the road  
There's blood on shore  
  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me
