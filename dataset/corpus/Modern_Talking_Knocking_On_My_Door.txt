Ooh - knocking on my door - ooh  
Oh baby when I see your eyes  
I feel like I'm in paradise  
My heart is beating just for you  
Don't play game with me (oh - tomorrow)  
Tomorrow there's another day  
I'm begging you, oh baby stay  
You said to me you had to go  
But I really know(really know)  
You said to me the time will show  
But I really know  
  
One day you're knocking on my door  
And you want to come in (wanna come in)  
All I want to do is just everything (everything)  
Save a little room in your lonely heart  
I promised you will be my baby  
  
Oh tell me, you'll never make me lonely  
Cause you're the one and only (the one and only) girl for me  
  
Ooh - knocking on my door - ooh  
Nobody knows the way I feel  
I promised you my love is real  
It's larger than the universe  
I promised from my heart (oh - together)  
Together til the end of time  
Oh baby you're always on my mind  
You said to me you have to go  
But I really know (really know)  
You said to me the time will show  
But I really know  
  
One day you're knocking on my door  
And you want to come in (wanna come in)  
All I want to do is just everything (everything)  
Save a little room in your lonely heart  
I promised you will be my baby  
  
Oh tell me, you'll never make me lonely  
Cause you're the one and only (the one and only) girl for me  
  
One day you're knocking on my door  
And you want to come in (wanna come in)  
All I want to do is just everything (everything)  
Save a little room in your lonely heart  
I promised you will be my baby  
  
Oh tell me, you'll never make me lonely  
Cause you're the one and only (the one and only) girl for me  
  
Ooh - knocki
