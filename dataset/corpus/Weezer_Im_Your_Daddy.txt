I thought tonight would suck like every other night  
I'd party with my friends  
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor  
Normal came to an end  
  
We started talking and man, it was so clear to me  
There's no one else like you  
You got the brains, the body, and the beauty  
To top it off, you're cool  
  
[Chorus]  
This ain't impossible  
This ain't improbable  
You are my baby tonight  
And I'm your daddy  
This ain't believable  
This ain't predictable  
You are my baby tonight  
And I'm your daddy  
  
I hope that I ain't freaking you out  
You probably hear it all the time  
I swear I ain't like those other boys  
I'm a special kind  
  
I would like to give a demonstration  
Of what it is I do  
I'll take you out to dinner at Palermo's  
We'll split a cheese fondue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will egg the goomba  
If you tire  
Try my best to moonwalk  
On the wire  
  
I just want to, oh ah,  
Feel your fire  
Feel your fire  
Feel your fire!  
  
[Chorus]
