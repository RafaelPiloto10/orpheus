She is an American car,  
She isn't legal so she can't go far.  
She got her mind stuck up in second gear,  
Where she going ain't exactly clear.  
Baby please, baby please, I want to drive you home.  
  
Low mileage without a pink slip,  
Clean upholstery and it ain't been ripped.  
She stripped her gears only late last night,  
I don't think that thing was oiling right.  
Baby please, baby please, I want to drive you home.  
  
She shakes and shimmies all over the road,  
She's always happy when she carry a load.  
Another lonesome automobile,  
Something bout the way she makes me feel.  
Baby please, baby please, I want to drive you home.
