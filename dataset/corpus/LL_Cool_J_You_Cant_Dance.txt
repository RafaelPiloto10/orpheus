He man, I've seen ya,  
Think ya rockin' it on the floor,  
You look like a moron!  
Who let you in the door?  
To put the question bluntly  
Maybe your feet's deformed.  
They should slap you in the teeth  
When you put your dancing shoes on.  
You can't dance!  
  
Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?  
Homeboy, what's the use?  
Anytime you wanna step aside a party,  
First think of an excuse.  
You dance like a fat old lady  
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice,  
But every time you try to get one move right.  
The old lady then did it twice.  
You can't dance!  
  
You've been a dancing disco disaster,  
The worst I ever saw.  
They should dropkick you on the neck  
And drag you off the floor.  
In every discotheque, I see you there  
In the middle of the crowd,  
Looking like you got eight or nine  
Left feet dragging all around.  
You can't dance!  
  
Take my advice, don't move!  
You'll never get the knack.  
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party  
And wouldn't be coming back.  
On the floor you're a dinosaur,  
Yeah boy, that's how you move.  
You look like Ralph Cramden or a Donald Duck cartoon.  
You can't dance!  
  
You wanna come to my party?  
I wouldn't give you a chance.  
You tried to take break-dance lessons,  
Ended up in an ambulance.  
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?  
You dance like you got arthritis already,  
What'll happen when you get old?  
You can't dance!  
  
Why are you so stiff?  
Is it something that your mother did?  
Maybe you grew up around "can't dance" people  
When you were a "can't dance" kid.  
You live in a "can't dance" house,  
Went out in a "can't dance" car,  
Your doofy "can't dance" father  
Got drunk in a "can't dance" bar.  
You take a "can't dance" bath,  
Put on your "can't dance" cologne.  
Go out to a "can't dance" party  
So you wouldn't have to "can't dance" all alone.  
You can't dance!  
  
Homeboy, will you please get off the floor, you moron?
