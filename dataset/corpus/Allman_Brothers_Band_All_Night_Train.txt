Last night sorta got so insane,  
As I went riding on the all night train.  
Took it down the street and around the block,  
Took it downtown baby where the big boys rock.  
Roll on, roll on,  
Take me where I can ease my pain.  
Preacher say boy now where you been?  
Getting lead in my pockets,  
Putting money in sin.  
When the morning comes not a nickel to my name,  
Threw it all away on the all night train.  
Ride, let the passenger ride.  
Ride, let the passenger ride.  
I woke up late yesterday afternoon,  
My eyeballs feeling like two balloons.  
The doctor say things ain't never gonna change,  
Till you stop riding that all night train.  
Ride, let the passenger ride.  
Ride, let the passenger ride.  
Took a little trip to keep from going insane,  
Spent the rest of my life on the all night train.  
All night train.  
All night train.  
All night train.
