You cut off all of your fingers  
Trade them in for dollar bills  
Cake on some more make-up to  
Cover up all those lines  
Wake up and stop shaking  
Don't you want some of this?  
Don't you need some of this?  
You take but cannot be given  
You ride but cannot be ridden  
Pinch this tiny heart of mine  
Wrap it up in soiled twine  
You never read what you've written  
I'll be your lover, I'll be forever  
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high  
Don't you want some of this?  
Don't you need some of this?  
You shove your hair down my throat  
I feel your fingers in me  
Tear this bitter fruit to mess  
And wrap it in your soiled dress  
Now you must spit out the seeds  
  
All dried up and tied up forever  
All fucked up and dead to the world
