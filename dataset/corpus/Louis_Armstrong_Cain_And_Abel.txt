Now have you read of the fable of Cain and Abel?  
Once they were in a scandal that shook the town.  
Cain became mighty jealous of brother Abel,  
So he rose up and smote Abel down.  
  
Now the Lord sure was hopping mad,  
And yet he was plenty sad,  
to think that he had a man like Cain.  
  
The Lord spoke and showed his wrath,  
And Cain walked the path  
That led to a life full of pain.  
  
You can't run from the shadow of retribution.  
If you're bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs.  
Let yourself take a lesson from Cain and Able:  
  
Don't lament, be content,  
Don't resent what the Lord has sent,  
And you'll find that you're bound to get along.
