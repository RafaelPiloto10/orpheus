Why do lovers drift apart?  
How does love fade away?  
When do pieces of a broken heart mend again?  
You've been crying in the dark  
And you've been feeling alone  
Don't be scared of what you find  
When you turn the light on  
  
Ain't nobody gonna say goodbye  
No, ain't nobody gonna walk away  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry  
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you  
Like I love you  
  
What sad memory of yesterday  
What terrible scar  
Keeps you gathering pieces of  
Your shattered heart  
There was once upon a time  
When hope was living within  
And I know there will come a time  
When you can believe again  
  
Ain't nobody gonna say goodbye  
No, ain't nobody gonna walk away  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry  
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you  
Like I love you  
  
How long have you been feeling lonely?  
How long have you been feeling sad and blue?  
  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry  
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you  
Like I love you  
  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Let me love you, like I love you
