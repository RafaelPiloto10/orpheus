For a while I thought I fell asleep  
Lying motionless inside a dream  
  
Then rising suddenly, I felt a chilling breath upon me  
She softly whispered in my ear (forsaken)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Forsaken  
I have come for you tonight  
Awaken  
Look in my eyes and take my hand  
Give yourself up to me  
  
I waited faithfully for night to fall again  
Trying to silence the fear within me  
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss  
And saw a crimson sting on her lips  
  
I have to know your name  
Where have I seen your face before?  
My dear, why don't you be afraid?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me far away  
Close your eyes and hold your breath  
Till the ends of the earth  
  
Forsaken  
I have come for you tonight  
Awaken  
Look in my eyes and take my hand  
Forsaken  
Fly away with me tonight  
Awaken  
Renew my life  
Now you are mine  
Give yourself up to me
