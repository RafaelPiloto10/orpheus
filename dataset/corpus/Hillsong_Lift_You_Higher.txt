Verse  
You came to save the world  
To rescue me  
To rescue me  
You came to give us hope  
You're all I need  
You're all I need  
  
You set our hearts on fire  
It burns in me  
It burns in me  
Now You awaken us  
For all to see  
For all to see  
  
Pre-Chorus  
Because Your love has set me free  
Because Your love will never leave  
Because You live and died for me  
I live for You alone  
  
Chorus  
We lift You higher  
Our God  
Your Name be lifted higher  
In everything  
  
Bridge  
We lift You up  
We lift You up  
We lift You up
