I saw your face in a criminal sketch  
Don't be alarmed 'cause you don't know me yet  
I'm on the prowl now sniffing around this town, for you  
  
Calling all cars there's an officer down  
Shot to the heart on a night on the town  
And the evidence of your fingerprints was found and now  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
Oh, no here we go once again  
We both know you'll never turn yourself in  
So I'm drivin' 'til it's light out  
Searchin' for your hide-out  
(drivin' 'til it's light out)  
(Searchin' for your hide-out)  
  
Pick up the pace as I chase you around  
One of these days I'll end up trackin' you down  
But, yeah, I got the feeling I'll be letting you loose when I do  
Because you,  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street  
  
You got the right to remain right here with me  
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit  
Love is a high-speed chase racing down the street  
  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
Woo woo woo  
I'm coming after you  
  
I'm coming after you  
I'm coming' after you  
I'm coming' after you  
I'm coming' after you
