In the ether  
I hang suspended  
I wait for you  
And I know you're near  
In this high heaven  
My world's upended  
I feel no passion  
I feel no fear  
  
I'm dizzy with love  
But you never appear  
In the gloom of this room  
Of this cell down here  
  
I know this place  
Isn't truly real  
And that like my love  
It expands and sprays  
The light will find me  
Will bend toward me  
Yet I'm marooned  
In a billion days  
  
I'm drunk with you  
And I can't explain  
Who or where I am  
Or how I'm in pain  
  
Rocking and rocking me  
Rhythm is shocking me  
Just like a child in your fist  
You are knocking me  
Rocking and rocking  
Autistic, caged I am  
Rocking and rocking  
And rocking enraged  
  
I am drunk with you  
And I can't explain  
Who or where I am  
Or how I'm in pain  
  
In the ether  
In the ether  
  
In the ether  
I wait for you  
Hanging in this mist  
That I know's unreal  
There is nothing there  
There's no you, no me  
Even though it's crazy  
I still appeal  
  
This is heavenly hell  
I appear insane  
I have no idea  
Who there is to blame
