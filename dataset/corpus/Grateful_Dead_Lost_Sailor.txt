Compass card is spinning  
Helm is swinging to and fro  
Oh, where is the dog star  
Oh, where's the moon  
You're a lost sailor  
You've been too long at sea  
Some days the gales are howling  
Some days the sea is still as glass  
Oh, raise the main sail  
Oh, lash the mast  
You're a lost sailor  
You've been too long at sea  
Now the shorelines beckon  
Yeah, there's a price for being free  
Hear the sea birds cryin' and there's a ghost wind blowing  
And it's calling you, to that misty swirling sea  
Till the chains of your dreams are broken  
No place in this world you can be  
You're a lost sailor  
You've been away too long at sea  
Now the shorelines beckon  
Yeah, there's a price for being free  
Driftin', you're driftin'  
Yeah, driftin' and dreamin'  
'Cause there's a place you've never been  
Maybe a place you've never seen now  
You can hear them callin' on the wind  
Oh, you drift your life away  
[Incomprehensible]  
Hey baby, drift your life away  
Driftin' and dreamin'  
Really goin' on a dream now  
Really goin' on a dream, really goin' on a dream  
Really goin' on a dream
