A psycho drive twisted in my head  
Silence broken,  
but there's nothing said  
I got a nightmare from a fantasy  
Will the voices ever set me free  
I can hear 'em,  
I can hear 'em,  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see 'em,  
I can see 'em  
I can see 'em  
Over and over again  
I saw it happening like deja-vu  
They tried to tell me,  
But they couldn't get through  
In my head I hear the voices scream  
I need someone to tell me what it means  
I can hear 'em,  
I can hear 'em,  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see 'em,  
I can see 'em  
I can see 'em  
Over and over again  
Whoa  
Who turned off the lights?  
Whoa  
A shadow in the night  
Whoa  
It wasn't meant to be  
I can't take this alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight  
Oh no I can't take it alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight  
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
I wonder if tonight will be my last  
I need an angel who will rescue me  
To save me from my mental symphony  
I can hear 'em,  
I can hear 'em,  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see 'em,  
I can see 'em  
I can see 'em  
Over and over again  
Whoa  
Who turned off the lights?  
Whoa  
A shadow in the night.  
Whoa  
It wasn't meant to be  
I can't take this alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight  
Oh no I can't take it alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight
