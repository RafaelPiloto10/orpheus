There's a place in the world  
For a gambler  
There's a burden that only  
He can bear  
There's a place in the world  
For a gambler,  
And he sees  
Oh, yes he sees  
And he sees  
Oh, yes he sees  
  
There's a song in the heart  
Of a woman  
That only the truest of loves  
Can release.  
There's a song in the heart  
Of a woman.  
Set it free  
Oh, set it free  
Set it free  
Oh, set it free  
Set it free  
Oh, set it free.  
  
There's a light in the depths  
Of your darkness  
There's a calm at the eye  
Of every storm.  
There's a light in the depths  
Of your darkness.  
  
Let is shine  
Oh, let it shine  
Let is shine  
Oh, let it shine  
Let is shine  
Oh, let it shine.  
Let it Shine
