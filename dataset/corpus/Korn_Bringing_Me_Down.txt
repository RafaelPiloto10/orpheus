Day after day it's the same  
Why do we play these games?  
Reaching out for something true  
Questioning all that I do  
Gotta get back, gotta get back  
Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks  
Name of the game, feel the pain  
Look into my eyes and you'll see no pain  
Everything will come right back to you  
Everything you put me through  
  
I can't breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
You know it's pulling me down  
  
Why do I feel so alone?  
So close, yet so far from home  
One thing I know I believe  
On until after they bleed  
Sin is through, sin is through  
Coming on to me while I'm coming on to you  
Never look away, never look away  
Cause once you slip you're out of my way  
Practice this one thing I say  
Never let this get away from me  
  
I can't breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
  
I can't breathe will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
  
You know it's pulling me down [x9]  
  
Never give up, never give up  
Never turn away or I'll be fucking you up [x2]  
  
Gotta get back, gotta get back  
Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks  
Feel the pain, feel the pain  
I don't need a mask to see your pain  
Sin is through, sin is through  
You're coming on to me while I'm coming on to you  
Never look away, never look away  
Once you slip you're out of my way  
  
I can't breathe will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
You know it's pulling me down  
  
I can't breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
  
You know it's pulling me down
