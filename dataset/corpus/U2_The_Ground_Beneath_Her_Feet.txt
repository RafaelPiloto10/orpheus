All my life, I worshiped her  
Her golden voice, her beauty's beat  
How she made us feel, how she made me real  
And the ground beneath her feet  
And the ground beneath her feet  
  
And now I can't be sure of anything  
Black is white, and cold is heat  
For what I worshiped, stole my love away  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
  
Go lightly down your darkened way  
Go lightly underground  
I'll be down there in another day  
I won't rest until you're found  
  
Let me love you, let me rescue you,  
Let me bring you where two roads meet  
Oh come back above, where there is only love  
Only love  
  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
  
Let me love you true, let me rescue you,  
Let me bring you to where two roads meet  
  
Let me love you true, let me rescue you,  
Let me bring you to where two roads meet  
  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my
