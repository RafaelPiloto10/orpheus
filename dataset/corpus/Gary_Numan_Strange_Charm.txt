I don't know  
I don't know  
The dream was everything  
  
I don't know  
I don't know  
If it's all falling down.  
I lose connection as they let me down  
  
What you gonna think?  
What you gonna do?  
What you gonna say?  
Are you gonna scream 'Oh no'?  
What you gonna think?  
What you gonna do?  
What you gonna say?  
I just don't like this thing, at all.  
(Strange charm)  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the fun begin  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the night come in.  
  
We don't like it  
We don't like it  
We're from the factory and we've come to play.  
Let the boys out.  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
Come closer and talk to me  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
D'you get the picture now?  
  
You won't like it  
You won't like it  
We get impatient as the time runs out.  
Let the boys out.
