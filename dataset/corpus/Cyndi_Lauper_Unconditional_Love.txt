And I want to be everything  
You want me to  
But I'm not sure I know how  
I lose faith and I lose ground  
Then I see you and remember When I see you I remember  
Unconditional love, love, love  
Unconditional love  
  
It doesn't matter what I say  
'Cause it always seems you're taking  
Me the wrong way  
But if you could read my mind you'd see  
I fight myself all the time  
When I see you I surrender  
Unconditional love, love, love  
Unconditional love, love  
  
Standing on a wilder shore  
I got my head up in the clouds, oh  
I ain't got no sense of direction now  
  
I want to lie next to you I want to lie next to you  
And I want to do everything you want me to  
And I want to do everything you want me to  
Sometimes I wish at the sky But I'm not sure I know how  
I imagine what the clouds look like  
Put your arms around me now  
  
When I see you I remember  
When I feel you I surrender  
Unconditional love, love, love unconditional love ...  
Unconditional love  
Put your arms around me now  
When I see you I surrender  
When I feel you I surrender  
Unconditional love, love, love unconditional love ...  
Unconditional love, love, love  
When I see you I surrender...  
When I see you I remember  
Unconditional love...  
Unconditional love...  
  
All you need is  
What the world needs  
Now the word is love
