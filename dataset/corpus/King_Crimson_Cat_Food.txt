Lady Supermarket with an apple in her basket  
Knocks in the manager's door,  
Grooming to the muzak from a speaker in shoe rack  
Lays out her goods on the floor,  
Everything she's chosen is conveniently frozen.  
"Eat it and come back for more!"  
  
Lady Window Shopper with a new one in the hopper  
Whips up a chemical brew,  
Croaking to a neighbor while she polishes a sabre  
Knows how to flavor a stew.  
Never need to worry with a tin of "Hurri Curri"  
"Poisoned especially for you!"  
  
No use to complain  
If you're caught out in the rain,  
Your mother's quite insane.  
Cat food cat food cat food again.  
  
Lady Yellow Stamper with a fillet in a hamper  
Dying to finish the course,  
Goodies for the table with a fable on the label  
Drowning in miracle sauce.  
Don't think I am that rude if I tell you that it's cat food,  
"Not even fit for a horse!"
