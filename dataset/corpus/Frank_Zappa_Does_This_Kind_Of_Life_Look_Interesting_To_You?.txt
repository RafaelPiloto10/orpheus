Bad Conscience: Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after
night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the
French Riviera at the midem convention. A big tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt
eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your
name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and
customized by ran toon tan han toon frammet and dee. Followed by twelve
potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out
they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice with
your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner
office, Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets
on Air Rangoon. Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a big rock
and roll guitar player in a comedy group?
