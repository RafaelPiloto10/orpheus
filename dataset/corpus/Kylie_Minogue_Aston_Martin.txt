Twenty-four hour sunset  
I got a tank of gas and  
All the things I can do  
When driving with you in my Aston  
It's a perfect chance  
For some romance  
With a little luck now baby  
We might get to start  
  
In my Aston Martin  
We might get started  
In my Aston Martin  
Let's go  
In my Aston Martin  
You can call me darling  
In my Aston Martin  
Let's go  
  
I love the records playing  
On a late night radio  
Just anticipating  
How much faster we can go  
  
It's a perfect chance  
For some romance  
Got my fingers crossed now baby  
That we get lost  
  
Way down by the sea  
Is where I wanna be  
Way down by the sea  
Is where I wanna be  
  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
(We might get started)  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
(We might get started)  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
(Let's go)
