Happy, happy birthday baby  
Although you're with somebody new  
Thought I'd drop a line to say  
That I wish this happy day  
Would find me beside you  
Happy, happy birthday baby  
No, I can't call you my baby  
Seems like years ago we met  
On a day I can't forget  
Cause that's when we fell in love  
  
Do you remember  
The names we had for each other  
I was your pretty  
You were my baby  
Oh, how could we say goodbye  
  
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday  
I'm not acting like a lady  
So I'll close this note to you  
With good luck and wishes too  
Happy happy birthday baby
