Little triggers that you pull with your tongue  
Little triggers, I don't want to be hung up, strung up  
When you don't call up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggers--my hand on your hip  
  
Thinkin' all about those censored sequences  
Worryin' about the consequences  
Waiting until I come to my senses  
Better put it all in present tenses  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Worryin' about the common decency  
When it is only a question of frequency  
When you say OK but you've got cheek to be  
Sayin' you're tired of me when you don't even weaken these  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggers--my hand on your hip
