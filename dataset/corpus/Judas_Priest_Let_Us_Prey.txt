Call for the priest, I'm dying...  
  
Well, the pressure's too much, you know I peaked last night  
I gotta get some a quick release  
City is standing on my shoulders  
My body's going piece by piece  
Ooh..!  
  
Yes I know what I want and I know where to get it  
And I'm going there right away  
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on  
Down to my knees and pray  
Ooh..!  
  
When your back's to the wall come along one and all  
We shall fight all the slander that's penned  
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose  
For our triumph's the means to their end  
  
With you by my side I shall ride every storm  
  
Let the cynics drop dead in their critical head  
They're wrist merchants as we all can see  
Bunch of deaf ears with their columnized fears  
What a shame, what a shame, oh dear me!  
Ooh..!
