Ah well, c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight  
I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right  
Well I've been a-doin' my homework all week long  
And now the house is empty and the folks are gone  
Ooo C'mon everybody  
  
Ah well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four  
And the house'll be a-shakin' from my bare feet slappin' on the floor  
Well, when you hear that music you can't sit still  
If your brother won't rock then your sister will  
Ooo C'mon everybody  
  
Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside  
If my folks come a-home I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide  
They'll be no more movies for a week or two  
No more runnin' round with the usual crew  
Who cares C'mon everybody  
  
C'mon everybody  
C'mon everybody
