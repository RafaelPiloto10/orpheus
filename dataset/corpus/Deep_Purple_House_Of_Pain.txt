Have you ever had a woman that could make you crazy  
Have you ever had a woman that could drive you mad  
Have you ever had a woman give you so much trouble  
And the best lovin' you ever had  
  
My friends all say I'm losing it big time  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
Back to the house of pain  
  
Have you ever had a rock that just keeps on rollin'  
Have you ever seen a train comin' down the track  
Have you ever jumped into the cold, cold never  
And know there's no turning back  
  
My friends all say I'm crazy, baby  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going home  
Back to the house of pain  
  
Have you ever had a weight that was much too heavy  
Have you ever had a burden that was yours alone  
Have you ever spent a night when you keep on waiting  
Staring at the telephone  
  
My friends all say I'm crazy, baby  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back to my woman  
Back to the house of pain  
Then I run away  
  
My friends all say I'm losing it big time  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
Back to the house of pain  
  
You'll always be my inspiration  
I love you from afar
