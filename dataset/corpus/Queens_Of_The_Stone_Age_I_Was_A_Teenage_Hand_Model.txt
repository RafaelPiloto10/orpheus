Cozied up to the toilet  
Face stuck to the floor  
I met expectations  
That I was tryin' to ignore  
  
Job had such patience  
I wonder, what's that like?  
One hundred thousand million  
That's what you like  
So I was thinkin'  
  
So these cities are sprouting  
Like a spit in the eye  
And this world isn't waiting  
It's just passing me by  
  
I just peak in the window  
Lookin' inside  
The butcher's got a fork in your face  
I'm standing alive  
And I was singin'
