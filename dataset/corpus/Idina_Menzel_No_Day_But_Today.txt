There's only us, there's only this  
Forget regret, or life is your's to miss  
No other path, no other way  
No day but today  
  
There's only us, only tonight  
We must let go to know what's right  
No other road, No other way  
No day but today  
  
I can't control my destiny  
I trust my soul, my only goal  
Is just to be  
  
There's only now, there's only here  
Give in to love or live in fear  
No other path, No other way  
No day but today  
  
There's only us, There's only this  
Forget regret, or life is your's to miss  
No other road, no other way  
No day but today  
  
No day but today  
(No day but today)  
No day but today  
(No day but today)  
No day but today  
(No day but today)  
No day but today
