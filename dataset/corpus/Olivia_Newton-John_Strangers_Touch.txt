I've been doin' some soul searchin', feel guilty as a girl can feel  
I've got no business smiling, beguiling  
  
I'm caught up in a triangle, no future in this shape I'm in  
So what do I find so appealing, in stealing, tell me  
  
How come a stranger's touch can thrill me so much  
My heart's in jeopardy, he's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
  
I wasn't lookin' around, you know I'm happy with you  
You're a part of me that I can't replace  
But he touched my heart in a new place, he found a space, tell me  
  
How come a stranger's touch can thrill me so much  
My heart's in jeopardy, he's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
  
Can't keep on hurtin', hurtin' you  
  
How come a stranger's touch can thrill me so much  
My heart's in jeopardy, he's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
He's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
  
Can't keep on, can't keep on, can't keep hurting you  
Can't keep on, can't keep on, can't keep hurting you  
Can't keep on, can't keep on, can't keep hurting you
