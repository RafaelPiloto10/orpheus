Little David, play on your harp, hallelu, hallelujah, little David,  
Play on your harp, hallelujah.  
Little David, play on your harp, hallelu, hallelujah, little David,  
Play on your harp, hallelujah.  
  
Hey now, I don't know for sure, but it's gets said, and I got told,  
Someone said that the streets of heaven are paved with solid gold,  
It must make a might good road, little David, play on your harp,  
Hallelu, hallelujah, little David, play on your harp, hallelujah.
