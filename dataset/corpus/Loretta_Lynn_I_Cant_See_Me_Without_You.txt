Is it day is it night am I losin' my sight is it over or we're really through  
I can't see you in my arms anymore and I can't see me without you  
I can't see me without you to lean on and I can't see you leavin' or gone  
I could never see anything you wanted me to and I can't see me without you  
  
I see the house you once called your own and I see the door you walked through  
I see the road you're leavin' me on and I can't see me without you  
I can't see me
