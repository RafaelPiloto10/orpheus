Looking at me, never find out what a working man's about  
Raving all night, sleeping away the day  
Something to ask, something to say, something to keep the pain away  
Something I'd like to see if it's alright  
  
Life, go easy on me  
Love, don't pass me by  
  
Spending my time, making? A chime? And I'll throw away the rest  
Looking for ways to?...? And ease my mind  
Something I need, something I plea for, something I have to say  
Something to keep me safe when I'm away  
  
One way for me, one way for you, one way for all of us  
To get back home, do whatever we want to do  
Nothing to tell you, nothing to show, nothing that you don't know  
Something to play, something to say for now
