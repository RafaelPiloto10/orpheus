It seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe  
He got a smile that make the lilac want to grow  
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh  
When they know little Joe's passing by  
  
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare  
Soon he kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere  
Trouble fly away and life is easy go  
  
Does he love me good? That's all I has to know  
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe  
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe  
Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe
