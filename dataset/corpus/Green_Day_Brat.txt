Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days  
They're getting over the hill  
Death is closing in and catching up  
As far as I can tell  
Got a plan of action and cold blood  
And it smells of defiance  
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die  
And got my inheritance  
Now I want more  
Cause I'm getting bored  
And I'm going nowhere fast  
I was once filled with doubt  
Now it's all figured out  
Nothing good can last  
Crows feet and rot are setting in  
And time is running out  
My parent's income interest rate  
Is gaining higher clout  
I'm a snot nosed slob  
Without a job  
And I know I damn well should  
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days  
But my future's looking good
