Come all you merry makers  
You wine drinkers and heart breakers  
Pass me the bottle one more round  
Come all of you love makers  
All you cheaters and lie makers  
Fill me with happiness and bring on the clowns.  
  
There's a place around the corner and I can't wait to go  
I can't stay away from there when I'm feeling low  
Running from my problems, cheating on my wife  
Acting like a hobo, running out on life.  
Laughin loud, telling jokes, drinking to much wine  
Gathered 'round the table we're all one of a kind.  
  
Some come all you merry makers  
You wine drinkers and heart breakers  
Pass me the bottle one more round  
Come all of you love makers  
All you cheaters and lie makers  
Fill me with happiness and bring on the clowns.  
  
I thought that I was happy till I saw you walkin' in  
And through the loud and noisy crowd you reach out your hand  
I know I shouldn't be here, I really don't belong  
I'm proud that you still love me and you wanna take me home.  
  
Goodbye you merry makers  
You wine drinkers and heart breakers  
I'll be gone when the bottle passes 'round  
Goodbye you love makers  
All you cheaters and lie makers  
You'll never miss me when you bring on the clowns.  
  
'Cause I'll be with my baby when you bring on the clowns
