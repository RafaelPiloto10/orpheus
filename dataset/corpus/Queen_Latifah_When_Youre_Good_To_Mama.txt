Ladies and gentlemen  
The Keeper of the keys, the Countess of the clink  
The Mistress of murderers row  
Matron Mama Morton  
Ask any of the chickies in my pen  
They'll tell you I'm the biggest mutha hen  
I love them all and all of them love me  
Because the system works, the system called reciprocity  
Got a little motto  
Always sees me through  
When you're good to Mama  
Mama's good to you  
There's a lot of favors  
I'm prepared to do  
You do one for Mama  
She'll do one for you  
They say that life is tit for tat  
And that's the way I live  
So, I deserve a lot of tat  
For what I've got to give  
Don't you know that this hand  
Washes that one too?  
When you're good to Mama  
Mama's good to you  
If you want my gravy  
Pepper my raggoo  
Spice it up for Mama  
She'll get hot for you  
When they pass that basket  
Folks conribute too  
You put in for Mama  
She'll put out for you  
The folks a top the ladder  
Are the ones the world adores  
So boost me up my ladder kid  
And I'll boost you up your's  
Let's all stroke together  
Like the Princeton crew  
When you're strokin' Mama  
Mama's strokin' you  
So what's the one conclusion?  
I can bring this number to  
When you're good to Mama  
Mama's good to you
