I must be crazy now  
Maybe I dream too much  
But when I think of you  
I long to feel your touch  
To whisper in your ear  
Words that are old as time  
Words only you would hear  
If only you were mine  
  
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you  
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes  
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do  
And you'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side  
  
I love you  
Please say you love me too  
These three words  
They could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
Until the end of time  
  
So today I finally find the courage deep inside  
Just to walk right up to your door  
But my body can't move when I finally get to it  
Like a thousand times before  
Then without a word you handed me this letter  
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said  
  
I love you  
Please say you love me too  
Until the end of time  
  
Well maybe I, I need a little love, yeah  
Maybe I, I need a little care  
Maybe you, maybe you need somebody just to hold you  
If you do, Just reach out, I'll be there  
  
I love you  
Please say you love me  
Please say you love me too  
These three words, they could change our lives forever  
And I promise you that we will always be together  
  
Oh, I love you  
Please say you love me  
Please say you love me too  
Until the end of time  
Oh baby, my baby, together, forever  
I love you  
I will be your light  
Shining through your eyes
