In the heart of your most solemn barren night  
When your soul's turned inside out  
Have you questioned all the madness you invite  
What your life is all about  
  
Some of us choose to live gracefully  
Some can get caught in the maze  
And lose their way home  
This is the life we belong to  
Our gift divine  
  
Have you ever wished that you were someone else  
Traded places in your mind  
It's only a waste of your time  
  
Some of us choose to live gracefully  
Some can get caught in the maze  
And lose their way home  
This is the life we belong to  
Our gift divine  
  
Feed the illusion you dream about  
Cast out the monsters inside  
  
Life begins with an empty slate  
Fragile left in the hands of fate  
Driven by love and crushed by hate  
Until the day  
The gift is gone  
And shadows remain  
  
Some of us choose to live gracefully  
Some can get caught in the maze  
And lose their way home  
Memories will fade  
Time races on  
What will they say  
After you're gone  
This is the life we belong to  
Our gift divine  
Our gift divine
