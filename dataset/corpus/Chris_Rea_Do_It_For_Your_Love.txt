Each single day I get up and make my way  
And it all comes into view  
It's like a part in a play  
You can turn it around in so many different ways  
But it's still the part you play  
And so to you I dedicate  
This role they have handed me  
  
And I will do it for your love  
  
Down in the street you can win or lose  
To that crazy beat  
But you'll never change the tune  
Cause the tune is the song  
And song is the game of life, we just come and go  
But we can laugh and we can bend  
Together though, me and you  
  
So I will do it for your love  
  
Look around, see that you see  
There's no sense in being so blue  
Now I've got to have a reason for seeing this out  
Other than seeing it through  
  
So I will do it for your love
