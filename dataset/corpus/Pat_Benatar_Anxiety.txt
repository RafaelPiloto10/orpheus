Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
I feel a little shaky, I can't control my nerves  
I know you think I'm fakin', but can't you feel the curves?  
I swear to you I feel it, it scares me half to death  
It gathers in my throat and it gathers up my breath  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
I'm picking up the telephone, there's no one I can call  
I need somebody bad tonight, can't find no sleep at all  
I wish I could relax, I just can't stop my mind  
I wish I could collapse but my body's not that kind  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
Can't you hear my heartbeat, hear the way it sounds?  
Can't you hear my heartbeat, Y' hear the way it pounds?  
Just give me somethin' to slow it down, Yeah  
  
Sometimes in the city, sometimes in my car  
I pound on the windows like a bee inside a jar  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous
