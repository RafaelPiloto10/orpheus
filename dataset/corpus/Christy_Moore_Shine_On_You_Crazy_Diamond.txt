Remember when you were young  
You shone like the sun  
Shine on you crazy diamond  
Now there's a look in your eyes  
Like black holes in the sky  
Shine on you crazy diamond  
You were caught in the crossfire  
Of childhood and stardom  
Blown on the steel breeze  
Come on you target for faraway laughter  
Come on you stranger  
You legend  
You martyr  
And shine  
  
You reached for the secret too soon  
You cried for the moon  
Shine on you crazy diamond  
Threatened by shadows at night  
And exposed in the light  
Shine on you crazy diamond  
Well, you wore out your welcome  
With random percision  
Rode on the steel breeze  
Come on you raver  
You seer of visions  
Come on you painter  
You piper  
You prisoner  
And shine  
  
Nobody knows where you are  
How near or how far  
Shine on you crazy diamond  
Pile on many more years  
And I'll be joining you there  
Shine on you crazy diamond  
And we'll bask in the shadow  
Of yesterday's triumph  
Sail on the steel breeze  
Come on you boy child  
You winner and loser  
Come on you miner for truth and delusion  
And shine
