I love you, I love you, there's no other way  
Just one way to say "I love you"  
I love you, I love you, and, try as I may  
That's all I can say - "I love you"  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say "I love you"  
  
There's no other way  
Just one way to say "I love you"  
  
And, try as I may  
That's all I can say - "I love you"  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you, I love you, and yearn for the day  
The day when you'll say "I love you"
