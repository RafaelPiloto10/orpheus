When we were only 17  
And thrown into society  
That was the end of you and me  
From what we could have been  
  
And if we didn't keep in touch  
I guess we didn't care that much  
We never understood that stuff  
But now I need you  
  
I never meant to let you down  
But lettin' you down was easy  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your lives, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and you aren't  
But don't say no  
  
We fought together laughed together  
Said things that we hoped were clever  
The thought of missing you forever  
Makes me wanna cry  
  
And now that you've grown up to be  
A sentimental memory  
Are you still you 'cause I'm still me  
At least I hope so  
  
A life beginning somewhere else  
It was our time to die  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and you aren't  
Don't say no  
  
So, what do you know?  
Where do you go, has it been fun?  
Oh, did you survive being buried alive  
Like I did?  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and you want  
Don't say no  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and then you aren't  
Don't say no
