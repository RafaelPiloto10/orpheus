As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night  
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight  
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before  
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure  
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world  
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Oh yeah  
  
As I went down into the town to see what I could see  
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me  
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star  
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far  
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come  
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Hallelujah (repeated)  
  
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come  
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone  
  
[Chorus:]  
A child is born  
On this holy night  
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright  
So come to see  
Mary's sweet baby  
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully  
So peacefully  
Oh yeah
