No matter where I go baby  
No matter what I do  
I spend my whole life honey  
Just thinking of you  
  
Yeah it don't seem to matter  
Who's right or who's wrong  
I want to tell you how I feel now  
Through the words of this song  
  
Try to lock me out  
I can always get in  
I got every combination  
Every code and every pin  
  
Yeah I'm so crazy about you  
that's the word on the street  
I bet you hear all about it  
From the people you meet  
  
You know baby I put a spell on you  
Can't take it off  
Now their ain't nothing you can do  
One night baby put a spell on you  
There ain't nuthin that you gonna do  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I play the keys to you heart  
Yeah it sounds so sweet baby  
Won't stop once it starts  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I got the secret of your heart  
No matter were you go baby  
We're not too far apart  
  
Your all that I got  
Without you baby  
My life's kinda shot  
I look for your face  
'Cause no one else can  
fill this space  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I play the keys to you heart  
Yeah it sounds so sweet baby  
Won't stop once it starts  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I got the secret of your heart  
No matter were you go baby  
We're not too far apart
