The snitch, the snoop, the tattletale  
Lead a threadbare up stairs  
Adieu, my little ballyhoo  
You broke my heart in two  
And now I haunt the bars and scent those trite affairs  
She went home to gather her comb  
And caught him unawares  
  
And there was her man enjoying the lay of the land  
He took a walk in the dark with a dish from the stand  
Girls and their creations  
Tight in the brightest grenadine  
But I'd take all that I've seen  
For a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Josephine, Josephine  
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Gavotte, garrotes, Cotillions and slow Arabesques  
Drum-rolls and Farandoles were all made in jest  
But when you make that move  
I can't resist  
When will you declare your armistice?  
  
Josephine, Josephine  
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
In another time and place a different fate was cast  
He tried to skeddle-daddle-do  
She might have slapped him  
Just for saying "Grant one more chance before you pass"  
"Then curse the nurse that named me the first or bury me at last"  
  
And in three-quarter time  
The true and the false  
Dancing the "Hesitation Waltz"  
Then comes the "flirtation"  
And temptation  
Hip, hip hooray  
Listen to what I say  
Then you can take it away
