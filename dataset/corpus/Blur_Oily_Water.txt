Lead in me and me in water  
Dangling in my world  
I swallowed too much oily water  
It keeps slipping down my spine  
  
In a sense of self decline  
Growing fat on sound  
It's oly and early morning dream  
And the whole world will be alright  
  
My heads is full of suspicion  
I'm coming home sometime  
I've swallowed too much oily water  
It keeps slipping down my spine  
  
In a sense of self decline  
Growing fat on sound  
It's oly and early morning dream  
And the whole world will be alright
