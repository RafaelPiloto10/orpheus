I hopped off the plane at LAX  
With a dream and my cardigan  
Welcome to the land of fame excess,  
Whoa, am I gonna fit in?  
  
Jumped in the cab,  
Here I am for the first time  
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign  
This is all so crazy  
Everybody seems so famous  
  
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,  
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
  
[Chorus]  
So I put my hands up  
They're playing my song,  
And the butterflies fly away  
Noddin' my head like, yeah  
Movin' my hips like, yeah  
I got my hands up,  
They're playin' my song  
You know I'm gonna be okay  
Yeah, it's a party in the USA  
Yeah it's a party in the USA  
  
Get to the club in a taxi cab  
Everybody's looking at me now  
Like "who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?  
She's gotta be from out of town"  
  
So hard with my girls not around me  
Its definitely not a Nashville party  
Cause' all I see are stilettos  
I guess I never got the memo  
  
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and I'm nervous  
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)  
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)  
But something stops me every time (every time)  
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright  
  
[Chorus: x2]
