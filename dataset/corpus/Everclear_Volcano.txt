I like it here in this quiet room  
We can turn off all the trouble when we do what we do.  
I like it here in the middle of the day,  
We can hide inside each other when we need to get away  
From rest of world  
We need to get away from the world outside.  
Way from the world,  
Need to find the place where we can hide  
Somewhere they can't find us  
Yeah, somewhere under a volcano.  
We can hide inside a volcano  
We can find the good life on the inside.  
  
I like the crazy way you look at me,  
Without the drugs we can be what we're afraid to be.  
I remember what it's like to be clean and insane  
I remember what is that makes me need to get away.  
Away from of world  
We need to get away from the world outside.  
Away from the world,  
We need to find a place where we can hide, yeah  
Somewhere they can't find us  
Where my chain can pass from black to white  
They may let us out this time, oh.  
I made some mistakes, I paid the price  
I walked away clean, you know I did my time.  
You've been waiting for years, waiting for me.  
Waiting to leave so we can find a dream  
We can live under volcano with the fire all around  
We can lose yourself inside a dream  
In the middle of the northern sound.  
Get away from the world  
We need to get away from the world  
Gotta get away from the world.  
We got to get away, oh oh  
Get away from the world  
We got to get away, oh oh  
Away from the world  
You know we gotta find the place where we can hide  
Oh, somewhere we can hide.  
We can find the good life on the inside.
