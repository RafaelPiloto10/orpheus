The sun is overshadowed by the presence of the moon  
Night time has fallen, she'll be comin' home soon  
Leave the door wide open, ah, so she won't need a key  
Lock it behind you baby, draw the blinds so no one can see  
There's only one thing on my mind  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Silence is golden, ah, for me there's just one choice  
The music of your laughter, ripplin' of your voice  
The freshness of the evergreen, ah, fades as if too shy  
Can't compete with your beauty, couldn't if it tried  
There's only one thing on my mind  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Let's build somethin' to climb on  
Makin' the show a live one  
No need for make-up, let's be real  
Give all in what you're givin'  
Makin' life worth livin'  
Bein' alive's how you should feel  
Oh and don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Don't want the sun to be shinin'  
Raisin' his eyebrows at the moon  
Sayin' I told you, so she wouldn't show  
Well, don't speak too soon  
I hear her footsteps  
Walkin' on the outer floor  
Well, it could be  
I don't know, I don't know for sure  
There's only one thing on my mind  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Come on back, can't live without you  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I need you, I need you, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I want you, I want you, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I love you, I love you, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I need you, I need you, I)
