I know its past tense  
Its been a minute since  
We were a couple  
And, walking and holding hands  
  
Kisses and I love yous  
Doing what lovers do  
Baby  
Or baby that was then  
  
'Cause now we don't  
Talk no more  
You gotta a new man  
And, it shouldn't bother me  
  
But girl its driving me, crazy  
And everybody says  
Boy why don't you just leave it alone  
But I don't think I can  
  
[Chorus]  
I sit up all night  
Thinkin' bout ya  
And know it ain't right, baby  
But I don't  
I don't think, don't think that I  
That I can let go (Don't think I can let you know)  
  
I'm home alone and hope  
I know its a foolish thought  
Think that someday she might come back  
Wish on it all the time  
  
Knowin' it may never happen  
But see I'm not a fool  
'Cause no we don't  
Talk no more  
  
You gotta new man  
But, I'm gonna keep it safe  
I've got the patience  
That some lack  
But everybody says  
Boy why don't you just leave it alone  
But I don't think I can  
  
[Chorus]  
I sit up all night  
Thinkin' 'bout ya  
And know it ain't right, baby  
But I don't  
I don't think, don't think that I  
That I can let go (Don't think I can let you know)  
  
I don't think I can let you go  
I can't let you go  
No  
I don't think that I can let you go  
Let go  
And everybody says  
And I don't think I can  
  
[Chorus]  
I sit up all night  
Thinkin' bout ya  
And know it ain't right, baby  
But I don't  
I don't think, don't think that I  
That I can let go (Don't think I can let you know)
