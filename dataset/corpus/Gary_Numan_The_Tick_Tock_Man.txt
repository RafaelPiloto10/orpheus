Look at your face  
It's so fortunately arranged  
Don't look back  
I can assure you that you won't like what you see  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and I'm so uneasy  
  
Hotel rooms, sweet dreams  
Like slot machines that call it 'Love love'  
A coin in the hole  
You young things never stay young for longe  
  
This edge in my voice  
But there's really nothing much to say  
My conscience mends  
I suppose it all meant something to you.  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and I'm so uneasy
