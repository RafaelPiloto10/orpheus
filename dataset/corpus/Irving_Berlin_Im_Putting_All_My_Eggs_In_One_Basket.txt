I've been a roaming romeo  
My juliets have been many  
But now my roaming days have gone  
Too many irons in the fire  
Is worse than not having any  
I've had my share and from now on:  
  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting ev'rything I've got on you  
  
I'm giving all my love to one baby  
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through  
  
I've got a great big amount  
Saved up in my love account  
Honey  
And I've decided  
Love divided  
In two  
Won't do  
  
So  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting everything I've got on you

Heaven help me if my baby don't come through  
  
I've tried to love more than one  
Finding it just can't be done  
Honey  
There's one I lie to  
When I try to  
Be true  
To two  
  
So  
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket  
I'm betting everything I've got on you
