I never knew so many bad times  
Could follow me so mercilessly  
It's almost surreal  
All the pain that I feel  
The future ain't what it used to be  
  
It doesn't matter what they're thinking  
It doesn't matter what they're thinking of me  
It's always so cold  
I'm to young to be old  
The future ain't what it used to be  
  
Were there ever any stars in the sky  
Did the sun ever shine so bright?  
Do you have any dreams I could borrow  
Just to get me through the lonely night?  
Is there anything left to hold on to  
When the rivers wash it all away?  
Is there anyone left to hold on to  
Is there anything left I can say?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say a prayer for the falling angels  
Stem the tide of the rising waters  
Toll a bell for the broken hearted  
Burn a torch for your sons and daughters  
The endless night has got a hold of me  
Dark days are pulling me forward  
And all the tears are washing over me  
I'm crying, lost forever  
In a future that ain't what it used to be  
No more no more no more  
  
It's like a storm that's never ending  
It's like a shadow on the land and the sea  
There's nothing so sad as  
A tomorrow gone bad  
The future ain't what it used to be  
  
Some days I feel so numb and empty  
And those would be the good days for me  
Nothing gets to me now  
Unless I'm thinking of how  
The future ain't what it used to be  
  
Is there anything left to hold on to  
When the rivers wash it all away?  
Is there anyone left to hold on to  
Is there anything left I can say?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The future just ain't what it used to be  
It's never gonna be like it was  
The future just ain't what it used to be  
I wish it wouldn't come but it does  
I wish it wouldn't come but it always does
