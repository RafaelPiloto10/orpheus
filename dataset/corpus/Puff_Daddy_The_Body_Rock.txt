See when we like to make you shake your ass, move your hips  
So we gonna do a little something like this

Tell me how it feels, is it hot is not  
Does it drop cash like a slot  
Does it stay streeted go pop  
Checkin out what Flipmode got, mad hip-hop  
Chartin number one, drinks in the sun  
Eighty times so we can get sponged, shake it hon  
All a brother know is make the hit get the dough  
Makin grandmas hit the floor, really though  
It's my thang my slang  
Rich motherfuckers gettin chicks at the  
Bringin my team to the joint wit Alan Iversan runnin on point  
Don't smoke a spliff on the joint  
And when you see they on point  
Cause I, I be that nigga wit the million dollar figures  
Gettin all up in they bitches  
Leavin they pussy in stitches, uh  
  
[Rampage]  
Aiyyo I'm on to the next level  
I'm gettin rich, friends said I switch  
I got me a bad chick, live up in the hills  
Pay my mom's bills, recoup a half a mil  
Still got my deal, pop the 700 Benz-o  
You never seen, cash money fiend  
A lot of cats wanna dream  
Pack a shorty black or Phillipian  
The way I eat my shrimp with steam  
I'm the man with the gangsta lean, what, what  
Yo I split your whole spleen if you know what I mean  
Call me little rabcash, I get you for your stash  
Vip pass, ave all the gas, I make it last  
  
Chorus: Busta Rhymes  
  
To my people in the front if you ready to bump a say  
"Don't stop the body rock"  
To my people in the back if your not a wack a say  
"Don't stop the body rock"  
To my people in the left if you hot to death a say  
"Don't stop the body rock"  
To my people in the right wanna party tonight just say  
"Don't stop the body rock"  
  
[Mase]  
Since Mase refuse to lose, we makes numeral moves  
Cause I'm smoother than them dudes and them two thousand dollar shoes  
When I move to new Jerus, cause I like the cruise  
And my six double-o, blast weed, love the dough  
I'm that Goodfella, what the hella they can tell me  
Smoke my la la out in la, who's ready  
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy  
See angealan they winnin, a nigga need the chedda  
Cause I'm more in a broad way  
With all A's and platinum  
There been many things we touch  
Never had in finance so I never had to deduct shit 1. 8  
And every week I have to re-up  
So what, so what  
  
[Busta Rhymes]  
Aiyyo check out the way me and my niggas always be whippin shit  
The way that I display no flavor and do it so intricate  
Pidda and padda padda and pidda over with the shit  
You you you you you oh y'all niggaz be yappin to make me sick of it  
Hit you wit shit that y'all niggaz never ever forget  
Fuckin wit my niggaz just like you playin russian roulette  
Ooh me and my whole baton coming soon  
Make a make room, we diesel like a bunch of balloons  
A yo yo make ya damage, all of my niggaz damage ya  
Tryin to alter our lavage liven niggaz y'all turn savage  
Yo Flipmode and Bad Boy collabo'

Chorus 2X
