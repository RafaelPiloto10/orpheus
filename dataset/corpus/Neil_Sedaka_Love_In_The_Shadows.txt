In the shadows  
You get to know your lover mostly by feel  
Got to put your faith in things you can touch  
If you dare to  
'Cause the shadows can make you crazy  
With the things they reveal  
They show it all without revealing too much  
Scare the hell out of you  
'Cause me and my love  
Live among the shadows  
Where the old playground is an alley way  
Now me and my love make love among the shadows  
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway  
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes  
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow  
Me and my baby know love in the shadows  
In the shadows  
You got to work at love to get it to shine  
You can't believe in everything that you see  
Not this time around  
'Cause the shadows can play  
A half a million tricks on your mind  
You try your best but you can never break free  
It just kind of drags you down  
'Cause me and my love  
Live among the shadows  
Where the old playground is an alley way  
Now me and my love make love among the shadows  
When the sun goes down in a dark hallway  
Love in the shadows where the sun never shines  
Deep in the shadows where most men go blind  
Me and my baby find love in the shadows
