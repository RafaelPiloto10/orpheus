Where do you go?  
When you're alone and in your head  
Why do they know you?  
Is your story painted in red?  
What do you see?  
What do you dream when you're awake?  
What have they seen of you?  
Are you afraid of what's been said?  
  
And if time stood still  
If you won't be your witness  
No one ever will  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I would be a lucky girl if time stood on it's head  
Don't let me down  
  
Don't let me down  
Don't let them see  
These shadows fallen over me  
Where do you go?  
When you're awake and in your head?  
Why do they know you?  
Is your story painted in red?  
  
And if time stood still  
If I can't be my teacher  
No one ever will  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
That let me let me down  
  
And I can't choose the road ahead  
Close my eyes and hold my breath  
Hope my little debt won't let me down  
And I can't choose the road ahead  
And close my eyes and hold my breath  
Hope my little death won't let me down  
  
And if time stood still  
If I can't be my teacher  
No one ever will  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
That let me let me down  
  
I hear a voice that's in my head  
Don't let me down  
'Cause I can't hold the future in my head  
So many things I should have said  
That let me let me down  
  
'Cause I would be a lucky girl if time stood on it's head  
Don't let me down
