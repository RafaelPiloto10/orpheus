Called out to prove my love  
You reply by getting defensive  
Called out o prove my love  
Now you should be able to sense it  
  
I'm full of your dreams  
I let you sleep with the lights on  
Stay with me might as well  
Be the kind of girl you want to beI am in love  
  
I am in love  
I am a fool  
Fell from above  
These things that I have done  
  
They would be a test of anyone  
How am I meant to see  
You dressed up like your mother  
They say you marry your father  
  
I hope that don't reflect on me  
They say you marry your mother  
I hope that don't put you in her company  
I am in love  
  
I am in love  
And I am a fool  
There is no other  
I am in love  
  
I am in love  
What I say is don't lie  
But it's enough to make you wonder  
I can't be one that you want to trust  
  
And not the one that you want to trample  
In the dust  
I am in love  
I am in love  
  
And I am a fool  
There is no other  
I am in love  
I am in love  
  
Into the fire  
Tears start coming  
Good stars surround us  
It's enough to want to make you wonder
