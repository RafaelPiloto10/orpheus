Hmm...., well, well, well, well, well  
The mailman smiled as he handed me the news, tell you chil'  
I nearly jumped out of my shoes, the postcard read returning home tonight  
My body jumped with pure delight, I know you're gonna need  
Some tender lovin' care, whatever you need you know I'll be right there  
(Honey I won't deny you) that's one thing honey, that I'll never, never do  
(Honey, I won't deny you) you took care of me, I'll take of you  
(Doot, doot, doo, doo, doo) Now when I'm down (repeat Doo, doo)  
You make me feel better, and your love for me really keeps me together  
Come rain or shine, night or day, whenever you call me it'll be okay  
If you want to stop by 'cause you're in the neighborhood  
Or if you want me to make you feel real good (repeat Honey I won't deny you)  
Oh, no (I won't deny you) that's one thing I'll never do to you  
You took care of me, I'll take care of you (doot, doot, doo, doo, doo)  
You know my body hungers for you and I know that's right  
And when I can't get it, I get so uptight, here by my side  
Is where you aught to be if you bring your lovin' home to me  
(Repeat honey I won't deny you) I, that's one thing I'll never do to you  
I won't, cause you took care of me and I'll take care of you, oh, yeah, yeah  
Musical Interlude  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, (I won't deny you, I won't deny you)  
Here by my side is where you aught to be, if you bring your lovin' home to me  
I (I won't deny you, honey I won't deny you) That's one thing I'll never do,
no  
(I won't deny you) I, I won't deny you, I won't deny you, I won't deny you,  
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) I won't deny you
