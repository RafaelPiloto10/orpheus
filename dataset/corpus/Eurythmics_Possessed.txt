Got tired of being gifted and tormented  
Signed, sealed, delivered, then resented  
I think I've lost a very nice part of me  
And even though I'm only half the man I used to be  
It feels good  
I'm flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I even like myself again  
I'm not exactly sure of what I'm after  
But I won't be happy until I get it  
I'm either innocent or just plain stupid  
What's the betting I'll regret it  
But it feels good  
Feels like I'm home again  
Feeling safe and sound again  
I even like myself again  
And it feels good  
I'm flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I'll never touch the ground again  
Feels like I'm swimming in a sea of beauty  
Feels like I'm going round the bend  
God defend me from my enemies  
God defend me from my friends  
Cos it feels good  
I'm flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I even like myself again  
And it feels good (possessed)  
I'm coming home again (possessed)  
Feeling safe and sound again (possessed)  
I'll never touch the ground again (possessed)  
Cos  
It feels good
