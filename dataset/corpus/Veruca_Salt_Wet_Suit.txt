Roll the dice  
Now I wipe the tears from the skies  
Play your hand  
How I love my Marlboro man  
  
Say your prayers  
'Cause you've got enemies everywhere  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
In your cold bed, I'll never be torn from you  
  
Try to keep it together  
You try your best to forget her  
Silly me, always a sucker for monogamy  
Honesty seems to bring out the better in me  
  
Wish I knew another way to ruin the day for you  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
In your cold bed I'll never be torn from you  
Try to keep it together  
  
You try your best to forget her  
I just can't leave you this way  
When you're not okay  
Trains will pass through here someday  
  
And take you away  
But you won't let me hit the ground  
When my heart slows down  
Your wetsuit is keeping you warm  
  
In your cold head I'll never be torn from you  
Try to keep it together  
You try to keep it together  
  
Keep us together (ah)  
Keep us together (ah)  
Keep us together (ah)  
Keep us together (ah)
