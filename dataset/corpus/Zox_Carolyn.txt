The summer swept Chicago  
Left us with a little bit of rain  
We are trembling, glistening  
Listening to the rumble of the elevated train  
  
And I have never been afraid  
Of opening myself up to a dream  
And now you've filled me like a bubble  
And the trouble is I'm bursting at the seams  
  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
It has never been so quiet  
My heart will never beat this loud again  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
And walk back out amongst the strangers  
Strangers who've grown closer than my friends  
They grow closer than my friends  
  
A square of sunlight on the bedspread  
And I stagger through the silence 'til you wake  
We kiss away the morning  
Wishing that the morning lasted all day  
  
Well I have never been afraid  
Of opening myself up to a girl  
But now I've let you in  
You begin to shake my precarious world  
  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
It has never been so quiet  
My heart will never beat this loud again  
I can't leave you, Carolyn  
I walk back out amongst the strangers  
Strangers who've grown closer than my friends  
  
Sometimes love can be so  
Sometimes love can be so lonely  
Sometimes love can be so  
Sometimes love leaves you alone  
  
(Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I can't leave you, (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
I don't ever want to be lonely, lonely (Carolyn)  
(Carolyn)  
(Carolyn)
