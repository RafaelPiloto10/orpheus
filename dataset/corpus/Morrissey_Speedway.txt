And when you slam  
Down the hammer  
Can you see it in your heart?  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said, I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
  
So when you slam  
Down the hammer  
Can you see it in your heart?  
Can you delve so low?  
And when you're standing  
On my fingers  
Can you see it in your heart? Ah  
And when you try  
To break my spirit  
It won't work  
Because there's nothing left to break  
Anymore  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said, I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
  
You won't sleep  
Until the earth that wants me  
Finally has me  
Oh you've done it now  
You won't rest  
Until the hearse that becomes me  
Finally takes me  
Oh you've done it now  
And you won't smile  
Until my loving mouth  
Is shut good and proper  
Forever  
  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said, I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
And all those lies  
Written lies, twisted lies  
Well, they weren't lies  
They weren't lies  
They weren't lies  
  
I never said  
I never said  
I could have mentioned your name  
I could have dragged you in  
Guilt by implication  
By association  
I've always been true to you  
In my own strange way  
I've always been true to you  
In my own sick way  
I'll always stay true to you
