When I feel you dreaming  
I think of sunsets  
How high my high gets  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wanna give to you an everlasting love  
I wanna fill your life with a satisfying love  
All you need is an everlasting love  
All you want is a mystifying love  
  
Sun breezes, moonlight teases  
  
Friendly invasion  
Late night persuasion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Each time you pass me by  
You saw me fade away  
I'll give you more each day
