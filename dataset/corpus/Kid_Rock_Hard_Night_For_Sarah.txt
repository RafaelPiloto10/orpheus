Its been a hard night for sarah  
The divorce went through today  
Ten years out the window  
She's been faithful all the way  
  
She's feeling really bitter  
She's feeling lost and small  
She wonders where it all went wrong  
  
Its been a hard night for sarah  
She's taken quite a fall  
  
Well he was all she ever hoped for  
And she gave him all she had  
Never gave a cause to worry  
Never hurt her or made her sad  
  
And no one thought to tell her  
They all figured that she knew  
Just another harmless fling  
A phase all men go through  
  
Its been a hard night for sarah  
She's going to have to see it through  
Gonna have to see it through  
  
The sun is slowly rising  
On another brand new day  
The children will be waking soon  
And shell send them on their way  
  
It's been a hard night for sarah  
It's been a hard night for sarah  
It's been a hard night for sarah  
But today is another day  
Today is another day
