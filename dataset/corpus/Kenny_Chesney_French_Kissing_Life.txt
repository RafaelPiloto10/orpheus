Don't really know what day it is  
Been rocking nine days in a row  
All I know is it's hurricane season  
And any minute she's gonna blow  
  
I need a shave and I need some rest  
I know some people are worried about me  
But I'm french kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Went through customs and immigration  
Still this feels like home  
I'm floating 'round through Gorda Sound  
With a cooler and a bong  
  
Maybe I could've been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Tonight I don't need to feel famous  
Out here all I feel is free  
  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
Maybe I could've been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea
