Yeah, everything, everything was the same  
  
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck  
Rather hold my head high and die, then live and duck  
I gotta set it off, Jada Queen and Vivica  
The last chick was scared to get that money, I can't live like her  
Got no problem with you, niggas, get it how you live it, bro  
It's a cold world, these mean streets will shiver you  
All I asks is for the same respect that I be giving you  
If not my boy will put the beats on you, Karen Civil you  
That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia  
My advice, don't mess with his man, word to Nivea  
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia  
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia  
That's when you would go uptown 'cause you had to re' there  
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair  
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware  
That was the 90's, y'all wouldn't get it, you had to be there  
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it  
It's hard to get off the ground, y'all think I just levitated  
Y'all think it was all love and nobody ever hated  
Y'all think 'cause I never stated I never been devastated  
All y'all see is sun shining, think I was never shaded  
Y'all think these calendar models is all that I ever dated  
Nigga, nothing was the same, HOT 97 played it  
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 played it  
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated  
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated  
You know why? 'Cause when you good the devil hate it  
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted  
Attention, I never paid it, me and this clever lady  
She brains, do some things, then we lay together faded  
And while I chill, loaded up a steel  
Just wishing a nigga would but knowing a nigga will  
But for real, nigga, good is how you feel  
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will  
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will  
  
Damned if you do them, if you don't, don't, don't, don't  
They don't have a hand on your head of what you're doing now  
You're damned if you do them, if you don't  
People sit around and judge you anyway  
Don't, don't, don't
