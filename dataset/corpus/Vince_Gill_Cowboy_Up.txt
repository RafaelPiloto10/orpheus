I'm puttin' on my favorite cowboy boots  
Like a crazy bull rider comin' out of the chute  
I'm ready for some dancin', maybe too much beer  
Little bare-back rubbin's goin' on in here  
Hey little cowgirl, leave the Stetson on  
Let's cowboy up and down, honey, all night long  
She said her name was Levitra Marcantonio  
I'm a bare back rider, okie, don't you know?  
These frozen margaritas are goin' to my head  
I could not believe it when Levitra said  
?Hey Mr. Cowboy, come on and take me home  
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long?  
All night long, oh, you're comin' on strong  
All night long, come on and do me wrong, do me wrong, baby  
Hey little cowgirl, leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long  
Hey little cowgirl, leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down till Levitra's gone
