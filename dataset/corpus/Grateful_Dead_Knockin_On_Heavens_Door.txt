Mama take this badge from me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Mama put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That cold black cloud is comin' down  
Feels like I'm knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation Jack  
'Cause it's just you against your tattered libido, the bank and the mortician  
Forever man  
And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on Heaven's door
