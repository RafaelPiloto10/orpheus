[Verse 1]  
I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping  
I'm always sleeping naked in case you wake up and you're creeping  
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my
tongue  
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips  
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking baby  
I want to make your fantasies reality I want to be yours baby  
  
[Hook]  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
[Verse 2]  
There ain't nothing that I'm scared to try  
I can be on top or if you like it I'll just lie here  
Take my picture position my body  
Wherever you like just know that I like it naughty  
Teach me a lesson pretend we never met  
But we can't keep just kissing cause you're getting me so wet  
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving  
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up cause I'm screaming  
What are you doing to me  
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free  
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage  
Here I am, here you are  
I want it so hard  
You finger my heart  
And I know just what I need, what I came here to do  
I've been thinking baby, been mostly about you  
  
[Hook]  
I want you to bang my box  
I want you to bang my box  
  
[Outro]  
You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face I want you to eat
it baby
