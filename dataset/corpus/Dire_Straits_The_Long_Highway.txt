Heard a bell being toll  
Before the break of day  
I heard then my name being called  
Down that long highway  
  
You don't get long  
You don't get long  
You don't get long to stay  
  
Kissing me once and I'll be gone  
Down that long highway  
  
Spirits call from way beyond  
Lord I may not disobey  
Spare a thought for the vagabond  
Down that long highway  
Down that long highway  
Down that long highway
