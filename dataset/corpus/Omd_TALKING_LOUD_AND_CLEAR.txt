Talking loud and clear, saying just what we feel  
Lying in the grass with the sun on our backs  
It doesn't really matter what we do or what we say  
With every little movement, we give ourselves away  
  
Opposite and opposite, decisions are reversed  
Facing one another with words that couldn't hurt  
With every little word you're getting closer to me  
Talking loud and clear, saying just what you feel today  
  
Talking loud and clear, saying just what we feel  
Lying in the grass, we've got time on our hands  
Body next to body with silence all around  
We understand each other but didn't make a sound  
Promises and promises of vows we shall return  
Facing one another, I thought my heart would burn  
You turn to move away but then get closer to me  
Talking loud and clear, saying just what you feel today
