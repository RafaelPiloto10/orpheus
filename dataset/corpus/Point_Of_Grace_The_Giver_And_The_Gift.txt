Three men and a star in the sky  
Oh what I would give for a wisdom so bright  
One girl with a journey to make  
Oh how I wish I was that brave  
  
Fearless, shameless, faith through the dark  
How I wish I was as strong as they are  
  
You say come to me wait no more  
I give you all you're asking for  
Forget the lies this world has told  
I'll wrap your life in linen gold  
I'm more than just only  
One night that's holy  
I?m your star and I'm your wish  
Cause I am both the giver and the gift  
  
A child far away born in the night  
Too young to know what is meant for his life  
But he'll grow and he'll love more than anyone can  
And the world's gonna see a light where he stands  
  
He'll say come to me wait no more  
I give you all you're asking for  
  
Forget the lies this world has told  
I'll wrap your life in linen gold  
I'm more than just only  
One night that's holy  
I'm your star and I'm your wish  
Cause I am both the giver and the gift  
  
Christmas Eve, all I see  
Is snow on the trees  
And it's white and it glows  
That's how I want to be  
  
And You say come to me wait no more  
I give you all you're asking for  
Forget the lies this world has told  
I'll wrap your life in linen gold  
I'm more than just only  
One night that's holy  
I'm your star and I'm your wish  
Cause I am both the giver and the gift  
The giver and the gift
