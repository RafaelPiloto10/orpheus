Put your faith in what you most believe in  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart  
Let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see  
  
A paradise untouched by man  
Within this world blessed with love  
A simple life, they live in peace  
  
Softly tread the sand below your feet now  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart  
Let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see  
  
Beneath the shelter of the trees  
Only love can enter here  
A simple life, they live in peace  
  
Raise your head up  
Lift high the load  
Take strength from those that need you  
Build high the walls  
Build strong the beams  
A new life is waiting  
But danger's no stranger here  
  
No words describe a mother's tears  
No words can heal a broken heart  
A dream is gone, but where there's hope  
  
Somewhere something is calling for you  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart  
Let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see
