I can't explain a thing  
I want everything  
To change and stay the same on top  
Doesn't care about anyone or anything  
Now come together, come apart  
Only get lonely when you read the charts  
  
Oh baby, when they made me  
They broke the mold  
Girls used to follow me around  
Then I got cold  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw your cameras in the air  
And wave 'em like you just don't care  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
Oh change will come  
Oh change will come  
I will never believe in anything again  
We never believe again  
Kick drum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
  
Oh, I'm a mascot for what you've become  
And oh, oh, I love the mayhem more than the love  
And oh baby, when they made me  
They broke the mold  
Girls used to follow me around  
When I got cold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, throw your cameras in the air  
And wave 'em 'cause I just don't care  
Oh, throw your cameras in the air  
And wave 'em 'cause I just don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
Oh, change will come  
Oh, change will come  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand
