Settle down, class  
Now you've passed  
Your grade one pyramid selling  
Yeah, the time has come  
For me to drum  
Some facts into you about spelling  
  
Oh, it seems to me  
Your abc  
Skills are less than terrific  
So buck up, boys  
As we master the joys  
Of the lovely hieroglyphics!  
  
Everyone needs their abc  
It's as simple as... Vulture, foot, basket  
You know how to sing doh-ray-me  
Easy to spell, it's... Hand, eye-thingy, owl  
  
Abc  
Vulture, foot, basket  
Doh-ray-mee  
Hand, eye-thingy, owl  
  
You'll pass with ease  
And find it's a breeze  
The rules are scientific  
Don't have to be smart  
All you do is start  
With simple phonetic glyphics  
  
Next you get two letters, a set  
More things called logographic  
Finally third, the form of a word  
Determinitives... Horrific!  
  
Everyone needs their... Flamingo, house, sun  
It's simple, but 'sun' can mean duck, everyone  
You all know how to write your name  
Except for me - Tutanephututakhamen  
  
Flamingo, house, sun  
Means duck to some  
Tutanephututakhamen  
Let's leave that one!  
  
If you find it hard, don't be afraid  
To go and ask your mummy for aid  
Now it's time for a spelling bee  
That's not how you spell bee, see me!  
Foot, reed, reed, easy!  
  
Cat, pig, dog, rat, dog, frog  
Make your spelling magnific  
You can go up and down  
Left and right and around  
No punctuation in hieroglyphics  
  
A, B, C, D, E, F, G  
Just seven hundred characters or so  
Now that's done  
Let's have some fun  
With numbers, here we go!  
  
Everyone needs their 1, 2, 3  
It's as simple as... Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye  
You can all count to ninety-nine  
Easy to write it's... Hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop  
Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye  
  
1, 2, 3  
Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye eye  
Ninety-nine  
Hoop hoop hoop hoop, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye...  
Basket?
