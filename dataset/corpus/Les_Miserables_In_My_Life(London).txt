COSETTE:  
In my life  
I have all I could want.  
You are loving and gentle and good  
But Papa, dear Papa,  
In your eyes I am just like a child  
who is lost in a wood.  
  
VALJEAN:  
No more words  
No more, it's a time that is dead  
There are words  
That are better unheard  
Better unsaid.  
  
MARIUS:  
In my life  
She has burts like the music of angels  
the light of the sun!  
and my life seems to stop  
as if something is over  
and something has scarcely begun!  
  
MARIUS AND EPONINE:  
In my life  
there is someone who touches my life.  
  
MARIUS:  
waiting near!  
  
EPONINE:  
waiting here!
