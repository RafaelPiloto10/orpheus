To get up and walk away will be too easy  
So stay and stand your ground just watch your mouth with me  
On the back of every right, there's a wrong looming  
So here you and I should tread assault  
As these razorblades for boots will it be  
  
Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?  
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?  
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes  
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem  
  
Unabashed honesty would be ideal  
But a prophet did once say, that honesty's our only word  
So where do we go from here? Abandon ship now!  
My problem is you made me melt and I don't want to be frozen anymore  
  
Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?  
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?  
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes  
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem  
  
Oh oh no oh no  
  
Have you ever, have you ever tried to, I have never, I have never tried to!  
  
Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?  
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?  
And if you ever try to fit in my shoes  
They'll never be quite as soft as they seem
