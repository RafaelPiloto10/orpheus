Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time  
Staring at the golden heights, wondering are you ready for the climb  
  
Are you ready for this? If you're ready to believe it, treasure you'll find  
Are you ready for that?  
Are you ready for this? Don't mistake the chance, focus your eyes  
Will you take the chance? When you're ready to receive it, fear's left behind  
Well, you've got the time  
  
A new perspective, a new state of mind  
  
Always on the edge of what could be the greatest moment in this life  
Watching as the theme builds, left only to wonder in delight  
  
You've got to let it go You've got to let yourself believe in all that can be  
You've got to let it go  
Wanting to feel Wanting to feel just what it means to be free  
There's no reason for deceiving There's no reason for deceiving, focus your
eyes  
  
To a new perspective, a new state of mind  
  
Sometimes you feel you want to run away from it all  
Sometimes you hear the voices of the past come to call  
But there's no giving up when you are giving it all  
  
Hoping, forgiving and loving, the qualities of life  
Designing the future we're building, the dreams taking flight  
  
Are you ready for love?  
Are you ready for love?  
Are you ready for love?  
  
A new state of mind  
  
Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time  
Reaching for the golden heights without a doubt you're ready for the climb  
  
You've got to set it out You've got to set yourself believing and fortunes
you'll find  
You've got to set it out  
No escaping No escaping once you've made up your mind  
There's a reason for your being There's a reason for your being, focus your
eyes  
  
A new perspective, a new state of mind
