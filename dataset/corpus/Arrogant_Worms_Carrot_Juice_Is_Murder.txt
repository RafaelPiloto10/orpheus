Listen up brothers and sisters come hear my desperate tale  
I speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like a jail  
Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night  
This killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight  
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime  
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just cause a radish can't scream  
  
[Chorus]  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (having their insides revealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)  
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell)  
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade is a spade)  
  
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue  
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two  
I'm a political prisoner, trapped in a windowless cage  
Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a rage  
I told the judge when he sentenced me, "This is my finest hour,  
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower"  
  
[Chorus]  
How low as people do we dare to stoop,  
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup?  
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes  
Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato!  
Oh spare the spud! Eat a cow instead!  
  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir-fry are sealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob)  
How do you think that feels? (leave them out in the field)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes, your composts are graves)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (take up macrame)  
Let's call a spade a spade  
(is a spade, is a spade, is a spade, is a spade......)  
  
Power to the peas! Give peas a chance!  
all we are saying, is give peas a chance
