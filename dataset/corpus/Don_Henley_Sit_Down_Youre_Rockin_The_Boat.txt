I dreamed last night  
I was on the boat to heaven  
By some chance  
I had brought my dice along  
And there I stood  
And I hollered someone fade me  
But the passengers they knew right from wrong  
  
And the people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
The people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Cause the devil will drag you under  
By the sharp lapels of your checkered coat  
Sit down Sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Oooh Oooh Oooh (scat)  
Oooh Oooh Oooh  
  
As I sailed  
With those passengers to heaven  
By some chance  
I found a bottle in my fist  
And there I stood  
Nicely passing out the whiskey  
But the passengers were bound to resist  
  
And the people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
The people all said sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Cause the devil will drag you under  
By the sharp lapels of your checkered coat  
Sit down Sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Oooh Oooh Oooh  
Oooh Oooh Oooh  
  
As we sail  
On that tiny boat to heaven  
Great big wave  
Came and washed me over board  
And as I sank  
Oh I hollered someone save me  
That's the moment I woke up  
Thank the lord  
  
And I said to myself sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
I said to myself sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Cause the devil will drag you under  
By the sharp lapels of your checkered coat  
Sit down Sit down  
Sit down you're rockin the boat  
Sit down (Sit down) Sit down (Sit down)  
Sit down Sit down you're rockin the boat
