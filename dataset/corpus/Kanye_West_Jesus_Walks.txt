Order, huh  
Yo, we at war  
We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves  
  
(Jesus Walks)  
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down  
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)  
  
You know what the Midwest is?  
Young and Restless  
Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace  
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus  
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is  
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is  
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless  
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard  
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method  
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us  
Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"  
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?  
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases  
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis  
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us  
Well Mama, I know I act a fool  
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope  
  
(Jesus Walks)  
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down  
(Jesus Walks with me)  
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)  
(Jesus Walks)  
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs  
(Jesus Walks with me)  
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long  
(I want Jesus)  
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down  
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now  
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs  
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so
long  
  
So long  
(Jesus Walks with me)  
  
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers  
(Jesus walks for them)  
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah  
(Jesus walks for them)  
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly  
I know He hear me when my feet get weary  
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct  
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think  
I ain't here to argue about his facial features  
Or here to convert atheists into believers  
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers  
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus  
So here go my single dog radio needs this  
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus  
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape  
But if I talk about God my record won't get played  
Huh?  
Well let this take away from my spins  
Which will probably take away from my ends  
Then I hope this take away from my sins  
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about  
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out  
  
(Jesus Walks)  
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down  
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)  
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
