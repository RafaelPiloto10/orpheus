Hope, a new beginning  
Time, time to start living  
Just like just before we died  
  
There's no going back to the dreams we started from  
  
Hurt, falling through fingers  
Trust, trust in the feeling  
There's something left inside  
  
There's no going back to the dreams we started from  
All secrets known  
  
Calm, old wounds are healing  
Strong, truth is worth saving  
I want to feel alive  
  
There's no going back to the dreams we started from  
All secrets known
