Everywhere the sun is shining.  
All around the world it's shining.  
But cold winds blow across your mind.  
Confusion--it's such a terrible shame.  
Confusion--you don't know what you're sayin'.  
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on.  
You feel there's no-one there for you to lean on.  
  
Every night you're out there darlin'.  
You're always out there runnin'.  
And I see that lost look in your eyes.  
Confusion,I don't know what I should do.  
Confusion,I leave it all up to you.  
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on.  
You feel there's no-one there for you to lean on.  
  
Dark is the road you wander.  
And as you stand there under.  
The starry sky,you feel sad inside.  
Confusion,you know it's drivin' me wild.  
Confusion,it comes as no big surprise.  
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on.  
You feel there's no-one there for you to lean on.
