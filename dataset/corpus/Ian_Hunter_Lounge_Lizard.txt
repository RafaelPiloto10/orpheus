Well I picked her up on a Saturday night  
Pool hall poison but she felt alright  
Oh dear what a sight when I saw her in the light of day  
She was a speakeasy sleazer of the highest degree  
Oh you should hear the stories she was laying on me  
We really got it on as she held my point of view  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh! She's a lounge lizard  
Coming on strong  
Who you fooling  
It's me you're with  
Lounge lizard  
Come on come on  
You got to be joking  
Give give give yeah  
  
Well I don't care if your sister's a john  
I don't mind where your momma come for  
Just give it to me  
Just pull it through me  
Alright  
  
Golly is a dolly got makeup on  
I don't mind just keep your raincoat on  
No hesitation, no reputations to scale us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I said give give give  
Give give give [Repeat x 4]
