Cigarette lit  
My plans to quit  
And I know I can but I know I will forget it  
Stuck here, I need something quick  
Jus' to stop me thinking  
Always loud, always in  
Jus' come in to me  
  
Excuse me please, what have you got?  
Get me out of my head while I've still got the courage  
But not so out, just out enough till I feel like I'm takin' off  
  
The rain falls down, I'm not alone  
Covers all of us in silver line, silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night  
  
What a gift, this short visit  
And I know I'll go just as quick as I came in  
Night stick, my finger tips  
Jus' stop me thinking  
Always out, always in  
Oh jus' come in to me  
  
Excuse me please what have you got  
Get me out of my head while I've still got the courage  
Not so out, just out enough till I feel like I'm takin' off  
And the rain fall down, I'm so alone  
And covered all of us with silver line, in silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night  
  
I'm always out, always in  
Jus' come in to me  
Not so out, just out enough till I feel like I'm takin' off  
And the rain falls down, I'm not alone  
And covers all of us in silver line, in silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night, oh oh  
And the rain falls down, I'm not alone  
It covers up in a silver line, in silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night
