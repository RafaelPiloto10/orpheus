I was staying at the Marriott  
With Jesus and John Wayne  
I was waiting for a chariot  
They were waiting for a train  
  
The sky was full of carrion  
"I'll take the mazuma"  
Said Jesus to Marion  
"That's the 3:10 to Yuma  
My ride's here..."  
  
The Houston sky was changeless  
We galloped through bluebonnets  
I was wrestling with an angel  
You were working on a sonnet  
  
You said, "I believe the seraphim  
Will gather up my pinto  
And carry us away, Jim  
Across the San Jacinto  
My ride's here..."  
  
Shelley and Keats were out in the street  
And even Lord Byron was leaving for Greece  
While back at the Hilton, last but not least  
Milton was holding his sides  
  
Saying, "You bravos had better be ready to fight  
Or we'll never get out of East Texas tonight  
The trail is long and the river is wide  
And my ride's here"  
  
I was staying at the Westin  
I was playing to a draw  
When in walked Charlton Heston  
With the Tablets of the Law  
  
He said, "It's still the Greatest Story"  
I said, "Man I'd like to stay  
But I'm bound for glory  
I'm on my way  
My ride's here..."
