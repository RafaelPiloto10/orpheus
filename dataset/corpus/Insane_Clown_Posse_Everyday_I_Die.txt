[Violent J]  
Time, is all I have anymore  
[Verse - Violent J]  
I tried to visit Shaggy, I stepped up off of my porch  
And it was dark as fuck I couldn't see, not even with a torch  
I hear the streets talkin', and they aware of my move  
They whisperin' and swingin' from the trees, above I hear the loons  
I try to jog a little, crow eyes glow like cats  
Demonic zombies runnin' up on me, I slap 'em with the bat  
But my eyes keep bleedin' from the rays of the darkness  
They powerful and burn you somethin heartless (uh!)  
I hear a giant thumpin', some kind of ogre or somethin'  
I see the phantom screamin' as this giant behemoth is comin'  
And it swung at me, I felt a rip my head went spinnin'  
And flippin' and rollin' and finally landed in position  
I could see my body still standin', headless as fuck  
It finally fell but what the hell, still got my nugget but I'm stuck  
I can't move fuck I'm only a face, why even try?  
On top of that, it's a centipede crawlin' in my eye  
I want to die..  
[Hook] - x2  
Everyday I die  
Back to the start, another try  
I got the time so why should't I?  
[Violent J]  
I got too much time on my hands  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I tried to visit J, I walked out into the cold  
I see they don't collect they dead, they all up over the road  
And some are fully rotted, and some they must've just spotted  
I seen a headless body that resembles J's, but I doubt it  
I seen a centaur, I threw a pitch fork at it above  
I watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood  
I'm fuckin' 'bout to hurl, I close my eyes and walk on  
It's giant crows swoopin at me, got me carry me on  
I cut it's claws with the hatchet that I keep in my hand  
Even in Hell, you best believe I keep the hatchet in my hand  
And as I'm fallin' now, I see the Witch is ridin' my chest  
With its claws on my neck, screamin' I should've confessed  
I slammed down into an iron gate, a demon statue near me  
Four points stickin' out my chest, I'm hangin' there dearly  
And the hungry goblins, they got a fire beneath me  
They cookin' my legs, to make myself eat me  
I want to die..  
[Hook] - x2  
Everyday I die  
Back to the start, another try  
I got the time so why should't I?  
[Violent J]  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
I got too much time on my hands  
[Hook] - x2  
Everyday I die  
Back to the start, another try  
I got the time so why should't I?
