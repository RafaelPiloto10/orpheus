I was cold till you touched me  
Fear had no place to hide  
I felt nothing but sadness  
Love is the great divide  
  
Felt like someone was counting  
The tears that rush from my eyes  
I was broken and doubting  
Love and my own sweet pride  
  
Come clean, come clean  
You know where you've been  
Slipping and stepping inside  
Come clean, come clean  
I know that's a dream  
Love is the divide  
  
Felt a rush from the mountain  
Oh lord, i pushed you aside  
I felt nothing but sadness  
I'll be alone tonight  
  
How can we lose? there's no laws to abuse  
There was never more passion in crime  
You took my hand, told me you'd understand  
There'd be time, so much time  
  
I was cold till you touched me  
Fear had no place to hide  
I felt nothing but sadness  
Love is the great divide
