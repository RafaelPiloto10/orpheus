No one on earth means more to me Your painted pictures are the way that the
world should be Don't ever change it, I don't wanna live in this world without
you Oh no I can't explain, I can't define What you do to me, but my senses are
so alive You tell your story and it's all that I ever believe Portraits and
poetry are frozen forms of perfection But they don't live and breathe When my
heart's in need they don't answer me You - ooo oooh you are, you're a human
work of art Walking, talking inspiration You - ooo oooh you are, you're a
human work of art You make me love, you make me care You give me freedom I
don't need when I know you're there My search is over I've got all of the
riches that money don't buy, Oh no Your words are poetry and your face is more
than perfection The way I watch you move it only goes to prove In everything
to do You - oooh oooh you are, you're a human work of art Walking, talking
inspiration You - ooooh ooh you are, you're a human work of art You're my
mission You're my goal Oooh you liberate my soul There's no illusion, that
your touch is gold Portraits and poetry are frozen forms of perfection The way
I watch you move it only goes to prove In everything you do You - oooh oooh
you are, you're a human work of art Walking, talking new sensation You - ooooh
oooh you are, you're a human work of art Walking, talking inspiration
