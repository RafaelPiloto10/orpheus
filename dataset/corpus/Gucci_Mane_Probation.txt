If you ain't rhyming... Go suck your mamma's pussy niggaare, chill  
... Shit,... Got probation  
Dirty did two out of ten I on parole  
And I'ma go... Cause it caught a violation, holy shit  
And this music tells me to like it's an occupation  
  
Ain't no other one, ain't no better run, ain't nowhere to stand  
Hold your money tight  
Running out of time, got... In disguise, the rain is at your...  
I wanna see you shinning, ain't nowhere to run  
  
... Gotta nodest... Hard top loaders and Ferrari troopers  
Ain't nowhere to run so I'm standing here  
No need to panic I'll complain a deal  
Big goosie and this motherfucker what you know  
About green money...  
I'm on paper work, my paper work, my paper trail tell me the detail  
I sell everything if I had the chance  
Since you give him a low one to the...  
But it's hard to appeal when you're man to please  
... Claiming need  
All greed, jealousy...  
Ok, marine is our sight of me  
Ain't nowhere to run, you can't... Me  
I'ma grind... Tell on me  
Wanna see me shine...  
Gucci Mane... And I control the steet  
  
Ain't no other one, ain't no better run, ain't nowhere to stand  
Hold your money tight  
Running out of time, got... In disguise, the rain is at your...  
I wanna see you shinning, ain't nowhere to run
