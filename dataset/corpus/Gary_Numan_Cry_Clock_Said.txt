Why cry now  
It's over  
Feelings change  
How are you  
How am I  
Cry, the clock said.  
  
I know little of romance  
And these little tract houses  
I know even less of you  
And if you should ever think of me  
Maybe as a game you lost  
Well someone I know lost the whole damn world  
No more this talk of they're out to get me  
Just slide out of Sydney and I can never go back  
How could I be surprised  
How could I even believe  
Cry, the clock said  
I'll forget who you are  
I'll forget one of these days  
Cry, the clock said
