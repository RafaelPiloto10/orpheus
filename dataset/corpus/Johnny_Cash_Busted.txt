My bills are all due and the babies need shoes but I'm busted  
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound and I'm busted  
I've got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay  
A big stack of bills that get bigger each day EE  
The County will haul my belongings away I'm busted!  
  
I went to my brother to ask for a loan I was busted  
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted  
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do  
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu  
And I was just thinking of calling on you I'm busted!  
  
Lord I'm no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted  
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted  
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow  
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go  
Where I'll make a livin' the Lord only knows but I'm busted!
