Don't know much about practicing what I preach,  
Don't know how to be envious without jealousy,  
Don't know how to hold my temper, when I have to get in the last word,  
Don't know how to speak softly and still be heard,  
But before I lose everything and everyone who loves me...  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Don't know much about love cause I get the same crap from every guy,  
Don't know how to see the grass being greener on my side,  
Don't know much about wisdom without being jaded,  
Don't know how to take criticism without feeling hated,  
But before I lose everything and everyone who loves me...  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Whoa man, I'm everything I said I wouldn't be,  
Standing here with nothing, will you help me?  
Don't know how to tell a joke without putting my foot in my mouth,  
Don't know how to be intimate if I don't have a crowd,  
Don't know how to be hopeful, what if they let me down?  
I don't know how to keep myself from hurting everyone...  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
God if you're listening would you have a message sent?  
Cause I need to be a better lover, brother, and a friend.  
God if you're listening would you come up with some change?  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name.  
Oh, God, I don't know much about nothing.  
No, so give me a break.  
Anyway, won't anybody listen to me?  
Oh, oh.
