Every morning when the people are out  
And I'm free move around on my own  
I look into the sun and I see a reflection  
Of a sad and lonely shrivelled man  
That's me, that's me  
And I know it's how I'm always gonna be  
  
Nothing to do, nothing to say  
Nothing to hope, and nothing to pray  
  
I can see, I can feel  
I've forgotten what I'm meant to be  
Won't come back, not if I try  
  
They told me things about me that I didn't know  
But I could tell they've told me lies  
And it really goes to show  
That everyone was wrong  
And they don't understand my ways  
But it's not me that's going wrong, it's them  
  
I can see, I can feel  
I've forgotten what I'm meant to be  
Won't come back, not if I try  
  
They told me things about me that I didn't know  
But I could tell they've told me lies  
And it really goes to show  
That everyone was wrong  
And they don't understand my ways  
But it's not me that's going wrong, it's them  
  
Every morning when the people are out  
And I'm free move around my own  
I look into the sun and I see a reflection  
Of a sad and lonely shrivelled man  
  
That's me, that's me  
And I know it's how I'm always gonna be  
  
That's me, that's me  
And I know it's how I'm always gonna be  
  
Shrivelled old man  
Who hides from a world  
He's never seen the light  
That can set him free  
His vicious life  
Is such a shame  
I wanna find out who's to blame  
  
And that's me, oh that's me, aaoh  
Set me free
