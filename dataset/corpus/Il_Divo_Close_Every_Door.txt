Close every door to me,  
Hide all the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
Do what you want with me,  
Hate me and laugh at me  
Darken my daytime  
And toture my night  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Just give me a number  
Instead of my name  
Forget all about me  
And let me decay  
I do not matter,  
I'm only one person  
Destroy me completely  
Then throw me away  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door to me,  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel  
Are never alone  
  
For we know we shall find  
Our own peace of mind  
For I have been promised  
A land of  
A land of our own!  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door  
Close every door to me
