(i don't like to be back)  
  
You see things in life  
And you're bit surprise what you see  
Life, your whole life, is changes  
You go through changes in your life  
One second you've got it made  
Next second you're down in the dumps  
And it goes back and forth  
Throughout your whole life  
One second you've got the most beautiful girl in the world  
Next second you don't even have a girlfriend no more  
And it goes back and forth  
And back and forth, you known  
And this is life man, it's changes  
This is what you gotta go through throughout your whole lifetime  
  
I'm going through changes  
I'm going through changes  
I'm going through changes  
  
And it goes back and forth  
And back and forth, you known  
  
Never  
Never  
Land
