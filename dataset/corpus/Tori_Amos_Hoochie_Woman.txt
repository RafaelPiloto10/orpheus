Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
  
I wasn't thinking  
My head was in the book  
His hands were on her everywhere  
I saw his face I dropped my coffee  
He's cheating on me with a Hoochie Woman  
  
Ooo hoo hoo you can  
Keep your Hoochie  
Ooo hoo hoo  
And the bank accounts  
Cause boy I bring home the Bacon  
I said boys I bring home the Bacon now  
  
I went to work and the office girls  
Were all burning their poetry  
It wasn't good  
But in the neighborhood  
Now they're all just a  
Hoochie Woman  
  
He called me up  
And said "she has needs"  
I said "you'll find 'em  
On Barney's fourth floor"  
He said "I need a loan"  
(I said) "that's not a problem  
You better keep this from you  
Hoochie Woman"
