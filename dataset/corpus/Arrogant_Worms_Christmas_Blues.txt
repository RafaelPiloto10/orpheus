Christmas is here, where did the time go?  
Got to load up the reindeer, put on my red suit and go  
I use to like Christmas, but every year it gets worse  
Getting gift to six billion people is just too much damn work  
Got the Christmas blues, man this job is killing me  
And most of these stupid new houses don't even have chimneys  
I use to be jolly, now I'm depressed  
Had a twinkle in my eye, now I've got a bullet proof vest  
'cause if the pace don't kill me, some gun totting yahoo will  
They keep shooting at me like I'm some sort of big fat red criminal  
Got the Christmas blues, I'm starting to see  
That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies  
I've grown to hate kids, especially their mail  
Always asking me for stuff, well guess what I don't care, oh  
Maybe I'm getting cranky as I get old  
'cause I feel like giving them all a big lump of coal  
Got the Christmas blues, man, enough is enough  
Next year you can find some other sucker to deliver this stuff  
Got the Christmas blues, I tell you I'm gonna quit  
And find me a steady job with good benefits
