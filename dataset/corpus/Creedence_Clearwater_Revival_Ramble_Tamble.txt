[Chorus:]  
Move,  
Down the road  
I go.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's mud in the water,  
Roach in the cellar,  
Bugs in the sugar,  
Mortgage on the home,  
Mortgage on the home.  
  
There's garbage on the sidewalk,  
Highways in the back yard,  
Police on the corner,  
Mortgage on the car,  
  
Mortgage on the car.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They're selling independence,  
Actors in the white house,  
Acid in digestion,  
Mortgage on my life,  
Mortgage on my life.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ramble tamble tamble  
Ramble tamble tamble  
Ramble tamble tamble
