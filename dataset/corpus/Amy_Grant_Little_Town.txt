Written by Amy Grant  
Your smile lights up a room  
Like a candle in the dark  
It warms me through and through  
And I guess that I had dreamed  
We would never be apart  
But that dream did not come true  
And  
Chorus:  
Missing you is just a part of living  
And missing you feels like a way of life  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish you were mine  
And I cannot hear the telephone  
Jangle on the wall  
And not feel a hopeful thrill  
And I cannot help but smile  
At any new of you at all  
And I guess I always will  
'Cause  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Hey, yeah  
(Repeat Chorus)  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish that you were mine
