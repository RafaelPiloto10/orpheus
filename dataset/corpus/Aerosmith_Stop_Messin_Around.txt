Baby, please stop messin' 'round  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
Baby, please stop messin' around  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
If you don't stop messin' 'round  
You'll be somebody's friend  
Instead of mine, yes sir  
  
You're rockin' the temperature  
My baby's cherry red  
You're rockin' so hard  
I fall right out of bed  
  
I said,  
Baby, please stop messin' 'round  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
If you don't stop messin' 'round  
You'll be somebody's friend  
Instead of mine
