I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies  
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when he flies  
Turning on the world, the way he smiled upon my soul as I lay dying  
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of his eyes  
  
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin  
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I"ve been  
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying  
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend  
  
Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again  
Coming close together  
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time  
He ain't ashamed to be a man or afraid to be a friend  
I don't know the answer to the easy way he opened every door in my mind  
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end  
Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again  
  
Coming close together  
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time  
But loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again  
Loving him  
Loving him  
But loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again
