Even though it's been so long, my love for you keeps going strong.  
I remember the things that we used to do  
A kiss in the rain till the sun shined through.  
I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you.  
  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,  
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day.  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you, baby.  
Love like ours will never end, just touch me and we're there again.  
  
I can see the love shining in your eyes,  
And it comes as such a sweet surprise.  
It seems believing is worth the wait,  
So hold me and tell me it's not too late.  
We're so good together, we're starting forever now.  
  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,  
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day.  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.  
No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you.  
  
Just one night, and we'll have to find the feelings like we used to do.  
Hold on tight, and whatever comes our way, we're gonna make it through.  
It seems to believing is worth the wait,  
So hold me and tell me it's not too late.  
We're so good together, we're starting forever now.  
  
And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.  
No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you.  
And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.
