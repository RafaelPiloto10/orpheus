So many lonely people looking for a way  
To fill the empty nights when the phone won't ring  
We all want to fall in love, hear the birds sing  
So if you're feeling desperate, don't give up  
Times, they are a changing and so is your luck  
  
Cupid's got a gun  
Arrows wouldn't do  
He's got the power love for you  
It's a big big love  
His aim is true  
Don't try to run  
Cupid's got a gun  
  
Don't you just sit there feeling sorry for yourself  
Reading romance novels and laying around the house  
Dreaming that the good parts were written just for you  
Then waking up saying this will never come true  
Stop your hesitating go out tonight  
You know he's out there waiting  
To get you in his sights  
  
Cupid's got a gun  
Arrows wouldn't do  
He's got the power love for you  
It's a big big love  
His aim is true  
Don't try to run  
Cupid's got a gun  
  
It's a real tough job helping people fall in love  
That old bow and arrow just wasn't strong enough  
Cupid wasn't stupid, he knew just what to do  
Now he's loaded for love  
He's coming for you
