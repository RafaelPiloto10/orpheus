Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam  
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze  
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home  
  
I met a man who lives in Tennessee  
And he was headin' for  
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie  
From Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down  
To Dixie's sunny shore  
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee,  
The traffic is terrific!  
  
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam  
If you want to be happy in a million ways  
For the holidays you can't beat home, sweet home
