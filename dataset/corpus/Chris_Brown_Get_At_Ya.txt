Where you going, slow it  
Don't act like you don't see me  
I'm glowing, show me  
What you look like in the morning  
Tone it on it, floating on 25s  
I wouldn't be fly if I threw some D's on it  
  
When I step to the floor I'm fresh low key  
When I step through the door all eyes on me  
Wanna be a star get on TV  
It's bout to jump off in my car so come with me  
(Oh baby)  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey girl I love what you do (yeah)  
The way ya making it move  
I'm tryna give it to you (oh)  
Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)  
Tryna get at ya  
You see me sitting on chrome  
And I'm tryna get at ya  
(Hey) I want ya girl  
(You) You feel me girl  
(Move, oh you) I'm on ya  
Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)  
Tryna get at ya (hey hey hey hey)  
You see me sitting on chrome  
And I'm tryna get at ya  
  
Girl I'm slowly approaching  
Dodging those misdemeanors  
They on it, (on it) want it (want it)  
I know they waiting on me  
To run it, run it  
You gotta show me  
If you with it be a bad girl  
  
When I step to the floor I'm fresh low key (low key)  
When I step through the door all eyes on me (on me)  
Wanna be a star get on TV  
It's bout to jump off in my car so come with me (hey girl)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chris' Rap]  
700 horsepower  
Speakers beating down the block  
Girls stop automatic static  
Better call the cops  
  
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it  
I'm gonna have to snatch it  
But I'm tryna get at ya  
200 miles per hour  
  
Speakers beating down the block  
Girls stop automatic static  
Better call the cops  
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it  
  
I'm gonna have to snatch it  
But I'm tryna get at ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x 2]  
Tryna give it to you  
Do you feel me girl  
Tryna give it to you  
Do you feel me girl  
Tryna give it to you  
Do you feel me girl  
Do you feel me girl  
Do you feel me girl
