Go sister, roll on it

Late night the speaker's pumpin'  
Flesh-to-flesh, grind-n-bumpin'  
Hot pants, green and yellow  
Round thighs, feeling mellow  
The beat of the ghetto  
Corn rows, bees and Afros  
the deed buzz from Nassau  
I'd love to show the night  
  
Go sister, roll on it  
Don't let the music stop  
Girl gon' make that Boongie drop  
  
Go sister, roll on it  
Go sister, roll on it  
Don't let the music stop  
Girl gon' make that Boongie drop  
Go sister, roll on it  
  
Gonna make that Boongie drop  
Gonna make that Boongie drop  
Gonna make that Boongie drop  
Gonna make that Boongie drop  
  
Black heat fills the dance hall  
Lovebirds got the back wall  
Junglers boot like labels  
High heels on the tables  
Bare feet on the dirt floor  
No one cares if you're poor  
every lock in the door  
ain't coming home tonight  
  
Go sister, roll on it  
Don't let the music stop  
Girl gon' make that Boongie drop  
  
Go sister, roll on it  
Go sister, roll on it  
Don't let the music stop  
Girl gon' make that Boongie drop  
Go sister, roll on it

Gonna make that Boongie drop, uh  
Gonna make that Boongie drop

Gonna make that Boongie drop  
  
Pop, lock and drop it  
I make that pussy speak Patois  
Like Petra, remember hah?  
Remember me from the basement parties?  
i remember you tight tight no pantie  
  
i be blowing on nigga type E  
Brother rubbing so close stepping on my Nikes  
At the red light, never give me red light  
Only give me green light, you know what I mean right?  
After my Red Stripe, hop up on my motorbike  
Show me what the motor like  
show me you can roll it right  
All of my Guyanese, girl, they're Bohemians  
All of my Jamaicans, shake it for me, shake it then  
  
Go sister, roll on it  
Don't let the music stop  
Girl gon' make that Boongie drop  
  
Go sister, roll on it
