[Verse 1]  
Have you ever wanted to disappear  
And join a monastery  
Go out and preach on Manic Street?  
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger  
On a passenger plane?  
(Passenger plane)  
  
Oh,  
  
Permanent jet lag  
Please take me back (please take be back)  
Please take be back  
Oh, oh  
I'm a stray dog sick  
Please let me in (please let me in)  
The mad keys tripping  
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings  
  
[Chorus]  
Give me a pen  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine  
But don't let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)  
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in  
  
[Verse 2]  
It feels like fourteen karats but no clarity  
When I look at the man who would be king  
The man who would be king goes to the  
Desert to sing war his dad rehearsed  
Came back with flags on coffins and said  
We won, oh, we won  
  
Permanent jet lag  
Please take me back (Please take me back)  
Please take me back  
Oh, oh  
I'm a stray dog sick  
Please let me in (Please let me in)  
The mad keys tripping  
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings  
  
[Chorus]  
Give me a pen  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine  
But don't let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)  
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in  
  
[Bridge]  
B-B-B-B-Benzedrine  
My, my, my Benzedrine  
My B-B-B-B-Benzedrine now  
  
Only one book really matters, the rest of the proof  
Is on the television, on the  
  
[Chorus]  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine  
But don't let the doctor in  
I wanna blow off steam and  
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)  
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in  
  
Have you ever wanted to disappear?  
  
It's not me, it's you  
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me  
Untie the balloons from around my neck and ground me  
I'm just a racehorse on the track  
Send me back to the glue factory  
Always thought I'd float away  
And never come back  
But I've got enough miles on my card  
To fly the boys home on my own  
But you know me: I like being all alone  
And keeping you all alone  
And the charts are boring  
And the kids are snoring  
And the eagles in a sling  
You say you're not listening  
And I said I'm wishing  
And I said, I said...
