In a manger like Christ I lay  
Yellow fever, yellow hay  
Feel the rhythm, sweetest sound  
Making, breaking sacred ground  
I'd give you a piece of my love for free  
But whatever I say you'll never see  
Acquire a taste for a different sound  
Make or break it this side of town  
  
Life will never be the same  
In Port-Royal town, I hear it coming  
The shaking of the ground  
They're stealing in the day  
In Port-Royal town, the children are running  
  
Ever strange the lives we lead  
So detached from the things we need  
Signs of greed in everyone  
Instant eviction and the blood on a gun  
Just when you think you've found it  
Spinning world I want to spin around it  
What is wrong? This pain won't peel  
The fibres of my life won't heal
