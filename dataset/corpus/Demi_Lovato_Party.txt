Saw you lookin at me  
Now I think you  
Moving this way  
Your pushing  
Through the crowd  
Like you got  
Something to say  
But you  
Couldn't get to me  
'Cause the music's  
Taking over your feet  
I can tell by your toes  
That you're rocking  
To this beat  
You gotta dance and sway  
Til you drop and break  
Free your soul  
Let me see you shake  
One by one  
We're stealing the stage  
Here we come so get  
Out of our way  
  
It won't be long  
Till the summers gone  
Get your party on  
Now were singin'  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
And were screaming  
Out loud  
  
Now it's going strait  
To your head  
Hanging in red, yea  
But your learn  
How to move  
To the grove  
Again and again  
Raise your hands  
In the are  
I'm a champion  
  
Were all dolled up  
With no where to go  
You want to get out  
And lose up the show  
Rock and roll  
Is staying home  
As long as you catch  
Your ready to go  
  
It won't be long  
Till the summers gone  
Get you party on  
And were screaming  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
Don't wait  
Don't you be late  
Get your party on  
Now were singin'  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
And were screaming  
Out loud  
  
You can learn it too  
Don't follow the rules  
I've seen those moves  
There in the way  
You make me move  
  
It won't be long  
Till the summers gone  
Get you party on  
And were screaming  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
Don't wait  
Don't you be late  
Get your party on  
Now were singin'  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
And were screaming  
Out loud
