This one right here  
This is to let everybody know  
That you gotta know who you are  
And you gotta know whose you are  
Hey, I know whose I am  
By the way  
Baby boy wait a second hear me out  
You don't know what you're talking about  
Don't know me or how I roll  
Child of the king your flossin don't appeal to me  
Im not impressed with shopping sprees  
Man your game ain't worth my soul  
(Hey boy) I know what you're looking for and it's ain't your night  
(Hey boy) you've got your eyes on me, but Ive got my eyes on high  
(Hey boy) don't you know the difference is in the life Ive found  
(Hey boy) took one chance it turned my life around  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Baby girl I see it from a mile away  
Youre lost and you can't find your way  
Trying to find just who you are  
You need to know  
Youre worth more than your weight in gold  
But gotta let God take control  
Truly be a shining star  
(Hey girl) I know what you're looking for you're not looking right  
(Hey girl) you've got your eyes on everything but on the most high  
(Hey girl) hear me when I say the difference is in the life Ive found  
(Hey girl) take one chance he'll turn your life around  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Ive never been so happy (repeat)
