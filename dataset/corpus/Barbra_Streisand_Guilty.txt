Barbra  
Shadows falling , baby , we stand alone  
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own  
(It oughta be illegal)  
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad  
(It oughta be illegal)  
You got a reason for livin'  
You battle on with the love you're livin' on  
  
You gotta be mine  
We take it away  
It's gotta be night and say  
Just a matter of time  
And we got nothing to be guilty of  
Our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are  
And we never let it end  
  
We are devotion  
And we got nothing to be sorry for  
Our love is one in a million  
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky  
I don't want to hear your goodbye  
  
Oh!  
Barry  
Aaah!  
Pulse's racing , darling  
How grand we are  
Little by little we meet in the middle  
There's danger in the dark  
(It oughta be illegal)  
Make it a crime to be out in the cold  
(It oughta be illegal)  
You got a reason for livin'  
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on  
  
Together  
You gotta be mine  
We take it away  
It's gotta be night and day  
Just a matter of time  
And we got nothing to be guilty of  
Our love will climb and mountain near or far, we are  
  
And we never let it end  
We are devotion  
And we got nothing to be sorry for  
Our love is one in a million  
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky  
  
Barbra  
I don't want to hear your goodbye  
Barry  
Don't want to hear your goodbye  
Together  
I don't want to hear your  
And we got nothing to be guilty of  
Our love will climb and mountain near or far , we are  
And we never let it end  
  
We are devotion  
And we got nothing to be sorry for  
Our love is one in a million  
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky  
Don't want to hear your goodbye  
Don't want to hear your  
And we got nothing to be guilty of
