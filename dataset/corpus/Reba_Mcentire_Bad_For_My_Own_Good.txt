  
I thought I had my life under control  
I was the one in charge of my heart and soul  
Now I must focus in I'm losin more sleep than I should  
I want you too badfor my own good  
yeah  
  
My intuition tells me I'm in to deep  
This time this heart of mine is playing for keeps  
I've fallen harder than I ever imagined I would  
I want you to bad for my own good  
  
Chorus  
If anyone had told me  
I'd be feelin like this  
I would have laughed in their face  
Now I'm addicted to the thrill of you kiss  
And it's a habit that I can't break  
  
My independence is a thing of the past  
My better judgment is fading fast  
But I wouldn't give you up  
Not even if I thought I could  
I want you too bad for my own good  
  
I want you to bad for my own good  
  
For my own good  
  
Oh, for my own good  
yeah  
  
For my own good
