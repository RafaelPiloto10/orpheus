What can separate me now

Falls from my eyes

You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done
