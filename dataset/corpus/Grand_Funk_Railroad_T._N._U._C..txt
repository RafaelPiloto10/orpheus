You won't find me,  
Knockin' at your door  
I've known forever,  
You don't love me no more.  
  
If you don't want to lay there,  
With your mouth shut tight  
I'm gettin' myself together,  
Yes I'm leavin' tonight  
  
You ain't gonna' find nobody,  
To treat you like I do  
I bend down on my knees,  
You treat me like a fool  
  
Now I know what you're tryin' to do,  
Awww it ain't gonna happen  
'Cause I just done got hip to you,  
I'm a walk out laughin'
