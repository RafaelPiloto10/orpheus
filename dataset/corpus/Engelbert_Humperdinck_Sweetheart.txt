If your heart tells you so, that you should leave me  
Don't try to forget, you and I never met  
And before you fly, why can't you tell me why  
You've forgotten all the words that you once said  
  
Long as I've got you there beside me  
Long as you're there to stand a guide me  
The love we share, no one can ever tear apart  
Long as I've got this life I'm living  
Long as it's you, the love I'm with then  
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart  
  
If my love for you can't make you happy  
Just open the door and you won't see me anymore  
And before you fly, why can't you tell me why  
You've forgotten all the words that you once said  
  
Long as I've got you there beside me  
Long as you're there to stand a guide me  
The love we share, no one can ever tear apart  
Long as I've got this life I'm living  
Long as it's you, the love I'm with then  
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart  
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart
