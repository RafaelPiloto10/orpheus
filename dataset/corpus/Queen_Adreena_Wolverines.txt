on my back i lay it down for plenty  
these bones to crack  
i'll scream til it's empty  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
she's clandestine i'll spit for a foothold  
these nails are mine  
i'll bleed til i get hold  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
i set the scales i'm fishing for murder  
this whore in jail  
i'll bang nail in her  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
it's a fox it's a bird it's a snake it's a word  
i heard it crawl from my veins  
your name  
it's your name  
it's your name  
i learn how to dance with the dog
