Thirty thousand feet above  
The city where I fell in love with you  
And the fading country skyline  
Brings an urban lullaby  
That still rings true  
  
When I passed you on the street that day  
Should've let that red scarf fly away  
Like any chance I had of keeping you  
Like the Northern Wind a-blowin'  
Yeah my lonely heart is frozen  
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours too  
  
Where the wind blows babe  
You can bet  
I'll be riding high with it  
Holding on for my dear life  
Just like I always did  
  
Close your eyes babe  
Take a breath, say my name  
And I'll be there  
My love will find you anywhere  
Anywhere my love  
  
The city lights look like the country sky  
But you're staring at the stars turned upside down  
I wish I may, I wish I might  
Find it in your heart to stick around  
I hate it had to end this way  
Tomorrow is a brand new day  
And the chances here at love  
Are precious few  
If someone's out there waiting  
For a sweet good-timing a lady  
To make you smile the way I always wanted to  
  
Where the wind blows babe  
You can bet  
I'll be riding high with it  
Holding on for my dear life  
Just like I always did  
  
Close your eyes babe  
Take a breath, say my name  
And I'll be there  
My love will find you anywhere  
Anywhere my love  
  
So I fly all night  
Our memories, my lullaby and love won't lie  
If it's love done right  
You'll be waiting on the other side  
Arms open wide  
'Cause love don't lie (lie)  
We can fly  
  
Where the wind blows babe  
You can bet  
I'll be riding high with it  
Holding on for my dear life  
Just like I always did  
  
Close your eyes babe  
Take a breath, say my name  
And I'll be there  
My love will find you anywhere  
Anywhere my love
