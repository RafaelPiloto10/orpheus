Jack of all trades master of none  
Even got lost trying to find the M1  
Ended up in South Shields with a couple of drunks  
  
Moved to Crouch End suburb of cool  
Took a few drugs acted the fool  
Fell in love with a girl on her harmonium stool  
  
Went round the world in the back of a van  
We kept in touch with our only fan  
He was short and sweet lived in Japan  
  
The band broke up round a pool in Bangkok  
To tell you the truth it didn't come as a shock  
Our days were numbered like hands on a clock  
  
So we carried on me and the serious girl  
Had massive hits all round the world  
We got so big we both became ill  
  
Flew into London with a bit of a tan  
Caught the train back to Sunderland to see me old man  
We had bacon and eggs from the same frying pan  
  
To walk down the high street  
Avoiding a scrap  
"are you Dave Stewart?"  
"yeah"  
: you're a crap"  
Had a pint in the Beehive then home for a nap  
  
Got married in France to an Irish colleen  
I was thirty three she was only thirteen  
I wore orange but she wore green  
  
Now I sit and write plays for myself and my sons  
They keep me amused yeah I have much more fun  
Than big lines of speed at quarter to one  
On a peaceful Sunday morning
