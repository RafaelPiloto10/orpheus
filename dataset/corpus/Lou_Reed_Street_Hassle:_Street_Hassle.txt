Hey, that cunt's not breathing  
I think she had too much of something or other  
Hey, man, you know what I mean  
I don't mean to scare you  
But you're the one who came here  
And you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave  
I'm not being smart or trying to be pulling my part  
And I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve  
But you know people get emotional  
And sometimes they just don't act rational  
They think they're just on tv - sha la la la, man  
Why don't you just slip her away  
You know. I'm glad that we met man  
It was really nice talking  
And I really wish there was a little more time to speak  
But you know it could be a hassle  
Trying to explain myself to a police officer  
About how it was that your old lady got herself stiffed  
And it's not like we could help  
But there's nothing no one could do  
And if there was, man, you know I would have been the first  
Only, someone turns that blue  
Well, it's a universal truth  
And you just know: That bitch will never fuck again  
By the way, that's really some bad shit  
That you came to our place with  
But you ought be more careful round the little girls  
It's either the best or it's the worst  
Since I don't have to choose, I guess I won't  
And I know, This is no way to treat a guest  
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet  
And just lay her out in the darkest street  
And by morning, she's just another hit and run  
  
You know, some people got no choice  
And they can never even find a voice  
To talk with that they can even call their own  
So the first thing, that they see  
That allows them the right to be  
Why, they follow it  
You know, it's called bad luck
