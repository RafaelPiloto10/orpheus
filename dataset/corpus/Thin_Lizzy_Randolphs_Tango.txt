The senorita took off her bobby socks  
She said she's gonna wear a skirt that shocks  
She's pulling out all the stops  
To get her Randolph back again  
  
Meanwhile Randolph, he's back at the ranch  
He's getting ready for tonight's song and dance  
He's doesn't know he doesn't stand a chance  
His last affair will be his last romance  
  
The senorita will be there waiting  
Don't go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
Underneath the Latin moonlight  
The danced and seen a falling star in flight  
To the strum of guitars she held him tight  
She wants her Randolph back again  
  
Meanwhile it's worthwhile for Randolph to wait  
'Till he gets the nerve then he won't hesitate  
He doesn't know but he's just bit the bait  
He just asked if he could make a date  
  
The senorita will be there waiting  
Don't go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
The senorita's heart is in love  
She wearing white tonight, looks as pure as a dove  
She's thanking God and all the heavenly stars above  
Randolph's romance is back again  
  
Meanwhile Randolph smiles and says he'll give her ten  
She doesn't come so he just counts again  
And he's been there since he does not know when  
He's thinks she's stood him up but in the end  
  
The senorita won't keep him waiting  
Don't go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
Senorita dance cheek to cheek  
We will dance off into the sky
