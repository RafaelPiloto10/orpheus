Jealousy, endlessly  
Sweeps through my mind  
Jealousy, often causes me to  
Be unkind  
  
I'm sorry I said that  
I'm sorry I did that  
I'm sorry I hit you  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Being endlessly jealous of me  
The man that you thought I could be turning red  
With jealousy  
  
Endlessly jealousy  
Eats through my skull  
Endlessly jealousy  
Makes me feel dull  
  
Fighting  
Endless jealous fighting  
I feel my fingers tightening  
Tightening, please don't break her arm  
  
Jealously thinking of you  
Of your endless possession of me  
Of my jealousy, endlessly, jealousy, endlessly  
Jealous of you  
  
Sorry, running to a phone to say  
I'm sorry, running out of dimes  
The phone on the street spits at me  
Have a good day  
  
Sorry, please you know how I am sorry  
I've been this way for  
Oh, so long, endlessly, zealously  
Jealous of you  
  
Jealousy, endlessly  
Eats through my mind  
Jealousy, endlessly  
Makes me be unkind  
  
I'm sorry I said that  
I'm sorry I did that  
I'm sorry I hit you  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Being endlessly jealous of me  
Endlessly jealous of you being endlessly  
Jealous of me  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you
