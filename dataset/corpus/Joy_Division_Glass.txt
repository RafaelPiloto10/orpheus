Hearts fail, young hearts fail  
Anytime, pressurised  
Overheat, overtired  
Take it quick, take it neat  
Clasp your hands, touch your feet  
Take it quick, take it neat  
  
Hearts fail, young hearts fail  
Anytime, wearing down  
On the run, underground  
Put your hand where it's safe  
Leave your hand where it's safe  
Do it again  
Do it again and again and again  
  
Anytime, that's your right  
Told ya we should do it again  
Overheat, overtired  
Don't you wish to do it again  
Anytime, that's all right  
Don't you wish to do it again  
I bet you wish you do it again  
Do it again  
  
In the Genetic demo version the previous verse is replaced by,  
Anytime, that's your right  
Bet you wish you'd done it again  
Anytime, that's your right  
Turn around and do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again and again and again
