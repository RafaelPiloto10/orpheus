If the people only knew  
If they could visualize  
Just open their eyes  
Even stop to think about  
  
If they could open their minds  
They could get beyond  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
  
Is rarely funny  
Rarely funny  
Could the people understand  
In only whisper and screams  
  
And colorless dreams  
Could they finally comprehend  
If they could suddenly see  
  
And suddenly feel  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
Is rarely funny  
  
Rarely funny
