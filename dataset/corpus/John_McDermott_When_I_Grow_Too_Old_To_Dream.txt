When I grow too old to dream: to g  
  
We have been gay going our way  
Life has been beautiful we have been young  
After you've gone life will go on  
Like an old song that we've sung  
[Chorus:]  
When I grow too old to dream  
I'll have you to remember  
When I grow too old to dream  
Your love will live in my heart  
So kiss me my sweet and so let us part  
And when I grow too old to dream  
That kiss will live in my heart  
  
After you've gone life will go on  
Time will be tenderly melting our tears  
Yet will I find you inmy mind  
Beckoning over the years  
  
(repeat chorus)
