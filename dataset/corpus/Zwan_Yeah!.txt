Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
I gave you everything  
What'd ya give to me?  
A pocket full of empty rings  
With diamonds that can sing  
The most that I could ever hope  
Is that you'd start to feel so real.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
What I want is what you want  
But what I want is more  
I'm tired of the questions  
Am I left in scorn?  
The drugs are my addiction  
She's laying on the tiles of my floor.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
'Cause you are (you are)  
My fault (my fault)  
As you are (you are)  
My own  
And you built (you built)  
My will  
But what I want, you can't fucking kill.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Everyone is not as one  
Everyone's the same  
Their asking for a moment  
Or looking out to blame  
So am I independent?  
Or am I just playing my own games?  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
'Cause you are (you are)  
My fault (my fault)  
As you are (you are)  
My own  
And you built (you built)  
My guilt  
But when I can, you just never will  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
'Cause you are (you are)  
My fault (my fault)  
You are (you are)  
My own  
It's your will (your will)  
And my guilt.  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah.
