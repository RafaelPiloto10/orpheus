On the street  
They're preaching violence  
Mr man it's in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Ain't it obvious  
I'm just a man like you  
  
Mr man full of love  
Mr man full of hate  
Got his heart on the trigger  
But he pulled it too late  
  
Mr man is a pilot  
Mr man is a fake  
Mr man's feeling hungry  
And he's lying in wait  
  
On the street  
The lights are fighting  
Searching for someone like you  
Better find a good messiah  
To help the sad and lonely through  
  
Why do I live the way I do  
Ain't it obvious  
I'm much more black than blue  
  
On the street (they're preaching violence)  
Mr man it's in your head  
On the street  
The midnight cowboy  
Needs no gun  
To shoot you dead
