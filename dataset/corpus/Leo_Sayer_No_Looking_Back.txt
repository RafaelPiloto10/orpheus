When there's no more looking back  
And you feel you've loved in vain  
You try and hide your sorrow  
Now you're alone again  
So you block out your emotion  
Laugh it off and carry on  
Sayin' why do i have to feel this way  
Was loving you so wrong  
  
If i could only turn around  
One more time for old time's sake  
I'd pick up all the pieces  
From the mistakes i made  
Did i give myself completely  
Or did i hang on for too long  
Ah, but what's the use of me talking this way  
Now that you're gone  
  
No looking back, it's over now  
All over now  
I tell myself i'm glad  
It's over now  
All over now  
It's over now  
  
But if i ever love again  
Oh, i won't be played a fool  
I'll put in my performance  
This time i'll know the moves  
It's not that i'm feeling bitter  
I've no bitterness to show  
And all i'm really trying to say  
Is that i wish i'd never let you go
