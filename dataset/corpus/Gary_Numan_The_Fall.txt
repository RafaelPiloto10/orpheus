Put your hate in a box  
See how it bleeds for you  
I've watched you  
Take your life and tear it apart  
  
Put your pain in a box  
I'll send it back to you  
What have you become?  
A shadow of a man  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing  
  
Put your lies in a box  
How have they worked for you?  
Did they win you back  
The things that you lost?  
  
Put your shame in a box  
How could you be so wrong?  
You sit there broken  
And the world moves on  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing  
  
How does it feel?  
I'll spare a little thought for "The Crow"  
How does it feel?  
Living in the black of your soul  
How does it feel?  
Like a beggar out caught in the cold  
How does it feel?  
With nothing but the truth left untold  
  
Do you fall like tears on an ocean?  
Drowning in rage like a poisoned emotion  
Do you fall like a fading desire?  
Lost and unloved a forgotten "messiah"  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing
