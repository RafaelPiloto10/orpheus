I've been trying  
There's no denying.  
It's sending me  
Out of my mind.  
  
I've seen reason  
Change to treason.  
It's losing its sense  
Of all kind.  
  
How much longer will it take  
For the world to see.  
We should learn to live  
And simply let it be.  
Bloodstone, bloodstone.  
  
In the night time  
Wake in fright.  
I'm so scared of the game  
That's being played.  
Start to wonder  
What's going under.  
And how many deals  
Have been made.  
  
Bloodstone.  
I can't take it.  
You got me living  
On a bloodstone  
I don't want that bloodstone
