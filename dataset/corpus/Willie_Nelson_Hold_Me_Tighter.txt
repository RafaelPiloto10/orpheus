I thought if I could be with you  
Maybe I'd feel better  
But I'm afraid I took advantage of your love  
I thought if you'd just hold me tight  
Maybe I'd forget her  
But I don't suppose as yet  
You've held me tight enough  
Please hold me tighter  
I still remember  
Put your arms around me  
Hold me close, hold me tight and long  
Please hold me tighter  
I still remember  
And I can't love again  
Until her memory's gone  
  
Please hold me tighter
