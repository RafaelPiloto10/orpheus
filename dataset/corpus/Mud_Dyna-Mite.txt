Ooh ooh ooh Nobody knew her name  
But she turned up just the same  
  
There was a knock on the door  
  
A thump on the floor and the party turned insane  
  
As she called out her name.  
And she walked in looking like dynamite  
  
She said now come along  
boogaloo through the night  
And by the way she's moving well  
  
Dynamite might she not with all  
she's got she's got the whole town lighting up dynamite  
Nobody quite knowing what to do  
  
Wrong or right  
  
But they all know Dyna is Dynamite  
And they're right.  
She hadn't been there long  
When she told us where she came from  
  
There was a flash in the sky  
  
A light in her eye and her dynamite light burned on  
  
As the music went on and on and on and on . . .  
And she walked in looking like dynamite  
. . .
