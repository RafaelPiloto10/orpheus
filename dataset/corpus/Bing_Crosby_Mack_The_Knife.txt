Uh-huh, Uh-huh  
Lay way back you cats, Dig in  
Live a while, yes, Mr Mack is movin' in  
  
Though the shark has, pretty teeth, dear  
And he shows 'em pearly whites  
Just a jackknife has MacHeath, dear  
And he keeps it, well out of sight  
  
When the shark bites, with his teeth, dear  
Scarlet billows start to spread  
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, dear  
So there's not a trace of red  
  
On the sidewalk, Sunday mornin'  
Lies a body oo-oozin' life  
Someones sneakin' 'round the cor-or-orner  
Is that someone Mack the Knife?  
  
From a tugboat, by the river  
A cement bags drooppin' down  
The cement, that's just for the weight, dear  
I'll bet you Mackys back in tow-own  
  
Mr Miller, disappeared, dear  
After drawin' out all of his cash  
Went tap city, and MacHeath spends like a sailor  
Did our boy do, somethin' rash?  
  
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver  
Polly Peacham, Miss Lucy Brown  
Oh, the line forms on the right, dear  
Now that Mackys back in town
