Sending out a message to the world  
But I just can't seem to find the words  
No one wants to die alone  
Broken and insane  
Question every last decision  
Another empty page  
  
Do you know the answers?  
Tell me, I find my happy ending  
When do we start pretending that  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
Wanting what I know won't satisfy  
Just to live this, need to live a lie  
Never meant to run away  
Jumping out the train  
My cage was built on good intentions  
Running every page  
  
Do you know the answers?  
Tell me, I find my happy ending  
When do we start pretending that  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
All the same on the inside  
All the same on the inside  
  
Do you want the answers?  
Tell me, I find my happy ending  
When do we start pretending that  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
All the same on the inside  
We're all the same on the inside  
We're all the same on the inside  
  
Yeah, we're all the same on the inside
