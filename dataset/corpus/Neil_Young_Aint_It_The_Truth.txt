Ain't it the truth  
Ain't it the truth, now, baby  
Ain't it the truth, now  
What I say?  
  
Eat watermelon  
Eat peaches and cream  
Eat ripe tomatoes  
You know what I mean.  
  
Ain't it the truth  
Ain't it the truth, now, baby  
Ain't it the truth, now  
What I say?  
  
Your majesty  
Your curvaceousness  
Your highness  
Your soulfulness.  
  
Make love to me, babe  
Make love to me  
Make me feel all right, now  
Make me feel so good.
