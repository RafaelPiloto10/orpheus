Mary's sellin' flowers on a stall in EC1  
Tonight she'll be out lookin' for some fun  
Her mate, Gerry's in the basement, he hasn't got a home  
But prides himself that he's got most things done  
Meanwhile, I'm up on the roof  
Waitin' for the sun to shine  
I haven't got an excuse  
So, I'll just keep my head down  
David's in the city, he's just made a deal  
And the boys they want to take his trousers down  
So they buy some little pills which will make poor David ill  
And they find themselves in some club downtown  
Meanwhile, I got off the roof  
'cause the rain keeps pouring down  
And I haven't got a clue  
Why there's faith in all these clowns  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
Jim and Jane hit the grapevine 'cause they're lookin' for a party  
A secret number knows where it can be found  
So they pick up Pete and Sheila, then they head down the M40  
But someone said they closed the country down  
Meanwhile, I've locked myself in the kitchen  
Waitin' for the storm to pass  
And if there's too much damage  
I think I'll get the fuck out fast  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world
