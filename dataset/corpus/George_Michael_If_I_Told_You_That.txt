Dark Child Hey baby,  
Ha ha ha  
  
Chorus  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that  
I'll always keep you  
What would you say?  
If I told you that  
  
[George]  
Now tell me how you'd feel  
If I told you that  
I had feelings for you, yeah  
Tell me baby  
  
[Whitney]  
And would it be so wrong  
To say what's on my mind  
I'm sorry I have to baby, baby  
  
We were friends  
But with time  
What I feel deep inside  
For you has changed  
But I'd give up for love  
If I thought that it was untrue (Untrue)  
For you (For you baby)  
  
Chorus  
  
[George]  
I know that we're just friends  
But what if I decide  
To bring something in,  
Ooh yeah Baby, baby  
  
[Whitney]  
I hope it won't offend  
The trust we have cuz  
I don't want this to end  
No, no, no, baby  
  
If you think we will lose what we have  
Then I'd just rather stay the same  
(Rather stay, rather stay the same)  
Cuz I don't want to chose between two  
Of the most precious things to me  
(Precious things to me, oh yeah)  
  
Chorus  
  
[Whitney](George)  
If we (If we)  
Take this chance (Take this chance)  
And extend to each other romance  
I hope (Baby I hope)  
It would be (It would be)  
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
Chorus  
  
If I told you that  
Chorus  
  
If I told you that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Would you be there for me?  
(Could you?) Could you dare to hold me?  
Will my feelings lead me, love always  
(Baby what would you say?)  
  
If I told you  
Chorus
