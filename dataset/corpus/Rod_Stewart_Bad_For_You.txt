Every day I wake  
Every word I speak  
Got you on my mind  
I've made love to you  
And I may not be  
The answer to your prayer  
Give me just one night  
And I'll take you there  
  
I can read your mind  
Honey I ain't blind  
You want love so hard  
It's no federal crime  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone's gotta tell me  
That you're mine all mine  
Take me to your river honey  
Fracture my mind  
I'll be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
I've got my brand on you  
I'll be bad for you  
  
When you turn around  
I'll be standing there  
Anywhere you go  
I will follow you  
Any place you walk  
Any words you talk  
I'll be by your side  
I won't let you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
I put my brand on you  
I'll be bad for you  
Bad for you  
  
Listen to me  
Be bad for me  
  
Every day I wake  
Every word I speak  
Got you on my mind  
I've made love to you  
  
When the night gets hot  
You're my only thought  
Can't control myself  
I'll make love to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be bad for you  
So very bad for you  
Ain't nothin' you can do  
I'll be bad for you  
Bad for you  
Nothing you can do  
I'm so bad for you baby  
I'll be bad for you baby
