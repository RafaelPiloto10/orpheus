The brilliance of my fleeting mind  
Chimes like voices in foreign caves  
It chimes in time - takes me where I'm going  
Alone my fleeting mind is knowing  
Believe it when I pin it down  
And that's not hard to forget  
With my hands upon my knees  
  
You will steal from my fleeting mind  
Remember all our words they are just smoke rings in the rain:  
That's just a poem in brilliant places  
But poets, they are too grim  
They steal like party thieves from crowded rooms  
To rhyme their homes with better places  
  
The brilliance of their minds  
Will seek with never knowing  
Alone my fleeting mind is knowing  
Believe it when I pin it down  
And that's not hard to forget  
With my thought like sifting leaves  
I believe in my fleeting mind  
  
The brilliance of their minds  
Will seek with never knowing  
Alone my fleeting mind is knowing  
Believe it when I pin it down  
And that's not hard to forget  
With my thought like sifting leaves  
I believe in my fleeting mind
