Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, you don't know your mind  
It says hi, you walk straight by  
Missing person, you can't take  
A look in your book 'cause it makes you shake  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, you don't ever change  
Same mistakes, again and again  
You're so shallow, you try to get  
Your feet in your mouth but they never get wet  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
I gave you love, I gave you love, I gave you love  
What's the matter, ain't that enough?  
I gave you love, I gave you love  
See you later, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
You're so clever, you can see  
I've known all along you were hassling me  
Tell those faces on your head  
As far as I'm concerned, you're dead  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
I gave you love, I gave you love, I gave you love  
What's the matter, honey, ain't that enough?  
I gave you love, I gave you love  
See you later, traitor  
Traitor, traitor  
She just hears what she wants to fill  
She can't help it, the girl can't help it  
Destroys her brain, she's out of touch  
Just what do you do that's worth so much  
She had to run, know what I mean?  
You and your convenient dream  
Did she hurt, you bet she hurt  
She left me naked, she just lost her shirt  
Ain't no letter of revenge  
Every line has got to end  
You're just one woman I can't depend  
See you later, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
...
