Fly away little bird  
Any place in this open mouthed world  
Begs to be fed like a bed that beckons you, but you won't rest  
Everyone's got a need to go  
Most of us stick with our row to hoe  
But not you, you're the black crow  
With a straight line, and no time  
For the birds of prey who wreck your nest  
Twice your size steal your best  
They set you on this course of your collision  
I am a stop along your way  
I am the words you'll never say  
I crossed the great beyond of fear  
I opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view  
You went there too  
Fly away little bird  
Find the song in you that no one's heard  
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight  
Through this short life  
Everyone's got a deep regret  
We try to ground ourselves to forget  
But your race to the end is neck and neck  
You love them, you love them not  
The birds of prey who wreck your nest,  
Twice your size steal your best  
They set you on this course of your collision  
I am a stop along your way  
I am the words you'll never say  
I crossed the great beyond of fear  
Opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view  
And you went there too  
But all along your chosen path are  
Window panes and sheets of glass  
That you won't see  
You fly too fast  
One day it will be over  
Fly away little bird  
The saddest song I ever heard  
Was the one that I wrote you in my heart  
That never made it to the world
