Am I helpless to refrain  
Like a jail it's so insane  
Am I disatisfied with love or unamused  
An incapacitated heart  
A long-shot fired in the dark  
I never knew that I could care so much  
At last the world will know  
That this is, this is no, no ordinary love song  
Oh no, no ordinary love song  
Oh no  
A man, a man who hoped so long  
So long to find  
If I could be your love song  
Oh yes  
Your one eternal love song  
Oh yes  
Sometimes when I turn  
You're standing unaware  
And I am filled with desire,  
Then again despair  
What can I do?  
Please tell me, can't I make you see?  
You're everything I need  
You are the missing key  
I'll be your instrument of love  
You play every chord in me  
At last the world will know  
That this is, this is no, no ordinary love song  
Oh no, no ordinary love song  
A girl, a girl who hoped so long  
So long to find  
If I could be your love song  
Oh yes  
Your one eternal love song  
Oh yes  
Sometimes when I turn  
You're standing unaware  
And I'm filled with desire,  
Then again despair  
What can I do?  
Please tell me, can't I make you see?  
You're everything I need  
You are the missing key  
I'll be your instrument of love  
You play every chord in me  
Sometimes when I turn  
You're standing unaware  
I'm filled with desire,  
Then again despair  
What can I do?  
Please tell me, can't I make you see?  
You're everything I need  
You are the missing key  
I'll be your instrument of love  
You play every chord in me  
Play me, play me, play me  
I love you
