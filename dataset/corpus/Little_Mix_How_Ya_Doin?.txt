Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through  
Why don't you leave your name and your number?  
I will get back to you (ooh)  
  
Ain't got no time for what you think can be described as love  
I've cut your hold on me, you're missing me, I've had enough  
It's been so long since you have treated me like I deserved  
  
So long, baby, I'm gone  
You can leave a message for me after the tone  
  
You called, I missed it  
You called, I missed it,  
You called, and I missed it,  
Never get back in, tired of listenin'  
  
Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through  
Why don't you leave your name and your number?

I'm through will wish the things with you and me could be so good  
Time to wake up or no make-ups can't make me a fool  
Too much history, now it comes down to one thing  
  
So long, baby, I'm gone  
you can leave a message for me after the tone (oh!)  
  
You called, I missed it  
You called, I missed it,  
You called, and I missed it,  
Never get back in, tired of listenin'
