Ooh-ooh  
Old Mr. Joe, he build a house away  
On top of some hill  
Old Mr. Joe knew he had to go, so he  
He got right down and wrote bank will  
He say now, here's to mother hen  
And her chicken, Lord have mercy now  
Master, will you take a roll in the mud  
Like you know you should?  
The old barnyard, the old barnyard  
Birds and the chick, ooh-wee  
Who's got to watch out for brother mongoose  
With his top hap and walking-stick?  
  
It's just the poor's brain washing  
(Poor's) They told me a long time ago,  
It's just the poor's brain washing, ooh-wee  
(Poor's brain washing) Now look at a thing like this  
  
Cinderella and her long lost fellow  
In the midnight hour, she lost her silver slipper  
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall  
While Jack and Jill had themselves a fall  
  
It's just the poor's (brain washing)  
And I don't need it no longer (washing)  
It's just the poor's brain washing  
Coming through to a poor man's child, ooh-wee, look at this  
  
Little Miss Muffet she sat on a tuffet  
While Little Red Riding Hood delivered her grandmom's food  
Ooh-wee ooh-wee  
Ooh-wee, look at one more thing like this  
The cow jumping over the moon  
While the dish got jealous, he grabbed the handy spoon  
  
It's just the poor's brain washing  
And I don't need it no longer, I don't want it no longer  
I don't need it no longer (washing)  
And I don't care for no more brain washing (washing)
