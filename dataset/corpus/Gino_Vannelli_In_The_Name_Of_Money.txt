The sun rises after midnight  
Big dreamers never sleep  
She takes a slow walk in the red light  
Wishin' on the stars in concrete  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
She's runnin' every light on the road to recognition  
  
[Chorus:]  
Under one condition  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
Anything goes  
When you play that game  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
You gotta stick it out  
If you want to claim your fame  
  
So some hotshot in a rag top  
Gets her on the silver screen  
A hundred mirrors far a backdrop  
But her face was never seen  
Agents of love, devils in disguise  
They're blowin' smoke in the little girl's eyes  
Yeah, she'll sign the dotted line and fall into submission  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday she'll be a leading lady  
In a baby blue Mercede'  
When she's rich and famous  
Her scandals will entertain us  
The badder the better  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
She's runnin' every light on the road to recognition  
  
[Chorus]
