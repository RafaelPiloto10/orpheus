Hit the city, hit the night  
Hit the club, sip the wine  
Just remember to leave on time  
  
Hit the red lights, check the girls  
You're steppin' into another world  
See the man, he'll spin you alive  
But just remember to leave on time  
  
Heartache, city of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city  
Crazy people in heartache city  
City of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city, it's a city of sin  
  
Check the star club, see the stars  
See the action  
In the back street bars  
Lookin' for love  
You're in the wrong place  
Tricks for kicks  
Can you stand the pace  
  
Heartache, city of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city  
Crazy people in heartache city  
City of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city  
  
Hit the city, hit the night  
Crazy people, neon light  
You pay your money  
It's no real crime  
But just remember to leave on time
