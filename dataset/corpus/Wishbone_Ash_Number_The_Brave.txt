In another time and space  
You meet your maker face to face.  
You know who cast the spell  
And turned his eye on you,  
Can't lose sight of it,  
Never fading out,  
Fading out of view.  
Number the brave  
In your heart,  
Number the brave,  
For they died for you.  
Out of the free zone  
Into the night -  
There has to be a sacrifice.  
It's such a scary feeling,  
You must feel it too -  
From a fallen angel fading in and fading out of view.  
So when we reach the other side  
You know their fight is justified.  
Now you see the meaning  
Of the dream they share with you -  
It's a burning light  
Never fading out,  
Fading out of view.  
Number the brave  
In your heart,  
Number the brave,  
For they died for you.
