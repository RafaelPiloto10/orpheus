Here is a song from the wrong side of town  
Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound  
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down  
Here is a page from the emptiest stage  
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made  
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong here  
The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets  
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet  
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong  
Feels like home  
I should have known  
From my first breath  
God send the only true friend I call mine  
Pretend that I'll make amends the next time  
Befriend the glorious end of the line  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong here
