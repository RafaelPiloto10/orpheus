You like to think  
That you're the only one  
Who understands my needs  
And you tell everyone  
That I can't live without you  
Even for one day  
But who gave you the right  
To talk about the way  
I feel so deep inside?  
Now I realize  
You were never mine  
We were never right  
Baby you will find  
  
I will survive  
I'm gonna make it through  
Just give me time  
I will get over you  
I will survive  
No matter what you do  
Just wait and see  
I will get over you  
'Cause baby I will survive  
'Cause baby I will survive  
  
What makes you think  
That I don't see the ways  
You made a fool of me?  
Don't laugh behind my back  
'Cause what goes around  
I promise you comes back  
Now I realize  
You were never mine  
We were never right  
Baby you will find  
  
I will survive  
I'm gonna make it through  
Just give me time  
I will get over you  
I will survive  
No matter what you do  
Just wait and see  
I will get over you  
'Cause baby I will survive  
  
I will survive  
I'm gonna make it through  
Just give me time  
I will get over you  
I will survive  
No matter what you do  
Just wait and see  
I will get over you  
  
I will survive  
I'm gonna make it through  
Just give me time  
I will get over you  
I will survive  
No matter what you do  
Just wait and see  
I will get over you  
  
I will survive  
I'm gonna make it through  
I will survive  
I will get over you  
  
'Cause baby I will survive
