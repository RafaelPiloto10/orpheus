I think its only fair to say  
We'd welcome riches down our way  
No stigma knotted in my hair  
I want to be a millionaire  
  
Nevertheless I must insist  
A thought is spared for those who missed  
The handouts when it came to wealth  
To education and good health  
  
The time has come now all can see  
As seeing this is killing me  
Our future victim to command  
Together we can lend a hand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't blame me for wanting more  
The facts are too hard too ignore  
I'm scared to death of poverty  
I only want what's best for me  
  
But even so I'm holding on  
I think the world can live as one  
If only credence took the lead  
The world would see a world to feed  
  
An endless sea of blood that's spilt  
Enough to sail an ark of guilt  
And when we lend our helping hand  
We'll have our green and pleasant land
