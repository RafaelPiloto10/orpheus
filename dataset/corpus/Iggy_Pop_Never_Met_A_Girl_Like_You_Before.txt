I've never known a girl like you before  
Now just like in a song from days of yore  
Here you come a knockin', knockin' on my door  
And I've never met a girl like you before  
  
You give me just a taste so I want more  
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw  
Cos you've got me crawlin', crawlin' on the floor  
And I've never met a girl like you before  
  
You've made me acknowledge the devil in me  
I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically  
Hope that I'm talkin' allegorically  
Know that I'm talkin' about the way I feel  
And I've never known a girl like you before  
Never, never, never, never  
Never known a girl like you before  
  
This old town's changed so much  
Don't feel like I belong  
Too many protest singers  
Not enough protest songs  
And now you've come along  
Yes you've come along  
And I've never met a girl like you before...
