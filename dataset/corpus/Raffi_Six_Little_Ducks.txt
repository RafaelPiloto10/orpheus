Lyrics for Animal Songs  
6 Little Ducks  
Traditional  
From the album More Singable Songs  
Six little ducks that I once knew  
Fast ones, skinny ones, fair ones too.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Down to the river they would go.  
Wibble wobble, wibble wobble to and fro.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Home from the river they would come.  
Wibble wobble, wibble wobble, ho-hum-hum.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Six little ducks that I once knew  
Fat ones, skinny ones, fair ones too.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.
