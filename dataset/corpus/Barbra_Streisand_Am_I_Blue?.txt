[Fanny:]  
  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you  
Am I blue  
You'd be too if each plan with your man  
Done fell through  
There was a time, I was his only one  
But now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Lordy  
Was I gay  
Till today  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Am I blue  
There was a time, I was his only one  
But now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Oh lordy  
Was I gay  
Till today  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Oh god, did you hear that note  
It was given to me by my friend Grace Moore on my birthday  
Oy, was she glad to get rid of it  
Through  
I think I give it to her back, or her front  
Am I blue  
Oy, is this thing heavy
