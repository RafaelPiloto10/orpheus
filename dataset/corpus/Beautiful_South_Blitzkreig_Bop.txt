(Ramones)  
  
They're forming in straight line  
They're going through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
They're piling in the back seat  
They're generating steam heat  
Pulsating to the back beat  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
Hey ho, let's go  
Shoot 'em in the back now  
What they want, I don't know  
They're all reved up and ready to go  
They're forming in a straight line  
They're going through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
The Blitzkrieg Bop
