Hello, everyone, it's nice to be here  
I've come so far to see you all  
I can see your deep blue eyes  
They sleep beneath the open sky  
Before you stands one like your brother  
Swear to God he needs no other  
But how can I afford to be  
Here with you so carelessly  
You know what you did was so unkind  
You search for the life we need to find  
There's right and there's wrong  
And there's good and there's bad  
And there's an answer to this I wish I had  
  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
  
Well we had a party in our hotel last night  
It ended up in an awful fight  
My friend left me and my heart too  
I hope I don't end up like you  
  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
  
Your country is a wonderful place  
It pales my England into disgrace  
To buy a drink that is so much more reasonable  
I think I'll go there when it gets seasonable  
You know what you did was so unkind  
You search for the life you need to find  
There's right and there's wrong  
And there's good and there's bad  
And there's an answer to this I wish I had  
  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do
