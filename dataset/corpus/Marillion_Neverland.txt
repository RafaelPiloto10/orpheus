When the darkness takes me over  
Face down, emptier than zero  
Invisible you come to me  
Quietly  
  
Stay beside me  
Whisper to me "Here I am"  
And the loneliness fades  
  
Some people think I'm somethin'  
Well you gave me that, I know  
But I always feel like nothing  
When I'm in the dark alone  
  
You provide the soul, the spark that drives me on  
Makes me something more than flesh and bone  
  
At times like these  
Any fool can see  
Any fool can see  
Your love inside me  
  
All these years  
Truth In front of my eyes  
While I denied  
What my heart knows was right  
  
At times like these  
Any fool can see  
Any fool can see  
Your love inside me  
  
I want to be someone  
I want to be someone  
I want to be someone  
Who someone would want to be  
Someone would want to be  
  
Wendy  
Darling  
In the kitchen  
With your dreams  
  
Will you fly  
again  
Take to the sky  
again  
  
Undo the hooks  
Once and for all  
Banish the tic tic tic tok tok tok  
Again  
  
Will you be  
Yourself for me  
Cause I can take it  
I can stand  
Anything  
  
When you're with me  
I can stand it  
I can stand  
  
But when you're gone  
I never land  
In Neverland  
  
Want to be someone someone would want to be  
someone someone would want to be  
someone someone would want to be  
someone someone someone someone  
  
Any fool  
Any fool can see  
Any fool can see  
Your love  
Inside me
