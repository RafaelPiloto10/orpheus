Called you on the phone  
Said I'm comin' through  
Hope your all alone  
Cause I got plans for you  
  
We could stay at home  
Or dance and hang all night  
As long as I'm with you  
Doesn't matter what we do  
  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Or what I'm gonna do  
Just know that I'm here with you  
Don't try understand  
Baby there's no mystery  
Cause you know how I am  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm real  
What you get is what you see  
What you tryin' to do to me  
You want to say your mine  
Be with me all the time  
You're falling so in love  
And you just can't get enough  
You're tellin' all your friends  
She's a bad, bad bitch  
  
You like the way I dress  
The way I wear my hair  
Show me off to all your friends  
And baby I don't care  
Just as long as you  
Tell them who I am  
Tell them I'm the one who made you give a damn  
  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Or what I'm gonna do  
Just know that I'm here with you  
Don't try understand  
Baby there's no mystery  
Cause you know how I am  
  
[Chorus]
