Come hither, ye faithful  
Triumphantly sing  
Come, see in the manger  
The angels' dread King!  
  
Refrain:  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye, come hither, O come ye, come hither  
O come ye, come hither to worship the Lord.  
  
True Son of the Father  
He comes from the skies  
To be born of a virgin  
He doth not despise.  
  
Refrain:  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye, come hither, O come ye, come hither  
O come ye, come hither to worship the Lord.  
  
Hark! hark! to the angels  
All singing in Heav'n  
"To God in the highest  
All glory be given!"  
  
Refrain:  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye, come hither, O come ye, come hither  
O come ye, come hither to worship the Lord.  
  
To Thee, then, O Jesu, this day of Thy birth  
Be glory and honor through heaven and earth  
True Godhead incarnate! Omnipotent Word  
O come let us hasten, O come let us hasten  
O come let us hasten, to worship the Lord!...
