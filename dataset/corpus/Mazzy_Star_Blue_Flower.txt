Waitin' for a sign from you  
Waitin' for a signal to change  
Have you forgotten what your love can do?  
Is this the end?  
  
Walkin' through the city  
Your boots are high-hilled and are shinin' bright  
The sun was sparklin' on the shaft of your knife  
Flower in the morning rain  
Dying in my hand  
  
Was it all in vain?  
Superstar in your own private movie  
I wanted just a minor part  
But I'm no fool  
I know you're cool  
I never really wanted your heart  
  
You're the keeper of the key  
Nothing seems to bring you down  
It's not that cool when I'm around  
Flower in the morning rain  
Dying in my hand  
  
Was it all in vain?  
Superstar in your own bright movie  
I wanted just a minor part  
But I'm no fool  
I know you're cool  
I never really wanted your heart
