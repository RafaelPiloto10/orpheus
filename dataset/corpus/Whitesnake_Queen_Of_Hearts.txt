She was the keeper of all my reason,  
Possessor of all I owned,  
She kept me on the edge of darkness  
With words as cold as stone.  
Then you came along,  
Your eyes were flashing with desire,  
Oh babe, you got me burning, so much  
You got my soul on fire.  
  
Honey, you move me,  
You got me so I can't sleep at night,  
You tell me you believe in me,  
And you say you're gonna treat me right.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy roller,  
They say that love's a gamble,  
But, I got the Queen of Hearts.  
  
If I could touch the crystal silence  
That we have after making love,  
Just to tell you I need you here  
In the glow of the stars above.  
  
If you ever leave, or deceive,  
Or fool around,  
You could be right,  
You could be wrong,  
But, woman, I know I'll miss you  
When you're gone.  
  
Honey, you move me,  
Like the wind thro' a willow tree.  
Ain't no doubt about it, baby,  
You make the blind man see.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy Roller,  
They say that love's a gamble,  
But, I got the Queen of Hearts.  
  
You drive me crazy when you walk,  
Crazy when you talk,  
Crazy when you walk with me.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy roller,  
Gonna tell you, holy roller,  
You're the Queen of Hearts.  
  
You gave me the answer,  
I knew right from the start.  
I'm gonna tell you, holy roller,  
You're the Queen of Hearts
