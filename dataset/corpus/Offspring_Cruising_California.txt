Hey ho, let's go  
  
(Go go go!) turn up the beat, yeah  
(Oh oh oh!) I wanna feel it  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
Cause we're never going home till the summer's all gone  
  
Summer time, living's easy  
Cruising, bumping, my huntington beach  
Cause the sun will shine  
We have a good time  
They all line up for a bump and grind  
  
And the girl that you want is directly out in front  
And she's waving her caboose at you  
You sneeze achoo  
She calls you out and boom!  
  
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk  
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk, bum-bumpin' in my trunk (oh yeah)  
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh)  
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh), bum-bumpin' in my trunk (let's go)  
  
(Go go go!) turn up the beat, yeah  
(Oh oh oh!) I wanna feel it  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
Cause we're never going home till the summer's all gone  
  
The sun goes down, the friepit's leep  
It's another summer night here in the oc  
Well I know a baller but I do have an impala  
And I might say 'hey' but I'll never say 'holla'  
  
The girl with the glass and a g-string just like a floss  
Well she's waving her caboose at you  
I bet you do  
She calls you out (uh huh)  
  
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh)  
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh), bum-bumpin' in my trunk (bump that truck)  
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh)  
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh) bum-bumpin' in my trunk (let's go)  
  
(Go go go!) turn up the beat, yeah  
(Oh oh oh!) I wanna feel it  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
With the radio on, plays it all summer long  
  
(Go go go!) you're all I'm breakin'  
(Oh oh oh!) my friends are drinkin'  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
Cause we're never going home till the summer's all gone  
  
(California)  
(California)  
  
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh)  
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk (uh huh), bum-bumpin' in my trunk (hey ho, let's  
Go)  
  
(Go go go!) turn up the beat, yeah  
(Oh oh oh!) I wanna feel it  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
With the radio on, plays it all summer long  
  
(Go go go!) you're all I'm breakin'  
(Oh oh oh!) my friends are drinkin'  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
Cause we're never going home till the summer's all gone  
  
(California) don't you wish that you could come  
Cause we're never going home till the summer's all gone
