[Chorus:]  
Just like a prisoner,  
He don't know right from wrong.  
Just like a baby,  
He sings a pleading song  
  
And that's why  
So many tears must fall.  
Yes, that's why  
So many tears must fall.  
  
Just like a sailor,  
He steers away from home.  
He feels a tidal wave  
In his heart, but he ain't alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm like that prisoner,  
I don't know right from wrong.  
Just like that baby,  
I sing a pleading song  
  
And that's why  
You'll never know how I feel.  
Yes, that's why  
You'll never know how I feel.
