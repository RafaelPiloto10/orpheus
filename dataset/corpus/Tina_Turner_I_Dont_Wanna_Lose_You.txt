Women of a certain age  
They learn to rely and judge all his responses  
Having played the mating game  
She doesn't waste time cause all that she wants is  
Really honest emotions  
Ones he can't help but show  
Though I hardly know your name  
I know about love and I know  
  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't even want to say goodbye  
I just want to hold on  
To this true love, true love  
  
Women who have made mistakes  
Are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances  
She will play the waiting game  
She's never impressed by those manly advances  
I know I've only just met you  
Maybe I should know better  
But when you look at me that way  
There's something inside that's so right  
  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't even want to say goodbye  
I just want to hold on  
To this true love, true love  
I don't want to lose you  
And I always want to feel this way  
Cause every time I'm with you  
I feel true love, true love  
  
Tell me you're real  
You're not pretending  
Let's make a deal  
My heart's depending on you
