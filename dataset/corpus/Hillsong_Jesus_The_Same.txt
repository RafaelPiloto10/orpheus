There's a light in the darkness that shines  
Giving hope to all the world  
Hope to all the world  
There's a door that's been opened to all  
Into a new and living way  
A new and living way  
  
Praise the name of Jesus  
Perfect Redeemer  
Star of the morning  
Yesterday, today and forever  
Jesus the same  
Jesus the same  
  
There's a fire that burns in our hearts  
To see the lost return to the Father  
It's a passion that's not of our own  
We have seen it in the Son  
In the face of the Son  
  
Wonderful Counselor  
Mighty God  
Eternal Father  
Prince of Peace
