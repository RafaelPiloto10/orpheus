Cold hands touching my face  
Don't hide - the snake can see you  
Old friends you might not remember  
Fading away from you  
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory  
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory  
and we looked  
And we passed  
Through the hallways of shatterproof glass  
she runs through the night as if nobody cares  
She screams and she cries and ignores all the stares  
She wants me to come, but I'm never going there  
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory  
The goldheart mountaintop queen directory
