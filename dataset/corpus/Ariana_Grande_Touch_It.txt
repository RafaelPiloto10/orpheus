[Verse 1]  
How do I make the phone ring?  
Why do I even care?  
How are you all around me when you're not really there?  
When you're not really there?  
How do I feel you on me when you're not on my skin?  
Why do you say you want me, then tell me "I'm not coming in"?  
Baby, just come on in  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave  
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
  
[Verse 2]  
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?  
Why don't we face the danger just for the night and forget?  
Baby, let's just forget  
Remind me why we're taking a break  
It's obviously insane  
Cause we both know what we want  
So why don't we fall in love?  
Baby, let's fall in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave  
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
  
[Refrain]  
Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it  
  
[Bridge]  
Remind me why we're taking a break  
It's obviously insane  
Cause we both know what we want  
So why don't we fall in love?  
Baby, let's be in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone  
And I remember all the places you wanna go  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave  
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace  
Take me all the way  
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it  
  
[Outro]  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna  
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
