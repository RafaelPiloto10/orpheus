What if the sky was turning red  
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed  
Laying face to face, oh girl, I love the way you sound  
When you rain on me, so tonight let's act it out  
Show you how it's gon' be, I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips  
Hold your body by your legs and hips  
The world can't end until we finish  
Girl we gon'  
  
We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world  
And they depended on us to make earth shaking love  
As we lay down, lay down  
You telling me to go harder, go harder  
You telling me to go deeper, go deeper  
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker  
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down now  
  
All these vibrations from your legs  
Massaging my back  
I got your body shivering  
'Cause we're covered in sweat  
Girl I like the way it opens up  
When you throw it back babe  
Girl it might be too much  
Babe if you keep doing that  
I got that pillow for your knees right here  
Baby can you make it disappear  
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear  
Then I wanna make you holler  
  
We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world  
And they depended on us to make earth shaking love  
As we lay down, lay down  
You telling me to go harder, go harder  
You telling me to go deeper, go deeper  
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker  
And as we lay down, lay down now  
  
Do it like we only got one  
Baby let's pretend we only got one night  
One last time, let me take my time, do it to you right  
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down  
But that won't stop me from turning that thing around  
Girl yeah  
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfucking  
End of the world  
And they depending on us to make earth shaking love  
And as we lay down, lay down now  
You telling me to go harder, go harder  
You telling me to go deeper, go deeper  
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker  
Lay down, lay down now  
Lay down right now
