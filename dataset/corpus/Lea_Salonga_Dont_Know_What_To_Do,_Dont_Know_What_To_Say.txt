I have loved you only in my mind  
But I know that there will come a time  
You'll feel this feeling I have inside  
  
You're a 'hopeless romantic' is what they say  
Falling in and out of love just like a play  
Memorizing each line I still don't know what to say  
What to say...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't know what to do whenever you are near  
Don't know what to say my heart is floating in tears  
When you pass by I could fly  
Every minute every second of the day  
I dream of you in the most special way  
You're beside me all the time  
  
I have loved you and I'll always will  
Call it crazy but I know someday you'll feel  
This feeling I have for you inside  
  
I'm a hopeless romantic I know I am  
Memorized all the lines but here I am  
Struggling for words I still don't know what to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every minute every second of the day  
I dream of you in the most special way  
You're beside me all the time  
  
All the time... [Repeat x 3]
