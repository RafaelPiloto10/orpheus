Nothing suffocates you more than  
The passing of everyday human events  
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make  
Your children breath into survive  
  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
  
And when we were good  
You just closed your eyes  
So when we are bad  
We'll scar your minds  
  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
  
You'll never grow up to be a big-rock-star-  
Celebrated-victim-of-your-fame  
They'll just cut our wrists like  
Cheap coupons and say that death  
Was on sale today  
  
And when we were good  
You just closed your eyes  
So when we are bad  
We'll scar your minds  
  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of one is a tragedy  
The death of millions is just a statistic  
  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
But I'm not a slave to god  
That doesn't exist  
And I'm not a slave to world  
That doesn't give a shit  
  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
