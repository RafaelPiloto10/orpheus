[Verse1]  
She wakes up in the morning, jumps in the shower  
Then rubs on her lotion, while she's wrapped in a towel  
And no music on, but she dance till perfection  
I swear the bathrooms the club, the ways she's showing love to her reflection  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Every morning I watch her from behind, but she don't know  
I pretend that I'm asleep, but I don't miss her show  
  
[Chorus:]  
My favorite of the day,  
Is when she dance in mirror  
Dance in the mirror  
There's nothing more I can say  
Just watch her dance in the mirror  
Dance  
  
Oeh she's so cute, cute, cute  
Dancin' in there nude, nude, nude  
Oooh  
  
My favorite part of the day  
Is when she dance in the mirror  
Dance in the mirror  
  
[Verse2]  
It's late in the evening, we got dinner reservations  
She's taking her time, but I don't mind waiting  
I don't get impatient, cause when she gets naked  
Oeh the temptation, oeh the temptation  
You make me wanna cancel all of our plans  
Keep you right where you stand, just wanna see you dance  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Every morning I watch her from behind, but she don't know  
I pretend that I'm asleep, but I don't miss her show  
  
[Chorus:]  
My favorite of the day,  
Is when she dance in mirror  
Dance in the mirror  
There's nothing more I can say  
Just watch her dance in the mirror  
Dance  
  
Oeh she's so cute, cute, cute  
Dancin' in there nude, nude, nude  
Oooh  
  
My favorite part of the day  
Is when she dance in the mirror  
Dance in the mirror  
  
[Bridge:]  
Ooooh oe ooooh oh oh  
She's singing to herself like  
Da da, da da, da da da  
  
Ooooh oe ooooh oh oh  
She's singing to herself like  
Da da, da da, da da da  
  
[Chorus:]  
My favorite of the day,  
Is when she dance in mirror  
Dance in the mirror  
There's nothing more I can say  
Just watch her dance in the mirror  
Dance  
  
Oeh she's so cute, cute, cute  
Dancin' in there nude, nude, nude  
Oooh  
  
My favorite part of the day  
Is when she dance in the mirror  
Dance in the mirror
