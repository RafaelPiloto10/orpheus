So many heartaches i put you through  
So much trouble and pain  
So many tears i made you cry  
I'll never put you though that again  
  
I'm gonna make every minute count  
And cover you with all my love  
  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna give it all up to you  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true  
  
You're not alone in the world  
There's always someone who cares  
This time i'm sure i'm your girl  
I'm not going anywhere  
  
Let me show you what the girl can do  
I'll cover you with all my love  
  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make it all up to you  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true  
  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make it all up to you  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna love you through, through and through  
  
I kept you waiting for so long  
Now i see that i was wrong  
I guess love you oh so much  
Now i thrill to your touch  
  
I kept you waiting for so long  
Now that's all in the past  
Don't you say you can't go on  
I'm gonna give you love that lasts  
  
I'm gonna make ever minute count  
And cover you with all my love  
  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make it all up to you  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true  
  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna make it all up to you  
If it makes you feel good  
I'm gonna love you through, through and through
