Did you get my card?  
Did you read my love letter?  
Did it touch your heart?  
When you read my love letter  
  
Sunny days, smiling face  
Spirit filled, heaven praise  
Memories in my mind  
Reminiscing of good times  
Miracles, so amazed  
Soldiers far away  
It makes me ask the question baby

Love making history  
A toast to our victories  
Sweet dreams, butterflies  
Holding hands, side by side  
Best friends, families
