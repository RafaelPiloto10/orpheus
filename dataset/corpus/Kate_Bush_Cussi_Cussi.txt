Please  
Don't be-e afraid of this  
Coz' we don't move the way they do.  
Surely you don't love them?  
So why hide it away from me?  
Please be easy you got it I haven't,  
Somewhere in your "harmineenou, home-arneenou"  
There's a room in a long form  
Where you just play a tune  
It gets us really stoned,  
Really amazingly,  
Cussi, Cussi, Cussi,  
Cussi, Cussi, Cussi. Ah.  
Don't let them in  
When you see that secret smile.  
Baby, don't let them in  
When you feel the ribbons eye.  
You get the wrong idea,  
You'll get broken,  
And you never let yourself go again with me.  
And I've notice in your eyes  
A sadness I don't like.  
To recognise  
You are feeling a heavy side of your ecstacy.  
Now you're getting to me,  
So that I can I hardly bear it.  
So that I can I hardly bear it.  
No no,  
Don't get too deep.  
Don't let them in  
When you see that secret smile.  
Baby, don't let them in  
When you feel the ribbons eye.  
You get the wrong idea,  
You'll get broken,  
And you never let yourself go again with me,  
Properly.
