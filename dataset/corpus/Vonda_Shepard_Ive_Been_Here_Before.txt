I've tried so many times  
  
To Keep romance alive  
  
I guess I never really had true love  
  
Then you came my way  
  
And nothing's been the same  
  
Now you're all I'm ever thinking of  
  
  
If I had the say you'd be staying  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
Hey...I've been here before  
  
Looking in your eyes see just a little more...I said  
  
Hey...I've been here before  
  
Someone must have sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
One in a million boy  
  
You fill me up with joy  
  
Sometimes I don't believe in accidents  
  
I know we're meant to be  
  
It's so plain to see  
  
From here on out it where the fun begins  
  
  
If I have the say you'll be staying  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
Hey...I've been here before  
  
Looking in your eyes see just a little more...I say  
  
Hey...I've been here before  
  
Someone must have sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
Sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
(Bridge)  
  
Sometimes the obvious is hard to see  
  
Now here you are standing right in front of me  
  
I could have missed my one and only  
  
Chance for love, chance for love...oh!  
  
  
Hey...I've been here before  
  
Looking in your eyes see just a little more...I said  
  
Hey...I've been here before  
  
Someone must have sent you down to brighten up my  
  
  
Sent you down to brighten up my life  
  
  
(Chorus)
