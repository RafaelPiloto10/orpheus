When you get weak,  
And you need to test your will  
When life's complete,  
But there's something  
Missing still  
Distracting you from this  
Must be the one you love  
Must be the one whose magic touch  
Can change your mind  
Don't let another day go by  
Without the magic touch  
  
Distracting you  
(change your mind)  
Supporting you  
(change your mind)  
Embracing you  
(change your mind)  
Convincing you  
(change your mind)  
  
When you're confused and  
The world has got you down  
When you feel used and  
You just can't play the clown  
Protecting you from this  
Must be the one you love  
Must be the one whose magic touch  
Can change your mind  
Don't let another day go by  
Without the magic touch  
  
Protecting you  
(change your mind)  
Restoring you  
(change your mind)  
Revealing you  
(change your mind)  
Soothing you  
(change your mind)  
  
You hear the sound,  
You wait around  
And get the word  
You see the picture  
Changing everything  
You've heard  
Destroying you with this  
Must be the one you love  
Must be the one  
Whose magic touch  
Can change your mind  
Don't let another day go by  
Without the magic touch  
  
Destroying you  
(change your mind)  
Embracing you  
(change your mind)  
Protecting you  
(change your mind)  
Confining you  
(change your mind)  
Distracting you  
(change your mind)  
Supporting you  
(change your mind)  
Distorting you  
(change your mind)  
Controlling you  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind, change your mind  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind  
(change your mind)  
  
The morning comes  
And there's an odor in the room  
The scent of love,  
More than a million roses bloom  
Embracing you with this  
Must be the one you love  
Must be the one  
Whose magic touch  
Can change your mind  
Don't let another day go by  
Without the magic touch  
  
Embracing you  
(change your mind)  
Concealing you  
(change your mind)  
Protecting you  
(change your mind)  
Revealing you  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind, change your mind  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind, change your mind  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind  
(change your mind)  
Change your mind, change your mind  
Change your mind  
Change your mind, change your mind  
Change your mind  
Change your mind, change your mind  
Change your mind, change your mind
