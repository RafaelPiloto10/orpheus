Embrace me  
My sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me  
My irreplaceable you  
Just to look at you  
My heart grows tipsy in me  
You and you alone  
  
Bring out the gypsy in me  
  
I love all  
The many charms about you  
Above all  
I want my arms about you  
Don't be naughty baby  
Come to me  
Come to me do  
My sweet embraceable you  
  
I love all  
The many charms about you  
Above all  
I want my arms about you  
Don't be naughty baby  
Come to me  
Come to me do  
My sweet embraceable you
