Uh, uh, yeah, uh-huh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Verse 1]  
Yo, I ain't got no reason to trick or spend  
Mami, I'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickering  
Player like me? every season these chicks have been  
Talking how I came through the P's in a sicker Benz  
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends  
Jewels so icey I need freezers to stick 'em in  
I be's in the keys with a click of friends  
Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin  
I don't care if a skeezer is thick or thin  
It's going look like she having a seizure I stick it in  
Skeos say "can I get the keys to ya six again?"  
After I nut, that's when amnesia be kicking in  
Most broads I done met, ain't see a guy  
Who spend a G on Gucci T's, five for sweats  
I'm what chicks strive to get, I stay in the P.J's  
You thinking I'm talking private jets, uh  
  
[Chorus]  
I need the cash in my palm, the ice in my charm, ma' be easy  
(Watch it, please)  
Want to lean to the side while I cruise in your ride, ma' be easy  
(Put down that cheese)  
Gotta have a broad wanting and let me hold something, ma' be easy  
(You get nothing from me)  
You get nothing!  
  
[Verse 2]  
So the kid never stresses a female  
And if you ask where I live they gon' give you  
Addresses to e-mail  
All that cops can suggest is that he sell  
How I'm goin' push it unless it's a v-12  
From S's to CL's, I request is  
In the head rests his TV's dwell  
They heard how many albums I presses for retail  
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale  
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills  
Getting Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled  
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal  
Still dames have been giving me slow neck  
And I don't even know what they real names have been  
I feel ashamed to spend, cause when it comes to knocking 'em down  
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Ma you must of had too many weed totes  
Cause I ain't giving you any see-notes  
I'm all about floating on them new skinny speed boats  
Hundred and something with two skinny deep throats  
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat  
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes  
No more shopping sprees I'm rough wit the ends  
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins  
I deal wit nothing but tens  
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends  
Chickens get keys, scuffing the Benz  
Cause they want to lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens  
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link long view  
(One try) I ain't trying to put clinks on you  
Hope tricking ain't one of the things you think John do  
Cause that's the way you end up wit a drink on you mami  
  
[Chorus]
