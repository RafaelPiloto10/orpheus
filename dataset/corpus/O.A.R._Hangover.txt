Woke up with a headache from the night before  
Cause sometimes I drink  
Spent the night with my head in the toilet bowl  
It's where I like to think  
I said cause I don't want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
La-da-da hey-o  
  
Ya ever spend all night thinking about your life  
Well I suggest we try  
Well it's something that you're gonna wanna do with the night  
Cause I tend to cry  
I said cause I don't want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Lalalala had-ey-o  
  
Ya ever spent all day thinkin' bout the night  
It's something that you do  
When you think away too much you're out of sight  
What ya gonna doi said cause I don't want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Lalalala had-ey-o
