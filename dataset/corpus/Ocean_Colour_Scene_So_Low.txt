If anyone rises at 6:31  
And fakes all day that they're having their fun  
They never did get it right  
Since they got it so low.  
  
To anyone drinking the morning away  
The afternoon will prove a mistake  
They never will get it right  
Now they've got it so low.  
  
[Chorus]  
And we laugh and we drink,  
And we teach ourselves not to think.  
We never did get it right  
Since we got it so low.  
  
To all of the faces that freeze for you there  
In your memory when you try not to care  
They never disappear down the slow road  
  
For all of those people who bleed by the side  
And split from their tongues  
And sharpen their knives.  
They never will get a life  
Now they've got it so low  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cornfields and pig-tails and fish in the stream  
The night when the boys stole the billion dollar dream  
From the high-jinx school for girls  
Down the road.  
  
Stories are smoke trails  
And some may be true.  
You're listening to me  
But I'm talking to you.  
I hope you never fall from grace  
If you get it so low.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we laugh and we drink  
And we find it hard not to think.  
We never did get it right  
Since we got it so low.
