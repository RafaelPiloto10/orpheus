I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour  
But heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job  
And heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
In my life  
Why do I give valuable time  
To people who don't care if I live or die?  
  
Two lovers entwined pass me by  
And heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job  
And heaven knows I'm miserable now  
  
In my life  
Oh, why do I give valuable time  
To people who don't care if I live or die?  
  
What she asked of me at the end of the day  
Caligula would have blushed  
  
"You've been in the house too long" she said  
And I (naturally) fled  
  
In my life  
Why do I smile  
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?
