There's a blue light in my best friend's room  
There's a blue light in his eyes  
There's a blue light, yeah  
I wanna see it shine  
There's a ship that sails by my window  
There's a ship that sails on by  
There's a world under it  
I think I see it sailing away  
I think it's sailing miles  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by  
There's a world outside my doorstep  
Flames over everyone hot  
Don't you see them shining  
I wanna hear them beating for me  
I think I hear them waves  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by  
Crashing me by
