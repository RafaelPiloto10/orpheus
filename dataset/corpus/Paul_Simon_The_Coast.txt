A family of musicians took shelter for the night  
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia  
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine  
Rose of Jericho and Bougainvillea  
  
This is a lonely life  
Sorrows everywhere you turn  
And that's worth something  
When you think about it  
That's worth some money  
That's worth something  
When you think about it  
That is worth some money  
  
A trip to the market  
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight  
Settling over Washington  
A trip to the market  
A trip around the world  
Where the evening meal  
Is negotiable, if there is one.  
  
This is a lonely life  
Sorrows everywhere you turn  
And that's worth something  
When you think about it  
That's worth some money  
That's worth something  
When you think about it  
That is worth some money  
  
To prove that I love you  
Because I believe in you  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
If I have money  
If I have children  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
  
We are standing in the sunlight  
The early morning sunlight  
In the harbor church of St. Cecilia  
To praise a soul's returning to the earth  
To the rose of Jericho and the Bougainvillea  
  
To prove that I love you  
Because I believe in you  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
If I have money  
If I have children  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
  
If I have weaknesses  
Don't let them blind me now  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
Leaving the shadow of the valley behind me now  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah
