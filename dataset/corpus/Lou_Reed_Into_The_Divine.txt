I think you're, oh, so beautiful  
I think you're so kind  
And I think I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
And I think of an apple core  
When you start thinking of God  
  
And I know I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
And I think you're so beautiful  
Beautiful as the blackened space and stars  
But all I see is a coreless seed  
When you cry for a God who's not there  
  
And I think you're so beautiful  
And I see you're as the sun  
That shines out through these galaxies  
Shimmering and warm, ah  
  
And I think you're so beautiful, oh, oh, oh, oh  
And if there's one thing I believe at all  
It's how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
It's how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
It's how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
  
How much, how much  
How much, how much  
How much, how much  
How much, how much, how, how much  
If you disappear into the  
How much, how much  
(How much), hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
How much
