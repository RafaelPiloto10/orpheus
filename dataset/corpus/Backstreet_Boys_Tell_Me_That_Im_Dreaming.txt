You had me thinking right from the start  
That our feeling will never keep us apart  
You had me thinking that I was the one  
But I never knew it was only for fun  
Chorus  
Tell me that me that I'm dreamin'  
Say you're never leavin'  
Don't you wanna be with me

Tell me that I'm dreamin'  
Say you're never leavin'  
Your heart will be safe you'll see  
Isn't it true that my love for you  
Is here to stay, it'll never go away  
Isn't it true that my love for you  
Is here to stay baby there will always be that day

Chorus  
Know how can I know that summer days are gettin' lonely  
And how can I know that my love is gettin' stronger  
I dream away  
Spoken  
Girl if you only knew  
Just how much I really love you  
I think about you night and day  
My love for you will always stay  
I never knew it was only for fun  
You had me thinkin' that I was the one  
Chorus  
Come on now you and me girl we were meant to be  
Together forever in harmony, yeah (x4)  
Tell me that I'm dreaming (x3)  
Say it all again  
Tell me that I'm dreaming (x3)  
Sing it to me one more time  
Repeat to fade
