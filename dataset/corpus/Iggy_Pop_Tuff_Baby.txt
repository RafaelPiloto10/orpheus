Psst, psst, hey girl  
Just come here, come on, come here  
  
I love your hair  
Your pearly smile  
Your icing scan  
Society's vile  
Insect cars  
Horny men from Mars  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you, tuff baby  
  
You've know the score  
For a while now  
Your dad don't care  
Your mom's aware  
Your hands are new  
I wonder what they'll do  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you, tuff baby  
  
There's chaos in the old suburbs  
And downtown too they got the blues  
But you'll survive  
With a hard glint in your eyes  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you  
I love you, tuff baby [Repeat: x3]
