Deep in the night, I remember  
There I am reaching for you  
Longing to turn to you  
That's all I want oh so much  
Deep in the night I need you  
To touch me  
Deep in the night, I wait for daylight  
Daytimes I always get through  
But when the sun goes down  
That's when I feel  
I feel oh so alone  
Deep in the night I need you  
To hold me  
Read a book and I think about you  
Put it down and I think about you  
I make some coffee and I think about you  
Wash up the cup and I think about you  
Wind the clock and I think about you  
Turn on the light and I think about you  
When I punch the pillow and I think about you  
Deep in the night I feel lonely  
Why didn't I try someone new?  
It didn't work out I know  
But I know but I know  
Because I try I try  
Deep in the night  
I need you beside me  
Deep deep in the night
