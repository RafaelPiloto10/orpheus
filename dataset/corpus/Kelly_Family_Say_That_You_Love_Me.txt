Oh my baby if I could only evoke the love  
My heart yearns for like the desert longing for the rain  
Sometimes my baby when I feel lonely and I cry  
Oh I laid myself down to close my eyes  
And wish that you were here  
  
Chorus:  
Say that you love me  
Say that you need me  
Say that you want me all the way  
Say that you love me all the way  
  
Why my baby was I made to need so much  
When there's so little out there  
To grasp on to and wipe the tears away  
Oh babe believe me  
It's an endless longing for one's love  
Why do I dream for so much  
When I know  
It all just can't be had  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh darling  
You and I know that I'm strong  
But with you I'm only stronger  
So make me help please  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh my baby where am I going to find  
The answer  
Can it be  
The answer's not for me
