Well you say you're from the city  
California is your home  
Hey I'm a country girl over Oklahoma way  
Oh there are miles and miles between us  
But that don't mean a thing  
When those guitars start to play  
Oh, sweet sounds of freedom  
Ringing through the air  
Sending out a message to us all  
We don't have a curtain  
Made of iron or stone  
We are not divided by a wall  
So come on tell me  
Hey, hey, hey  
From L.A. to Broadway  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Hey, hey, hey  
Whoa, everybody's singin'  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
When you're feelin' low  
Hit that radio  
Let the music lift you  
Let the music lift you  
Up, way up, way up  
There are books that tell us  
What makes this whole world turn  
And how Heaven holds the star wars  
But there's no explanation  
Lord it's still a mystery  
How a song can touch your heart  
So come on, tell me  
Hey, hey, hey  
From L.A. to Broadway  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Hey, hey, hey  
Whoa, everybody's singin'  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Let the music lift you  
Let the music lift you  
Up, way up, way up
