One, two, three, four  
  
I seem to recognize your face  
Haunting, familiar yet, I can't seem to place it  
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name  
Lifetimes are catching up with me  
  
All these changes taking place  
I wish I'd seen the place  
But no one's ever taken me  
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away  
Oh, hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away  
  
I swear I recognize your breath  
Oh, memories like fingerprints, they're slowly raising  
Me, you, wouldn't recall for I'm not my former  
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf  
  
I changed by not changing at all  
Small town predicts my fate  
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see  
  
Well, I just wanna scream, "Hello"  
Oh, my God it's been too long  
Never dreamed You'd return  
But now here You are and here I am  
Hearts and thoughts they fade away  
  
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away  
Oh, hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away  
Hearts and thoughts they fade away  
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away, fade away
