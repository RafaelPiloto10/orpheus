All that is, was and will be  
Universe much too big to see  
Time and space never ending  
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending  
Limitations of human understanding  
Too quick to criticize  
Obligation to survive  
We hunger to be alive  
  
All that is, ever  
Ever was  
Will be ever  
Twisting  
Turning  
Through the never  
  
In the dark, see past our eyes  
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies  
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens  
On a quest, meaning, reason  
Came to be, how it begun  
All alone in the family of the sun  
Curiosity teasing everyone  
On our home, third stone from the sun  
  
All that is, ever  
Ever was  
Will be ever  
Twisting  
Turning  
Through the never  
On through the never  
  
We must go  
On through the never  
Out of the  
Edge of forever  
We must go  
On through the never  
Then ever comes  
  
All that is, ever  
Ever was  
Will be ever  
Who we are  
Ask forever  
Twisting  
Turning  
Through the never  
Never
