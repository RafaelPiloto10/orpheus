Do what you do cause you do it so well  
So stand in my way  
If only I knew what these eyes could not tell  
What this mouth could not say  
People are wrong but I'm right this time  
I'm losing bad friends fast  
Do what you do and keep it that way  
And this love will last  
  
Do what you do when your lights are turned down  
And you wake up afraid  
Think of the love that I have here for you  
And the wish will be made  
Only a cut of the deepest kind  
Could break what I hold for you  
I know the cut will never be mine  
So do what you do  
  
Waiting to put a foot in the door  
Hoping to learn what you're never sure  
Don't look too far it's here where you are  
  
Only a cut of the deepest kind  
Could break what I hold for you  
I know the cut will never be mine  
So do what you do
