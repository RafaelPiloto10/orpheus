In the jungle of these times  
Honest love's so hard to find  
In the world of video  
Computers tell you what to do  
The world's devoted to the Dollar sign  
  
Remote-controlled and on the line  
Plug in man on the rack  
Waiting for a heart attack  
And no chance to die  
  
No more space for love  
The world gets really tough  
Can't you see the end  
Twentieth Century Man?  
  
In the jungle of these times  
There's nothing left for them to buy  
They look for God on the screen  
They've got even dream-machines  
They are mesmerized  
  
No more space for love  
The world gets really tough  
Can't you see the end  
Twentieth Century Man?  
  
No more space for love  
The world gets really tough  
Can't you see the end  
Twentieth Century Man?
