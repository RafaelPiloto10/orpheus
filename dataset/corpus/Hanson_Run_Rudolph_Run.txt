Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind  
Run run Rudolph, Randalph's not too far behind  
Run run Rudolph Santa Clause is coming to town  
Santa he can hurry he can take the freeway down  
  
Run run Rudolph he's a whizzing like a merry go round  
Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"  
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"  
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star  
  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town  
Santa he can hurry, he can take the freeway down  
Run run Rudolph, he's a whizzing like a merry-go-round  
"I'm gonna kick it one time for ya, come on"  
  
"Tay, kick one for Christmas, baby"  
(Tay does a keyboard solo)  
Said Santa to a girl child "What would please you most to get?"  
Run Run Rudolph, you got to run, Rudolph  
  
"A little baby doll that can cry, scream, drink, and wet"  
Run Run Rudolph, you got to run Rudolph  
Then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet  
  
Run run Rudolph, you got to run Rudolph  
Run, run Rudolph [Repeat: x5]  
  
Santa clause is coming to town  
Run, run, run, run, run, run  
Run, run Rudolph, Santa Clause is coming to town  
Santa he can hurry, he can take the freeway down  
  
Run run Rudolph, he's a whizzing like a merry-go-round  
  
Run run Rudolph [Repeat: x12]  
  
Santa clause is coming to town
