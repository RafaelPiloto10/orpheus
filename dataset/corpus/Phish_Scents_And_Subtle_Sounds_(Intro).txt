If you would only start to live  
One moment at a time  
You would, I think, be startled  
By the things that you would find  
  
Like scents you never noticed  
And many subtle sounds  
Like colors in the landscape  
And textures of the town  
  
Then the winds would lift you up  
Into the sky above  
And you'd be treated to a view  
Of everything you love  
And if the moment passes  
You should try it once again  
For if you do it right  
You'll find the moment never ends
