It's easy sometimes when you just coast along  
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong  
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down  
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around  
  
Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea  
Perhaps you'll laugh and make them all smile  
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be  
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for awhile  
  
Birds of a feather are flocking outside  
Like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance  
Of pulses and ringing and campfire chants  
Of ritual drumming although at first glance  
You thought you could run but you won't take a chance  
  
It's not an experience if they can't bring someone along  
They hang on emotions they bottle inside  
They peck at the ground  
And strut out of stride
