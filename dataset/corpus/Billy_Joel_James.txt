James, we were always friends  
From our childhood days  
And we made our plans  
And we had to go our separate ways.  
I went on the road  
You pursued an education.  
  
James, do you like your life?  
Can you find release?  
Will you ever change?  
Will you ever write your masterpiece?  
Are you still in school  
Living up to expectations? James  
  
You were so relied upon  
Everybody knows how hard you tried.  
Hey, look at what a job you've done  
Carrying the weight of family pride.  
  
James, you've been well behaved,  
You've been working hard  
But will you always stay  
Someone else's dream of who you are?  
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.  
  
I went on the road,  
You pursued an education, James  
  
How you gonna know for sure?  
Everything was so well organized.  
Hey, now everything is so secure  
And everybody else is satisfied.  
  
James, do you like your life?  
Can you find release?  
Will you ever change?  
When will you write your masterpiece?  
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.
