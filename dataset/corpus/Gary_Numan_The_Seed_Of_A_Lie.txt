I'm a ghost in the dark and I'm yours.  
I belong in the past and I'm yours.  
Like a song you forget, and I'm yours.  
Like a dream in the night, and I'm yours.  
  
The wrong place?  
The wrong time?  
I don't know.  
The wrong face?  
Yours or mine?  
I don't know.  
  
Like a tear when you sleep, I'll be yours.  
Like a scar that won't fade, I'll be yours.  
Like a pain in the cold, I'll be yours.  
Like a fear in the heart, I'll be yours.  
  
The wrong word when you cry  
I will be  
Like the seed of a lie  
I will be  
Like the germ of disease  
I will be  
Like the last one who cared  
I will be  
  
Like your shadow  
I will haunt you  
Do you remember?  
I said to you  
'Love is a mountain  
But harder to climb.  
It should be forever  
But love is unkind  
To me.  
Don't let me down.'  
  
And you let me down
