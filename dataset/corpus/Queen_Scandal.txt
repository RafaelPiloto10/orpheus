Eeh dah eeh dah  
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh  
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know  
Hey scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show  
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break  
They'll hear me pleading, we'll say for God's sakes  
Over and over and over again  
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds  
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools  
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates (oooh oooh)  
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates  
(Oooh oooh)  
Over and over and over again  
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair  
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care  
It's only a life to be twisted and broken  
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah  
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sakes  
Over and over and over and over again - yeah  
  
Scandal, scandal  
Scandal, scandal  
  
Yes you're breaking my heart again  
Scandal - yes it'll all and all happen again  
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times  
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies  
And in the end the story deeper must hide (oooh)  
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside  
Scandal, scandal  
Scandal, scandal
