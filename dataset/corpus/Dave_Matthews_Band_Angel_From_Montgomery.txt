I am an old woman, named after my mother  
My old man is another, child that's grown old  
If dreams were thunder, lightning were desire  
This old house would have burnt down, a long time ago  
  
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster from an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to  
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl, well I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at, just a free rambling man  
But that was a long time, and no matter how I try  
The years just flow by, like a broken down dam  
  
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em there buzzing  
And I ain't done nothing, since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person, go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening, and have nothing to say
