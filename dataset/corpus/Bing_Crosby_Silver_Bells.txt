Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, (ring-a-ling) hear them ring (ting-a-ling)  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
Silver bells, (silver bells) silver bells (silver bells)  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, (ring-a-ling)  
Hear them ring, (hear them ring)  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights, even stoplights  
Blinkin' bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big day  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells,  
The corner Santa Claus is busy  
Silver bells  
Is busy now because  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, it fills the winter air  
Hear them ring, you hear it everywhere  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks (Silver bells)  
Dressed in holiday style (Silver bells)  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas (It's Christmas time in the city)  
Children laughing, people passing (Ring-a-ling)  
Meeting smile after smile (Hear them ring)  
Soon it will be Christmas day
