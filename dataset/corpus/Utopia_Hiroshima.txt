Under the rising sun dirty yellow children play  
And in the red pagoda mamasan is praying  
Blood wasted saving face, ancestors are looking on  
As they wave their silver samurai underneath the big gun  
Hiroshima, no one could imagine  
Not the victors nor the victims  
Pitiful survivors nor the pawn of a man  
Who had the button under his hand  
No one would believe it  
God, god is on our side, he placed the power in our hands  
To teach the yellow peril, this is christian mercy  
Harry, harry give 'em hell, give 'em hell one more time again  
We'll show those axis powers how to make an oven [fry them]  
Hiroshima, nagasaki  
Don't you ever forget, don't you ever fuckin' forget  
  
This is the official voice of the united states of america addressing the  
Peoples of the islands of japan. tomorrow morning, on august 15th, 1945 at  
Exactly 8:15 am, we will bomb your cities of nagasaki and hiroshima with a  
Blast that will level these cities. this is the only alert you will receive.
