Long afloat on shipless oceans  
I did all my best to smile  
'Til your singing eyes and fingers  
Drew me loving to your isle  
  
And you sang, "Sail to me, sail to me, let me enfold you"  
Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you  
  
Did I dream you dreamed about me?  
Were you hare when I was fox?  
Now my foolish boat is leaning  
Broken lovelorn on your rocks  
  
For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow"  
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow  
  
I'm as puzzled as The Oyster (alt. 'as a newborn child')  
I'm as troubled as the tide  
Should I stand amid the breakers?  
Or should I lie with death my bride?  
Hear me sing, "Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you"  
Oh my heart, oh my heart is waiting to hold you
