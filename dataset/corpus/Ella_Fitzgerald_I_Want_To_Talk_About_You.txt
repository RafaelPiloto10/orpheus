Don't tell me about a night in June  
Or a shady lane beneath the velvet moon  
Don't tell me, 'cause I want to talk about you.  
  
Don't mention that waterfall  
Or that shady nook where crickets softly call  
Don't tell me, 'cause I want to talk about you.  
  
The moon and the stars, the objects on Mars  
Are things that we've talked of before  
But your love for me was the question  
Your answer throws back heaven's door, so  
  
Tell me, your love will be sincere,  
Then my darling, you needn't ever fear  
I love you and I want to talk about you.

Then my darling, you needn't ever fear  
I love you and I want to talk about you.
