BURNING OF THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
  
THE MORNING IS DEAD  
AND THE DAY IS TOO  
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT HERE TO GREET ME  
BUT THE VELVET MOON  
ALL MY LONELINESS  
I HAVE FELT TODAY  
IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN ENOUGH  
TO MAKE A MAN THROW HIMSELF AWAY  
AND I CONTINUE  
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
ALONE  
  
NOW THE SMILING PORTRAIT OF YOU  
IS STLL HANGIN' ON MY FROWNING WALL  
IT REALLY DOESN'T REALLY DOESN'T BOTHER ME, TOO MUCH AT ALL  
IT'S JUST THE, UH, EVER FALLING DUST  
THAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR ME TO SEE  
THAT FORGOTTEN EAR-RING LAYING ON THE FLOOR  
FACING COLDLY TOWARD THE DOOR  
AND I CONTINUE  
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
ALL ALONE  
  
BURN  
LONELY LONELY, YEAH  
LONELY LONELY LONELY  
LONELINESS IS SUCH A, DRAG  
  
SO HERE I SIT TO FACE  
THAT SAME OLD FIRE PLACE  
GETTIN' READY FOR THE SAME OLD EXPLOSION  
GOIN' THROUGH MY MIND  
AND SOON ENOUGH TIME WILL TELL  
ABOUT THE CIRCUS AND THE WISHINGWELL  
AND SOMEONE WHO WILL BUY AND SELL FOR ME  
SOMEONE WHO WILL TOLL MY BELL  
AND I CONTINUE TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
ALONE  
  
DARLIN' DO YOU HEAR ME CALLIN' YOU  
SO LONELY  
LONELY!
