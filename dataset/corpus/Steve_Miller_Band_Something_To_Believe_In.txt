Ooooooooo  
Ooooooooo  
You give me something to come home to, baby  
You give me something to believe in  
I know in my heart  
You have loved me from the start  
  
Whoa, baby  
I know that it's real  
I can tell by the way that I feel  
  
Oh  
You give me something to believe in  
Yes, and you give me something to go on living for  
And I know in my heart  
You have loved me  
From the start  
  
Whoa, baby  
I know that it's real  
I can tell by the way that I feel  
  
Lie down, my love, lie down  
I will sing you a lullaby  
Lie down, my love, lie down  
Rest easy and close your eyes  
Like clear water in a mountain stream  
I will come to you in your dreams  
Like pictures reflected in a mountain lake  
I will be with you when you wake  
  
You give me something to hold on to  
You give me something to believe in  
And I know in my heart  
You have loved me  
From the start  
  
Whoa, baby  
I know that it's real  
I can tell by the way that I feel  
Oh, oh  
  
Lie down, my love, lie down  
I will sing you a lullaby  
Lie down, my love, lie down  
Rest easy and close your eyes  
Like clear water in a mountain stream  
I will comfort you in your dreams  
Like pictures reflected in a mountain lake  
I will be with you when you wake
