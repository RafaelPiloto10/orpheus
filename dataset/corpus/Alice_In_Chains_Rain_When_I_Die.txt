Is she ready to know my frustration?  
What she slippin' inside, slow castration  
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me  
Did she come here to try, try to take me  
Did she call my name?  
I think it's gonna rain  
When I die  
Was it something I said, held against me?  
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing  
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing  
I can help her but won't, now she hates me  
She won't let me hide  
She don't want me to cry  
Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me  
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me  
Could she love me again, or will she hate me  
Prob'ly not, I know why, can't explain me  
Did she call my name?  
I think it's gonna rain  
When I die
