Who's gonna tell you when  
It's too late  
Who's gonna tell you things  
Aren't so great  
You can't go on  
Thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna pick you up  
When you fall  
Who's gonna hang it up  
When you call  
Who's gonna pay attention  
To your dreams  
Who's gonna plug their ears  
When you scream  
  
You can't go on  
Thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna hold you down  
When you shake  
Who's gonna come around  
When you break
