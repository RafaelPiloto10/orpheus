You've got the look, they'll never forget  
You want to be noticed, but they haven't noticed yet  
  
When the time is right, a star on your door  
Taking you places that you've never been before  
Where did you go?  
  
[Chorus]  
Go to sleep tonight and dream about it till the morning  
Make a scene tonight, read about it in the morning  
Appearing for the very first time, on the screen tonight  
And when you want to, they treat you like a Prima Donna  
  
You're a movie queen, familiar face  
Prettiest woman in the whole of the human race  
  
You're gonna be famous, you want to go far  
Name up in lights, everybody knows who you are  
On with the show  
  
How will it feel being number one  
Hard to imagine but I can't blame you for tryin'  
How will it feel havin' so much fun  
Hard to imagine but it's so electrifying  
  
[Chorus]
