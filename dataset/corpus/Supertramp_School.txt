I can see you in the morning when you go to school  
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule,  
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work  
And be like Johnnie-too-good, well don't you know he never shirks  
He's coming along..  
  
After school is over you're playing in the park  
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark  
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about  
And grow up just like them, won't you let it work it out  
And you're full of doubt  
  
Don't do this and don't do that  
What are they trying to do?  
Make a good boy of you  
Do they know where it's at?  
Don't criticize, they're old and wise  
Do as they tell you to  
Don't want the devil to  
Come out and put your eyes  
  
Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight  
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right  
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say  
It's always up to you if you want to be that  
Want to see that  
Want to see that way  
You're coming along
