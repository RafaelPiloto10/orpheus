I can kill standing still  
It's easy  
I can scare with a stare  
It's easy  
  
Hey Ringo  
It's sad though  
Because it's hard to walk tall  
When you're small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When you're small  
You walk as if you're falling  
  
I attack from the back  
Because it's easy  
And I can assail  
While wearing very nice jewelry  
  
Oh hey Ringo  
It's sad though  
Because it's hard to walk tall  
When you're small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When you're small  
You spend your life crawling  
  
I burst into  
Public baths  
And I throw my weight around  
And no one can even see me  
No one can even see me  
Nobody can see me  
No one can see me  
  
Success is just a mess  
Hey Ringo  
It's sad though  
Because it's hard to walk tall  
When you're small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When you're small  
You're bound to look ???
