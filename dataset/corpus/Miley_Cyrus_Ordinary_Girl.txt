Ohh Oh Ho Yeah  
La Da Da  
Don't get me wrong I love who I am  
I don't wanna be ungrateful  
It probably sounds strange  
I really love the role I play the songs I sing  
But with all the fame  
The things that seem so simple  
Suddenly so far out of reach  
Wish that they could see that underneath  
  
I'm just an ordinary Girl  
Sometimes I'm Lazy, I get bored.  
I get scared, I feel ignored  
I feel happy, I get silly  
I choke on my own words  
I make wishes, I have dreams  
And I still want to believe  
Anything can happen in this world  
For an Ordinary Girl  
Like you, like me  
For an Ordinary Girl  
Like you like me  
  
How are you?  
Hello, goodbye  
One day here, one day there  
And again it's time to go  
Miss popular always on the road  
Put my best foot forward  
Gotta get on with the show  
Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine  
Everywhere I arrive I get high fives  
They pay me larger than life  
  
I'm just an ordinary Girl  
Sometimes I'm Lazy, I get bored.  
I get scared, I feel ignored  
I feel happy, I get silly.  
I choke on my own words  
I make wishes, I have dreams  
And I still want to believe  
Anything can happen in this world  
For an Ordinary Girl  
So give it everything or nothing at all  
And get back on your feet  
When you stumble and fall  
A lil luck can go a long way  
So don't you worry about what people say  
Who knows where the wind may blow  
  
For an ordinary girl... mmm  
  
I'm just an ordinary Girl  
Sometimes I'm Lazy, I get bored.  
I get scared, I feel ignored  
I feel happy, I get silly.  
I choke on my own words  
I make wishes, I have dreams  
And I still want to believe  
Anything can happen in this world  
For an Ordinary Girl  
Like you, like me  
For an Ordinary Girl  
Like you like me  
  
For an ordinary girl... mmm  
  
For an ordinary girl  
  
Like me like you...
