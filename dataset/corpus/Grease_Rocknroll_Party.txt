Little girl, do you know what I mean? Pretty soon, she'll be 17  
They tell me her name's Mary-Jean, rock 'n roll party queen  
  
Friday night 'n she's got a date, goin' places just for stayin' out late  
Droppin' dimes in the record machine, rock 'n roll party queen  
  
Pa pa pa pa, oh no, can I have a ball tonight?  
Baby baby, can I be the one, to love you with all of my might?  
  
She's the girl that all the kids love, they talk about her, wherever shegoes  
I could write a fan magazine about my rock 'n roll party queen  
  
La la la... Rock 'n roll party queen  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, rock 'n roll party queen  
  
Pa pa pa pa, you should see her shake  
Baby baby, don't you call it puppy luck, don't you want a true romance?  
  
Rockin' and rollin', little party queen  
We're gonna do the strawl, hey party queen  
You know I love you so, my party queen  
You're my rockin' and my rollin' party queen
