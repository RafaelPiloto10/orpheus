(e) I was strollin' one day, in a lonely graveyard,  
When a voice from the tomb, seemed to (b7) say,  
I once (e) lived as you live, walked and talked as you talk,  
But from earth I was (b7) soon called a- (e) way.  
Chorus  
(e) oh, those tombs, ("oh those tombs"),  
Lonely tombs, ("lonely tombs "),  
Seemed to say in a low gentle (b7) tone,  
Oh how (e) sweet, ("oh how sweet"),  
Is the rest, ("is the rest"),  
In our beautiful, (b7) heavenly (e) home.  
Every voice from the tomb, seemed to whisper and say,  
Livin' man you must soon follow me,  
And I thought as I gazed, on that cold marble slab,  
What a sad lonesome place that must be.  
Repeat chorus  
I then came to the place, where my mother did lay,  
And her voice, soft and low, from the tomb,  
It said, son I'm at rest, with the savior above,  
I am safe in my heavenly home.  
Repeat chorus
