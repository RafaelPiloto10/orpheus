Yeah, hello  
Get lifted  
Yeah, I get lifted  
Yeah, yeah, so get lifted yup! Haha  
  
I am sittin' on the clouds, I got smoke comin' from my seat  
I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet  
Playin' touch football, on marijuana street  
Or, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleets  
Get high, so high, that I feel like lying  
Down in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me 'cause  
(I feel like dying)

Swimming laps around a bottle of Louis the Thirteenth  
Jumpin' off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine  
I'm at the top of the top, but still I climb  
And if I should ever fall, the ground would then turn to wine  
Pop, pop, I feel like flying, then I feel like frying, then  
(I feel like dying)  
  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like)  
  
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars  
I am a prisoner, locked up behind Xanax bars  
I have just boarded a plane, without a pilot  
And violets are blue, roses are red  
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead  
Wish I can give you this feeling I feel like buying  
And if my dealer don't have no more, then  
(I feel like dying)  
  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying I feel like dying
