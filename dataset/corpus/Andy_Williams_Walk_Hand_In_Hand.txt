Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity  
Have faith, believe in me, give me your hand  
Love is a symphony of perfect harmony  
When lovers such as we walk hand in hand  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look toward the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look up to the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me
