I met her in a shooting gallery, speeding like a goose  
Back when both of us were used to making strangers  
She shook me down for all I had and every way but loose  
But I was still too juiced to feel the danger  
And anyway now, anymore you don't know which is worse  
Falling out of love or left behind  
I just seen the sweetest dreaming wind up like a curse  
Maybe one too many times.  
  
Chorus:  
But she said, "I don't want you baby, I just want someone to hold me  
I got too much rock and roll to be a wife  
I can't live without the lightning and I'm scared of growing older  
So I'm bound to keep on running for my life"  
  
I've seen her roll herself into a tight and tiny ball  
Like a belly-gunner crouching in a turret  
I said, I recognize the symptoms, girl, I got the same disease  
I just haven't got a clue to how to cure it  
And any way, now, any more, you don't know who to trust  
'Cause love is wild as lust and just as blind  
Anyone who's ever gonna love me - better fool me first  
And baby, maybe, I been one too many times.  
  
Chorus:  
But she said, "I don't want you baby, I just want someone to hold me  
I got too much rock and roll to be a wife  
I can't live without the lightning and I'm scared of growing older  
So I'm bound to keep on running for my life"
