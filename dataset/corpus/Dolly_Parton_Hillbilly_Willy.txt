Now Little Will was from the hills way back in the sticks  
He got his reputation from turning on them country chicks  
He drove a souped up hot rod car buddy he could really  
Knock those little girls off their feet yeah  
Hillbilly Willy  
He'd talk that ole sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl  
Willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall  
But when he talked that ole sweet talk he drove those little girls silly  
They stood in line waiting for their time to court  
Hillbilly Willy  
  
Then this country cyclops who measured six foot nine  
Came up to Little Will and said, "You stole that little girl of mine"  
Then there was a awful brawl boy it was a dilly  
When the fighting stopped there on top stood  
Hillbilly Willy  
  
Now the moral of the story is to be a lover you gotta be tough  
Even if you're just five feet tall you gotta be able to strut your stuff  
Now to all you lovers in radioland, if your love life's a little chilly  
Bear in mind the rough, tough kind like  
Hillbilly Willy  
  
Just bear in mind the rough, tough kind like  
Hillbilly Willy
