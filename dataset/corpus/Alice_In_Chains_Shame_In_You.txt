When I waken, and I'm achin', time for sleepin, yeah  
When I'm sayin time to go and, I've been hurtin, yeah  
When I'm layin, I'm still tryin, concentrating on dyin', yeah  
You're right as rain, but you're all to blame  
Agreed my crime's the same  
My sins I'll claim, give you back shed pain  
Go find a place for own shame  
So you can deal with this thing unreal  
No one made you feel any hurt, yeah  
Body's movin, only provin, no one needs to move  
Still believin, yet mistaken, all God's children, yeah  
And I must say, I was stupid, selfishly she consumed, yeah  
And you must change patterns all we trained  
Or n'er regain peace you seek  
Now you hear me, for the things I see  
Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah  
Throw out, blow up, hold in  
Show fine, no signs, grow blind
