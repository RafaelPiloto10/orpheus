A gardener's daughter stopped me on my way, on the day I was to wed  
It is you who I wish to share my body with she said  
We'll find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed  
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head.  
Her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun  
Her hands were like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds on.  
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood  
And we walked 'till we came to where the holy magnolia stood.  
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love  
  
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above.  
The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait I was sad but I had to go,  
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio.  
  
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around  
There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound  
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met  
'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget.  
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before  
As if was a year before  
  
Until the gift that someone left, a basket by my door.  
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed,  
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  
  
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe  
They'd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before.  
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread  
I'll tell you everything I've learned, and Love is all, he said.
