Darling you send me  
I know you, you send me  
Darling you, you send me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
Honest you do, honest you do  
Darling you, you thrill me  
I know you, you thrill me  
I know you thrill me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
Honest you do  
At first, I thought it was infatuation  
But ooh, well it lasted  
So very, so very, so very long  
Now I find myself wanting you  
And marry you and take you home, waoh waoh  
You, darling you send me  
I know you, you send me  
Darling you, honey you send me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
My my  
At first, I thought it was infatuation  
But ooh, well it lasted  
So very, so very, so very long  
But now I find myself wanting you  
And marry you, and take you home  
I know, I know, I know  
You, you, you, you send me  
And darling, darling you, you  
Darling, you send me  
I know you, you, you send me  
Honest you do, honest you do
