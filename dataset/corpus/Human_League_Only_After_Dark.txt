I feel my spirit fly  
Only after dark - ahh  
I kiss the world goodbye  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
Fight with the city lights  
Only after dark - ahh  
Run, I'd like to run away  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
Won't you disappear into midnight with me  
Why don't you come, why don't you come, why don't you fly, fly, fly with  
Sweet elusive fate ,will be our company  
  
Bring out the vamp in me  
Only after dark - ahh  
Moon, sinful as can be  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
It's wrong to feel so free (!)  
Only after dark - ahh  
Only you know it can be  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
Won't you disappear into midnight with me  
Why don't you come, why don't you come, why don't you fly, fly, fly with  
Sweet elusive in fade , will be our company
