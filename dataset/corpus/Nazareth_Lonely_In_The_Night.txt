I'm runnin' tired of this deception  
I have no wish to play this game  
Too many times a bad connection  
And you're still holding me away  
We're living under false pretenses  
Foolin' ourselves, believe the lies  
I could not take one more rejection  
You wanted more but would not try  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
We're trapped within our own defenses  
The walls we made all look the same  
There is no love without affection  
We've come to far to break the chain  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
I'm growing tired of this deception  
We fall apart and wonder why?  
Our hearts now pull in new directions  
We don't know how to say goodbye  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night
