Been so many words, so much to say  
Words are not enough to keep the guns at bay  
Some live in fear, some do not  
Some gamble everything on who gets the final shot  
  
Oh, don't talk to me of love  
It's obvious it's not enough  
Annihilation kill 'em all  
Capitulation watch the mighty fall  
The road to glory is lined in red  
And though the reason now is gone  
The battle rages on  
  
Was it love or hate that got here first?  
Hate's a habit, it's hard to shake the curse  
Kill to live, and live to die  
Human nature you let the strong survive  
  
Oh don't talk to me of love  
Be serious, it's not enough  
Annihilation kill 'em all  
Capitulation watch the mighty fall  
The road to glory is lined in red  
And though the reason now is gone  
The battle rages on
