It ain't so much a question of not knowin' what to do  
I knowed what's right an' wrong since I've been ten  
I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true  
About how girls are put upon by men  
I know I musn't fall into the pit  
But when I'm with a feller  
I ferget!  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
I'm in a terrible fix  
I always say 'come on, let's go'  
Just when I oughta say 'nix'  
  
When a person tries to kiss a girl  
I know she oughta give his face a smack!  
But as soon as someone kisses me  
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!  
  
I'm just a fool when lights are low  
I cain't be prissy an' quaint  
I ain't the type that can faint  
How can I be what I ain't  
I cain't say no  
  
Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty  
And starts to talk purty  
Whatcha gonna do?  
Supposin that he says  
Your lips are like cherries  
Or roses or berries  
Whatcha gonna do?  
  
Supposin that he says  
That yer sweeter than cream  
And he's gotta have cream or die  
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?  
Spit in his eye?  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
Cain't seem to say it at all  
I hate to disserpoint a beau  
When he is payin' a call!  
  
Fer a while I act refined and cool  
A settin on the velveteen setee  
Then I think of that ol' golden rule  
And do fer him what he would do fer me  
  
I cain't resist a Romeo  
In a sombero and chaps  
Soon as I sit on their laps  
Somethin' inside of me snaps  
I cain't say no!  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
Kissin's my favorite food  
With or without the mistletoe  
I'm in a holiday mood!  
  
Other girls are coy and hard to catch  
But other girls ain't havin' any fun  
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match  
I have a funny feeling that I won  
  
Though I can feel the undertoe  
I never make a complaint  
'Till it's too late for restraint  
Then when I want to I cain't  
I cain't say no!
