Back track, listen, stop that  
Before everything is lost again  
You lied, oh why  
Stand back, give is slack  
You don't know where my head is at  
You're in too deep, don't try  
  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't need, I don't need what you up to  
Better step down, better turn around, no  
Better row out, here's a bow now move  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to no  
  
You grab never give back  
And think I don't think through that  
I do, I'm onto you  
Too far, pushin' your luck  
Get out, it's the end of the line  
For you and now you're mine  
  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't need, I don't need what you up to  
Better step down, better turn around, go  
Better row out, here's a bow now move  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to no  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
  
Stand back, give it slack  
You don't know where my head is at  
I do, I'm onto you  
  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't need, I don't need what you up to  
Better step down, better turn around, go  
Better row out, here's a bow now move  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to
