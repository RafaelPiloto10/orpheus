I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well  
And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
Sometimes I wonder  
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover  
To me listening to Stevie Wonder  
Under the covers where we used to lay  
And re-stacks is what the speakers play  
I'll be on tour almost every day  
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
Just watching the dvd, smoking illegal weed  
Getting high as two kites, and we needed to breathe  
We used each other's air just for the people to see  
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us  
And also you are beautiful without your make-up  
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  
We can all be loved the way God made us  
And time's the only reason that we could break up  
Cause you would always tell me away too much  
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  
Or make a mistake, say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
And every weekend in the winter  
You'd be wearing my hoodie  
With draw strings pulled tight  
To keep your face in the cold  
Taking day trips to the local  
Where we eat on the road  
Cause every day when I was away  
We'd only speak on the phone  
Watching Blue Planet  
Creating new habits  
And if we were two rabbits  
And then you vanish  
Back to 'burgh with all the Celtics, i'd dissapear  
You call me selfish, I understand  
But I can't help it  
I put my job before everything  
Except my family and friends  
But you'll be in between forever  
So I guess we'll have to take a step back  
Overlook the situation  
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break  
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  
So we can either deal with the pain  
Or wait to get on a plane  
But in the day we'll have to say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Love will come and love will go  
But you can make it on your own  
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now  
People grow, and fall apart  
But you can mend your broken heart  
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
Then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now
