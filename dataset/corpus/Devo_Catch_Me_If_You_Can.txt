I gotta run away from dr surd.  
He's always on my tail.  
He's comin' so I better run  
'cause he would know I never fail.  
  
(chorus)  
Oh my hell.  
It's dr surd.  
He thinks he is a big man.  
Let me tell you something, surd.  
Just catch me if you can.  
  
Surd won't leave me all by myself.  
He gives me such a fright.  
If I was followin' that surd,  
I'd do it like he did the other night.  
  
(chorus)  
Oh my hell.  
It's dr surd.  
He thinks he is a big man.  
Let me tell you something, surd.  
Just catch me if you can.  
  
We didn't meet until half past four.  
I couldn't stand it anymore.  
I did get it.  
I did understand.  
Who was the bitch  
Holding his assistant's hand?  
I gotta run away from dr surd.  
(dr surd.)  
He's always on my tail.  
He's comin' so I better run  
(better run.)  
'cause he would know I never fail.  
  
(chorus)  
Oh my hell.  
It's dr surd.  
He thinks he is a big man.  
Let me tell you something, surd.  
Just catch me if you can.
