[Nick:]  
Ooh  
How many times am I gonna let you walk right past  
I swear sometimes I think I'm moving too fast  
You never know if it's gonna last  
I guess that's what scares me sometimes  
  
[Brian:]  
Ooh  
I know it ain't right but I don't wanna let me care  
I wanna know love but I'm a little scared  
You never know what you're gonna get  
And that is what scares me sometimes, times  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
[Aj:]  
Yeah  
I don't hurt people that don't hurt me back, yeah  
I turned to war and I'm so tired of that (Mhmm)  
I'm ready to walk my guides down  
I'm done playing tough guy for now, for now  
  
[Aj:]  
Everybody deserves taking chances  
And that only flies in certain circumstances  
Can't keep running away from these feelings  
Everybody needs someone sometimes  
Sometime  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
[Howie:]  
And before this moment fades away  
I wanted you to know I made mistakes  
But even if there's no more words to say  
I tried to be better without you  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
Oh
