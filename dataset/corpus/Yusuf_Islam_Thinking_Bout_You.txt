When I hold your hand,  
I could fly a zillion miles with you.  
When I see your grace,  
I can see you're God's words come true.  
Every little bird above the haze,  
And fish beneath the waves,  
Knows about you  
Wouldn't they do.  
  
When I see your eyes,  
I can see rainbows in the sky.  
Being with you,  
All who parted reunite.  
Every little pearl drop in the clouds,  
And stones beneath the ground,  
Are waiting for you  
Wouldn't they do.  
  
Whatever you say  
Lightens up the burden of the day.  
Whatever you do  
Makes us ever want to follow you.  
  
Whatever they say,  
Whatever they do,  
I'll always love you.  
  
Every burning comet that zooms,  
And angels too,  
Think about you  
Wouldn't they do.  
  
Thinkin' bout you,  
I could climb a mountain in the dark.  
Listenin' to you,  
Flowers dance in the park.  
  
Whatever they say,  
Whatever they do,  
We'll always love you.  
  
The words that you say,  
Lightens up the burdens of the day.  
Whatever you do,  
Makes us want to follow you.  
  
Whatever they say,  
Whatever they do,  
I'll always love you.
