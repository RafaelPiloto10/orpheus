Won't you listen 'cos I'm at it  
Again  
Lightning striking and on that  
You can depend  
They say that lightning never  
Strikes the same place twice  
Gods of thunder sit and watch  
The event  
You know I take no prisoners  
My back's to the wall  
You know I must be going  
When destiny calls  
Until I feel that thunder  
Shattering my brain  
I won't stop  
  
Rockin' all night rockin' all  
Night  
Until the lightning strikes  
Again  
Rockin' all night rockin' all  
Night  
Until the lightning strikes  
Again  
  
Tell your mama that you're  
Gonna be late  
But not to worry we'll just be  
Rockin' all night  
The lightning strikes before  
You hear the thunder roar  
We're becoming the children  
Of the night  
  
I'm not apologizing  
I am what I am  
There is no compromising  
I don't give a damn  
Until i feel the thunder boiling  
In my veins  
I won't stop  
  
Rockin' all night rockin' all  
Night  
Until the lightning strikes  
Again  
Rockin' all night rockin' all  
Night  
Until the lightning strikes  
Again  
  
Oh no I've lost control  
Here we got it's only rock 'n'  
Roll  
  
The silver light is flashing  
As all turns to gold  
In my head voices screaming  
And I'm being told  
If you will only listen you will  
Hear them too  
I won't stop  
  
Rockin' all night rockin' all  
Night  
Until the lightning strikes  
Again  
Rockin' all night rockin' all  
Night  
Until the lightning strikes  
Again
