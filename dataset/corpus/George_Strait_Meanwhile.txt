She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room  
We walk together to a table for two  
Every man stares but her eyes are only for me  
We take to the dance floor, she squeezes my hand  
I can't believe just how lucky I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still dancing with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
Meanwhile  
  
We move to the end of a beautiful night  
Tender the kisses, soft candle light  
She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs  
And reach for each other the passion begins  
We fall together as lovers and then,  
  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still lying with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
  
I try and I try, the Lord knows I do  
But each time my heart beats back to you  
  
Meanwhile I'll go on living my life now  
I'll find a way somehow  
Oh but, meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You'll always be with me  
But I'll never hold you again  
Meanwhile.
