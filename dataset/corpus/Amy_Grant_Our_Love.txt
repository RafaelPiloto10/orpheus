I don't know what to say to you  
Tears are on your face  
You don't know how we'll make it through  
Such a lonely place  
But if you could read my mind  
Then you'd understand  
Even in times like these  
I'm wanting nothing other than  
Chorus:  
Our love  
You and me together  
Our love  
I'll stay with you  
Our love  
Our love our love is true  
Oh won't you take me in your arms  
That's where I belong  
Together we are safe from harm  
Together we are strong  
I will hold your heart in mine  
And guard it through the night  
Let the stillness of this moment  
Speak to us of all that's right with  
(repeat chorus)  
Our love  
You and me forever  
Our love  
I'm made for you  
Our love  
Our love our love is true  
Close your teary eyes and sleep  
I'll watch through the night and keep  
(repeat chorus)  
Our love  
Our love
