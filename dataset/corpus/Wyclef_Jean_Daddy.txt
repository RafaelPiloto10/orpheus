"Daddy"  
  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
I'm sure y'all heard about my dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
This one goes out for everybody that lost somebody  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Be strong  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Now I understand what Scarface meant  
When he said I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die  
Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine  
I would be the one carrying a coffin  
Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom  
I'm the first born so I gotta play strong  
Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed  
It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph  
I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all  
Temperature forty below  
You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold  
But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa  
I can't front  
I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense  
So I could see dead people  
I'm so hurt, dad  
I can't cry no more  
But I know that you're knockin on heaven's door  
Peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
All my people live on  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Rest in peace, dad  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
  
Look into my eyes  
Realize I'm the same man my father was  
y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac  
The way I clean my ride  
Old grim tilted to the side  
But what I loved most was when the God philosophize  
About the philosophies of life in its reality  
Keep the right mentality  
Don't fall into vanity  
Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me  
Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here  
I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you  
And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you  
And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I fear no evil  
For the Lord is wit me  
But don't forget that your mom's in your hands  
You two were so close  
That I finally understand  
And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters  
I'ma miss em  
No matter what I'mma be wit em  
Peace  
  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To my dad, rest in peace  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
I guess I'll see you at the resurrection  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
To all my people that lost somebody  
Da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Put the lighters in the air  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, daddy  
Oh, daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
I need you, daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Oh, oh  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy  
Daddy  
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
