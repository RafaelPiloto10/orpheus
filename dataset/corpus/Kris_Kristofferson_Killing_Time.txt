See that long line of people who keep standing in the rain  
Lookin' tired, gettin' cold  
And that signal light they're waiting for, don't ever seem to chang  
Killing time, ain't it slow.  
Watch them bending with the burden of the pennies that they save  
Marking time, growin' old  
Slowly marching by the numbers to the freedom of the grave  
Killing time, ain't it slow  
That's the closest thing to living that they're ever gonna know  
And their good times ain't no better than their bad  
'Cause they think they need a signal light to tell them they can go  
Killing time, ain't it sad.  
Don't feel sorry for those people who keep standing in the rain  
They don't mind, they don't know  
'Cause it never crossed their minds they got a reason to complain  
Killing time, ain't it slow.  
They're not haunted by the visions that they never dared to see  
And they'll never miss the dreams they've never had  
They're condemned to go on living in a penitentiary  
For killing time, ain't it sad.
