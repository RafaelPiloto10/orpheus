Prentending to act so serene  
On your so called submissive knees  
A shopping list of begging pleas  
Adds to your complacencies  
As soon as the sun don't shine your way  
And you're saving it all up that rainy day  
It's a matter of time before you get down 'n' pray  
Fair weather faith - protect me from the storm  
Fair weather faith - gonna right all my wrongs  
Fair weather faith - you know I'm doing alright  
Fair weather faith - out of mind, out of sight  
Well I wonder if the man upstairs  
Will bother to lend an ear  
If you took the time to share  
Another one of your puppet prayers  
I ain't talkin' 'bout the weather
