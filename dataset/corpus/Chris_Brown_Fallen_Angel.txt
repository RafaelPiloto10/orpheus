[Verse 1]  
If I could, take a trip, to outer space  
She would be the one, I will see  
When I get, to heavens gate  
She would welcome me with her arms, open wide, and a smile  
Will shadow me brighter than the sun  
She hasn't had a fair chance, so I'll give her one  
Let me tell you who she is, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a fallen angel, sent from heaven up above  
She's a fallen angel, waiting for me to love her, yeah  
(Know that she's) She's a fallen angel, take your judgment off her  
I know, that she's a fallen angel  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know, I could  
Help her mend, her broken wings  
So she can fly again  
But I don't, wanna lose everything that I've gained  
Turning me a selfish man (oh)  
Cause without em my heart just don't go, no more (no more)  
I couldn't take the pain, from watching her fly away  
So say that you'll stay  
She's mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Don't you  
Baby don't you (don't you worry) worry  
I'm goin' help you (I'm goin' help you ) fly  
(I'm goin' help you fly)  
Just take me under yo (take me under) wings,  
And we can reach the (we can reach the) sky  
(we can reach the sky)  
Baby don't you (don't you worry) worry,  
I'm goin' help you (I'm goin' help you ) fly  
(I'm goin' help you fly)  
Yo mama, don't you (take me under) worry  
You goin' reach the (we can reach the) sky  
(we can reach the sky)  
She's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 4]  
Baby I know  
I know that they done hurt you  
But I'm here  
Let's take it all away  
So if you let me,  
You know what, just put your heart in my hands  
And everything they say, I take it back  
Like this  
  
[Verse 5: Reverse]  
You don't mean nothing,  
I don't want ya,  
I don't need ya,  
Never loved ya,  
You're nobody,  
And I'll never make it,  
You're a mistake (oh)
