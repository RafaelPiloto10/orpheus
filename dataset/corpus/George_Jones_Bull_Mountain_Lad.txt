Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
I've seen a lot of trouible in my time.  
  
I've seen his moma cryin' while he was a-runnin' wild  
I heard his daddy say, boy, you're no son of mine  
I watched his uncle whip him hard with a double plow line  
I've seen a lot of trouible in my time.  
  
Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
Lord, I've seen a lot of trouible in my time.  
  
Well, I seen his moma barefoot in the cold winter time  
His dad would lay out drinkin' for weeks on the wine  
I've seen the children hungry and cry at supper time  
Lord, I've seen a lot of trouble in my time.  
  
Well, I've heard moma prayin', read the bible late at night  
His dad would say it's bedtime, woman, blow out the light  
I've see her do the washin', the clothes freezin' on the line  
I've seen a lot of trouble in my time.
