One dark and stormy night  
Big John was feeling blue  
Ain't he didn't seem right  
So he didn't know just what to do  
I said do please tell me  
Ain't you satisfied?  
He looked around so pitiful  
And to me he replied  
Keeps on raining  
Look how it's raining  
Daddy he can't make no time  
Wind keeps blowing  
Howl wind's blowing  
  
Soon I'll find  
In the winter time  
When it starts to snow  
I know, Billy  
You've got to have some dough  
Keeps on raining  
Look how it's raining  
Daddy he can't make no time  
  
Ain't the rain just beautiful  
Some people say  
But I'd rather see it  
In a fine movie place  
Keeps on raining  
Look how it's raining  
Your daddy he can't make no time  
No daddy he can't make no time
