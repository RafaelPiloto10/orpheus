Half a mile outside Buloxi  
Did I come or did I go  
Seven sirens singin' to me  
Why I listen I don't know  
I got some smokes I got some coffee  
My head is ready to explode  
I'll be makin' my way further down the road  
I'm not much for conversation  
And I don't care for playin' games  
I've heard all the hard luck stories  
Man they all turn out the same  
I'm the last lonely survivor  
And I'm still carryin' their load  
I'll be makin my way further down the road  
I'll be makin' my way  
I want to get there some day  
I'll be makin' my way  
Past the one eyed Jocks layin' rail road tracks in my soul  
I'll be makin' my way  
I want to get there some day  
I'll be makin' my way  
Past the one eyed Jacks layin' rail road tacks in my soul  
Sometimes I wake up with a fever  
Then I just have another beer  
I'd like to wake up to a new life  
A million miles away from here  
But I got Beam instead me chasin'  
And I live by the legend's code  
I'll be makin' my way further down the road  
I'll be makin' my way further down the road
