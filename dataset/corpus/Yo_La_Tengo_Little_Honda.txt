I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you  
We're going down to the auto shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do  
Get on the ride, no sweat, sure we'll take you anywhere you want me to  
  
First gear, it's all right  
Second gear, hang on tight  
Third gear, ain't I right  
Faster, it's all right  
  
It's not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike  
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, that two-wheel ride  
We'll go on into the hills or anywhere you wanna decide  
  
We'll ride some hills like a champ because my Honda's built really light  
When I go into the turn, lean with me, hang on tight  
I think I'll put on the lights, so I can ride mine under the night
