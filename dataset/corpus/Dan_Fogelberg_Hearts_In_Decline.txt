Nothing lasts foreverI know that this is true  
But I never knew how true it was  
'Til I was losing you.  
Maybe I'm a dreamer  
Or maybe I'm a fool  
But I never thought  
That love could be  
So careless or so cruel.  
You wrestle with the reasons  
But the reasons never rhyme  
Or comfort when the  
Heart is in decline  
And it doesn't really matter  
If it's chance or it's design  
It's going to take some time.  
Love don't play no favorites  
You know there's no one that's immune  
Cause she changes her demeanor  
Like the phases of the moon.  
There ain't no easy answers  
You know there's only shades of grey  
But when it's love or it's survival  
I guess you gotta get away.  
The days stretch on forever  
And the nights are so unkind  
And endless when the  
Heart is in decline.  
And it doesn't really matter  
If it's chance or it's design  
It's going to take some time.  
It's going to take some time.
