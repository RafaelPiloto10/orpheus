LL  
N.O. Joe, hit me baby!  
  
Push it out girl, arch your back  
Them 17's is fittin' like bubblewrap  
uh, plus they low on your hips  
You there, let me grab  
That thing you do keep me brick  
50 told you bout the "Magic Stick"  
c'mon, lean on me  
I'm in love with this scenery  
Poke it out  
'Pon de river, 'pon de bank baby stroke it out  
Sweat for your man  
Both hands on your hips for your man  
Me and the boys is your biggest fans  
Every time we see you we be like damn!  
Work it girl  
Move somethin', hurt me girl, oh!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
c'mon, c'mon, move somethin'  
c'mon, c'mon, move somethin'  
c'mon, c'mon, move somethin'  
c'mon, c'mon, prove somethin'  
  
Such a pimply aura  
Way way hotter than I was before-a  
She want to sit courtside next to a baller  
Where the paper's longer and cats are taller  
  
Woo! I'm off on my own  
Do the math mami, L's on the throne  
Now take it to the floor  
Do a split if you really hardcore  
  
Man listen here  
I'm hot today, ain't concerned with last year  
I see your lil' shorty ride shotgun  
But I done left stoplights with a hot one  
  
Made her hop out, and move somethin'  
Jump in my joint, and prove somethin'  
He-he, I laugh at y'all  
Don't worry about the check, already cashed it y'all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
uh, pull it to the side  
Shake it for daddy, it's time to ride  
Make it sweat 'til it slide  
Do your thing like it's justified  
  
Tease me a little  
It's my turn to take it to the middle  
Let me palm that thing  
You got the bomb, I disarm that thing  
  
Turn it around girl, I want that thing  
You had to know the way you flaunt that thing  
Your body's jumpin'  
Ain't no frontin' when you provin' somethin'  
  
Made eye contact with me  
Now bring that thing back to me  
You do your thing so naturally  
I think I'm in love, actually  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
LL  
N.O. Joe, hit me baby!  
Hot one boy, "Definition"
