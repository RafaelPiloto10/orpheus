You promised me it would last forever  
You said there's no way it could die  
Everything you ever told me  
Was a bunch of lies  
  
Hey, I'm on the back of the outside  
You know that's not where I belong, no  
Every truth, everything I believed in  
Has turned out wrong  
  
It's all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
  
It's all clear when you scratch on the surface  
Going deeper deeper down  
All I wanted was to make you happy  
But baby, what's that sound?  
But baby, what's that sound?  
  
It's all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
  
All you ever cared for was to make you stronger  
No-one I have known has looked so weak  
Oh yeah  
  
It's all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
So many times
