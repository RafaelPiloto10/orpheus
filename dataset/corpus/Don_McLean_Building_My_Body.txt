I'm building my body  
I'm happy when I'm building my body  
I'm tired of fighting, let's make friends  
I'm tired of burning both ends  
That's why I'm building my body  
It hurts me but I'm building my body  
And I know what the pain is worth  
I know I feel the pain of birth  
I'm pushin' up  
And gettin' down with my body  
There's no-one else around with my body  
One look says I'm a stone disgrace  
Don't kick no sand in my face  
  
Because I'm building my body strong  
I'm watching what I eat  
And I'm sorting out right from wrong  
Hey, not a lot of meat  
And I know that it won't be long  
Before I gotta quit smoking  
  
Because I'm building my body  
I'm peaceful when I'm building my body  
I'm sweating out mistakes I've made  
I'm getting back the dues I've paid  
I'm doing more  
And getting sore with my body  
But I'm gaining a rapport with my body  
And this seems like the perfect time  
They say I'm in my prime  
  
That's why I'm building my body strong  
I'm thinking at the table  
And I'm sorting out right from wrong  
I'm reading every label  
And I know that it won't be long  
Before I gotta quit smoking  
  
'Cause I'm building my body  
There's someone else inside of my body  
He's waiting to be born again
