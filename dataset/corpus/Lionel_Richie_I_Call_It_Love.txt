I look at you  
You look at me  
(You can't help it you're feeling butterflies)  
It's obvious  
There's some chemistry  
(I think I know why it feels so right)  
Girl, I wanted so long to know  
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go  
(Don't tell me I have to start all over again)  
I never thought this day would come  
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)  
I realize that you're the one  
(And you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)  
What's inside of my heart  
It ain't gonna change  
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away  
(You feel it, I feel it, let's not pretend)  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I don't know what love is  
Maybe I'm a fool  
I just know what I'm feeling  
And it's all because of you  
Don't tell me  
I don't know  
I want the truth  
'Cause they call it  
We call it  
You call it  
I call it love  
  
It's so clear for you to see  
(Don't let nobody tell you what to do)  
Why they can't they just let us be happy  
(I don't want to find somebody new)  
If you know what's really in your heart  
Then don't let them tear us apart  
('Cause you feel it, I feel it, let's think this through)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We have a bond that's unbreakable  
And it's not time to let it go (We're in love)  
And now that we know it's real  
We are going to let it show  
To the whole world  
That I'm yours forever  
And you're my girl  
(You are my girl)  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Love  
They call it love  
I call it love
