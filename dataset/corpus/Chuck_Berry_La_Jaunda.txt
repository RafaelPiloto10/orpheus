In Baya California  
Down in Tijuana  
La senorita come to me  
She say "Mi nombre es La Jaunda"  
I asked her would she care to dance  
She looked at me and said "Como esta?"  
I say "Hablo solo en Ingles  
Y no comprendo Espanol"  
I speak only the language of English  
I don't understand Espanol  
  
For a moment I took a notion  
Then I went into a dancing motion  
She nodded her head  
"Yo mucho gusto" she said  
And she danced with more devotion  
When her cheek came close to mine  
I could hear her softly whisper  
She said "Habla solo la langua de Ingles  
Y no comprenda Espanol"  
I speak only the language of English  
I don't understand Espanol  
  
She placed her hand before my heart  
And she whispered "Yo te amora"  
With half - closed eyes  
She raised her lips  
And she said "Besame ahora"  
She hold me close and she squeeze me tight  
And she whispered " Yo quiero ahora"  
I say "Hablo solo la langua de Ingles  
No comprendo Espanol"  
I speak only the language of English  
I don't understand Espanol
