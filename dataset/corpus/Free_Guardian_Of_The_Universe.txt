Sleep now my little baby  
Safe inside your mama  
You have no name  
But soon you will  
And soon the sun will shine  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
On this little one  
  
Slowly comes the day  
You will see, hear, touch and feel  
Slowly comes the day  
You will know  
What kind of world this is  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
On this little one  
  
Slowly comes the day  
You will see, hear and touch and feel  
Slowly comes the day  
You will know  
The kind of world this is  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
On this little one  
Oh, oh, oh
