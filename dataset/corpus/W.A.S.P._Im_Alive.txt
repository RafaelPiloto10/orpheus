The target is me, a monster you flee  
I hate what you say and you do  
A mirror is there and look if you dare  
The fool that you see's only you  
Oh, no, you won't nail me to your tree  
Or hang my head up high  
No kingdom reigns over me  
Despise all the liars I see  
Don't give me your  
"Save my soul" cure  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
I - I'm still alive, and I am soul survivor  
You can't understand, why  
I - I'm still alive, and I am soul survivor  
Damn your holy man - alive  
  
Can't understand, the lord of the land  
Your heart and your head made of stone  
Lay in the sand my blood on your hands  
For God's sake just leave me alone  
Oh, no, you won't nail me to your tree  
Or hang my head up high  
Restless is all I can be  
Ruthless and reckless you see  
I don't need your  
"Save my soul" cure  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Force suppression, that's what you do  
Feel me, what's in it for you  
Listen, I'm on to your game  
All your lies are the same  
  
[REFRAIN:]
