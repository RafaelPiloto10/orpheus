Now you're gone  
I can feel my heart is breaking,  
An' I can't go on  
When I think of the love that you've taken  
  
In the night I pray for your embrace,  
Every time I close my eyes  
I can't escape your face  
You're out of sight,  
But, always on my mind,  
I never realized  
My love could be so blind  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all I need,  
So maybe we could turn back  
The hands of time,  
Maybe we could give it another try  
One more time  
  
But, now you're gone  
There's an emptiness closing around me,  
An' I can't go on  
When all I have left is the memory  
  
In the night I call out your name,  
I wake up in a cold sweat  
An' I'm all alone again  
I need your love  
Much more than I can say,  
I realize without you  
I can't face another day  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all that I need,  
Since I lost you, girl,  
I've been losing my mind  
You're all that I want,  
So maybe we could turn back  
The hands of time,  
Maybe we could give it  
Another try  
One more time,  
Baby, just one more time  
  
Now you're gone  
I can feel my heart is breaking,  
An I can't go on  
When all of my love has been taken  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all that I need,  
Since I lost you, girl,  
I've been losing my mind  
  
You're all I want,  
Can't you feel the love  
In this heart of mine  
You're all that I need,  
Since I lost you, girl,  
I've been losing my mind.
