I belong  
To you, and I'm not  
Confused,  
I don't care  
Where you been,  
And I don't wanna know  
Where you went,  
Girl I need your heart  
I'm right here,  
And I'll try my best  
Not to bring you to tears,  
If your eyes could only see what I see  
Girl you're the best part of me  
  
Girl I'll do whatever it takes  
Say whatever you want me to say,  
Girl I'll go wherever you wanna go  
Just teach me the way  
And I'll love you for forever and a day day day day day day day day day day

Forever and a day day day day day day day day girl you're the best part of me.  
  
Every breath  
Is a breath of you,  
You have no idea what you do,  
To me, my love was locked away but now its  
Right here as where I wanna be.  
My heart  
Standing still and it'll only beat when you near,  
You may never  
See what I see  
But you're the best part of me

Say whatever u want me to say,
