Walked with no one and talked with no one  
And I had nothing but shadows  
Then one morning you passed  
And I brightened at last  
Now I greet the day and complete the day  
With the sun in my heart  
All my worry blew away  
When you taught me how to say  
  
Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid  
This Rover crossed over  
  
If I never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
Grab your street
