[Verse - Violent J]  
In my mind's eye  
You throw wickedness at me  
I'm just a toy to you  
I bring no real joy to you  
The way I see it  
You don't want me here no more  
You want a hole in my forehead  
And blood pourin' on the floor  
Cause I'm so dirty  
Fuckin' dirty and shoddy  
I want up out of this body  
That's hated by everybody  
Sometimes I don't know why  
I continue to try  
It's so much easier to die  
Than to get by  
And to get by  
And to get by..  
[Verse - Violent J]  
If I'm gonna die  
I'm taking you with me  
Get you and get me  
We can be bloody  
If I'm gonna fly  
I'm gonna succeed  
Take you and get me  
We can be bloody  
Sometimes I don't know why  
I continue to try  
It's so much easier to die  
Than to get by  
And to get by  
And to get by..  
[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]  
I don't want to leave my house  
Don't want to open my mouth  
Don't want to read my mail  
Don't want to meet with pals  
I don't want to fuck shit up  
Don't want to fuckin' get up  
Don't want to take up space  
Don't want your time to waste  
I don't want to fight this back  
Just want to fade to black  
Don't want to turn to faith  
Or want to burn at stakes  
I don't want to build my life  
I want to bloody my knife  
Don't want to grab the phone  
Don't want to leave this room  
I don't want to talk with you  
I'm fuckin' stalkin' you  
Don't want to fix myself  
I want to nix myself  
I don't want to try to change  
Just want to fry my brains  
Don't want to slow shit down  
I want to throw shit around  
I don't want to run nowhere  
Don't want no one to care  
Don't want another crack at it  
I'd rather be a crack addict  
I don't want to look for help  
Don't want to help myself  
I don't want to even try  
To get by  
To get by..
