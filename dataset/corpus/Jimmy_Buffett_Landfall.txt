Now what do they do if I just sailed away  
Who the hell really compelled me to leave today  
Runnin' low on stories is what made it a ball  
What would they do if made no landfall  
  
I lived half my life in eight by five room  
Just crusin' to the sound of the big deisel boom  
It's not close quarters that would make me snap  
It's just dealing with the daily unadulterated crap  
  
Sail away for a month at a time,  
Sail away I've got to recharge mind  
Then you'll find me back at it again  
  
Oh I love the smell of fresh snapper fried lite  
What'd you say, pouilly fuisse could round out the night  
The mid morning watch is the best time to look  
Oh what would they do if I wrote the big book  
  
'Cause I've seen incredible things in my year  
Somedays were laughter, others were tears  
If I had it all to do over again  
I'd just get myself drunk and I'd jump right back in  
  
Sail away, that's the way I survive  
Sail away, that's just no shuck and jive  
It just makes my whole life come alive  
  
The wind whistled threw the cool rigging at night  
Crazy crowds boogie to the sound and the lights  
Down in he's just havin a ball  
What would he do on another landfall  
What would they do if I made no landfall  
Oh what would they do if I flew to Nepal  
What would I do if I met Lucille Ball  
Tryin' to make a little sense of it all  
Just tryin' to make a little sense of it all
