Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'  
Cut the music up  
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'  
  
[Chorus]  
You think you ballin' cause you got a block?  
He think he ballin' cause he got a block?  
You know these hoes came to see me ball  
You know these hoes love to see me ball  
You think you ballin' cause you got a block?  
He think he ballin' cause he got a block?  
You know these hoes love to see me ball  
You know these hoes came to see me ball  
  
Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone  
Think I forgot to put my roof on  
Said "fuck it, buy another car"  
Hopped out the Lamb'  
Said "fuck it, bought another car"  
I bought the Phantom just to say it's black  
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap  
I'm getting head in the backseat  
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete  
I'm ballin' hard, I need a jersey on  
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home  
I'm on them Diddy's, spendin' Dirty Money  
I'm on that Jizzle, spendin' birdy money  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Still ballin' like a muthafucker, tell 'em that  
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques  
Ain't got nuttin' gold but some gold chains  
Say "Jizzle, what's the goal?"  
Move the whole thang  
My celly bumpin' like a chat line  
He bought a five-hundred, need he, need a halftime  
If yo job ain't ballin' hard, then you need to quit  
You need a eighteen hard, then you need to split  
Summer's mine, winter too  
I'm poppin' bottles in the club, that's what winners do  
They claiming bitches, them my old hoes  
They claim they ballin' in my old flows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These hoes call me Tunechi baby  
Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating  
Bitch, I'm balling, ballin' like a motherfucker  
Twelve gage, bitch, I got a dozen of them  
Nigga broke, acting like they got it though  
I'm with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!  
So many cars I'm like eenie meanie minie mo  
So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope  
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat  
Run in ya house, and get to poppin' at your shower cap  
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac  
And if them bitches don't sell, we buy em back  
  
[Chorus: x2]
