Cold hard labor, it's a labor of love  
Convicted of crimes, the crimes of passion  
Caught in a chain gang, the chain of fools  
Solitary confinement, confined by the rules  
  
I'm just a Prisioner  
An inmate of love  
Oh I'm a Prisioner  
Captured by love  
With no escape  
No where to go  
No place to hide  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner!  
I'm just a Prisioner  
  
Mending the wounds, the wounds of lament  
The knife cut deep, deep into my heart  
The romance is over, my passions remain  
Still bound to love by this ball and chain  
  
I'm just a Prisioner  
An inmate of love  
Oh I'm a Prisioner  
Captured by love  
With no escape  
No where to go  
No place to hide  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner!  
I'm just a Prisioner  
  
Oh I'm a Prisioner  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner!  
  
Find an escape, a key to the door  
I gotta get out, can't take anymore  
Make a clean break, to bury the past  
I'll shed these chains and be free at last  
  
I'm just a Prisioner  
A Prisioner Of Love  
I'm just a Prisioner  
A Prisioner Of Love  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner  
I'm just a Prisioner
