Body, body, bo-bo-bo-body, body  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Nobody does it like you do  
Body to body  
I love the way you make me feel  
When you do what you're doing to me, oh  
Touching me the way you do, you know, know you've got to feel it too  
When you body's next to mine, you've got me hypnotized  
Body to body  
Body to body  
You know I like the way you do what you do when you do it to me, oh  
Body to body  
Nobody does it like you do  
Body to body  
You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no  
Oh, what you do  
Flowing through this magic night  
I love to feel you hold me tight  
You are the one that's right for me  
You got me feeling tingaly  
Share the night with stars above  
I think I've found this thing called love  
Fever running through your eyes  
You are my heavenly device  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Body to body nobody does it like you do  
Body to body  
You know I like what you do when you do what you do to me, no  
Oh, what you do  
You opened up the world to me  
You changed my life so tenderly  
I know you are the only one  
You're brighter than the burning sun  
Don't know where you're going to  
I don't care as long as I'm with you  
That certain sparkle in your eyes  
Has got me feeling oh so high  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Body to body  
Body to body  
I like what you do when you do all those things to me  
Body to body....
