I remember when we used to walk together  
Used to talk together, go to the park together  
In all kinds of weather we would share  
This common pleasure with most of human kinds  
It was a kind of treasure One that I was surely glad to find  
But I got one right here and I'm okay  
I'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay  
I'm alright. Everything else is alright sometimes.  
  
Just remember those bones they get broken  
And love is not a token of affection  
It's not even a real thing, it's a word  
So don't you try to but it out with a ring  
Cause it's a verb, to love someone  
Open up and let them in  
Just don't be afraid to set them free again  
  
This ain't no heaven, ain't no hell , ain't no in between  
Cause there's just too many faces and places in this world  
That I ain't ever seen  
I'm gonna keep on keeping on  
I'm gonna reap on being strong  
I got my head on, though misconnected  
It's alright cause I do it protected  
I got a day job. I drive a cheap ride  
Sounds like I'm gonna fine  
You only get one life to learn  
There's only so many brain cells that you can burn  
And life can take a turn and take away that you've earned  
And leave you yearning for more, so much more  
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more  
Your stomach's gonna be churning  
Wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more.  
You're wanting some more, more, more  
Do you want some?  
  
Well I got some right here and I'm okay  
I'm okay and you're okay  
Ha ha, we're okay  
Everything else will be fine sometimes.  
Guess what I'm doing okay.
