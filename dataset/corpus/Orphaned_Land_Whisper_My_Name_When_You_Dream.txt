In this throne that I lay I hear her sigh  
All gods of north are calling to me with wrath  
Oh - sing for me my queen of lost  
  
In this state with pleasure I die  
I watch with an all knowing eye  
Undying pleasure envelops all that we are  
Our emotions rage like a flaring sun, like a work undone  
  
Feel my passion unto you flow  
I watch the halo slowly grows  
And from this moment I now know  
You whisper my name when you... Dream on...  
I cry for you oh my lord, (sing for me)  
My kingdom of lust is yours (oh, sing for me)  
Bonded by love we are one, you are the moon and I am the sun
