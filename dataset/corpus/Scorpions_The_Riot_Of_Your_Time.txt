The only king of rock has gone  
Gone to heaven  
A star on the way to the stars  
Another king of rock is born in '77  
Just born to be there when it's dark  
  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time  
  
Just to get the message to be more  
Than you desire  
A star full of life wild and young  
The hits from 1994 electric fire  
Will burn out the time like the sun  
  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time
