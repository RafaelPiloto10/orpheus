Born to sing the blues  
So tired an' worn, just singin' the blues  
Alone right from the start,  
I walked alone with blues in my heart.  
  
True love, (true love) I've never known (I've never known.)  
Everything (everything) I do is wrong. (all wrong.)  
But wrong, I've always been  
It's hard to go on when I never win.  
  
My life, (my life) my destiny, (my destiny.)  
Is loneliness (loneliness) and misery. (misery.)  
My life, I didn't choose.  
I guess, I was born to sing the blues.  
  
The lonesome blues,  
The weary blues
