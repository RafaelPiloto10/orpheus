You can take me out of my hell  
You can't take the hell on out of me  
Watch me here as I get  
But be careful what you see  
  
I cut across the waste , some live and some enshrined  
I look into the light of the necroshine  
Don't you worry ' bout me  
You know I'm doin ' line  
  
Basking in the light  
Of the necroshine  
In the name of all that's sacred  
In the name of misery  
  
Watch me here as I turn red  
And remember what you see  
I hunger for a taste  
To fill me glass with wine  
  
Away from the right into the necroshine  
Don't you ever doubt me  
As you walk the line  
Guided by the light  
  
Of the necroshine  
I think that I have been reborn,  
Just a little better than before  
I think I tried to tell myself,  
  
That I needed just a little more  
They always tried to sell me,  
Hang me what I couldn't use  
Always tried to get a little better,  
  
With an offer that I can't refuse  
You can take me full of fire,  
you can take me as you lind  
Or you can leave me here , where you gonna see me  
  
Guided by the necroshine
