City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you'll hear  
Silver Bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Strings of streetlights, even stoplights, blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene  
And above all this bustle you'll hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
Soon it will be Christmas day
