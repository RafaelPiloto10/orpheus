Well hello. Gee, I can't believe you're here with me.  
Oh, I've wanted to see you alone for so long.  
Where did you learn to do all that?  
Oh, c'mon over here,  
Sit down right next to me.  
Oh, c'mon, don't be afraid.  
I ain't gonna hurt you.  
Just want to show you a few things  
I picked up when you went away.  
Like this. Ah, don't feel bad.  
Oh, so good, so good, so good.  
You and me have got in bed.  
  
Now that we caress,  
A kiss so warm and tender,  
I can't wait 'til we reach  
That sweet moment of surrender.  
Oh, we'll hear the thunder roar,  
Feel lightning strike.  
We don't have to hurry,  
'Cause you know we got all night.  
  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.  
I'm gonna give you more  
Than you've ever dreamed possible.  
Hang on in there, baby.  
Hang on in there, doll.

Don't be afraid, baby. Oh, no.  
You're the master of the world.  
Whoa, we can't help but make it,  
Because there's real love between us, boy.  
Whoa, c'mon, help me touch that fire  
That every girl dreams of.  
We're almost there little boy.  
We're truly making love.

I'm gonna give you more  
Than you ever dreamed possible.  
Hang on in there, baby.

Please don't destroy  
This new joy we've found.  
  
Uh, so heavy, uh.  
Listen now, baby.  
What is that you say?  
Something eating at you?  
It's gonna get away.  
Don't you fight it, baby.  
C'mon, open up the door.  
That's the key to freedom  
We've been working for.  
Let it go, baby. Let it go, honey.  
Oh, right there, right there.  
Now don't you move it anywhere.  
Let it go. Let it go!
