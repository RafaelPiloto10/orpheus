If she brings you happiness then I wish you both the best  
It's your happiness that matters most of all  
But if she ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  
Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know  
Then I'll stand by you if ever you should call  
And if I should ever hear that she made you shed a tear  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side  
To dry away every teardrop that you cried  
And if he ever leaves you blue ah just remember I love you  
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
