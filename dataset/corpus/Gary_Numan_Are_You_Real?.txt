No one's alive  
You could almost be me  
What do you mean  
"Oh, nothing, nothing at all"  
Room eight top floor  
I've seen this man before  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Cold metal voice  
Of no one's friend it could be mine  
My reflection  
Is no longer me at all  
Am I a fake  
Of the man and are you of me  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Relax in a backroom  
Oh me oh my oh wouldn't you  
I know your face  
Your connection is broken, boy  
Nothing is new  
Remember? I've got no time  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Real?  
Real?  
Real?
