Another summer day  
Is come and gone away  
In Paris and Rome  
But I want to go home  
Mmm  
  
Maybe surrounded by  
A million people, I  
Still feel all alone  
I just want to go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know  
  
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you  
Each one a line or two  
'I'm fine, baby, how are you?'  
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough  
My words were cold and flat  
And you deserve more than that  
  
Another aeroplane  
Another sunny place  
I'm lucky I know  
But I want to go home  
Mmm, I've got to go home  
  
Let me go home  
I'm just too far from where you are  
I want to come home  
  
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life  
It's like I just stepped outside  
When everything was going right  
And I know just why you could not  
Come along with me  
But this was not your dream  
But you always believe in me  
  
Another winter day has come  
And gone away  
And even Paris and Rome  
And I want to go home  
Let me go home  
  
And I'm surrounded by  
A million people, I  
Still feel alone  
Oh, let me go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know  
  
Let me go home  
I've had my run  
Baby, I'm done  
I gotta go home  
Let me go home  
It will all be alright  
I'll be home tonight  
I'm coming back home
