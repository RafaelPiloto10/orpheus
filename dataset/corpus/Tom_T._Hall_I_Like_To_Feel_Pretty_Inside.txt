A mink wears a mink coat the whole year around  
Even when he is not going to town  
A skunk has a stripped coat, it's pretty he thinks  
Although we all know he stinks  
  
An elephant has hide as hard as a rock  
A zebra has stripes and the leopard has spots  
Sometimes I'm sad when I look at my hide  
But I'd rather feel pretty inside  
  
I like to feel pretty inside, don't you?  
I like being kind and I like being true  
I like to like me when I close my eyes  
I like to feel pretty inside, oh, I like to feel pretty inside  
  
If a mink wore a fur coat the whole year around  
If he had to wear it when he went to town  
If a skunk had a red coat and smell like a rose  
Do you think he'd turn up his nose?  
  
If elephants have fur as likely as not  
A leopard would have stripes and the zebra have spots  
I guess it would be great to have a new hide  
But I'd rather feel pretty inside  
  
I like to feel pretty inside, don't you?  
I like being kind and I like being true  
I like to like me when I close my eyes  
I like to feel pretty inside, oh, I like to feel pretty inside  
  
I like to feel pretty inside, don't you?  
I like being kind and I like being true  
I like to like me
