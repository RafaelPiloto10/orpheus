You leave me sad and lonely  
Sitting here oh so blue  
Since you went away and told me, baby,  
Yeah that we're through  
Now baby, c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon little lover  
C'mon and discover  
My love for you  
Trying to forget you  
Getting you outta my mind  
I'm gonna search all over this world  
And find some other kind  
Now some other lover (c'mon little lover)  
Some other lover (c'mon little lover)  
C'mon little lover  
C'mon and discover  
My love for you  
Break  
Writing you a letter  
Feeling oh so blue  
I've been crying my heart out baby  
Since you said we're through  
Now baby c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon little lover  
C'mon and discover  
My love for you
