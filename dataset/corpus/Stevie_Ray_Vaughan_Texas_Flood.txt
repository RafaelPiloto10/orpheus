Well there's floodin' down in Texas  
All of the telephone lines are down  
Well there's floodin' down in Texas  
All of the telephone lines are down  
And I've been tryin' to call my baby  
Lord and I can't get a single sound  
  
Well dark clouds are rollin' in  
Man I'm standin' out in the rain  
Well dark clouds are rollin' in  
Man I'm standin' out in the rain  
Yeah flood water keep a rollin'  
Man it's about to drive poor me insane  
  
Well I'm leavin' you baby  
Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay  
Well I'm leavin' you baby  
Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay  
Well back home are no floods or tornadoes  
Baby and the sun shines every day
