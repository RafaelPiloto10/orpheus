There's a Rose in Bethlehem  
With a beauty quite divine  
Perfect in this world of sin  
On this silent, holy night  
  
There's a fragrance much like hope  
That it sends upon the wind  
Reaching out to every soul  
From a lowly manger's crib  
  
Oh, Rose of Bethlehem  
How lovely, pure, and sweet  
Born to glorify the Father  
Born to wear the thorns for me  
  
There's a Rose in Bethlehem  
Colored red like mercy's blood  
'Tis the flower of our faith  
'Tis the blossom of God's love  
  
Though its bloom is fresh with youth  
Surely what will be He knows  
For a tear of morning dew  
Is rolling down the Rose  
  
Oh, Rose of Bethlehem  
How lovely, pure, and sweet  
Born to glorify the Father  
Born to wear the thorns for me  
  
There's a Rose in Bethlehem  
With a beauty quite divine  
Perfect in this world of sin  
On this silent, holy night  
  
Oh, Rose of Bethlehem  
How lovely, pure, and sweet  
Born to glorify the Father  
Born to wear the thorns for me
