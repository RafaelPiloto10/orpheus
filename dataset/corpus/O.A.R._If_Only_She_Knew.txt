If only she knew  
What was going right,  
If only she knew,  
I would not be alone tonight.  
If only she knew  
What was going wrong  
If only she knew  
I would not be singing this song.  
If only she knew  
What would I do?  
Would I run?  
Maybe stick around just for fun  
Would I take you out just us two?  
That would be grand  
If only she knew  
  
If only she knew what to do  
Relax with you  
And let myself get lost in your smile  
Well I could lose it all for awhile  
Oh my dear you know its true  
I love you deep, if only you knew  
Well I would give it all to you  
Love you true if only you knew  
  
If only she knew  
What would I do?  
Would I run?  
Maybe stick around just for fun  
Would I take you out just us two?  
That would be grand  
If only she knew
