You double-clicked my heart  
You've upgraded my life  
You booted up my hard drive  
Please be my cyber-wife  
You've logged into my soul  
You've downloaded my dreams  
Let's go to my chat-room  
And I'll show you what I mean  
  
I wanna log in to you  
So I can prove my love is true  
You're the apple of my ibm, let me interface with you  
I wanna log in to you  
(Log in to you)  
  
Password incorrect  
My login was denied  
I gotta open up your motherboard  
Put my Pentium inside  
  
I got a 21" screen  
The colours'll make you dizzy  
My attachments are full of love for you  
But your modem still rings busy (Beep Beep)  
  
Www dot love  
You at me dot com  
You can unzip all my floppy files  
And spin my cd-Rom  
  
I wanna log in to you  
So I can prove my love is true  
I'm free of any virus  
And I've been debugged too  
I wanna log in to you  
So I can prove my love is true  
Come be my laptop dancer, I got lotsa ram for you  
I wanna log in to you  
  
Www dot love
