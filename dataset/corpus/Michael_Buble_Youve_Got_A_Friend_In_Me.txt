You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
When the road looks rough ahead  
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed  
You just remember what your old pal said  
Yeah you've got a friend in me  
Baby you've got a friend in me  
  
You've got a pal in me  
You've got a friend in me  
You got your troubles and I got 'em too  
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you  
We stick together, and see it through  
'Cause you've got a friend in me  
Darling you got a friend in me  
  
Now, some other boys might be little bit smarter than I am  
Are bigger and stronger too  
Maybe, But none of them  
Is ever gonna love you the way I do  
It's me and you  
  
And as the years go by  
Our friendship will never die  
You're gonna see it's our destiny  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
  
Now, some other boys might be little bit smarter than I am  
Are bigger and stronger too  
Maybe, But none of them  
Is ever gonna love you the way I do  
'Cause it's me and you  
  
And as the years go by  
Our friendship will never die  
You're gonna see it's our destiny  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend in me  
I, you and me, you and me  
You've got a friend in me  
My darling you've got a friend in me
