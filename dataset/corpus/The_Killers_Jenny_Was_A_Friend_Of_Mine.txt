We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same  
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain  
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go  
She couldn't scream while I held I close  
I swore I'd never let her go  
  
Tell me what you want to know  
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on  
There ain't no motive for this crime  
Jenny was a friend of mine  
So come on, oh come on, oh come on  
  
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time  
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright  
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth  
She couldn't scream while I held her close  
I swore I'd never let her go  
  
Tell me what you want to know  
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on  
And then you whisper in my ear  
I know what you're doing here  
So come on, oh come on, oh come on  
There ain't no motive for this crime  
Jenny was a friend of mine  
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
