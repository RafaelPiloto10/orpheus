Your mamma told you,  
Told you to stay away  
Pappa done scold you girl,  
Don't hear a word he say  
He said,  
Over my body  
No star-crossed lover lay  
  
You can run, I can hide  
And we'll meet each other  
On the other side  
Don't you worry pretty baby  
They'll never take us alive  
  
Tell me you're leaving it,  
Leaving it all behind  
Better believe in me,  
Never treat you unkind  
(A little closer girl)  
Come take my hand child  
I'll love you  
For a million miles  
  
You can run, I can hide  
And we'll meet each other  
On the other side  
Don't you worry pretty baby  
They'll never take us alive  
  
Save our souls, save our souls  
Save our souls, save our souls  
  
You better run, I gotta hide  
And we'll meet each other  
On the other side  
Don't you worry pretty baby  
They'll never take us alive  
  
You better run, and I can hide  
And we'll meet each other  
On the other side  
Don't you worry pretty baby  
They'll never take us  
Don't you worry pretty mamma  
They'll never break us  
Don't you worry pretty baby  
They'll never take us alive
