Live life given now  
Tomorrow can wait  
Dance all through the night  
Sleeping all day  
Stuck inside a box  
You gotta get out!  
Stand up, get up  
Live your life now come on!  
  
Stand up, get up!  
Come on, yeah yeah yeah!  
Come on, come on!  
  
[Chorus]  
Live life given now  
Tomorrow can wait  
Dance all through the night  
Sleeping all day  
Stuck inside a box  
You gotta get out!  
Stand up, get up  
Live your life now come on!  
  
Stand up, get up  
Let's go right now!  
  
People lining through this life we lead  
Never knowing what we'll find out  
So we living, working, and waiting for the day  
There'll be something that's coming to take the pain away  
And we wait for nothing inside your ways  
You gotta let that fun girl through!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes it feels  
How love indeed  
And when just floating  
Searching infinity  
(infinity)  
(infinity)  
(infinity)  
(infinity)  
  
Come on and dance here tonight  
Tomorrow can wait  
Dance all through the night  
Sleeping through day  
Stuck inside a box  
You gotta get out!  
Stand up, get up  
Live your life now come on!
