So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah  
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah  
California, I'm fine  
Somebody check my brain  
California's all right  
Somebody check my brain  
Check my brain  
  
I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah  
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah  
California, I'm fine somebody check my brain  
California's all right somebody check my brain  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Guitar  
  
I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah  
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah  
California, I'm fine somebody check my brain  
California's all right somebody check my brain  
  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Check my brain, check my brain
