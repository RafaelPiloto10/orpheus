Looking up into the endless sky  
Staring into the maze of time  
Our existence caught in the blink of an eye  
Imagining other words we try  
Realizing somehow we're all part of this  
Wondrous cosmical tapestry  
  
Beyond the sun  
Beyond the sky  
Are where the real questions lie  
Wanting to know where it begins  
The puzzle piece we are missing  
  
Starlight  
Flowering  
Endlessly through the universal garden  
Garden above  
  
Looking up into the endless sky  
Through space and time  
Staring into the maze of time  
We'll fly  
Our existence caught in the blink of an eye  
Retracing years  
Imagining other worlds we try  
No fears  
Realizing somehow we're all part of this  
Blazing a new trail  
Wondrous cosmical tapestry  
  
Beyond the sun  
Beyond the sky  
Are where the real questions lie  
Wanting to know where it begins  
The puzzle piece we are missing  
  
Starlight  
Flowering  
Endlessly through the universal garden  
Garden above  
  
Investigate the science of illusion  
We benefit without knowing  
  
Our time is man-made  
Our fear is man-made  
Delusion man-made  
Religion man-made  
  
Love is forever  
Flowering  
Endlessly through the universal garden  
Garden above  
  
Beyond the sun  
Beyond the sky  
Are where the real questions lie  
Wanting to know where it begins  
The puzzle piece we are missing  
  
Beyond the sun  
Beyond the sky  
Are where the real questions lie  
  
Universal garden
