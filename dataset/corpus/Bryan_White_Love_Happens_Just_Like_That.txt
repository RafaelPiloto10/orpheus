You didn't notice me right beside you  
I said you looked like someone that I knew  
A little lie to get you to talk to me awhile  
You're eyes oh how they melt me  
  
Your smile, girl heaven help me  
Your lips kiss and tell me a thing or two  
Oh, the happy ending this could be  
Swept away in love and all it's glory  
  
One minute hearts are lonely  
The next each other's only  
Then darlin', I just know we'd fall that fast  
So don't you ever think it can't  
  
Love happens just like that  
I could try and act like I don't care  
But, bein' shy that gets me nowhere  
Though I admit, I'm a little bit scared to talk to you  
  
A risk, yeah maybe  
But it's one worth taking  
'Cause I see a love in the making here with you  
Oh, the happy ending this could be  
  
Swept away in love and all it's glory  
One minute hearts are lonely  
The next each other's only  
Then darlin', I just know we'd fall that fast  
  
So don't you ever think it can't  
Love happens just like  
Lightning striking, flames igniting  
In an instant, souls igniting  
  
One minute hearts are lonely  
Then the next each other's only  
Then darlin' I just know we'd fall that fast  
So don't you ever think it can't  
  
Love happens just like  
Don't you ever think it can't  
Love happens just like that  
It happens just like that  
  
Love happens just like that
