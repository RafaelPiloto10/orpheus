Everybody knows...but no one's saying nothing  
  
And it's a sound so very loud...that no one can hear?  
  
I got something in my shoes...It's keeping me from walking  
  
Down the long and winding road...back home to you  
  
And round this town you've ceased to be  
  
That's what you got for sleeping with the enemy  
  
Where angels fly you won't play  
  
So guess who's gonna take the blame for...  
  
My Big Mouth my big name  
  
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame?  
  
Into my big mouth, you can fly a plane  
  
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame?  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame?  
  
I ain't never spoke to God  
  
And I ain't never been to heaven  
  
But you assumed I knew the way  
  
Even though the map was given  
  
And as you look into the eyes  
  
Of a bloody cold assassin  
  
Only then you realise  
  
With who's life you have been messin'
