They judge a boy by his friends  
And all a mine are trash  
They say you find your own level  
Well, I'm a snake in the grass  
  
But I can't help the things I do  
I've always been attracted to  
  
Cheap thrills, don't you know I like  
Cheap thrills, it's night after night  
Cheap thrills  
Well, if you ain't supposed to do it I will  
  
I got a low reputation and and a bad attitude  
'Cause all I want to do is something that I ain't supposed to do  
But I can't change the things I love  
I guess I'm just a victim of  
  
Cheap thrills, don't you know I like  
Cheap thrills, it's night after night  
Cheap thrills  
Well, if you ain't supposed to do it I will  
  
Cheap thrills, don't you know I like  
Cheap thrills, it's night after night  
Cheap thrills  
Well, if you ain't supposed to do it I will  
  
Cheap thrills, whoa, you know I like  
Cheap thrills, whoa, night after night  
Cheap thrills, yes, yes, yes  
If you ain't supposed to do it I will
