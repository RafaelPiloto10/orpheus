You used to be on fire, now you chill me to the bone  
We used to fly like angels, now we're sinking like a stone  
You say you're trying to help me but that ain't the way it feels  
I think you're trying to kill me with those stiletto heels  
  
Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing  
I been stabbed in the back babe  
And if you don't love me, I'll never feel a thing  
  
And oh, one thing I know, there's only one place left for me to go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Going back to the kingdom of desire, going down to the valley of the gun  
I'm gonna stand too close to the fire, I'm gonna fly too close to the sun  
  
They say the king of love sleeps on a velvet bed  
My sheets feel like sandpaper, and my pillow feels like lead  
But as sure as Atlantis sank into the sea  
I'm sinking like a stone babe, that's how it's got to be  
  
Paint the town black babe and let that pendulum swing  
I been stabbed in the back babe  
And if you don't love me, I'll never feel a thing  
  
And oh, if I don't have you, there's only one thing left for me to do  
  
When you dig up God's little acre, you lose all peace of mind  
You stare into the distance, looking for a sign  
But that sign it never comes babe, your wishes won't come true  
You keep praying for the rain while the sun beats down on you  
  
And oh, one thing I know, there's only one place left for me to go  
  
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun, yeah  
I'm gonna fly too close to the sun
