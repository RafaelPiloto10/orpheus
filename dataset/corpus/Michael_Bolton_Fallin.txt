Angels heard me callin'  
Saw the mountains crumble  
Fell in love with the wind  
And all the time I spent  
Dreamin' of you  
And all the love we made  
But I never knew I found you  
  
[Chorus]  
I can feel love fallin', fallin'  
I can see it comin', hey  
'Cause heaven sent you down to me  
Heaven sent you down  
  
Oceans re conforming  
To pave the way before me  
Revealing your flawless aura  
I saw your wings unveil, inviting to me  
A world of love  
But I wasn't even looking for ya baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You became rain in the air  
When you appeared to me  
Like a love mystery, feels so real to me  
'Cause you came from heaven  
Sent down straight to me  
And there's not another that ya can love  
Oh I can feel it fallin'  
  
CHORUS
