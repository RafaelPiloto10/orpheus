This is my confessional  
Pen and paper I'm gonna right this down  
Saying things you never thought  
That were on my mind,  
Let the truth pour out  
Cause I'm tired of the games  
I won't lie, no I'm not ok!  
You were wrong you're to blame,  
Now the world knows your name  
  
So here you go,  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down!  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you,  
This is no mistake, yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you, about you!  
  
This song is about you, yeah!  
Seem I'm feeling better now,  
I like the way our heads lifting off my chest!  
Should have done months ago  
If I knew back ten it would feel like this!  
Cause you done all the games  
I won't lie, no I'm not ok  
You were wrong, you're the blame  
Now the world knows your name!  
  
So here you go,  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down!  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you,  
This is no mistake, yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you, about you!  
  
When you hear this play,  
I hope you feel the same way that I felt that day  
That you let me, yeah you left me!  
This is my confession  
This is my confessional  
Pen and paper round gonna right this down  
  
So here you go,  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down!  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you,  
This is no mistake, yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you, about you  
About you, about you, about you!  
This song is about you, yeah!  
This song is about you  
This song is about you, oh!
