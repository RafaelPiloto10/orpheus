Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I want to shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh  
  
I like crazy, foolish, stupid  
Party going wild, fist pumping  
Music, I might lose it  
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)  
I don't care the night, she don't care we like  
Almost dared the right five  
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise  
Take me so high, jump and don't stop  
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man  
When they heading my van, mic check one two  
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose  
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow  
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto  
Club shuts down, a hundred super models  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I wanna shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh  
  
Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo  
Number one, club popper  
Got a hangover like too much vodka  
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool  
No doubt by the end of the night  
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move  
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof  
All black shades when the sun come through  
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show  
What happens to that body, it's a private show  
Stays right here, private show  
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain  
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne  
My life, coming harder when we hit fame  
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I want to shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh  
  
I am a wild one, break me in  
Saddle me up and lets begin  
I am a wild one, tame me now  
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl  
  
Show you another side of me  
A side you would never thought you would see  
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough  
I hear you like the wild stuff  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you'll do  
I want to shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh  
  
I am a wild one break me in  
Saddle me up and let's begin  
I am a wild one tame me now  
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
