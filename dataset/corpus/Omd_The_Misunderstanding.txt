Well we know where the true one lies  
And you can't say it's our imagination  
Just because we cannot find the proof  
We've shared this thought for some considerable time  
It's increasingly unlike the rest  
For as we get older we've become less aware  
Security lies at the heart of our lives  
Attaching ourselves to ourselves  
We're extinguished but we're still alive  
  
Misunderstood but our intention is good  
We were not questioned on our replies  
It does you no good  
Though you think that it should  
And it would given half a chance  
If there's compassion in your hearts  
Now that you've seen enough  
We've given of our best  
For god's sake you know  
Please please please please please please please please can we go home  
Is this the time or place to say goodbye  
Regardless I'll find my final cue  
We'll sneak out the back door and close it
