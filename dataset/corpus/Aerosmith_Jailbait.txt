Baby, take me, baby, take me, baby I'm drivin' maybe  
Baby take me...  
Take it or leave it on a Saturday night  
If what you see is what you get then gimme a bite  
Here comes the ladies, they're so insecure  
Leave it to the boys and the fool on the hill  
Hey baby, be no jock, no third degree  
Oh, jailbait  
Play the foolin', play the pawn  
Wake up baby I'm out the door, jailbait  
I'm believin', someone talkin  
Can't let go, got the hold, oh jailbait  
What it is that you believe  
What you got, got up your sleeve, oh  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait  
  
Take it, leave it, roll the dice  
You're hot as hell, I'm cold as ice, oh jailbait  
Tell your daddy how you do me  
Put the woodshed, do it to me, jailbait  
Whatchya see in daddy's eyes  
Check the voice, ain't no surprise  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait  
Do me, do you, tell me, would you  
See me, me too, do me, do you  
I ain't complainin bitch's brew  
Girls in love I never knew she jailbait  
Steep the chase, cold sweatin  
Stick your feet up  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait
