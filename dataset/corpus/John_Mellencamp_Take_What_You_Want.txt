Put your life on the table  
Stick your money on the line  
Create the situation there, one more time  
Your name it means nothing  
And the dreams that we live ??  
  
And now you don't care if she is, the girl from next door  
She's never been known for nothing, but a motor street whore  
You don't believe nothin' that you can't see  
And you see me as nothing, to me, yeah-ah yeah  
  
You can take what you want  
Take what you want  
Take what you want  
But just don't take it away  
You can stay if you want  
Stay if you want  
Stay if you want  
But just don't stay all day  
Cause you know it means nothing, to me  
  
Don't see much sense in lying here with you  
The sex is over now, what is there left to do  
Conversation, conversation baby, I don't talk that much  
And now I don't know when I'm gonna see you again  
I'm leaving tomorrow and this will all start again  
I hope you don't believe that you was a failure ??  
And you see it means nothin' to be a man  
  
(repeat chorus 2 times)  
But you know it means nothing  
Yeah you know it means nothing  
Yeah you know it means nothing, to me
