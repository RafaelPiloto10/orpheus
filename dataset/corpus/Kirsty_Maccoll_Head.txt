You go to my head till I'm losing my mind  
Your beautiful words stretch me out on a blanket of sky  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
You go to my head, I dream I am loved  
You're flowing through me like a river of poetry  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
So keep feeding the fire, I can't get any higher  
Till the night burns with the fire of a thousand stars  
You go to my head and I know I'm alive  
You could waken the dead with your beautiful mind  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes
