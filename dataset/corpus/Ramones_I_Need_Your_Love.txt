Went to my girlfriend's yesterday  
The only thing I wanted to say  
Is little girl won't you  
Come out and play, yeah  
  
Told that girl surrender to me  
Take your love and send it to me  
Come on baby, can't you see  
It's you, yeah, baby  
  
I need your love  
I need your love  
I need your love, tonight  
  
I need your love  
I need your love  
I need your love, tonight  
  
Ah, you took a walk with me and  
Then you took a hold of my hand  
And I knew it was going  
As planned, yeah, baby  
  
I need your love  
I need your love  
I need your love, tonight
