Ol' Joe's got a Boston whaler  
He bought in Key Biscane  
He swears since the day he's got her  
She's been nothing but a pain  
When the sun's at his back  
And the winds in his face  
It's just him and the wheel  
He wouldn't take a million for the  
Way it makes him feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Boats  
Vessels of freedom  
Harbors of heeling  
Boats  
  
Newport is where John hung his hat  
Til he lost his wife Jo  
Now forty feet of sail antique  
Is where Ol' John calls home  
He watched his life pass before his eyes  
In the middle of a hurricane  
Came out alive on the other side  
That's where "the other side" got its name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Twenty years of a landlocked job  
Was all that tom could take  
Sitting at his desk  
All alone and depressed  
Says this just cant be my fate  
Went home that night and told his wife  
You can tell all of your friends  
It's been real but it ain't been fun  
Gonna get us one of them  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Vessels of freedom  
Boats
