We can plant a seed  
And watch it grow  
Food enough to fill a table  
Running water down an overflow  
Eat as much as we are able  
But would the fruit turn ripe  
If the rains had never been?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Lord deliver us from the elements  
We at your mercy and your reverence  
Oh Lord deliver us from the elements  
We've no defense we are impotent  
  
You can travel far to distant lands  
Some so hot no man could bear  
You can conquer peaks with winds of sand  
Where Mother Nature didn't care  
Would not our world turn cold  
If the sun refused to shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when the world grows old  
And we know more than our brains can hold  
Nature will be law  
Well we're as helpless now as we've ever been before  
Would not our world turn cold  
If the sun refused to shine  
  
[Chorus]
