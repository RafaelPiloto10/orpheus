When I take you out tonight with me  
Honey, here's the way it's gonna be  
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses  
In the slickest gig you've ever seen  
  
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry  
When I take you out in the surrey  
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top  
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters  
When I drive them high steppen strutters  
Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters and their eyes will pop!  
  
The wheels are yellow, the upholstry's brown  
The dashboard's genuine leather  
With Isinglass curtains you can roll right down  
In case there's a change in the weather  
  
Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'  
Ain't no finer rig I'm a thinkin'  
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin that I'd keer to swap  
Fer that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top  
  
Would you say the fringe was made of silk?  
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk  
Has it really got a team of snow white horses?  
One's like snow, the other's more like milk  
  
All the world'll fly in a flurry  
When I take you out in the surrey  
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top  
When we hit that road hell-for-leather  
Cats and dogs will dance in the heather  
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop!  
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along  
The cows'll moo in the clover  
The river will ripple out a whispered song  
And whisper over and over  
Don't you wish you'd go on forever  
Don't you wish you'd go on forever  
Don't you wish you'd go on forever  
And you'd never stop?  
In that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top  
  
I can see the stars gettin' blurry  
When we ride back home in the surrey  
Ridin' slowly home on the surrey  
With the fringe on top  
I can feel the day gettin' older  
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder  
Noddin', droopin', close to my shoulder  
Till it falls kerplop  
  
The sun is swimming on the rim of a hill  
The moon is taking a header  
And just when I'm thinking all the earth is still  
A lark'll wake up in the meader  
  
Hush, you bird. My baby's a sleepin'  
Maybe got a dream worth a keepin'  
Whoa, you team and just keep a creepin'  
At a slow clip clop  
Don't you hurry little surrey  
With the fringe on the top
