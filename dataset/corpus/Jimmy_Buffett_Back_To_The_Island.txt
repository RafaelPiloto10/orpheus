Now the day is gone,  
And I sit alone and think of you, girl  
What can I do without you in my life?  
Wond'ring if you love me,  
Or just making a fool of me  
Well I hope you understand,  
I just had to go back to the island  
  
And watch the sun go down  
Hear the sea roll in  
I'll be thinking of you  
And how it might have been  
Hear the night bird cry  
Watch the sunset down  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island  
  
For all the sunny skies, it's rainin' in my heart  
I know down in my soul I'm really gonna miss you,  
But it had to end this way,  
With all the games we played  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island  
  
And watch the sun go down  
Hear the sea roll in  
I'll be thinking of you  
And how it might have been  
Hear the night bird cry  
Watch the sunset down  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island
