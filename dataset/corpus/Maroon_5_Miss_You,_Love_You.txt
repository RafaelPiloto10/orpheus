This has not been easy  
This has been hard  
I am scarred  
And I do not know what to do with you.  
  
Go inside, kiss your mouth with my lips  
Grab your hips, can't remember why I fell in love with this  
  
But I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no  
I don't need you tonight  
  
Who do you think you are?  
No one cares about a name without a face  
So don't go shooting up the place  
Make no mistake, your love's not real  
'Cause the love that I've got is deeper, so much deeper than you could ever
feel  
  
And I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you cant stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no  
'Cause I don't need you tonight  
  
It was really nice to know you  
But, there's nothing left to show you  
I got bills to pay, get out the way, it's time to move on  
And dinner with your boyfriend, will never be the same again  
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him  
  
I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me  
To kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again  
So oh no, 'cause I don't need you  
And I miss you, I love you  
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no  
You beg me, you ask me to  
Kiss you and hug you  
You won't be getting my affection again  
So no no, 'cause I won't need you
