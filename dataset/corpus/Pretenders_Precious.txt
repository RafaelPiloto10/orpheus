I like the way you cross the street 'cause your precious  
Moving through the Cleveland heat how precious  
Taking rides and all the kicks was so precious  
But you know I was shittin' bricks 'cause I'm precious  
  
Made me want to, made me want to, you made me make it  
Oh, you're so mean  
  
East 55th and Euclid avenue was real precious  
Hotel sterling coming into view how precious  
It's a pity that you bruised my hip 'cause I'm precious  
You shouldn't let your manners slip you're too precious  
  
Made me want to, made me want to, you made me make it  
Oh, you're so mean  
  
We went around and round and round and round and round the Shoreway  
We was gonna do it do it do it on the pavement  
Oh maybe maybe I'm gonna have a baby  
We was a duet oh we do it all night  
  
I was feeling kind of ethereal 'cause I'm precious  
I had my eye on your imperial you're so precious  
Now Howard the duck and Mr Stress both stayed  
"Trapped in a world that they never made"  
But not me baby I'm too precious  
Fuck off  
  
Made me want to, made me want to, you made me make it  
Oh, you're so mean
