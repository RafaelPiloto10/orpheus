I woke up in a pool of sweat  
At first I thought that I pissed the bed  
Honest stories in the midnight hour  
The kiss of death on the Eiffel Tower  
  
And I went down  
Like the speed of sound  
You're out of sight  
But not out of mind  
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true  
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you  
I'll spend the night living in denial  
Making paper planes just for a while  
I'll crash into you, crash into you  
If you crash in my imagination too  
  
Break a leg and you crush my heart  
I'm a mess and you're a work of art  
Got your blessings going 0 to 5  
Steal a kiss and I took a dive  
  
And I went down  
Like the speed of sound  
You're out of sight  
But not out of mind  
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true  
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you  
I'll spend the night living in denial  
Making paper planes just for a while  
I'll crash into you, crash into you  
If you crash in my imagination  
  
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true  
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck  
And I fell for you  
And I fell for you  
And I fell for you
