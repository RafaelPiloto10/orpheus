There is a wind, my Billy, and it's awful strong  
Come for you, and anyone who's helped you along.  
  
But I want to live, live, live and let the stars shine bright  
Yes, I want to live, live, live and let it on alright  
  
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall  
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go  
  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange  
  
And with this gun goes everything I want to say  
Not for you, but for anyone who takes it away  
Let it fill his life, life, life until there's nothing left  
Let it kill his wife, wife, wife until he goes to bed  
  
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall  
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go  
  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange  
There's a Northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange
