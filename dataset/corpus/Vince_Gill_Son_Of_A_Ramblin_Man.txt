Have you ever had a thing for a woman  
A thing that makes you lose your mind?  
Every time I start to think about her  
Sends shivers up and down my spine  
My daddy was a bit of a rounder  
Said these women are gonna make you go blind  
I told my old man that I'm right over here  
Like the way I see just fine  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
Well, I'm just a hillbilly gypsy  
I ain't much for settling down  
If I thought somebody might miss me  
Maybe I'd hang around  
So I better keep on drifting  
As every town just a little too small  
Ain't nothin' in the world like a woman  
I'm going to try to love them all  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
Son of a runnin' kind  
I'm the son of a ramblin' man  
I come from a long, long line
