We can take a bit of a breather.  
We can skip to the practical part.  
We can skip to the Time of Neither,  
When we're together and even  
When we're apart.  
I'll tell you a story about the Lake Fever or  
We can skip to the coital fury.  
You didn't say yes or no, neither.  
You whispered, hurry.  
  
We can take it a little bit further.  
We can stick to the after-effects part.  
'Not trying to make you a believer,  
Don't want to a lil' piece of your heart.  
Just telling you a story about the Lake fever  
Or we can skip to a neutral fury.  
You didn't say yes or no neither.  
You whispered, hurry.  
Want to be a nobody without peer.  
Want to be a thought that's never done  
Want to shake your faith in human nature  
Want to break the hearts of everyone.  
Want to be your wheezing screen door.  
Want to be your stars of Algonquin.  
Want to be your roaring floorboard.  
Want to break the hearts of everyone.  
And cause discontent until They,  
Ceasing their investigation,  
Bring back the days events,  
Good citizens and time well spent,  
Til we're talking in whispers again.  
Until we're talking in whispers again
