What to do and where to start?  
Things are falling all apart  
Trying hard to move ahead  
But keep losing ground instead  
  
Still I have to take a chance  
Putting fear and doubt aside  
Had no warning in advance  
Nothing left to do but try  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just might make it work  
I just might make it after all  
I just might rise above the hurt  
Thought I've suffered quite a fall  
But I have to get a grip  
And hold on to it like a vice  
Have to face the falling chips  
I just might make it, I just might  
  
Oh, I might have been a fool  
But its true that love is blind  
And you have broken every rule  
You've taken all that yours and mine  
And how does one go on with life?  
When your shattered so inside  
Pieces of a love gone wrong  
Well, ya pick 'em up and you move along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rise above it, I just might be stronger then I know  
Well, I might even be surprised  
I've got to get on with my life  
I just might make it  
I just might  
  
Nothin' left to do but try  
I might make it  
I just might
