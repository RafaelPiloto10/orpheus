Burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide  
Sometimes you do me, sometimes you don't  
I know, I want you all the time, but I'm  
  
Burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide  
  
I'm burning up with fever, and you're the fever inside  
I'm burning up with fever, it's something I can't hide
