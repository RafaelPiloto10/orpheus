Old man looks much younger now  
He lost his strength, respect somehow  
Look in the mirror at what I found  
It's just the past and it's over now  
  
Ooh, it's over now  
Ooh, it's over now  
  
My heart's like a wheel  
Head's just a stone  
I got my memories  
Ain't got no home  
  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, fallin' apart at the seams  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, yeah, fallin' apart at the seams  
  
Old friends seem much closer now  
They stand the test of time somehow  
Look at the winner who hit the ground  
It comes around and then it goes back down  
  
Ooh, it's over now  
Ooh, it's over now  
  
My heart's like a wheel  
Head's just a stone  
I got no memories  
Ain't got no home  
  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, fallin' apart at the seams  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, yeah, fallin' apart at the seams  
  
My heart's like a wheel  
Head's just a stone  
I got my memories  
Ain't got no home  
  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, fallin' apart at the seams  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, yeah, fallin' apart at the seams  
  
(Fallin')  
I'm fallin' fallin'  
(Fallin')  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
