I have dreamed that your arms are lovely  
And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be  
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper  
When you're close, close to me  
  
How you look in the glow of evening  
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view  
In these dreams I've loved you so  
That by now I think I know  
What it's like to be loved by you  
I will love being loved by you  
  
In these dreams I've loved you so  
That by now I think I know  
What it's like to be loved by you  
I will love being loved by you
