I got a kind-hearted woman  
Studies evil all the time  
I got a kind-hearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
You would do to quit me  
Just to have it on your mind  
  
I got a kind-hearted woman  
Do anything in this world for me  
I got a kind-hearted woman  
Do anything in this world for me  
Lord, these evil-hearted women  
Lord, they will not let me be  
  
Ain't but one thing  
Makes Mr. Johnson drink  
Swear 'bout how you treat me, baby  
I begin to think  
  
Oh, baby  
My life don't feel the same  
You break my heart  
When you call Mr. So-And-So's name  
  
She's a kind-hearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
She's a kind-hearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
You wish to quit me, baby  
Just to have it on your mind
