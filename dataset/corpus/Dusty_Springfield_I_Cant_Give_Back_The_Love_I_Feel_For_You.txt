Here's a tear  
For a souvenir  
And a dream  
Torn at the seams  
Here's a promise that you made to me of love  
It's more than I'll ever see  
And then you're free to go  
  
But I can't give back the love I feel for you  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter what I do  
Take these eyes that once could see  
Now reflections of my misery  
And happiness I thought would last  
Is now becoming just a thing of the past  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You'll have to take all of me  
  
Simply adore  
'Til the world don't go round no more  
  
Here's the ring  
That didn't mean a thing  
And letters you wrote  
That gave my young heart hope  
Take the pillow where my dreams were made  
And the mind where the thought of you stayed  
But, baby, you should know  
  
That I can't give back the love I feel for you  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter what I do  
Take these arms that held you close  
And follow up the one you need the most  
Take these hands no good to me  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
  
But I can't give back the love  
That's a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You'll have to take all of me  
  
No, I can't give back the love that I feel for you, yeah  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter, no matter what I do  
No, I can't give back the love that's a part of me, yeah  
Gonna be stuck with it no matter, no matter what I, what I do  
Gonna get stuck  
Gonna get stuck
