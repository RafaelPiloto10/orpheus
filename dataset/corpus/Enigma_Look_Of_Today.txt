Come in and see the newest things  
Feel what just money can bring  
Don't you know, that's the load of today  
  
You have a problem, I can help  
Buy it and be yourself  
'Cause you know, that's the look of today  
  
So many trends just fade away  
Before you can wear it, it's a pass a blade  
But you know, that's the look of today  
  
You are so stylish, you are so vain  
Sometimes I think you have no brain  
But you know, that's the look of today
