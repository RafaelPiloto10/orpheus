First thing I remember knowin'  
Was a lonesome whistle blowin'  
And a youngun's dream of growin' up to ride  
On a freight train leavin' town,  
Not knowin' where I's bound  
No one could change my mind but mama tried  
  
One and only rebel child  
In a family meek and mild,  
Mama seemed to know what lay in store  
In spite of all my Sunday learnin',  
For the bad I kept on turnin'  
Mama couldn't hold me anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I turned twenty one in prison  
Doin' life without parole  
No one could steer me right  
But mama tried, mama tried,  
Mama tried to raise me better  
But her pleadin' I denied,  
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried  
  
Dear old daddy, rest his soul,  
Left my mom a heavy load  
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes  
Workin' hours without rest,  
Wanted me to have the best,  
She tried to raise me right but I refused  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried
