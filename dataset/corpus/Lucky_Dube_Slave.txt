Ministers of religion  
Have visited me many times  
To talk about it  
They say to me  
I gotta leave it I gotta leave it  
It's a bad habit  
For a man  
But when I try to leave it  
My friends keep telling me  
I'm a fool amongst fools  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm a slave, a slave  
I'm a slave  
I'm a liquor slave  
I'm a slave, a slave, slave  
I'm a slave  
Just a liquor slave  
I have lost my dignity  
I had before trying  
To please everybody  
Some say to me  
Yo yo  
I look better when I'm drunk  
Some say no no no  
I look bad you know  
Sometimes I cry  
I cry but my crying  
Never helps me none  
[Chorus:]  
''cause now I am a slave, a slave  
I'm a slave  
I'm just a liquor slave  
I am a slave, a prisoner  
I'm a slave  
Just a liquor slave  
Every night when I'm  
Coming back home  
My wife gets worried  
''cause she knows  
She's got double trouble  
Coming home  
Sometimes I cry  
I cry lord I cry  
But my crying  
Never helps me  
Chorus: (till fade)
