When I was younger do much younger than today  
I never needed anybody's help in any way  
But now these days are gone I'm not so self-assured  
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the door  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please?  
(Please help me, please help me)  
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze  
And every now and then I feel so insecure  
(Every now and then so insecure)  
I know that I need you like I've never done before  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please?  
(Please help me, please help me)  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you please?  
(Please help me, please help me)
