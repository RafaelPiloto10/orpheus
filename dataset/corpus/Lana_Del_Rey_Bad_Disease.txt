Well there's something about  
Watching a crime  
That makes me want to go out  
And make it all mine  
There's something about  
Seeing your face  
That makes me want to go out  
Tonight  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
To fall into  
Yeah, it's true  
There's something about  
Seeing him die  
That puts it all into perspective and I  
Want to stay home  
Be Left alone  
Someone make my mind up  
So I don't have to decide  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
To fall into  
Yeah, I do  
There's some reason why  
I can't sit still  
Every waking moment  
  
I feel so unfulfilled  
I try to lie down  
But I don't know how  
Baby when I'm sleeping  
It feels less like I am dreaming  
Oh my god  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
It's got me down  
On my knees  
There's a fear I have  
A feeling real bad  
I'm fine now if I find out that I'm not  
I'll be sad  
I try to quiet  
Thoughts in the night  
Oh they got me thinking  
I'll be happier just drinking  
It's not true  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
It's got me down  
On my knees  
I got a bad disease  
Will no one help me please  
Not even you
