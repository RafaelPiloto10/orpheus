Good God, if your song leaves our lips  
If your work leaves our hands  
Then we will be wonderers and vagabonds  
They will stare and say how empty we are  
How the freedom we had turned us up as dead men  
  
Let us be cold, make us weak  
Let us, because we all have ears  
Let us, because we all have eyes  
How they knew that this would happen  
We're so run down  
Good God! Can you still get us home  
  
How can we still get home  
I'm not dreaming  
We're forgetting our forgiveness
