One heart  
One hand  
One woman  
One man  
To love  
To live together  
  
This time  
This place  
This lifelong embrace  
Could last  
Could be forever  
  
This time  
Endings don't apply  
No broken hearts  
No crying eyes  
This time  
No emptiness for us  
Just you and I  
In love this time  
  
To trust  
To care  
To dream and  
To dare  
Believe in  
Something better  
  
This time  
Endings don't apply  
No broken hearts  
No crying eyes  
This time  
No emptiness for us  
Just you and I  
In love this time  
  
Here because the angels smiled on us  
The angels smiled on us, this time  
Here because we're the ones who shine  
We're the ones who shine, this time
