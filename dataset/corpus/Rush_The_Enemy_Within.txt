Things crawl in the darkness  
That imagination spins  
Needles at your nerve ends  
Crawl like spiders on your skin  
Pounding in your temples  
And a surge of adrenaline  
Every muscle tense to fence the enemy within  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not giving in to security under pressure  
I'm not missing out on the promise of adventure  
I'm not giving up on implausible dreams  
Experience to extremes  
Experience to extremes...  
  
Suspicious looking stranger  
Flashes you a dangerous grin  
Shadows across your window...  
Was it only trees in the wind?  
Every breath a static charge,  
A tongue that tastes like tin  
Steely-eyed outside to hide the enemy within  
To you, is it movement or is it action?  
Is it contact or just reaction?  
And you...revolution or just resistance?  
Is it living, or just existence?  
Yeah, you! It takes a little more persistence  
To get up and go the distance  
  
[Chorus]
