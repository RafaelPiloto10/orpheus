I'm the king, y'all know that  
She the queen, came right back  
  
Yea yea  
  
(Oh remix!)  
  
Now baby girl there ain't nothin' more that I can say  
You know by now I want it more than anything  
If I walk away and just let you leave  
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody  
  
I know you want it (yea)  
I'm hesitating (why?)  
You must be crazy  
I got a man, you got a lady  
  
I know we here together  
So this must be something special  
  
Cause, you could be anywhere you wanna  
But you decided to be here with me  
No coincidence it was meant to be  
Don't be shy gon' let ya boy get in  
So you can tell all of your friends you was on the remix like  
  
[Chorus]  
In this club  
In this club  
(Ladies can I put this love up on you one time if you ain't scared, say
wassup)  
In this club  
In this club  
(They can keep watchin', I'm not stoppin', baby I don't give up)  
In this club  
In this club  
(Ladies can I put this love up on you one time)  
(If you ain't scared, say whats up)  
In this club  
In this club  
(They can keep watchin', I'm not stoppin', baby I don't give up)  
  
Baby you know I'd be down  
But we cant have all these people staring standin' around  
This right here is only for your eyes to see  
But you getting carried away saying we can do it wherever  
The way you touching me (hey)  
Like no other  
  
I'm a make you feel insane  
  
Your trying your hardest to make me give in  
But I'm a be down to give you what you wantin' if you keep it up  
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up  
And I don't want security rollin' up on us (i got ya)  
I'm not hesitating I just don't wanna rush  
  
Cause, you could be anywhere you wanna  
But you decided to be here with me  
No coincidence it was meant to be  
A mess if I mess around and let you get in  
You gon' tell all of your friends you was on this remix like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shawty want a thug, it started with a hug  
And the rest went like this  
I gave her neck a kissy kiss  
She gave my neck a kiss back  
I said we could do it like a stack  
I mean we could do it like a G  
On the couch in V.I.P  
Shawty we can get it on  
I'm like shout out to the D.J  
For playin' this song  
Girl, we could act like two damn fools  
Have everybody think we doin' a dance move  
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya  
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover girl  
And it started with a hug but now we makin' love in this club  
And we not gonna stop just because  
The people in the crowd are watching us  
Cause we don't give a damn what they say, this is  
Th-the remix baby!  
  
Come a little closer let daddy put it on ya  
Need you to know, what happens here stays here  
  
And I'm, ready and willing  
Mamas got to go  
But your standing at attention  
Keep it on the low  
  
Ain't nobody watching  
Don't worry they cant see us  
I know I got you hot now let me in  
  
You in the club or the car  
Wherever you are  
Run and tell the D-J  
Run it back on replay (hey)  
  
In this club  
In this club  
(Ladies can I put this love up on you one time if you ain't scared, say
wassup)  
In this club  
In this club  
(They can keep watchin', I'm not stoppin', baby I don't give up)
