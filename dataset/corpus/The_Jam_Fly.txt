The way that sunlight flits across your skirt,  
Makes me feel I'm from another world,  
To touch your face in the morning light.  
I hope you're always gonna be around.  
The times I struggle to understand why,  
The ancient proverbs like who am I?  
Why am I here and what have I done?  
I see the answers place my trust in you  
  
Trust in you love, be with me then,  
That's when I want you, that's when I need you the most.  
  
I want us to be like peter pan  
But dreams it seems are weightless as sand,  
And mans supposedly is made of sand  
It seems that man cannot survive at all  
  
Lets disappear love, lets fly away  
Into the demi-monde, into the twilight zone  
The times inside I spent screaming at you  
Release me please from this mortal jail  
One shrug or smile can determine my fate,  
I'm lost for days and have myself to blame  
  
Something I'm giving, is yours for the taking,  
Something like sunlight, love is a spotlight  
Love is all sorrow, still Ill meet you tomorrow  
And look forward to see you, now I can't live without you
