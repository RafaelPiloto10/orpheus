[Intro]  
Na na na (Baby)  
Na na na (You got that look on your face)  
Na na na (Like you wanna go all night)  
Na na (And I like that)  
Whoa na na na (I want you to know)  
Na na na (That I ain't got no problem)  
Na na na (Just long as we can go)  
Na na na (The next night also)  
Na na (Check it out)  
  
[Verse 1]  
For as long as you're willing girl  
Want you to know that I'm willing too  
And where you want me to go girl  
I'll be willing to go there for you  
And if you want me to take my time  
Then I'll be willing to spend the night  
All you gotta say is please stay Joe  
And I'll be staying as long as your saying  
  
[Chorus]  
More and more  
Then after that you want more and more  
Then after that more and more  
Then after that more, more  
I hear you saying more and more  
Then after that you want more and more  
Then after that more and more  
Then after that more, more  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now, if you want me to make your love come  
Then I'll be willing to do anything  
And even if you want to kiss places  
Then I'll be willing to make you scream  
Said I'm down for whatever you say  
Girl all you gotta do is speak your mind  
Want me here Monday to Monday  
The baby girl it's fine  
As long as your screaming more and more  
  
[Chorus]  
More and more  
Then after that you want more and more  
Then after that you want more and more  
Then after that more, more  
Wanna hear you saying more  
More and more  
Then after that you want more and more  
Then after that more and more  
Then after that more, more  
  
[Verse 3]  
Baby we'll be going - in the bed to the floor babe  
Then we'll be going - from the bedroom to the kitchen babe  
Girl we'll be going - from the kitchen to the dining room  
Straight to - headed straight to the living room  
I'll be taking you up - taking you up the stairs babe  
Girl I guarantee - guarantee I'm bout' to drive you crazy  
We'll be all over the house - we'll be all over the house babe  
As long as you're screaming for me, saying give me more  
  
[Chorus]  
More and more  
Then after that you want more and more  
Whoa yeah, more and more  
Then after that you're screaming more, more  
Wanna hear you saying more  
I can hear you saying more and more  
More...more and more  
More and more, more and more  
Then baby after that more, more
