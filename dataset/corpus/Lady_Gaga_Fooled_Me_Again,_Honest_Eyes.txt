See the lonely girl  
Out on the weekend  
Tryin to make it pay  
She can't relay to joy, ohh  
She tries to speak in  
Can't begin to say  
  
The boy fooled me again  
Oh oh he loves me all up  
But I'm so down today  
See the lonely girl  
In Hollywood on the weekend  
Try to make it pay  
  
It's been hard days  
Harder nights  
The rockstars girlfriend  
She lost a fight  
Well it's alright baby  
I'm nobodys mother  
But I don't want this last cigerette to be over  
  
You fooled me again  
Fooled me again  
With your  
Honest honest honest eyes  
Again fooled me again  
With your dirty mouth  
Full of honest lies  
Uh oh  
Again oh when you fooled me again Oh yeah  
You're so honest  
Full of shhh  
Honest eyes  
  
It's been two days  
Since she left home  
She dried her eyes  
Picked up her microphone  
She sang, it's alright baby  
I'm nobodys mother  
Just don't want this last  
Cigerette to be over, you know  
  
You fooled me again  
Fooled me again  
With your honest  
Honest honest eyes  
Again fooled me again  
With your dirty mouth  
Full of dirty lies  
Again oh when  
You fooled me again  
Oh yeah  
You're so honest  
Full of shhh  
Honest eyes  
  
You fooled me again  
Fooled me again  
With your honest  
Honest honest eyes  
Again, fooled me again  
With you dirty mouth  
With the rust under your eyes  
Again oh when you fooled me again Oh baby yeah  
You're so full of it  
At least your honest eyeeyeeyeeyeeyeyes  
Again honest honest

Eyes... (piano)
