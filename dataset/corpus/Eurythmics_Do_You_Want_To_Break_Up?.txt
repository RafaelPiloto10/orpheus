[Chorus:]  
Yea, oh yea, yea  
Do you want to break-up?  
  
I've got a heavy heart  
Got heart filled full of lead.  
Pocket full of heartache  
(car crash in my head).  
I've got a steady hand  
Gonna lead me to my home.  
Take me up to heaven  
(heaven's where I'm goin')  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've seen trouble  
I looked right up to it's face  
Never tried to turn away.  
And I've been sad  
I've been overjoyed  
So let me disembrace you now  
My little trouble boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You took me to the ocean  
Dropped me like a stone.  
Took me to the deep blue ocean.  
I don't wanna stay there baby  
I don't wanna swim alone  
  
[Chorus]
