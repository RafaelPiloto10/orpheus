Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
My woman done left and took all of the reasons  
That I was workin' for  
  
You better not try to stand in my way  
When I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
  
Well, I've been working in this factory  
Pretty close to 15 years  
I've seen some of my best friends women  
Drownin' in a pool of tears  
  
I've seen a lot of kinfolks dyin'  
I had a lot of bills to pay  
Lord, I'd give the shirt right often my back  
If I had the guts to say, say what?  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
My woman's done left and took all of the reasons  
That I was workin' for  
  
You better not try to stand in my way  
When I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
  
The foreman is a regular S.O.B.  
And the night boss, he's a fool  
He got himself a brand new flattop haircut  
Lord, he really thinks that's cool  
  
One of these days I'm gonna blow my top  
And that's shockin', he's gonna pay it  
Well I can't wait to see their faces  
When I get the nerve to say, say what?  
  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
My woman done left and took all of the reasons  
That I was workin' for  
  
You better not try to stand in my way  
When I'm walkin' out the door  
Take this job and shove it  
I ain't workin' here no more  
Take this job and shove it
