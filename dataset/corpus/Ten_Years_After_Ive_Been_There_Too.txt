There's someone somewhere who can't go on  
Their life is crying, it's all gone wrong  
What can I say now to help you through  
Except to say that I've been there too?  
  
Your soul is aching, you can't see it through  
But time is healing each day you do  
Keep looking forward, forget the past  
It's up to you now, don't let it last  
  
You got to wake up, shake up  
You got a right to live  
Shake up, don't break up  
You've got a lot to give  
  
You'll wake up one morning, you start to feel good  
The sun in the blue sky looks like it should  
Cause time is a healer, it's strange but it's true  
So, keep looking forward, the sun will come through  
  
You got to wake up, shake up  
You got a right to live  
Shake up, don't break up  
You've got a lot to give
