All our friends keep knocking at the door  
They've asked me out a hundred times or more  
But all I say is, "Leave me in the gloom"  
And here I stay within my lonely room  
'Cause  
  
I don't want to walk without you, Baby  
Walk without my arm about you, Baby  
I thought the day you left me behind  
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind  
But now I find that  
I don't want to walk without the sunshine  
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?  
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me  
'Cause I don't want to walk without you  
No, sire
