If you really want me to, I'll go  
It's not that I want to, but I'll go  
If you've found somebody who could love you more than me  
If you really want me to, I'll go.  
  
I don't know just what you're tryin' to do  
You told me that your love for me was true  
I don't understand my love, please tell me what to do  
If you really want me to, I'll go.  
  
I need you more than you know  
Ask me to do anything but go  
I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry  
Just can't bring myself to say goodbye.  
  
Don't tell me that it's over  
I don't wanna know  
If you really want me to  
I'll go.  
  
I need you more than you know  
Ask me to do anything but go  
I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry  
Just can't bring myself to say goodbye.  
  
Don't tell me that it's over  
I don't wanna know  
If you really want me to  
I'll go.  
  
If you really want me to, I'll go
