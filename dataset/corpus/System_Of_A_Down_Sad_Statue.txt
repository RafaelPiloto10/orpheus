Conquest to the lover, and your love to the fire,  
Romances evolving in the absolute.  
Forgiveness is the..  
The ultimate sacrifice.  
Eloquence belongs,  
To the conqueror.  
Two picture of time and space are rearranged,  
In this little piece of typical tragedy.  
  
Justified Candy!  
Brandy for the nerves,  
Eloquence belongs,  
To the conqueror.  
  
You and me will all go down in history,  
With a sad Statue of Liberty,  
And a Generation that didn't agree.
