Now, are you afraid or is the heart set on its time?  
Cold, the silence reigns do we close our blackened eyes?  
I'm calling on our testament to overcome  
I'm calling on  
It's now or never  
  
Overcome  
I'm calling on my testament to overcome  
I'm calling on  
To overcome  
  
We stand strong  
We won't break  
Side by side we overcome  
  
Now deliver us from all the hell I've seen  
Now deliver us for there's fire in these veins  
We're calling on the strengths that I've come to know  
I'm calling on  
It's now or never  
  
Overcome  
I'm calling on the strengths that I've come to know  
I'm calling on  
To overcome  
  
We stand strong  
We won't break  
Side by side we overcome
