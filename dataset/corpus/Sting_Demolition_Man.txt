Oh! Demolition, demolition  
Demolition, demolition  
Tied to the tracks and the train's fast coming  
Strapped to the wing with the engine running  
You say that this wasn't in your plan  
And don't mess around with the demolition man  
  
Tied to a chair, and the bomb is ticking  
This situation was not of your picking  
You say that this wasn't in your plan  
And don't mess around with the demolition man  
  
I'm a walking nightmare, an arsenal of doom  
I kill conversation as I walk into the room  
I'm a three line whip, I'm the sort of thing they ban  
I'm a walking disaster, I'm a demolition man  
Demolition, demolition  
Demolition, demolition  
  
You come to me like a moth to the flame  
It's love you need but I don't play that game  
'Cause you could be my greatest fan  
But I'm nobody's friend, I'm a demolition man  
  
I'm a walking nightmare, an arsenal of doom  
I kill conversation as I walk into the room  
I'm a three line whip, I'm the sort of thing they ban  
I'm a walking disaster, I'm a demolition man  
Demolition, demolition  
Demolition, demolition  
Tied to the tracks and the train's fast coming  
Strapped to the wing with the engine running  
You say that this wasn't in your plan  
And don't mess around with the demolition man  
Tied to a chair, and the bomb is ticking  
This situation was not of your picking  
You say that this wasn't in your plan  
And don't mess around with the demolition man
