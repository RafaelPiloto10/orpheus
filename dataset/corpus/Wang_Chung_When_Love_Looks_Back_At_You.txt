(jack hues)  
I feel the tension  
In your hand  
I'm on a plane to a  
Foreign land  
So far away with no  
Telephone line  
I'm flying into spring  
And leaving winter behind  
I know it'll be winter  
In your heart  
Icy stone cold winter  
All the time we're apart  
Chorus:  
As I look at you  
Looking back at me  
The wordless tears in your eyes  
What's inside of you?  
What's inside of me?  
You may not realize for days and days  
The consequences of that gaze  
When love looks back at you  
When love looks back at you  
Love is a monster  
With a need to devour  
All who fall  
In her power  
And love is a sweet thing  
With a need to caress  
Security, stability and happiness  
I'm flying, flying from  
Reality  
Where two things can be true  
Simultaneously  
Repeat chorus  
I feel a cold wind  
In the street outside  
A plane flies low  
Through the rain-filled sky  
Winter's come to get me  
And it's tearing me apart  
As cool blue summer  
Floods your open heart  
Repeat chorus
