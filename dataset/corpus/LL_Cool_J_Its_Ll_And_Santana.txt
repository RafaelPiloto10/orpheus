My 12th album launched  
Now everything is carte blanch  
There's only one God  
Victory is all I want, let's go  
  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
(You witnessin' history)  
  
To my homies who get it and get it the fast way  
To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty  
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy  
Can't wait to smash me, all they do is harass me  
  
Check it, I stay in smoke filled Benzes  
Don't see nothin', you know the whole world's tinted  
OZM so po'-po', don't sing sing  
My license and registration is good, go check it  
  
It cost to be the boss, it cost for me to floss  
Of course you see the frost, got diamonds on my neck  
I'm the big skipper, big dipper, big pot  
Big whipper, just watch, big rocks, big flipper, you dig?  
  
Big money, big spender, big getter  
Big hustler, big grinder, do you get the big picture, you dig?  
This is a club banger, trunk hopper  
Block rocker, rude boy, top shotter  
  
Ay, this is for my down South trappers  
My Midwest slabbers, you dig?  
Ay, yup, yup, this is for my East Coast slangers  
My West Coast bangers, you dig?  
  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
(You witnessin' history)  
  
To my homies who get it and get it the fast way  
To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty  
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy  
Can't wait to smash me, all they do is harass me  
  
VV9 Vanquishes never lunchin'  
Hit your honey with these languages  
(I'm about that)  
Warto, Bertaliano, Cancerilli, neck shinin'  
My diamonds purple as grape jelly  
(I'm about that)  
  
Thorough get yo' bread perspective  
Don't forget to set your Tivo, my my game's perfected  
(I'm about that)  
Rainbow ice, you confidant talk, politely  
Leave the party with your wifey, so don't invite me  
  
Bang one of them joints from New Orleans  
Juvey hustle harder, Birdman, you still boring  
(Ch-ch-choppin' the scrub with my gold rims)  
Northside  
(Ch-ch-choppin' the scrub with my gold rims)  
Southside  
You about that  
  
Hot beamin' in the Beemer  
Bounce with your honey, have you singin'  
"Have you seen her?, Have you seen her?"  
L put in work, gospel church  
  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
(You witnessin' history)  
  
To my homies who get it and get it the fast way  
To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty  
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy  
Can't wait to smash me, all they do is harass me
