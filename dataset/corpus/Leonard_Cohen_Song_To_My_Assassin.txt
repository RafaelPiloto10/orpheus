(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Michael) We were chosen, we were chosen  
Miles and miles apart  
I to love your kingdom  
You to love my heart  
  
(Angels) We were chosen  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
(Michael) The love is intermittent  
The discipline continues  
I work on your spirit  
You work on my sinews.  
  
(Angels) We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
We have fun 'cause  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
(Michael) I watch myself from where you are  
Please do not be mistaken  
The spider web you see me through  
Is the view I've always taken  
  
  
Begin the ceremony now  
That we have been preparing  
I'm tired of this marble floor  
That we have both been sharing.  
  
(Angels) Now we will be sharing  
What he has been preparing!  
  
(Girls) He's the only one  
He's the only one  
He's the riddle of the music  
He's the music of my life  
  
(Boys) Now it begins  
Now it begins  
He's the riddle of the music  
He's the music of the sacrifice  
  
(Valkyries) Messenger  
Messenger  
Our will  
Will be done  
  
(Angels) We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
(Everyone) Begin the ceremony  
Begin the sacrifice ...
