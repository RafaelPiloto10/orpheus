I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey  
Better be ready 'bout half past eight  
I mean don't be late  
Be there when the band starts playin'  
Remember when you get there honey  
Dance all over the floor  
Dance all over my shoes  
When the band plays the Jelly Roll blues  
Set 'em all alight  
  
At the darktown strutters ball  
I'll be down to get you in a push cart honey  
Better be ready 'bout half past eight  
I mean don't be late  
Be there when the band starts playin'  
  
'Member when you get there honey  
Shim sham wins them all  
Dance all over my shoes  
When the band plays the Jelly Roll's blues  
Set 'em all alight  
(At) the darktown strutters ball
