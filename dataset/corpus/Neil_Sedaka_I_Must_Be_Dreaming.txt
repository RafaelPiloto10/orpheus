All my life I've been in love with you,  
now you are here, I can't believe it's true.  
I must be dreaming  
when you say that you're in love with me.  
  
In my dreams I've kissed your lips of wine,  
now all at once I find you're really mine.  
I must be dreaming  
when you say that you're in love with me.  
  
The way that I feel  
is so heavenly, too good to be real.  
When you're next to me I'm so afraid  
that I'm fast asleep so don't wake me up,  
let me dream if I'm dreaming.  
  
Oh my love, each time I hold your hand,  
everything is just the way I planned.  
I must be dreaming  
when you say that you're in love with me
