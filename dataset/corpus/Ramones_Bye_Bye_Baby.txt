Woke up thinking bout you today  
Why does it have to be this way  
We drove each other crazy  
Bye bye babe  
Bye bye baby  
Well I guess it's over and it's done  
We had some good times and we had fun  
We drove each other crazy  
I'll always love you  
  
Bye bye baby  
Babe bye bye  
Bye bye baby  
Don't you cry  
Bye bye baby  
Babe bye bye  
Bye bye baby  
Don't you cry  
  
Woke up thinking bout you today  
Felt sad and lonely we drove each other  
Crazy I'll always love you baby  
  
Well I guess it's over and it's done  
We had some goof times-we had fun  
We drove each other crazy I'll always love you
