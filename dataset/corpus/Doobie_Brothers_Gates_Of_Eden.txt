We've been together for a long, long while  
We've seen some bad and better days.  
But heart and soul are meant for all time  
These are the keys we can't replace.  
Let's got back to Eden,  
Don't make the garden wait.  
At the gates of Eden,  
This golden key is all it takes.  
Simple things are better said in simple ways,  
I'm a simple man in love with you.  
These are the gates of Eden,  
Take my hand we'll walk on through.  
Let's got back to Eden,  
Don't make the garden wait.  
At the gates of Eden,  
This golden key is all it takes.  
Remember we're the ones who make.  
You and me  
This golden key that's what it takes.  
There's only one.  
Let's got back to Eden,  
Don't make the garden wait.  
At the gates of Eden,  
This golden key is all it takes.
