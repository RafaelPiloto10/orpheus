Atlanta was on fire and so was she the night he left her.  
Left her there to bear her pain alone, hoping soon to return.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
The roaring of th guns filled the emptiness inside her where once she felt  
the pounding of her heart.  
When he held her in his arms, tenderness they learned.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair the couldn't control.  
While the world was falling down around them, they were not concerned.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
Winter brought the snow and a rider down from Franklin with news of how the  
war had taken toll and he would not return.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair they couldn't control.  
While her world crumbled all around her, she was not concerned.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
While strolling through her mind she stumbled on an old, familiar feeling of  
how he touched her many years ago and how he made her yearn.  
Burn, Georgia, burn
