Gimme a song I know, something I can relate to  
People never criticise the way I play  
Show me the way to go, I need to make a breakthrough  
I dont think that I can wait another day  
  
Its putting years on me, Im a young man going grey  
I dont believe that I can wait another day  
  
This simple melody is all I have  
I make my living that way  
I make good friends that way  
Ooh, I really can make no sense of it, as hard as I try  
Is it something I do wrong please wont you tell me why  
People all seem to like it and no one knows about it more than i  
  
I met a man today who walked in my direction  
Stopped took off his hat and lit a cigarette  
He listened carefully to what I had been playing  
He threw a coin into my hat and walked away  
  
Always play just what they want me to  
Everybody wants the same song  
If only I could do it in my own way  
I feel such emotion, emotion, ooh, emotion, emotion, ooh  
  
Say gimme a song I know, something I can relate to  
And no one wants to criticise the way I play  
I should just say no and play them what I want to  
Cos I dont think that I can wait another day  
  
Its putting years on me, Im a young man going grey  
I dont believe that I can wait another day  
  
This simple melody is all I have  
I make my living that way  
I make good friends that way  
They feel my emotion, emotion, ooh, ooh  
Emotion, emotion, ooh
