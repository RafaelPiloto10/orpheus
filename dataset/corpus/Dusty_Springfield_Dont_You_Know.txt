You can mess around 'til the midnight hour  
To see what he's puttin' down  
So, come on, oh baby, come on  
A-come on, I love you daddy all night long  
  
A-turn your lamp down low  
A-turn your lamp down low  
A-turn your lamp down low

Turn that thing down, baby  
I love you daddy all night long
