Can you see me, are you near me?  
Can you hear me crying out for life?  
Can you tell me, where's the glory?  
Ride the days and sail the nights  
When it's over you'll find the answer  
Running in the whispering rain  
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!  
Truth of thunder, life or blame  
  
Do you see a vision of a perfect place?  
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?  
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?  
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?  
There are people laughing  
They're all laughing on you  
If only they could see what you're saying is true  
Still generals fighting, making war on the world  
Don't they know, don't they know?  
No, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
The wind in the night blows cold  
Your eyes are burning  
As the sands of our time grow old  
Anno Mundi  
  
Do you follow the path that so many tread?  
Are you among the blind so easily lead?  
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?  
Depend on another to fight it alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you see me now, can you hear me now?  
Can you tell me, where's the glory?  
Ride the days and sail the nights  
When it's over, you'll find the answer  
Runnin' in the rain  
  
There's a hope that's growing and a vision too  
All those angry hearts now reach out for you  
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?  
No longer the fool, the vision is done
