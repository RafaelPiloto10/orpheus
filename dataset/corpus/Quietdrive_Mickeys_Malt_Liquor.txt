Making sure  
I'm not thinking  
About the things  
That I've been missing today  
Making sure  
That I've been wanting  
More than just the  
Other malt today  
  
Why don't you go  
Try to think  
I know it's hard  
But why don't you just  
Try to think  
About the simple things  
That I can think about  
When I'm away  
  
And I already heard you  
And would you  
Please repeat it  
  
Nothing pushes me  
Further than you  
I hate it when you say  
I can't understand why  
Things are always  
The same way with you and  
Hopefully  
When you start to break  
I'll see you and then  
I'll start to change  
Wonder why it  
Just wasn't enough for me  
To look and see you there  
  
I already you heard you then  
Would you please repeat  
That question  
  
Head on the floor  
It's my deep sensibility  
'Cause you left me alone  
And I know that I'm wrong  
So just go get your fuck for me  
I left a scar  
On my evil personality  
So go find me a song  
That can fill me in on  
The way I think about  
  
Find a song  
Hang on  
Wait one more day  
Until you start to  
  
And I won't  
And I know  
And it's not  
What I feel  
  
And I can't  
Understand  
Just how much  
You can drink  
  
And I won't  
And I won't  
And you say  
Tell me the truth  
  
Couldn't even  
Tell you  
If I  
Wanted to  
  
And you  
Say that  
That I've had  
Enough  
  
To pass  
The point  
You did  
Before  
  
And I say  
And I won't  
And I know  
And I try  
To walk away  
  
Head on the floor  
It's my deep sensibility  
'Cause you left me alone  
And I know that I'm wrong  
So just go get your fuck for me  
You left a scar  
On my evil personality  
So go find me a song  
That can fill me in on  
The way I think about me
