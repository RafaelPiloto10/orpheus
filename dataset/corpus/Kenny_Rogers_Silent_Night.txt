Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
Round yon Virgin  
Mother and Child  
Holy Infant  
So tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent Night  
Holy night  
Shepard's quake  
Round thy head  
At the sight  
Glory streams from heaven above  
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
Son of God  
Loves pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the God of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at thy birth  
Jesus Lord at thy birth
