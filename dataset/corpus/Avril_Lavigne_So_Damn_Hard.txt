I woke up this morning  
Knowing it had to end  
That useless calling  
Don't you know it drives me round the bend  
  
If honesty speaks truth  
I've said to many lies  
I'm tied up just let me loose  
I just can't decide  
  
'cause i wanted someone to come along  
And make me feel too damn good  
But baby you're average and I've had to much of that kind  
And I don't think I should  
And I just wish  
  
[CHORUS]  
You would  
Not be  
So good  
To me  
Then I  
Wouldn't  
Guess I  
Shouldn't  
And then  
Breaking us apart  
Wouldn't be so hard  
  
Stop making  
Doing  
This  
So damn  
Hard . . .
