Everybody wanna be like you they  
Want power and praise like you but  
See there is no God like our God  
There's no one like  
Who gave their life like you and  
Who paid a price like you see  
There's only one God that's our God  
There's no one like you  
  
Who can touch like you  
Or heal us like you do  
We stumble and we stray  
Till you always get us through  
Who makes all things new  
And comes to our rescue  
Death, hell, and the grave  
They could not conquer  
  
You became just like me  
To unlock and set free  
This prisoner that was deeply  
Wounded and redeemed  
The me I could not see

Some may worship things  
But what joy do they bring  
They try and hide the stains  
But can they set us free  
See where would we be  
Without Calvary  
A king upon a tree  
So the whole world can see  
  
You became just like me  
To unlock and set free  
This prisoner that was  
Deeply wounded and redeemed  
The me I could not see

[Repeat: x2]  
Healer, father, savior  
Counselor, friend, provider  
Was is and forever  
That's why I just wanna be where you are  
I'll travel life with you no matter how far  
  
Became just like me
