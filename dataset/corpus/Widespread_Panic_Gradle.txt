I hold the flower there  
Doesn't know she's beautiful  
She wakes every morning seeing  
All the other things are beautiful  
Well she's free  
Companion to the wind  
  
Time plays a roller coaster  
Not afraid to ride itself  
Never takes adventure lightly  
Always stops enough to let us on for a ride  
  
A blind New Orleans painter man  
Doesn't get many straight lines  
Hurricane tourists poke some fun  
The angels whisper, "Pay no mind"  
No mind  
  
We don't have any pocket change  
We've danced out of all our clothes  
Want to give everything every minute  
Give it all before we go  
  
Love waves a flower there  
Doesn't know she's beautiful  
Spends every morning thinking  
All the other things are beautiful  
Well she's free  
Companion to the wind  
And the angels whisper, "Pay no mind"  
The angels whisper "Pay no mind"  
No mind  
The angels whisper "Pay no mind"
