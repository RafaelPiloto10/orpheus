Last night I lay trembling  
The moon it was low  
It was the end of love  
Of misery and woe  
  
Then suddenly above me  
Her face buried in light  
Came a vision of beauty  
All covered in white  
  
Now the bell-tower is ringing  
And the night has stole past  
O Lucy, can you hear me?  
Wherever you rest  
  
I'll love her forever  
I'll love her for all time  
I'll love her till the stars  
Fall down from the sky  
Now the bell-tower is ringing  
And I shake on the floor  
O Lucy, can you hear me?  
When I call and call  
  
Now the bell-tower is ringing  
And the moon it is high  
O Lucy, can you hear me  
When I cry and cry and cry
