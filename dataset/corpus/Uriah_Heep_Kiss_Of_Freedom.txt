Looking out at the open space,  
There's a new war beginning,  
God my head is spinning  
I had to live cause I thought it was too late,  
To far arised,  
Now I am breathing,  
Now I am seeing,  
All the love that is flowing,  
Confidence is growing,  
Riding high on the magic carpet,  
Way ahead of time.  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
Who cares about right or wrong,  
When it's down to the feeling,  
Sets my head on wheeling,  
You know it takes no warning signs,  
To know what's going on,  
And the hands,  
Are touching hands,  
When we turn to eachother,  
From the sky to the cudder,  
And untill our lifetime is coming down,  
I'm living on,  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
Looking out at the open space,  
There's a new war beginning,  
God your head is spinning,  
Flying over the wide horizon,  
Far away from time,  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,
