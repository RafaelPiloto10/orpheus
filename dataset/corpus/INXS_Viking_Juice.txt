If this was easy  
Where would I be  
I haven't said I have all the answers  
How could anyone  
  
Can't stop looking at the lights  
All around my head  
I'm missing the darker side  
Of the man  
  
He's on his knees  
Looking for the door  
But everybody's  
Giving him applause  
  
Crashed the car  
Into a wall  
But everybody's  
Calling for more  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
These days are numbered  
Counted out in loss  
Faith and spirit  
Walking hand in hand  
  
To meet a wall  
Made of sound  
But where does that sound  
Find a place today  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
Oh shadow take me  
Leave nothing still  
'cause I've not seen the miracle  
How could anyone  
  
We ask too much of the song  
To come and save our souls  
When all it's trying to do now  
Is save its own  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll
