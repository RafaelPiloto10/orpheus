Shakespeare  
Mr. three o five  
This is to them boys that be in the club  
That talk a whole lot of nothing  
  
[Chorus]  
Shhh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot  
Shh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot  
Let's ride (let's ride)  
Let's go (let's go)  
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)  
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)  
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)  
Let the beat ride (hey, hey)  
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)  
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)  
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)  
Now let the beat ride  
  
I'm rolling  
Through the backstreets  
Them boys don't applaud  
But they clap heat  
I'm in that seven forty fizzle  
With them dark boys on it low key  
Blowing that oh-ee  
Jump out They like who's he?  
I'm a snatch about two or three  
It's a Dade thing when you speak cocaine  
Slash perico, chi chi get the yayo mang  
I'm stating facts  
This where we from  
The bottom dog  
This where you come  
When you need it, want it, don't got it, in the drought  
Looking for a good price  
Hit ninety five south  
K's as in kilos  
P's as in pounds  
E as in ex,  
We got it on deck  
So show some respect  
To the cocaine capital  
Dade County bitch!  
  
Shh  
Be quiet  
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot  
I'm cool, I'm quiet  
A couple shots will put yo ass on a diet  
This is for them big boys  
Doing them big things  
In the big Chevy's  
With them big rims  
Making big noise  
With them big speakers  
And anytime they cook yay  
Its some big beakers  
Listen buddy  
We off the chain  
Now what they do, what it is, what it ain't  
Listen buddy  
We off the chain  
I suggest you hand over them thangs  
I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torres  
Ese si era mi consorte  
And I missed ya dad  
But I know you watching me  
With you in heaven  
I know ain't stopping me  
The game is mine now  
I'm building  
I'm just tryna get paper like Seinfeld  
Sign, seal, deliver, its done  
Ready or not, here I come  
Dale!  
  
[Chorus]
