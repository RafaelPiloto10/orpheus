Keep movin', movin', movin',  
Though they're disapprovin',  
Keep them dogies movin', rawhide.  
Don't try to understand 'em,  
Just rope 'em, throw, and brand 'em.  
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.  
My heart's calculatin',  
My true love will be waitin',  
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.  
  
Move 'em on, head 'em up,  
Head 'em up, move 'em on,  
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide!  
Head 'em out, ride 'em in,  
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,  
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!  
  
The ending lyrics are:  
  
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin',  
Though the streams are swollen,  
Keep them dogies rollin', rawhide.  
Through rain and wind and weather,  
Hell bent for leather,  
Wishin' my gal was by my side.  
All the things I'm missin',  
Good vittles, love and kissin',  
Are waiting at the end of my ride.  
  
Move 'em on, head 'em up,  
Head 'em up, move 'em on,  
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide!  
Head 'em out, ride 'em in,  
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,  
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!  
Rawhide!
