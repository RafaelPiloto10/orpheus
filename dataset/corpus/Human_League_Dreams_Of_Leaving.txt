Someone stopped the clock when we should have started early  
If we miss the morning meeting our lives will be in danger  
Someone's trying to stop us, there is someone in our party  
It is someone with a grudge and they won't let us reach the border  
  
Our lives are in his hands, we pay with Krugerrands  
The currency of pain to help us leaving  
While back in our homeland the ones who make a stand  
Are taken from their homes and no one hears of them again  
  
I felt I had to come here, I thought things would be better  
The situation's changed but I find I'm still resented  
Someone wants my job it is someone in this building  
Someone's spreading rumors and I don't feel I can stay here  
  
I think I'm going north and now's the time to leave  
The people there they say are good to strangers  
And if I do my best and try to settle in  
I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor  
  
I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor
