Yeah X-Raided yeah  
Yeah X-Raided yeah  
Yeah X-Raided yeah  
Goin' down ugh  
Niggas be woofin' that shit  
Nigga who the fuck is you nigga?  
Show me y'all credentials before you speak on X-Raided  
  
They say when the dogs away the cats'll play  
Now X-Raided's back up in this bitch leavin' niggas in your way  
spittin' fire  
Why you done woke up the dragon?  
Thought the loc was through so niggas startin' braggin'  
About who can fuck with X now really  
Who put Sac on the map was it you don't be silly  
Will he make the beats up? Nigga what?  
And 24th Street rip  
But even blood niggas got dubs on my shit  
And thug niggas on the south side  
Slam X-Raided loc when they out ridin'  
I'm the king of this Sac-Town scene and you peasant  
I ran shit in the past well in the future and the present  
Yo Meek attempt to diss me you's a boy  
I knew you back when you was broke wearin' Bugle Boys  
Now you got tattoos ooh! You big killa  
I won't hesitate to slap you, you still a bitch nigga  
Which nigga want to war with the hardcore  
Load up you .44 playa what cha waitin' for  
Lay a motha fucka face down  
With bullet holes in your clothes  
Decapitated and naked from the waist down  
  
Chorus:  
Who is y'all new booty ass niggas tryin' diss this nigga  
I dismiss niggas  
Endless blue sportin trigga tottin menace  
Niggas that'll disfigure niggas on my shit list (2X)  
  
Nig-niggas on my shit list  
Niggas on my shit list  
Nig-niggas on my shit list  
Niggas on my shit list  
  
I know y'all busta remember me  
Pumpin' slugs in your dome lobotomizin' your memory  
It's him or me when the wars on  
My new tapes out now the south areas' a war zone  
I send letters from the pen to my true locs  
It's time to ride my nigga go out and shoot folks  
Incarceration ain't workin'  
My body's locked but my souls on the streets lurkin'  
Perkin' niggas like Folgers, motivatin' soldiers  
To make you set look like yo set got wrecked with bulldozers  
How many marks can I take in one day?  
I'ma need a little help don't trip it's on the way, hey!  
Display your corpse in the window like a mannequin  
Why damagin'  
You got no wind and it's plain and simple  
Name 'em cripple  
Get savage when I aim my pistol  
Flame a missile through your temple till your brain gristles  
Dead issues  
  
Chorus  
  
Who is y'all, who is y'all  
Yeah  
I'm through with y'all, through with y'all  
What  
Who is y'all, who is y'all  
Yeah  
I'm through with y'all, through with y'all (2X)  
  
Nigga you can't fuck with X-Raided and you hated  
I heard that little bitch ass shit that you stated, nigga  
You can't fuck with X-Raided and you hated  
I'm the motha fuckin' bomb bout to detonate it  
I consume fake rappin' mark niggas like Brut  
Chew 'em up spit 'em out piss on 'em when I'm through  
You used to be a rip now you claim damu  
You dog niggas didn't know but nigga I do  
I knew you's a hook like a you-turn  
Put your ass in a urn cremated nigga burned  
Howard Stern couldn't clown a nigga worse than Raided  
Let loose a few verses had you cursed and faded  
Like Madusa on the loop I'm turnin' true to the stone  
Spittin' brimstone burnin' motha fuckas to bone  
If it's on I'ma show you how to end this shit  
Chrome .50 caliber "Des Eags" with extended clips bitch  
  
Chorus
