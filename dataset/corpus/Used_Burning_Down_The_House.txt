Watch out,  
You might get what you're after.  
Cool babies,  
Strange but not a stranger.  
I'm-an-or-din-a-ry-guy.  
Burning down the house.  
  
Hold tight,  
Wait till the parties over.  
Hold tight,  
We're in for nasty weather.  
There-has-got-to-be-a-way.  
Burning down the house.  
  
Here's your ticket pack your bag:  
Time for jumpin' overboard.  
Transportation is here.  
Close enough but not too far,  
Maybe you know where you are.  
Fightin' fire with fire.  
  
All wet,  
Hey you might need a raincoat.  
Shakedown,  
Dreams walking in broad daylight.  
Three-hun-dred-six-ty-five-de-grees.  
Burning down the house.  
  
It was once upon a place,  
Sometimes I listen to myself.  
Gonna come in first place.  
People on their way to work:  
Say baby what did you expect?  
Gonna burst into flame.  
  
Burning down the house.  
  
My house,  
Is out of the ordinary.  
That's right,  
Don't want to hurt nobody.  
Some-things-sure-can-knock-me-off-my-feet.  
Burning down the house.  
  
No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet.  
Everything's stuck together.  
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set.  
Fighting fire with fire.
