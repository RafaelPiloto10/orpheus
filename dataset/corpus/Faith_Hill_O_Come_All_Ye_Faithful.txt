Oh, come ye  
Oh come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him  
Born the King of angels  
Oh come, let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
God of God  
Light of light  
Lo, he abhors  
Not the virgin's womb  
Very God  
Begotten not created  
Oh come, let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Sing, choirs of angels  
Sing in exultation  
Sing, all ye citizens  
Of heaven above  
Glory to God  
In the highest  
  
Oh come  
Let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
See how the shepherds  
Summoned to his cradle  
Leaving their flocks  
Draw nigh with lowly fear  
We too will thither hend  
Our joyful footsteps  
Oh come, let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Yea, Lord, we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
Jesus  
To thee be glory given  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
Oh come  
Let us adore him  
Christ the Lord
