Can you be true?  
Can this possibly be real?  
I knew quite suddenly  
Do you sense how I feel?  
I long to hear you whisper my name  
'Til you tell me  
"My Darling, you may be my man"  
  
There will be days when you must go from my sight  
There may be nights when clouds deny us starlight  
Only time will tell us  
I hope that it speaks gently if it isn't meant to be  
Then again  
By then we might not be listening so attentively  
  
I will be there  
If the days bring torments and trials  
To close the distances only measured in miles  
I long to hold you all through the night  
And to tell you  
"My Darling, you make everything seem right"  
And then I'll hear you calling in my name  
And I'll answer  
"My Darling, I may be your man"
