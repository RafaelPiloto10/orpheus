I'm touching your face and I  
Can't get very far  
You travel a million miles  
Always in the stars  
And crossing the clouds  
A fading moon  
Whispered "It's goodbye"  
But as it starts to die  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Tell me who you are  
  
I've never believed in much  
What can I be worth ?  
I'm always a shooting star  
Falling down to earth  
I prayed in my heart  
You'd never know  
Feelings wouldn't show  
But now before you go  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Tell me who you are  
  
And crossing the clouds  
A fading moon  
Whispers "It's goodbye"  
But as it starts to die  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Show me who you are  
  
Just stay awhile
