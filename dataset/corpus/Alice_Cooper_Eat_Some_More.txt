Sixty million tons of meat  
Spoiling in the stinking heat  
Train loads full of moldy bread  
Millions will still go unfed  
  
Acres full of dying wheat  
Burning brightly at our feet  
A billion tons of ocean fish  
Some with nothing on their dish  
  
We can't see, we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic  
  
Lots of melting cheddar cheese  
Spreading it's unique disease  
Rotting veggies on the ground  
Where little hungry little kids are found  
  
Worms in fruit an ugly sight  
They're begging for a single bite  
Our garbage dumps are mountains high  
While other people sadly die  
  
We can't see we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic  
  
We can't see we're going blind  
We're just dying on the vine  
We're all sinking from the weight  
Open wide and salivate  
  
Do you like the taste?  
Stuff it in your face  
Its not nice to waste  
We're not happy 'til we're choking  
So we eat some more  
Throw up on the floor  
Go back to the store  
We're so hungry, so pathetic
