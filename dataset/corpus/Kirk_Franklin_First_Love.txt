I know they hurt you  
They saw you stumble but didn't help you  
And now they left you  
They were quick to pray but slow to move  
  
And now you're empty  
Too tired to run, you walk away  
In the night there's a voice  
If you listen He sweetly says  
  
Come back to your first love (first love, first love)  
Come back home, back where you belong  
Come (to your, to your) first love  
  
You didn't make it  
You thought your love would last forever  
Ain't it funny how a chapter can make a story change  
Cold and lonely, you never knew hurt could feel this way  
Understand there's a plan if you're patient  
Hear the savior say  
  
God is able to heal if you listen  
And He'll show you His will if you listen  
But you gotta be still and just listen, listen  
  
Come back to your first love, first love  
Come back to your first love, first love  
Come back to your first love, first love  
Come back to your first love, first love  
  
Home, home, home, I'm Home  
Home, home, home, I'm Home
