She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
They laugh they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa.  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's a good man  
  
She doesn't care just as long as she still has her friends  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
they laugh, they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa  
  
She's got a serrated edge  
  
that she moves back and forth  
  
It's such a simple machine she doesn't have to use force  
  
When she gets what she wants,  
  
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag  
  
[REPEAT]  
  
...in the freezer  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
They laugh, they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa
