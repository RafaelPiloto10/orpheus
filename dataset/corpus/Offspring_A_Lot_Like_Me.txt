How can you live?  
With nothing at all?  
  
Where do you run?  
Where do you go?  
When the holes in your truth  
Are starting to show?  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I can't get out of bed  
  
How can you take?  
Without giving back?  
How does it work?  
When it's really cracked?  
  
How does it feel...  
And no wonder  
Hearts and minds have  
been won  
How does it feel...  
And I wonder  
How it's all come undone  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I can't get out of bed  
  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
Tell me who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
How can you take?  
Without giving back?  
Who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I can't get out of bed  
  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
Tell me who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
You look a lot like me  
You look a lot you look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah
