Do you remember?  
Do you remember?  
Do you remember,  
How you were gonna stay free?  
But they had plans for you  
And things to do  
The same thing goes for me  
Well, well I never  
Saw it coming to me  
But when I turn around to look at you  
It was all that I could do  
  
To see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And I'm no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
In the beginning  
Everything was so close  
And it seems that everywhere you go  
Everybody knows  
You don't remember  
What you wanted to be  
Well they went round the class  
And you were last  
The clock was fast  
So no-one asked  
  
To see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And I'm no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
Well how long can you run?  
How far and what fun?  
How far will you run,  
To get whatever you're after?  
You're after  
You're after  
You're  
  
Well I've been looking  
And I still can't see  
How we get from A to be to see  
And feel like should be  
Well I've been running  
But I've been running around  
Now there's nothing left  
For me to do  
But sit around  
And see the view  
  
And see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And I'm no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
Do you remember?  
Do you remember?  
Do you remember?
