[Verse 1]  
They talk about money, talk about jobs  
Talk about religion and playing the odds  
Talk about freedom, talk about faith  
They talking 'bout taking my guns away  
Monkeys in suits writing laws and rules,  
They just bicker and fight  
But I ain't gotta listen to them goddamn fools 'cause I know what's right  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind  
Rock on  
  
[Verse 2]  
They talk about the greedy, talk about the poor  
They talking 'bout sending my daughter to war  
Talk about spending, talk about pay,  
They talk about defending the NSA  
Monkeys in suits writing laws and rules,  
There's no end in sight  
But I ain't gotta listen to them goddamn fools 'cause I know what's right  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind  
  
[Bridge]  
I might be crazy but I ain't no fool  
I got them red-blooded white boy blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind
