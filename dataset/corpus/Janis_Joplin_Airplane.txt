Overhead to my surprise a plane was flying by  
While I contemplated diving in the pool  
But you'd think I'd see that my thoughts have gone awry  
And I can't explain why I feel like a fool  
  
I'm singing I know I'll feel better when I look into your eyes  
And I'm feeling optimistic 'cause you're cool  
But I won't now I don't know what it takes to be a man  
And I don't know why my dick shrinks in the pool  
  
Overwhelmed by stupid fear and introspective thought  
I dismiss the accusations I'm not though  
But I think the courage displayed was unjust  
Cause I seem to have a problem getting up  
  
Singing I know I'll feel better when I look into your eyes  
And I'm feeling optimistic 'cause you're cool  
But I won't now I don't know what it takes to be a man  
And I don't know why my dick shrinks in the pool  
And I don't know why my dick shrinks in the pool  
  
Cause the world, the world's a lot more brutal when you're down
