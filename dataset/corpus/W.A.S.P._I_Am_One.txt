Demolition, mission-man  
The old boy is hating me  
I've become the one, they warned me about  
Oh he's gonna die before me  
  
Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
Is there no love, I am one  
The side you see, is the nasty me  
Oh I am one  
Love I am one  
I got something to prove  
And nothing to lose  
Oh I am one  
  
18 bloody roses, each a year that bled my soul  
18 and numb, I'm somebody's son  
Mama, look what I've become  
  
Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
Is there no love, I am one  
The side you see, is the nasty me  
Oh I am one  
Love I am one  
I got something to prove  
And nothing to lose  
Oh I am one  
  
Will he take me down to the gallows  
And kill the boy inside the man  
I'm just a rock and roll nigger  
I know he don't know what I am  
  
I don't see my face in the mirror  
And more, or understand  
Why am I the chosen one  
I'm the crimson man  
Long live, long live, long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
Is there no love, I am one  
The side you see, is the nasty me
