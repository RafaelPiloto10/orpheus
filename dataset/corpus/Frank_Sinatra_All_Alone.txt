All alone, I'm so all alone,  
There is no one else but you,  
All alone by the telephone,  
Waiting for a ring-a-ting-a-ling  
  
I'm all alone every evening,  
All alone, feeling blue  
Wondering where you are,  
And how you are,  
And if you are all alone too  
  
I wonder where you are (remember me)  
And how you are (remember me)  
And if you are (I loved you)  
All alone (I loved you)  
Too
