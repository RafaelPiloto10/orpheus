There's a Red House over yonder  
That's where my baby stays  
There's a Red house over yonder  
That's where my baby stays  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
Seems like 99 and one half days  
Now wait a minute  
I think something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this damn door  
Now wait a minute  
I think something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this fucking door  
Something bad just because of it  
My baby don't want me no more  
That's her loss, that's my gain  
I'm gonna head out back yonder, I think  
Back yonder over the hill  
I'm gonna head out back yonder, I think  
Yonder over the hill  
Over the hill  
'Cause if my baby don't  
Love me no more  
I know her sister will
