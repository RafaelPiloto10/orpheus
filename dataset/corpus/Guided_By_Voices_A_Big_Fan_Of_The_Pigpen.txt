Oh, to speak on one's feet  
To beat on one's brain  
The popular mechanics are at it again  
A tenement filled with side-show freaks  
Assembled to downgrade  
An impeccable arrangement  
By the soft-rock renegades  
And give me time to light  
A sentimental torch tonight  
I'm a big fan of the pigpen  
  
Sharper than most  
Cut with exacto  
Gone is all good  
Ex post facto  
Ba-da-ba-da  
Oh, oh.
