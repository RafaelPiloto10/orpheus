Everywhere I hear the sound of marching feet, boy  
Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy  
But what can a poor boy do  
'Cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man  
No !  
  
Hey ! Think the time is right for a palace revolution  
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution  
Well, what can a poor boy do  
'Cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band  
Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man  
No ! No ! No !  
Get down !  
  
Hey ! Said my name is called disturbance  
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants  
Well, what can a poor boy do  
'Cept to sing in a rock 'n' roll band  
Cause in sleepy London town  
There's just no place for a street fighting man  
No ! No ! No !
