Say you love me  
As much as I love you yeah  
Would you hurt me baby  
Could you do that to me yeah  
Would you lie to me baby  
'Cause the truth hurts so much more  
Would you do the things that drive me crazy  
Leave my heart still at the door?  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl  
  
(Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright) Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy  
But it sure is worth a try  
  
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool  
'Cause I love too hard  
Are there any rules baby  
If this a lesson  
Then baby teach me to behave  
Just tell me what I gotta do  
Just to stay right next to you  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl

Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah  
Ain't no need for contemplating  
Promise you won't keep me waiting  
Tell me baby, I'm all that you need
