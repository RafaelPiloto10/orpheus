Oh yeah, yeah  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine, yeah  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.  
Sunday after meetings and Saturday with a man  
Sweet potato pie when you eat from the pan  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine.  
Can you dig it?  
Dancing the latest dance and eating ribs and tips  
Digging all the new sounds and drinking gin in sips  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine, baby  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul.  
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll  
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Let's go, let's go, let's go.  
To tie up my do right (?) and tighten up my 'fro  
Wrapping myself in black and still I shine and glow  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine  
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.
