I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
Some fellows make a winning sometimes  
I never even make a gain  
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows  
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
Some fellows make a winning sometimes  
I never even make a gain  
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
