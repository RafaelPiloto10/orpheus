Monday has come around again  
I'm in the same old place  
With the same old faces always watching me  
Who knows how long I'll have to stay  
Could be a hundred years  
Of sweat and tears  
At the rate that I get paid  
  
Sometimes I slowly drift away  
From all the dull routine  
That's with me every day  
A fantasy will come to me  
Diamonds are what I really need  
Think I'll rob a store, escape the law  
And live in Italy  
  
Lately my luck has been so bad  
You know the roulette wheel's  
A crooked deal  
I'm losing all I had  
  
Soon be like a man that's on the run  
And live from day to day  
Never needing anyone  
Play hide and seek  
Throughout the week  
  
My life is full of romance  
  
Guess I'll always have to be  
Living in a fantasy  
That's the way it's got to be  
From now on  
You think I'm crazy I can see  
It's you for you, and me for me  
Living in a fantasy  
From now on
