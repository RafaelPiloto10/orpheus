I'm a long long way from home  
Mendin' a broken heart  
Runnin' away from a love gone wrong  
Tryin' to make a new start  
An old friend called me up to say  
That you've made some wedding plans  
I'm comin' home on that midnight train  
And fight for you like a man  
  
[Chorus]  
Midnight train make your whistle blow  
Engineer pour your load of coal  
Midnight train make your engine whine  
Midnight train get me home on time  
  
Oh the thought of another man holdin' you  
Is drivin' me insane  
My only chance is to ride all night  
I can't let you change your name  
Now hey conductor we can't be late  
Rollin' on down the track  
'Cause you know tomorrow's your wedding day  
I gotta win my baby back  
  
[Chorus: x2]
