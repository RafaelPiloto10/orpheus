Woke up this morning  
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain  
Like a weight that I've carried  
Been carried away, away  
  
But I know something is coming  
I don't know what it is  
But I know it's amazing, can save me  
My time is coming  
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like today I know it feels like today  
I'm sure it's the one thing that's missin'  
The one thing I'm wishin'  
Life's sacred blessin' in me  
It feels like today I know  
Feels like today  
  
You treat life like a picture  
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time  
It's not gonna wait  
Til you make up your mind, at all  
  
So while this storm is breakin'  
While there's light at the end of the tunnel  
Keep running towards it  
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache  
Soon this dam will break  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feels like, feels like your life changes  
Feels like, feels like your life changes  
  
It's the one thing that's missin'  
The one thing you're wishin'  
Life's sacred blessin'  
It feels like today I know  
  
Feels like, feels like your life changes  
Feels like, feels like your life changes
