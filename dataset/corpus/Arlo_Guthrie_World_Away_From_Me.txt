I've been keeping on the run  
I've been traveling with the sun  
I've been singing all my life and getting by  
Got to keep up with what's going on  
In this place I've been so long  
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life  
And it's so good to come home  
To a woman all alone  
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
I'll be coming home at night  
While the kids are sleeping tight  
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine  
And the kids jump out of bed  
Hello Daddy, what did you get  
Did you think of anything on down the line  
She'll be talking with her smile  
Saying, honey, wait awhile  
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
Oh the prophets and the sages  
And the wise men through the ages  
All that's written down on pages from above  
Just can't adequately describe  
What I'm feeling here inside  
It's just useless to be living without love  
And I'll take her by her hand  
Just a woman and a man  
Without trying to understand what we should be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me
