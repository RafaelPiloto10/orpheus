Shut your mouth for the winter  
If your boyfriend listens  
Were building a relation  
For the music shakes it  
  
There's that song again  
There's that song again  
There's that song again  
There's that song again...  
  
How come I could not cheat  
If you're a colorful lover  
I don't mind being one of them  
I don't mind my, big deal  
  
It's been thrown away again  
It's been thrown away again  
It's been thrown away again  
It's been thrown away again...
