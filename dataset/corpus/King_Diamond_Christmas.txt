"Come they told me  
A newborn King to see  
Our finest gifts we bring  
To lay before the King...Oh when we come"  
  
[solo: Mike]  
  
It's Christmas again.. it will never be the same  
It's Christmas again, I know  
There's only sadness in my soul  
  
It's Christmas again...It'll never be the same  
  
And as the snow is falling from the sky  
All I want to do is cry  
I got to get away from here  
I gotta get away.....?  
  
By tomorrow, I will be gone  
By tomorrow, I'll see the sun again  
But tonight...I am...The Little Drummer boy  
  
Tonight...I am...the one who will destroy  
  
The secrets never told before  
Of those who lost their souls  
There are sad things in the Darkness  
There are sad things all around us  
  
It's Christmas again.. it will never be the same  
It's Christmas again, I know  
There's only sadness in my soul  
  
It's Christmas again... It'll never be the same

"Come they told me  
A newborn King to see  
Our finest gifts we bring  
To lay before the King..."  
Now here I go  
I'm falling on my face, drum breaking on the stage  
Oh My God it's such a big disgrace  
  
It's Christmas again.. it will never be the same  
It's Christmas again, I know  
There's only sadness in my soul
