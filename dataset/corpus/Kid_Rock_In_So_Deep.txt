My ideas like highs  
They come and they go  
It seems I've forgotten what I need to know  
I feel I'm wasting time at night when I sleep  
  
Someone so shallow that's in so deep  
So I patch the holes that yet haven't appeared  
Completely blinded but things are so clear  
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother  
  
I'm content sitting at the right hand of our father  
Fuckin' A is all I got to say  
Give me peace of mind and I'll be on my way  
I was born into this world and I don't know why  
So all I'm doing's passing time before I die
