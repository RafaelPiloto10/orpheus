Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
  
I found a reason to keep livin'  
Oh, and the reason dear is you  
I found a reason to keep singin'  
Wow-woh, and the reason dear is you  
  
Oh, I do believe  
if you don't like things you leave  
For someplace you've never  
gone before  
  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
  
Honey, I found a reason to keep livin'  
And you know the reason dear it's you  
And I've walked down life's lonely highways  
hand in hand with myself  
And I realize  
how many paths have crossed between us  
  
Oh, I do believe  
you are what you perceive  
What comes is better than what  
came before  
  
Oh, I do believe  
you are what you perceive  
What comes is better than what  
came before  
  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba  
  
And you better come  
come-come, come to me  
come-come, come to me, better come  
Come-come, come to me  
Ba-ba-ba-ba  
Ba
