If you try to get wit me  
Pull a four on the fifty  
Fuck yo monkey ass up like Bobby did Whitney  
Trigger fingers get itchy  
When niggaz get bitchy  
And they need they story told on Jerry or Ricki  
Well you're green and you're iffy  
I'm clean and I'm spiffy  
If they lock me up today I'll be back in a jiffy  
All my niggaz that's wit me  
All my bitches are picky  
To ride around that's right on time  
Bitch you know it's tricky  
Take a hit of the sticky  
Everybody get tipsy  
When we hittin' that whiskey  
All my niggaz get pissy  
Don't fuck wit no sissy  
All we bumpin' is missy  
If you know where I am motherfucker come get me  
I'm a man out of mickey  
All my niggaz love hickies  
That don't go away til ya well in your sixties  
All I'm wearin' is dickies  
Don't try to evict me  
When we come to Atlanta we gon' re-open Nickies  
  
I'm a gangsta rap teacher, nigga you better know it  
It's the Don Gotti Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet  
Sit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes  
My flow is razor sharp I'm comin' straight for ya throat  
With that west coast gang bang  
Watch him when his chain hang  
East coast down south  
Niggaz do the same thang  
Throw up ya dubs like Wu-Tang who bang  
Harder than that nigga barrelin' thru ya hood wit two chains  
Swangin' like he's nuts, 'cuz he don't give a fuck  
I know nigga that ain't bangin' in no khaki's or some chucks  
It's that westside, connected with that nigga who flow so wreckless  
He spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I bet this  
Motherfuckin' coast ain't got shit after me  
Ain't have shit before Cube except a Dub C  
The mack circle is back with mad purple in fact  
I'm 'bout to join the Lynch mob that's me squirtin' the mack
