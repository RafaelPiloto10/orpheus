(deciphering the song we have yet to see.  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness  
The chilly winter nights bring the scarves from the drawer  
A crowd starts to gather on paving stone squares  
Teeth start to chatter as the staff leave the store  
And daughters meet mothers and fathers meet sons  
It's too dark to walk home without anyone  
The shopping precinct's closed, it's like a graveyard  
The chain falls through the spokes as I unlock my bike  
I cycle to the pub where I meet with my friends  
And I know that it's love as she pours me my pint  
And strangers meet strangers and friends share their lives  
I look at her again and feel butterflies  
I pull the pillow to my side  
And I imagine it is her  
As I slip into the night,  
I know what I prefer  
But I hope and I pray that one day she will say  
That's it's true  
I can't live without loving you  
Now there's no one around I push the bike home  
The rain's a lovely sound as it runs down the path  
There's our lights in the road, they amber the night  
And there's nobody home, so I soak in the bath  
And bubbles meet bubbles as they become one  
I think about the world and what I have done  
I pull the pillow to my side etc  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness (repeat to fade)
