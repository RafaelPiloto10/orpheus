You are the one who makes me happy  
When everything else turns to gray  
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings  
And sense me out into the day  
  
You are the crowd that sits quiet  
Listening to me  
And all the mad sense I make  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And sense it's all true  
How could anyone be more to me than you  
  
Sorry if sometimes I look past you  
There's no one beyond your eyes  
Inside my head wheels are turning  
Hey sometimes I'm not so wise  
  
You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration  
Just like the old love song goes  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And sense it's all true  
How could anyone be more to me than you
