Snow  
It won't be long before we'll all be there with snow  
Snow  
I want to wash my hands, my face and hair with snow  
  
Snow  
I long to clear a path and lift a spade of snow  
Snow  
Oh, to see a great big man entirely made of snow  
  
Where it's snowing  
All winter through  
That's where I want to be  
Snowball throwing  
That's what I'll do  
How I'm longing to ski  
Through the snow-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Those glist'ning houses that seem to be built of snow  
Snow  
Oh, to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow  
  
What is Christmas with no snow  
No white Christmas with no snow  
Snow  
  
I'll soon be there with snow  
I'll wash my hair with snow  
And with a spade of snow  
I'll build a man that's made of snow  
I'd love to stay up with you but I recommend a little shuteye  
Go to sleep  
And dream  
Of snow
