She's the one, that's what I thought  
When our love had just begun  
But times have changed  
And I's better go  
Because it's gonna be too late  
And all my love will turn to hate  
You've always known  
That music is my life  
And I live just for Rock' n 'Roll  
No one can make me change my mind  
'Cause I just want to live my life  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight  
  
You're still the one  
But you've shown me  
How independent you've become  
Don't tell me you need, you need me  
To be your ever faithful strong lovin' man  
Don't tell me I'm wrong  
I gotta go my way  
And you'll see, where I belong  
You live your life and I live mine  
I bet, you will turn out fine  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight  
  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight  
  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight
