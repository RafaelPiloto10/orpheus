I'm not down with the republic party or the democratic party  
I represent the gangsta party  
The gangsta party, yes sir

Killah coast is my home rich rollin' on my throne with my blue bandana on my
neck

The one they all wanna come and see, hoes lovin' me, you niggers wanna be
(Snoop, Snoop)  
Even blood fuck occurs, I hate the club, they're all showing me love,

So what I locus, Long Beach east side is the place to be  
Skinny side, low head honcho, filling up our Wop gang  
And you already know what it is  
I ain't no gang bang rookie, trying to overlook me  
Long Beach, east side, skin saga rolo, at the bottom pat sun  
I'm shopping on the set Leslie Howe for endo  
And she hit me up for some rainbow  
If you dare know about my get-go  
Dee, keen G young Pilot, fuck with  
Old G what a young men, thirteen got a head like an old man  
One daddy who I fuck with  
When I was young my mum said I looked like Snoop  
And we ride in the coupe and the top back Doggy style, banging our muff  
Two, one what it do, I got a other chick, I'm a take her to my dick, homey  
And I'm thinking crystal clear, diamonds on my dick shiny like a chandelier  
Like, even blood we're cut, damnI can't believe in the club with it  
(Snoop, Snoop, Snoop)  
Young Pilot, young Pilot
