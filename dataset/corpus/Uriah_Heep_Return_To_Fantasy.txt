Searching every day  
Looking every way  
Trying to make a connection  
To find a piece of the action  
Like a hungry poet  
Who doesn't know  
He is close to perfection  
Choice is the question  
  
Moonlight night  
After moonlight night  
Side by side  
They will see us ride  
But if they cared to look  
Then they would see  
It's our return to fantasy  
Fantasy, fantasy  
  
Can you understand  
That in every man  
There's a need to unwind  
That's never been defined  
Somewhere deep within  
There's another being  
You are somehow abusing  
By the person you're using  
  
Moonlight night  
After moonlight night  
Side by side  
They will see us ride  
But if they cared to look  
Then they would see  
It's just our return to fantasy  
Fantasy, fantasy  
  
Traveling faster than lightening  
Closer than ever before  
We can go on for you  
And take you nearer to  
The legend of mystery  
From the beginning of time  
Dreaming time dreaming  
We can return to  
The land of the good and the kind  
Time dreaming time dreaming  
Why don't you come to our party  
And open your minds  
  
In another place  
There's a newer face  
Like an unfinished painting  
Your creator is waiting  
The brush and pen describe  
What it is inside  
That will set your mind thinking  
While the others are sinking
