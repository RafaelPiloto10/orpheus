Watching the stars on Primrose Hill  
The moon is high and the city is still  
I came here to escape the chill  
Of your cold shoulder  
  
Evil sometimes the things you say  
If you really wish I would just go away  
Then why do you cry  
Like a little child  
  
All your world that's what you say I am  
I'm working so hard to be a better man  
You know I'll never ever lie, never play those games with my mind  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold, so cold inside  
Remember that fight in Amsterdam  
When I made you cry 'cause I know I can?  
  
You could not escape the chill  
Of my cold, cold shoulder  
All your world that's what you say I am  
I'm working so hard to be a better man  
  
You know I'll never ever lie, never play those games with my mind  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold  
  
I know you're hurting inside  
Want someone to pay for the tears you cry  
Ain't gonna be me, not this time  
Never lie, never play those games with my mind  
  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold, so cold inside  
Never play those games with my mind  
  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold, so cold inside  
I know you're hurting  
  
I'm hurting too  
But I don't want to hurt you  
'Cause I love you  
But my head says 'not this time'
