I'm gonna call up my boss and tell him I'm ill  
Gonna tell him I'm home, with the fever and chills  
I don't usually lie but for your sweet love I will, I need it so  
  
We won't be disturbed, the phone's off the hook  
And when it comes to lovin' woman, you wrote the book  
And I just saw that 'I want you' look and that's all it took, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Well, the boys at the plant are punching the clock  
If they could see us darlin', oh, what a shock  
They'd do the same if they had what I got  
So please don't stop, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today
