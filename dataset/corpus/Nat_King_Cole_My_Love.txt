The moon comes out and the sun goes down  
Everything in love goes round and round  
But my love goes on and on, my love goes on and on  
Nothing in the world can change my love for you  
  
Like the cat told the bird on the window sill  
I'll be lovin' you from now until  
My love goes on and on, my love goes on and on  
Nothing' in the world can change my love for you  
  
You keep my heart jumpin' a flip-flop  
You keep me feelin' a tip-top  
When everything else is long gone  
My love will still be goin' strong  
  
You make me mad for a little while  
But I get so glad when I see you smile  
My love goes on and on, my love goes on and on  
Nothin' in the world can change my love for you  
  
My love goes on and on, my love goes on and on  
  
You keep my heart jumpin' a flip-flop  
You keep me feelin' a tip-top  
When everything else is long gone  
My love will still be goin' strong  
  
You make me mad for a little while  
But I get so glad when I see you smile  
My love a goes on and on, my love a goes on and on  
Nothin' in the world can change my love for you  
Nothin' in the world a can change my love for you, my love
