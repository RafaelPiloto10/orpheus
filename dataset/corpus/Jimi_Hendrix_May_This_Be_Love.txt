Waterfall  
Nothing can harm me at all  
my worries seem so very small  
with my waterfall  
  
I can see my rainbow calling me yeah  
through the misty breeze of my waterfall  
  
Some people say day-Dreaming is  
for the all the lazy minded fools with nothing else to do  
  
So let them laugh laugh at me  
so just as long as I have you to see me through  
I have nothing to lose long as I have you  
  
Waterfall  
Don't ever change your ways  
fall with we for A million days  
oh my waterfall
