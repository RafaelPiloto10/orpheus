This is for the lovers,  
Strictly for the lovers, year  
If you want some one you want to get close to,  
Then you get close to this  
  
Woo, just to be close to ya  
  
Yo, drop the verse  
  
Like a flower to a tree, that how close I want to be,  
To your heart (baby to your heart, heart)  
Like the stars to the night, and daytime is to light  
Will never part (will never part)  
I want you to be the only thing that I see  
'cause I believe it's our destiny  
  
[Chorus]  
Just to be close, just to be close  
It's the only thing that I want to do  
Just to be close, just to be close  
Just to be close to ya (closer to ya)  
Just to be close  
  
So lonely is the night, without you to hold me tight  
(I want to hold ya closer)  
I need ya (baby hold me closer, closer)  
My life will mean nothing without the joy you bring  
To me, you know, you know, you know  
There were never (never be) no one else for me  
You were like the dream that become reality  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to give you all my love (all my love)  
I gonna give it to you, I gonna give to you  
All me love (all my love) I gonna give it to you, I gonna give to you  
Give you everything you need (all my love I gonna give it to you)  
I'm gonna it to you all you want (to be close to you) close to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be without your side  
I've never never never ever let you go  
Just want to be close  
I don't want to be without  
You girl never never never ever let you go  
Just to be close  
Never be no one else for me you were like a dream that become reality  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just want to be close, to you
