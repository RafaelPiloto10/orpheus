Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby  
They stand around and stare, no matter where she goes  
Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby  
They'd like to buy her things, like diamond rings and clothes  
I really had to overcome a lot of competition  
And I'm not telling how I reached my number one position  
But four ninety nine are wasting their time with my baby  
And here's the reason why they have my sympathy  
'Cause, baby, she got eyes for me  
Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby  
They stand around and stare, no matter where she goes  
Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby  
They'd like to buy her things, like diamond rings and clothes  
I really had to overcome a gang of competition  
And I'm not telling how I reached my number one position  
But four ninety nine and they are wasting their time with my baby  
And here's the reason why they have my sympathy  
'Cause baby has two eyes, great big bright two eyes  
Baby just has eyes for me, my baby just has eyes for me
