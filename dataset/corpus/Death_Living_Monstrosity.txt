Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction  
With life comes pain withdrawals and deformation  
Breaking the mould human appearance  
Contorting bodies with chemical interference  
  
The guilty one, innocent she now cries  
A life of hell, better off to die  
Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain  
Being born addicted to cocaine  
  
Living monstrosity  
A freak for life they'll always be  
Never knowing love or hate  
Only pain the drug create  
  
Some say she's naive, she's a stupid bitch  
Some say to forgive, guilty she should die  
  
The beginning of the end begins at birth  
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh  
An example we should make out of theses creators of misfortune  
A serious crime that should not be forgiven  
  
The guilty one, innocent she now cries  
A life of hell, better off to die  
Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain  
Being born addicted to cocaine
