Gold and silver is the autumn  
Soft and tender are her skies  
Yes and no are the answers  
Written in my true love's eyes  
  
Autumn's leaving and winter is coming  
I think that I'll be moving along  
I've got to leave her and find another  
I've got to sing my heart's true song  
  
Round and round the burning circle  
All the seasons, one, two and three  
Autumn leaves and then the winter  
Spring is born and wanders free  
  
Gold and silver bounds my heart on  
All too soon they fade and die  
And then I'd know  
There'd be no others  
Milk and honey  
Where they lie
