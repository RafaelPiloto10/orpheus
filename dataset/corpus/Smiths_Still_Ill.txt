I decree today that life  
Is simply taking and not giving  
England is mine - it owes me a living  
But ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye  
Oh, ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye  
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore  
No, we cannot cling to those dreams  
  
Does the body rule the mind  
Or does the mind rule the body?  
I dunno  
  
Under the iron bridge we kissed  
And although I ended up with sore lips  
It just wasn't like the old days anymore  
No, it wasn't like those days  
Am I still ill?  
Oh  
Am I still ill?  
Oh  
  
Does the body rule the mind  
Or does the mind rule the body?  
I dunno  
  
Ask me why, and I'll die  
Oh, ask me why, and I'll die  
And if you must, go to work - tomorrow  
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother  
For there are brighter sides to life  
And I should know, because I've seen them  
But not very often  
Under the iron bridge we kissed  
And although I ended up with sore lips  
It just wasn't like the old days anymore  
No, it wasn't like those days  
Am I still ill?  
Oh  
Oh, am I still ill?  
Oh
