[Verse:]  
Do you know how it feels  
To have come so far  
Just to get shot down  
And left to drown?  
'Cause I've come so far  
And I need you now  
Yes, it's true...  
So pull me through  
  
And get me out of this.  
  
[Pre-chorus 1:]  
I never hurt you  
Baby, tell me, is it what I didn't do?  
I'd never hurt you, yeah  
Without you, I'm...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Asphyxiated  
I'm dying, please give me one last breath oh,  
To pull me through it  
Please, just give me one last breath while  
I'm contemplating, and I'm wondering:  
If you gave me one last breath, oh,  
Would I suffocate again?  
  
...I'm suffocating.  
  
[Pre-chorus 2:]  
You were my everything  
Everything that I ever wanted  
But you've got me wounded again...  
Without you, I'm...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
So are you gonna watch me die  
Or just walk on by?  
Don't tell me you don't need me  
Cause I know you do.  
  
Give me one last try  
And I'll get it right  
I swear I'll get it right  
This time...  
  
[Chorus]
