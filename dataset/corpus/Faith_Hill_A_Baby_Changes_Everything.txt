Teenage girl, much too young  
Unprepared for what's to come  
A baby changes everything  
  
Not a ring  
On her hand  
All her dreams and all her plans  
A baby changes everything [Repeat: x2]  
  
The man she loves she's never touched  
How will she Keep his trust  
A baby changes everything [Repeat: x2]  
  
And she cries, oh she cries  
  
She has to leave, go far away  
Heaven knows she can't stay  
A baby changes everything  
  
She can feel it's coming soon  
There's no place, there's no room  
A baby changes everything [Repeat: x2]  
  
And she cries and she cries O she cries  
  
Shepherds own they got their  
Star shines down  
  
Choir of Angels say  
Glory to the newborn king  
A baby changes everything [Repeat: x2]  
Everything, everything, every day  
Hallelujah [Repeat: x4]  
  
My whole life is turned around  
I was lost and now I'm found  
A baby changes everything [Repeat: x2]
