You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
She knows him inside out  
The things he dreams about  
And makes them come true when she can  
She knows all of his faults  
The demons he's fought  
With nothin' but his hard-workin' hands  
  
And he calls out her name  
In passion and pain  
She makes him stronger each time  
Yeah it's there on her lips  
And her fingertips  
That she's with him to 'til end of the line  
  
(Yeah) you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves (yes you can)  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does and she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
He loves  
He always loves
