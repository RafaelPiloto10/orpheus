I've seen your picture  
Your name in lights above it  
This is your big debut  
It's like a dream come true  
And when you smile for the camera  
I know they're love it  
  
I got your pin shot  
I keep it with your letter  
Done up in blueprint blue  
It sure looks good on you  
So won't you smile for the camera  
I know I'll love you better  
  
Peg  
It will come back to you  
Peg  
It will come back to you  
Then the shutter falls  
You see it all in 3-D  
It's your favorite foreign movie
