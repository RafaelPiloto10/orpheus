If you kissed the sun right out of the sky for me  
And if you told me all the lies that I deserve  
And if you laid all night in the rain for me  
  
Well, I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
I couldn't love you more  
  
And if you loved me till my eyes gave no more shine for you  
If you walked beside me all the long way home  
And if you wasted all of your time on me  
  
Well, I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
  
And if you gave me all the things, I'd never ask of you  
And if you showed me all the ways you have to cry  
And if you laid all night in the rain for me  
  
I couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more  
Just couldn't love you more
