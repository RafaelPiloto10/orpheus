Hickory Grove, wait for me  
I'm just as poor as a man can be.  
Hickory Grove, wait for me  
I'm just as blind as the other men  
That see.  
  
Hickory Grove, make the sun  
Rise slower I don't have much time.  
Hickory Grove, watch me run  
Down through the years of my prime.  
  
Lady Luck, play your hand  
I've got a life for you to play with  
Hickory Grove, you will stand...  
I've got a dream that I can stay with.
