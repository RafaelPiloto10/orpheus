We are gifted to be scared  
We need stacks of weapons to survive  
Marching for religious reasons  
Marching on and on to save our lives  
  
When will it have an end  
How can we live in harmony  
How can I understand the way things gonna be  
  
Take me far away and set my spirit higher  
Take me far away and set my soul on fire  
And I pretend to understand  
Whatever comes I'll be there for you  
  
Genetically influenced  
Is our harvest how far can we go  
Someday my own clone will come  
Take away my wife how could I know  
  
Sometimes I feel so sad  
Sometimes I could just go insane  
But when I see your smile it makes me strong again  
  
Take me far away and set my spirit higher  
Take me far away and set my soul on fire  
And I pretend to understand  
Whatever comes I'll be there for you
