I never had a chance  
I thought you cared for me  
But now I see I never had a chance  
I never had a chance  
Though you never told me so somehow I know  
I never had a chance  
I knew we would have to part  
For I could always reach your lips  
But I could never reach your heart  
My dreams about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat but more than that  
I never had a chance  
My dreams about romance  
Ended in a friendly chat but more than that  
I never had a chance
