Jive talkin'  
Oh, you're no good  
Jive talkin'  
So misunderstood  
  
Jive talkin'  
You'll never know how  
Jive talkin'  
You'll never know now  
  
Ooh baby, you just don't know  
What you've done to me  
You've tried, you'll never know  
Tryin' to take away my energy  
  
With all your jive talkin'  
You're tellin' a lie  
Jive talkin'  
You wear a disguise  
  
Jive talkin'  
You know you're no good  
You're just a jive talkin'  
So misunderstood  
  
Oh baby, you'll never know just  
What you've done to me  
Only tryin', you're only tryin' to  
Tryin' to take away my energy  
  
With all your jive talkin'  
Jive talkin'  
Just a dirty, dirty liar  
Jive talkin'  
You know I love you  
Jive talkin'  
You'll never be true  
Jive talkin'
