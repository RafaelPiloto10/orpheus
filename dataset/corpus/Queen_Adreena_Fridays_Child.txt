(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
........ My daughter,  
Take her from the water.......  
I laid her down.......  
For she drinks from the river,  
I pray forgive her,  
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.  
Girl a string of lovers,  
Found dead beneath her,  
They pulled her down,  
For she drinks from the river,  
I pray forgive her,  
Don't let her drown,  
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.  
A prayer for the mind who's thread bare,  
For those who dare to tread there,  
Now the sun is gone,  
Oh I pray for my daughter,  
I pray support her,  
Don't let her drown,  
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
