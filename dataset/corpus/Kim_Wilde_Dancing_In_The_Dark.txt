We were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
He stepped into the night  
With his heart open wide  
I was standing there  
With nowhere left to hide  
He looked to me like a shadow  
Moving in the night  
Then he took a hold of my hand  
In the soft moonlight  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
I could hear his heartbeat  
Pounding in the night  
I could feel his body  
Starting to be kind  
With his soft red lips  
Made up my mind  
His soothing kiss  
Was all I desired  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
We kissed and touched  
But it wasn't enough  
To stop this wheel of fire  
One step at a time  
And I knew he was mine  
We were lost in the heat of desire  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
No way  
No way at all  
To stop us moving closer  
Each look in his eyes  
Made my heart beat in time  
Over and over and over and over  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start  
  
And we were dancing  
Dancing in the dark  
Sweet romancing  
Something's gonna start
