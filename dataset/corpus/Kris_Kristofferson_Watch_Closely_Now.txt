Watch closely now  
You'll observe a curious exchange of energy  
Are you a figment of my imagination  
Or I one of yours?  
  
Watch closely now, are you watching me now?  
Your eyes are like fingers  
They're touching my body and arousing my soul  
Ridin' the passion arising inside me  
How high can I go?  
You're comin' with me girl  
I'm gonna show you how  
When it's scary, don't look down  
  
Watch closely now, are you watching me now?  
I see the hunger arise in your eyes and it's a-urging me on  
Higher and harder and faster and farther  
Than I've ever gone  
You're comin' closer lady  
Don't ya leave me now  
We're gonna make it  
Don't look down  
  
Maybe I'm takin' me too many chances  
With no net at all  
Maybe I'll teach you at least that  
You've got to be free when you fall  
  
Watch closely now, are you watching me now?  
I'm the master magician, who's setting you free  
From the lies you've been told  
When they're breaking your back  
Bring your last straw to me  
I turn straw into gold  
I'm gonna need you later  
When you're not around  
But I can take it  
Don't look down  
  
Watch closely now  
Are you watching me now?
