It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done  
To be so in love with you and so alone  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and I will follow too  
It's long been on my mind you know it's been a long long time  
I'll try to find a way that I can make you understand  
The way I feel about you just how much I need you  
To be there where I can talk to you when there's no one else around  
Follow me where I go...  
You see I'd like to share my life with you and show you things I've seen  
Places where I'm going to places where I've been  
To have you there beside me and never feel alone  
And all the time that you're with me then we will be at home  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way take my hand and I will follow too
