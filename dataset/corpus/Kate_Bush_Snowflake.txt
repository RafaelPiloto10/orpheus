I was born in a cloud  
Now I am falling.  
I want you to catch me.  
Look up and you'll see me.  
  
You know you can hear me.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
We're over a forest.  
There's millions of snowflakes.  
  
We're dancing.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling and I'll find you.  
I am ice and dust. I am sky.  
I can see horses wading through snowdrifts.  
  
My broken hearts, my fabulous dances.  
My fleeting song, fleeting.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
My broken hearts, my fabulous dance.  
  
My fleeting song.  
My twist and shout.  
I am ice and dust and light. I am sky and here.  
I can hear people.  
  
I think you are near me now.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
We're over a forest.  
It's midnight at Christmas.  
  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
I think I can see you.  
There's your long, white neck.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
  
Now I am falling.  
Look up and you'll see me.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
In a moment or two.  
  
I'll be with you.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
Be ready to catch me.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.
