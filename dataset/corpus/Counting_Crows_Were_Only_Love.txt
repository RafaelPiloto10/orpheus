Who built the ball that is this earth?  
Gave me life, and water for my thirst.  
Home for a heart till death from birth  
And we're only love, at it's best or worst.  
Love calling your name  
I will live on  
Calling your name  
Who wrote the pages of our lives?  
In black and white, and taught me wrong from right  
It's your heart that held you tight  
But we're only love  
Spin me around and round and round  
Love calling your name  
I will live on  
Calling your name  
And the world seems like my enemy  
The waterfall of frowns  
And the wave of life will capture me  
And I'm falling down upon love  
C'mon now darling  
I'm falling falling down on love  
I'm falling down, falling down on love  
I'm falling down on love  
[Chorus:]
