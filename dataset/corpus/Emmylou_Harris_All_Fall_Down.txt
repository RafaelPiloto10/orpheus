Castles tall  
Houses small  
Left alone  
All fall down  
  
Dreams so clear  
Disappear  
Without a sound  
All fall down  
  
Lovers meet  
Lovers quarrel  
Lonely boy  
Lonely girl  
  
I lost him  
And I have found  
Dreams like walls  
All fall down  
  
All fall down  
All fall down  
She don't want me to call her  
And she's told me not to bother comin' round  
All fall down  
All fall down  
When you take a love for granted like I did  
You're bound too see it all fall down  
  
Castles tall  
Houses small  
Left alone  
All fall down  
  
Dreams so clear  
Disappear  
Without a sound  
All fall down
