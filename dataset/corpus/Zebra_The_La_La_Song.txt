I won't be the fool in my life  
I won't change the rules in my life  
In all your silence  
I knew it all along  
You haven't got the sense to know  
What's right from what is wrong  
And I really haven't got the time to  
Tell you about the things that are absurd  
  
Don't fear tomorrow  
Don't fear tomorrow  
  
I won't play the fool to your knife, to your knife  
You can't change the tune in my sight, in my life  
With all you science, I knew it all along  
You haven't got the nerve to write the words  
Within this song  
And you really haven't got the time to tell  
Me why you really are  
You really haven't got the time to tell me  
Why you really are  
You really haven't got the time to tell me  
Why you really are  
  
Don't fear tomorrow  
Don't fear tomorrow
