Lord I come  
Lord I thank you  
For your love  
For this grace divine  
Love and mercy  
Undeserving  
You gave it all  
The greatest sacrifice  
  
You were wounded  
For my sin  
You were bruised  
For all my shame  
You were broken  
For my healing  
Only by the cross  
I am saved  
  
You're the mender of the broken  
To every outcast  
A friend and comforter  
  
I come boldly to your presence  
Lord I bow before your throne  
You're my healer  
My redeemer  
You're my hope, my life, my heart  
  
You hear the cry of the broken  
You hear the cry of the broken  
You hear the cry of the broken  
You answer the cry of the broken  
You answer the cry of the broken  
You answer the cry of the broken
