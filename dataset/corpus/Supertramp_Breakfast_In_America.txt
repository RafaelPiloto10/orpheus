Take a look at my girlfriend  
She's the only one I got  
Not much of a girlfriend  
Never seem to get a lot  
  
Take a jumbo across the water  
Like to see America  
See the girls in California  
I'm hoping it's going to come true  
But there's not a lot I can do  
  
Could we have kippers for breakfast  
Mummy dear, Mummy dear  
They got to have 'em in Texas  
Cos everyone's a millionaire  
  
I'm a winner, I'm a sinner  
Do you want my autograph  
I'm a loser, what a joker  
I'm playing my jokes upon you  
While there's nothing better to do  
  
Don't you look at my girlfriend  
She's the only one I got  
Not much of a girlfriend  
Never seem to get a lot  
  
Take a jumbo cross the water  
Like to see America  
See the girls in California  
I'm hoping it's going to come true  
But there's not a lot I can do
