Like a horse and rider (Like a horse and rider)  
Like a midnight flyer (Like a midnight flyer)  
I'm coming to you, coming to you  
And there's nothing pretty baby that I wouldn't rather do  
Look outside your window, look into the night  
Hold on to your heart now darling, I'll be there in the morning light
