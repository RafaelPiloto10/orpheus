Here comes that feeling again  
You're always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when we're older  
We'll go back to being friends  
But oh,  
Here comes that feeling again  
I better get away from all these  
Oh-so-familar places that I see  
I gotta find a place without so many  
Familar faces in front of me  
When I wake up in the morning  
And there's no one there but me  
I'll remember  
I'll remember  
Here comes that feeling again  
You're always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when we're older  
We'll go back to being friends  
But oh,  
Here comes that feeling again  
Gotta keep on moving through these  
Distances between yesterday and now  
As if all this riding on these white lines  
Will make them fade away somehow  
Do you try not to remember  
The things you cannot forget  
And are you sorry for what hasn't happened yet  
I stare at everyone  
It makes me wonder why  
I can't see anyone but you  
Maybe change  
And all these faces  
Reappear in different places  
And I can't see a thing but you  
Here comes that feeling again  
You're always around me  
This island life never ends  
It just circles inside me  
And when we're older  
We'll go back to being friends  
But oh,  
Here comes that feeling again
