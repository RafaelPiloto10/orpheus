I'm the writer got a front page cover  
Hot gossip 'bout who's with their latest lover  
I write all chapters by the second scene  
I call the shots, don't need a Fleet Street team  
I am a writer and I'm the news  
You cross me you know you're gonna lose  
I'll do the story if you're dead or alive  
If seconds out or if you're gonna take a dive  
Slip out the news or a piece of scandal  
Don't toe the line, 'cause nothing's too hot to handle  
I am the writer and I'm the news  
If you cross me you know you're gonna lose  
Yeah you're gonna lose  
  
I am a writer and I am the news  
If you cross me you know you're gonna lose  
And where you are it's because of me  
'Cause overnight you know it don't come free  
I'll put you up there or I'll bring you down  
'Cause nothing moves without me in this town  
I am a writer and I am the news  
If you cross me you know you're gonna lose  
Boy you're gonna lose I said you're gonna lose  
I write the news I am the news  
Got to, got to lose  
Oh yeah you're gonna lose  
So don't step on my blue suede shoes...
