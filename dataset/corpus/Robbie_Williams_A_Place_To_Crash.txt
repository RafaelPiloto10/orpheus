I'm on a mission  
To abuse my position  
Abuse it with you  
  
Love, I'm a cynical bitch  
I'm gonna scratch that itch  
With a bitch like you  
  
Harder thinkers make me miserable  
Everything is unforgivable  
If not for you  
I wouldn't come at all  
  
Find a place to crash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
Move your phoney ass  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
Love me like I'm cash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
You can feel the clash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
[Guitar]  
  
If there's a freak in here  
Looking for someone like me  
I fit their description  
Perfectly  
  
Boom boom boom  
I bet they'll desert you  
They would if they met you  
Met you with me  
  
Every move you make is poetry  
They all fake what you do naturally  
If not for you  
I wouldn't come at all  
  
Find a place to crash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
Move your phoney ass  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
Love me like I'm cash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
You can see the clash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Teach me with your brain  
All right  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Things that I say  
When I say nothing at all  
It leaves a taste in my stomach  
And its no taste at all  
  
I can sing, I can't dance  
But it don't stop me at all  
Its a ball and I'll call , if I call you at all  
  
Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent  
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent  
I won't be happy till the moneys been spent  
I forget to forget, oh forget, oh forget  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
