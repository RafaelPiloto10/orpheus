I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to bein' nobody  
The who I was before I was your used to be  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to who I was  
Before I was the one who fell in love  
With the one who never, ever was in love  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep  
Now they're dry they don't lay me down to weep  
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see  
No thanks to you  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
These eyes that used to cry myself to sleep  
Now they're dry they don't lay me down to weep  
For the first time in a long time I like seeing what I see  
No thanks to you  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to bein' nobody  
The who I was before I was your used to be  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to who I was  
Before I was the one who fell in love  
With the one who never, ever was in love  
I'm back to bein' me  
  
I'm back to bein' me  
I'm back to bein' me
