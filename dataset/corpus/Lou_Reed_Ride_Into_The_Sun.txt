Looking for another chance for someone else to be  
Looking for another place to ride into the sun  
  
Ride into the sun, ride into the sun  
Ride into the sun ride into the sun  
Where -  
  
everything seems so pretty  
But if you're tired and you're sick of the city  
Remember that it's just a flower, made out of clay  
Oh, the city  
  
Where everything seems so dirty  
But if you're tired and you're filled with self-pity  
Remember that you're just one more person who's there  
  
It's hard to live in the city  
It's hard to live in the city, oh - oh - oh  
It's hard to live in the city, oh - wow - wow  
It's hard to live in the city
