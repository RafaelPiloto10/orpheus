On the corner into my car  
I drive forever never get far  
The 45 is slowly getting loaded  
I send another song to my star  
  
California mountains in the mornin'  
Stitch it up, and get it all  
All along the woman's got a want it  
Stitch it up, and get it all  
We all walk your pavement, get it off  
Take more than your....  
  
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa  
  
A pendulum inside of my bed  
Swingin' low, I hope to get hit  
The overflow is slow, but not enough no  
Another drop will never fix it  
  
California mountains in the mornin'  
Get along, and get it all  
All along the woman's got a want it  
Stitch it up, and get it all  
We all walk your pavement, get if off  
Take more than your friends  
  
If I call you lately  
I could be your man  
I could be your greatness  
If I call you lately  
I could be your man  
  
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa  
  
I shut it down the look in my eyes  
Knock 'em dead a' covered in flies  
The big sleep without a bed of roses  
The light of day will never tell lies  
  
All along the woman's got a want it  
Stitch it up, and get it all  
California mountains in the mornin'  
Stitch it up, and get it all  
We all walk your pavement  
Take more than your friends  
  
If I call you lately  
I could be your man  
I could be your greatness  
If I call you lately  
I could be your man  
  
On the river into my dock  
I paddle throught the shadow and fog  
To ponder all of those who came before me  
Another piece for building my arch
