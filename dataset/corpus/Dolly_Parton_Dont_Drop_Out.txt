Am I to face these lonely halls alone  
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home  
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more  
And you're the one I adore so baby  
Chorus:  
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
You're not prepared to do anything  
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well  
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out  
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try  
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry  
They say you're no good so baby do what you should  
And stay here by my side oh darlin'  
Repeat Chorus  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)  
Don't drop out of my life  
Baby, don't drop out  
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
