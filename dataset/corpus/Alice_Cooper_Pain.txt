I'm hidden in the scream  
When the virgin dies  
I'm the ache in the belly  
When your baby cries  
And I'm the burnin' sensation  
When the convict fries  
  
I'm pain  
I'm your pain  
Unspeakable pain  
I'm your private pain  
  
And I'm the compound fracture  
In the twisted car  
And I'm the lines on the face  
Of the tramp at the bar  
And I'm the reds by the bed  
Of the suicide star  
  
You know me- I'm pain  
I'm your pain  
Your own private pain  
Unfathomable pain  
  
And it's a compliment to me  
To hear you screamin' through the night  
All night  
Tonight  
  
I'm the holes in your arm  
When you're feeling the shakes  
I'm the lump on your head  
When you step on the rake  
  
And I'm the loudest one laughing  
At the saddest wake  
  
Yes I'm pain  
I'm just pain  
Dear old pain  
You need your pain  
  
And I'm the loudest one laughing  
At the saddest wake  
  
I'm the salt in the sweat  
On the cuts of the slaves  
I was the wound in the side  
While Jesus prayed  
I was the filthiest word  
At the vandalized grave  
  
Yes, pain  
Do you love me pain  
I love my pain  
I'm your pain  
  
It's a compliment to me  
To hear you screamin' through the night  
All night  
Tonight
