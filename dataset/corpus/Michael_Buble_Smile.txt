Smile  
Though your heart is aching  
Smile  
Even though it's breaking  
  
When there are clouds  
In the sky,  
You'll get by  
If you smile  
  
Through your fear and sorrow  
Smile  
And maybe tomorrow  
You'll see the sun  
  
Come shining through  
For you  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear  
May be ever so near  
  
That's the time  
You must keep on trying  
Smile  
What's the use of crying?  
  
You'll find that life  
Is still worth-while  
If you just smile  
Smile  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear  
May be ever so near  
  
That's the time  
You must keep on trying  
Smile,  
What's the use of crying?  
  
You'll find that life  
Is still worth-while  
If you just smile  
Keep on smiling  
  
Oh yeah  
Smile  
Never, never, never stop smile
