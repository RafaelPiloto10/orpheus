We hit the blue fields  
In the blue sedan we didn't get much further  
Just as the sun was rising in the mist  
We were all alone we didn't need much more  
  
So fast this expidition  
So vast this heavy load  
With a touch of luck and a sense of need  
Seeing the guns and their faces  
We look around the open shore  
Waiting for something  
  
Shoot high break low  
Aim high shoot low  
Break high let go  
Shoot high aim low  
  
This was to be our last ride  
With the steel guitar and the love you give me  
Underneath the skin a feeling, a breakdown  
Well we sat for hours on the crimson sand  
  
Exchanges in the currency of humans bought and sold  
And the leaders seem to lose control  
  
Shall we lose ourselves for a reason  
Shall we burn ourselves for the answer  
Have we found the place that we're looking for  
Someone shouted "open the door"  
Lookout  
  
Shoot high break low  
Aim high shoot low  
Feeling of imagination  
Break high let go  
Shoot high aim low  
  
Shoot high aim low  
Nothing you can say  
Shoot high let go  
Takes me by surprise  
  
Shoot high aim low  
Who says's there's got to be a reason  
Shoot high let go  
Who says there's got to be an answer  
  
We were all alone, we didn't need much more  
Shoot high aim low  
The sun's so hard on this endless highway  
Shoot high let go  
Shoot high aim low  
I've heard the singers, who sing of love  
Shoot high let go  
In the blue sedan we never got much further  
Shoot high aim low
