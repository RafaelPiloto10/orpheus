Breakin' my back just to know your name  
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game  
A breakin' my back just to know your name  
But heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss  
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this  
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight  
  
[Chorus]  
Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  
  
Ready let's roll onto something new  
Takin' it's toll then I'm leaving without you  
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this  
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A rushing, rushing around  
  
Pace yourself for me  
I said maybe, baby, please  
But I just don't know now  
When all I want to do is try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A rushing, rushing around  
  
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  
  
A rushing, rushing around  
  
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  
  
A rushing, rushing around
