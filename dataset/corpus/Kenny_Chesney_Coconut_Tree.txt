Everybody's got a place they go  
When the old battery gets running low  
I'm a sucker for the sand and sea, yea  
If I had my way, hey I'd always be  
  
Way up high in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut tree  
  
Not to green, not too brown  
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down  
Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece  
And you can do alright if you ain't afraid to be  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Yeah, there's less stress and the world's alright  
It's a different point of view  
When you're looking at life  
  
Way up high in a coconut tree  
(Layin' low) low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Layin' low, just my baby and me (Sunny skies as far as I can see)  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut tree  
Up here with Willie  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
Let's get high in a coconut tree
