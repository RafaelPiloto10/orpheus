Did you see me last night  
I was there in the dark  
I saw her look at you, the way I used to  
When I still had your heart.  
  
I watched you take her hand  
There was love in your eyes  
I remember when you looked at me that way too  
Before we said good-bye  
  
I don't want to be your friend  
I just want to be your lover  
I don't think I can pretend  
That you mean nothing to me  
  
It's hard enough to say good-bye  
Even when you know it's over  
I don't want to be your friend  
I want to be your lover and when I think I've had enough  
And I just can't stand the pain  
I reminisce about the way it felt  
To have you every day  
You know that every time I hear your voice  
I still get a thrill  
And there's nothing I can do about it  
  
Am I gone from your thoughts, forgotten somehow  
When you be there with her  
Does my memory stir, any part of you now  
I know that I should concede, face the truth and all that  
I know I should realize I'm not a part of your life anymore,  
But I can't  
  
I don't want to be your friend  
I just want to be your lover  
I don't think I can pretend  
That you mean nothing to me  
  
It's hard enough to say good-bye  
Even when you know it's over  
I don't want to be your friend  
I want to be your lover
