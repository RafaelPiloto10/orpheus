I'm gonna tend a bad fire until you come around  
I'd sing you real live love songs  
If I could get the feeling down  
  
I want to make you happy but the devil's out my way  
So I'll just pack up everything  
Roll it out and up the devil's pay  
  
I want to cause a bad scene  
But I gotta change my ways  
I want to hear your sound again  
I want to see you 'round someday  
  
I want to make you happy  
But the devil's out my way  
So I'll just pack up everything  
Roll it out and up the devil's pay  
  
and it seems no one can comfort me  
To take me from this station where I'm at  
Cause the things I love are leaving me  
And it's taken every single piece  
It's a grade-A mess and it's cutting teeth  
It's a big black wind that's blowing back of me  
  
I'm gonna roll up everything into a big red sun  
Boil til the room's insane  
Wave my rattles on and on  
  
I want to make you happy but the devil's out my way  
So I'll just pack up everything  
Roll it out and up the devil's pay
