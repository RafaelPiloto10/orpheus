I'm only twenty three for another hour, give or take  
I'm a fan of yours and I need a good mistake  
I'm not a sinner or preacher, all I have is slight of hand  
I do magic tricks for all the boys in the band  
  
Baby could I be the rabbit in your hat?  
I'd swing if you'd hand me, hand me the bat  
  
I'm on the road of least resistance  
I'd rather give up than give in to this  
So promise me only one thing, would you?  
Just don't ever make me promises  
No promises, oh no promises  
Oh  
  
I've never done this before, promises, promises  
But I'm enjoying the illusion and the things my body says  
Now you see me, now you don't, oh how well you disappear  
What are you running from and may I interfere?  
  
Baby could I be the rabbit in your hat?  
I'd swing if you'd hand me, hand me the bat  
  
Oh, oh baby could I be the rabbit in your hat?  
I'd swing if you'd hand me, hand me the bat  
  
I'm on the road of least resistance  
I'd rather give up than give in to this  
So promise me only one thing, would you?  
Just don't ever make me promises  
No promises,no no no promises  
  
Oh no no no no promises  
  
I'm on the road of least resistance  
I'd rather give up than give in to this  
So promise me only one thing, would you?  
Just don't ever make me promises  
No promises  
  
No no no no promises  
No no no no promises  
No no promises
