Baby when I think about you  
All I want to do  
Be by your side  
Take a little ride  
Take a little  
Baby you know I'm all about you  
And all I want to do  
Is take a little ride  
Maybe get inside  
Maybe get in  
  
Mama told me boy  
Someday that girls gonna take your mind  
And then you'll know  
I never knew what I do now  
I never knew what I do now  
I love you, love you, love you, love you  
You, you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
Mama told me boy  
Someday that girls gonna steal your mind  
And then you'll know  
I never knew what I do now  
I never knew what I do now  
I love you, love you, love you, love you  
You, you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
Sour as my fingers  
Dirty pick pocket  
I can still taste you  
I won't wash my hands  
Red is the color  
Of the sun with my eyes closed  
I can still taste you  
And I will again  
  
Woman please I be your possession  
You are my obsession  
Let me go down  
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down  
  
Down little place it digs to go  
Down little place it digs to go  
Down little place it digs to go  
Down little place it digs to go  
  
Mama told me boy  
Someday that girls gonna steal your mind  
And then you'll know  
I never knew what I do now  
I never knew what I do now  
I love you, love you, love you, love you  
You, you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
Woman please I be your possession  
You are my obsession  
Let me go down  
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
