Oh you are so very strange  
Sometimes I think you've gone insane  
Twisted hearts you've gone insane  
In this giddy world  
Couldn't you begin to go  
Where odd lines we hardly know  
Couldn't you put in a goal  
Just for me  
  
Did I say I want to know  
Talking about a goal  
Would you please leave me alone  
Can't you see I want to be on my own  
  
Oh, I would like to give you your head  
Just to see if you are dead  
Oh, I'd like to get into that pretty head  
And it would amuse me just to see  
How you feel about me  
How you feel about always getting fried  
  
Did I say I want to know  
We're talking about a goal  
Would you please leave alone  
Can't you see I want to be on my own  
Can't you see I want to be on my own  
  
Oh,I'm going to fly [Repeat: x 3
