I'd like to love you, every day  
If I may (If I may)  
And dream dreams of you, every night  
If I might (If I might)  
And if I may, I'd like to say  
I wish that you were mine  
If I had you, all I would do  
Is adore you all of the time  
  
I'd like to tell you of your charms  
Every day, if I may  
I'd like to hold you in my arms  
Every night, if I might  
You're the object of my affections  
And if you have no objections  
I'd like to love you, night and day  
If I may
