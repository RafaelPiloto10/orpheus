Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps  
Some of these women they just give me the creeps  
I'm avoidin' the Southside the best I can  
These memories I got, they can strangle a man  
  
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night  
Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm not sorry for nothin' I've done  
I'm glad I fought - I only wish we'd won  
The Siamese twins are comin' to town  
People can't wait - they're gathered around  
  
When I left my home the sky split open wide  
I never wanted to go back there - I'd rather have died  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
My woman got a face like a teddy bear  
She's tossin' a baseball bat in the air  
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword  
I'm crashin' my car, trunk first into the boards  
  
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice  
Well, I'll sell it to ya at a reduced price  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me, if only you knew  
  
Some things are too terrible to be true  
I won't come here no more if it bothers you  
The Southern Pacific leaving at nine forty-five  
I'm having a hard time believin' some people were ever alive  
  
I'm stark naked, but I don't care  
I'm going off into the woods, I'm huntin' bare  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm here to create the new imperial empire  
I'm going to do whatever circumstances require  
I care so much for you - didn't think that I could  
I can't tell my heart that you're no good  
  
Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years  
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew
