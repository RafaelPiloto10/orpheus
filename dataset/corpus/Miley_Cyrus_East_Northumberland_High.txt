My problem isn't that I miss you  
'Cause I don't  
My problem isn't that I kissed you  
Whoa oh  
  
I figured out  
That you're nothin' that I thought you're about  
You're just caught in a place  
It's what time will erase in my heart  
  
You're my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change, thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you  
  
Your problem's not for lack of tryin'  
'Cause you do  
It's just that you're at your best when you're lyin'  
Whoa oh  
  
Now you're standing here  
And saying things you think I wanted to hear  
But you got it all wrong  
I've already moved on, my dear  
  
You're my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change, thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you  
  
When you're standing near me  
I don't see so clearly  
The feelings are still palpable  
But when I take two steps away  
It sheds some light on my day  
  
Yeah you can't go back  
It's all in the past  
Guess you gotta laugh at it  
  
You're my type of guy I guess  
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High  
For the rest of my life  
But people change, thank God I did  
  
And if there's some confusion  
Let me tell ya, you're just delusional  
Get a clue, 'cause people change  
Thank God I did  
Thank God I did  
Thank God I did  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you  
It doesn't mean I like you  
  
Just because I liked you back then  
It doesn't mean I like you now  
  
Rock and roll, rock it
