I know that it's late and I really must leave you alone  
But you're good to hold and I feel such a long way from home  
Yes I know that our love is still new  
And I promise it's gonna be true  
Please let me stay don't you send me away oh no no  
Ah tell me baby that you need me  
Say you'll never leave me love me tonight  
Hold me now my heart is aching  
And until the dawn is breaking love me tonight  
Something is burning inside  
Something that can be denied  
I can't let you out of my sight darling love me tonight  
I've waited so long for the girl of my dreams to appear  
And now I can't hardly believe that you really are here  
Here in my arms you belong  
How can this feeling be wrong  
Darling be kind for I'm out of my mind over you  
Ah tell me baby that you need me  
Say you'll never leave me love me tonight  
Baby now the pain is stronger  
I can't wait a moment longer love me tonight  
Something is burning inside  
Something that can be denied  
I can't let you out of my sight darling love me tonight  
Let me love you baby  
Let me love you baby  
Let me love you tonight  
Love me tonight
