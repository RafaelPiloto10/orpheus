Don't wait for me...I'll be a long time comin'  
Unless by then, you have told me something  
To show how much you care  
I've done much more than as a man I should have  
  
Why did you... not do all you could have... to show  
How much you care?  
  
Over and again I've wondered was I wrong  
Kept thinkin' that I maybe shoulda come along  
But there comes a time in every man's life  
When he must be strong  
  
And my time's come  
And if you're gone  
Then I guess I'll cry and hold to memories  
Of "what might have beens"  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
And when I finally leave  
That will show how much I cared
