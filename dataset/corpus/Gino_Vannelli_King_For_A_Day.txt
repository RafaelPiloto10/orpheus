Blinded by the magenta spotlight  
Stands a disposable commodity  
Don't a high price ticket make a star shine so bright  
A taste of immortality  
And the critics they call you the new 'boy wonder'  
And you know just how to make a young girl cry  
The more you feed them the more they hunger  
As you watch the money multiply  
  
[Chorus:]  
How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be?  
King... for a day  
  
You got the whole damn world spinning 'round your middle finger  
Hey! Shoot a little skeet with the president  
And your mother loves you more for every dollar you bring her  
And yor latest wife is worth every cent  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blinded by the magenta spotlight  
Stands a manufactured fantasy  
Don't a high price ticket make a star  
Shine so bright  
And the people love you endlessly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be... King.
