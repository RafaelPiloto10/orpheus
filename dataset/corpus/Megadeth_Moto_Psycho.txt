Responsibility, an anchor around my neck  
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck  
Accountability, I live from check to check  
Volatility, neglect and no respect  
  
Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat  
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"  
  
One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train  
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho  
Moto Psycho  
  
You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean  
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean  
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between  
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene  
  
Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat  
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"  
  
One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train  
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho  
  
One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train  
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho  
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and I hit the road  
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho  
Time and time and time again I'm a  
Moto Psycho  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
