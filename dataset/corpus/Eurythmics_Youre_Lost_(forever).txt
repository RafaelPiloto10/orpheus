You can laugh  
You can cry  
But you can't look me  
Look me in the eye  
You're lost forever  
You can walk  
Yes you can run  
But you'll never be number one  
You're lost forever  
There's a church bell ringing  
On a mountain top  
You'll never hear it if you don't stop  
Big bird flying in a clear blue sky  
Don't it make you stop to think  
And wonder why...  
You may lose  
You may win  
But I'll never talk to you again  
You're lost forever  
From my memory  
From my memory
