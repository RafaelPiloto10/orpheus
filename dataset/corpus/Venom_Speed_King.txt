Good golly said little Miss Molly  
Whe she was rockin' in the house of the blue light  
Tooty Fruity was oh so rotty  
Rockin' to the East and West  
  
Loucile was oh so real  
When she didn't do her daddy's will  
Come on baby, drive me crazy  
You can do it, you can do it  
  
I'm a speed king, hear me sing  
Yes, I'm a speed king, see me fly  
Sat. night and I just got paid  
Gonna fool about now, ain't gonna save  
  
People gonna rock, people gonna roll  
Gonna have a party to save my soul  
Heard headed woman, soft heart man  
They been causin' trouble since it all began  
  
Take a little rice, take a little beans  
Gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans  
'Cause I'm a speed king  
Hear me sing, speed king, see me fly
