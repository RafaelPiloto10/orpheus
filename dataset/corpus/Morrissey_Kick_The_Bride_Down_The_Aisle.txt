Kick the bride down the aisle  
  
And make no mistake  
It's the best you can do for everyone's sake  
  
Kick the bride down the aisle  
And treasure the day  
I know so much more than I'm willing to say  
  
She just wants a slave  
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage  
So that she can laze and graze  
For the rest of her days  
Write down every word I say  
  
Kick the bride down the aisle  
In a mudslide of gloom  
She'll order you to tidy your room  
  
Kick the bride down the aisle  
Look at that cow in the field  
It knows more than your bride knows now  
  
She just wants a slave  
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage  
So that she can laze and graze  
For the rest of her days  
Write down every word I say  
  
You're that stretch of the beach  
That the tide doesn't reach  
No meaning, no reason  
The lonely season  
  
Kick the bride down the aisle  
And treasure the day
