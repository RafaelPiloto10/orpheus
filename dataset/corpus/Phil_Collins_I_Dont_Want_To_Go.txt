I don't want to see you go  
There's too much to say.  
  
But it's gone on for too long  
I know how much it hurts to hear  
You show it and I know it  
So there's no reason for the tears.  
  
I don't want to see you go  
Don't want to see you cry.  
  
Cause I've been there and I know it  
How much it hurts being left behind  
If you hold on, just be strong  
There'll come a time.  
  
All things will come to pass, you know  
All things will come around  
  
I see your bags are packed  
I guess that means you won't be back  
There's nothing left could keep me chained  
To get you, bring you back again.  
  
If you hold on, won't be long  
We'll find our time and place once more  
Just hold tight, it's alright  
We've been here before.  
  
All things will come to pass, you know  
All things will come around.  
  
But if you don't want to stay, say goodbye  
My number's on your wall  
Cause I've been there and I've seen it  
It's there beside those other guys  
So keep it, you may need it  
There's no more reason for the lies.
