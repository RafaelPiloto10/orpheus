We turned the dial, we heard the news and laughed, we don't know why  
We drank the wine and spoke of times we knew of days gone by  
We flicked through photographs we had, somehow they made us sad  
Remembering the times we used to have, it made us cry  
  
Oh I remember death in the afternoon  
  
A silence fell about the room with harsh and heavy calm  
The lovers and the friends all felt the same, it kept us warm  
We raised our glass and drank to times we had, but'd see no more  
The pictures of the past would haunt us still, and there remains  
  
Oh I remember death in the afternoon
