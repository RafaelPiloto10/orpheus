Girl, there are no words to say  
What I feel in my heart  
You, you're on my mind night and day  
And it hurts me when we're apart  
When you're not here by my side  
There is nothing in this world for me  
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see  
And although you may think it's crazy  
Here is where I want to be  
I will always need your love  
Now, I can see every dream  
When I look in your eyes  
And though things never are what they seem  
There is one thing that I realize  
That there's no doubt in my mind  
We can make this love go on forever  
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see  
And although you may think I'm crazy  
Here is where I'll always be  
And I need you with me 'cause you are the dream  
That finally came true for me  
And all my life there'll be no one else  
If I looked all my life there could be no one else  
And for the rest of my life all I need is you
