Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none  
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none.  
He's gone and leave me, he's gone and leave me  
He's gone and leave me to sorrow and mourn.  
Last night in deep slumber I dreamed I did see  
Last night in deep slumber I dreamed I did see  
My own true love came smiling to me  
My own true love came smiling to me.  
And when I awakened I found it not so  
And when I awakened I found it not so.  
My heart like some fountain with tears overflow  
My heart like some fountain with tears overflow.  
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none  
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none.  
He's gone and leave me, he's gone and leave me  
He's gone and leave me to sorrow and mourn.
