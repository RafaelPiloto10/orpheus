(a capella: she said: boy, your luck is running out... She make me feel like a
stranger... In my own house)  
I come stumbling in at a quarter to three  
To the sound of my own dog growlin' at me  
I'm scared to move or turn on a light  
You've got me creepin' around in the dark  
Like a thief in the night  
I've got no excuse, I should have known  
I've got no place to live  
I never feel at home  
  
I walk into the kitchen to see what's there  
I'm tired and I'm hungry but the cupboard's bare  
I've been working all day and all night too  
I can't believe this is all I have to come back to  
  
I guess I'll take a look upstairs, in the danger zone  
I wonder what I'm doing here  
When I never feel at home  
  
I'm a stranger in my own house  
I've got the keys to the door  
But I'm still locked out  
I'm a stranger in my own house  
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow this house down  
Can't be a stranger in my own house  
  
I see the do not disturb sign on my bedroom door  
What is this sheet and pillow laying on the floor  
I wore out my welcome  
I hear you loud and clear  
It's time to get a few things straight around here  
  
I've got no excuse, I should have known  
I've got a place to live but I never feel at home  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
I've got the keys to the door  
But I'm still locked out  
Stranger in my own house  
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow this house down  
Can't be a stranger in my own house  
  
I've got no excuse, I should have known  
With a woman like you I'm better off alone  
I'm a stranger in my own house  
I've got the keys to the door  
But I'm still locked out  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
Oh, honey I'm home  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
You got a lion on your hands girl, not a mouse!  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
I'm just a stranger in my own house  
Well, somebody's got to go...  
Stranger  
Stranger
