In darkness we do what we can  
In daylight we're oblivion  
Our hearts so raw and clear  
Are turning away, turning away from here  
  
On water we have walked like the fearless child  
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild  
And in search for confirmation  
We have jumped into the fire  
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire  
  
Chorus  
  
There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past  
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast  
And there's those that try to tame it  
And the carve it into stone  
Ah but words cannot extinguish it  
However hard they're thrown  
  
Chorus  
  
On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams  
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams  
And in searching for acceptance  
They have given it away  
Only the children of our children  
Know the price they had to pay  
  
Chorus
