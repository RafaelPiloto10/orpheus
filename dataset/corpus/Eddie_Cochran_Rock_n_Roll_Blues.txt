Oh, dancin' all night, so I have my play  
But how can I work when I sleep all day  
I got those rock 'n' roll blues, those rock 'n' roll blues  
I dig way down deep in my ol' blue jeans  
To put my last dime in that record machine  
I got those rock 'n' roll blues, those rock 'n' roll blues  
I have the blues to fight  
And to make things worse I fell in love last night  
The little girl I found  
Said to stop my hoppin' and settle down  
Oh why can't there be two of poor o1' me  
One on the dancefloor and one hangin' 'round the door  
I got those rock 'n' roll blues, those rock 'n' roll blues
