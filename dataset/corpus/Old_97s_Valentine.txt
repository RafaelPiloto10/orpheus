Heartbreak, old friend, goodbye it's me again  
Of late, I've had some thought of movin' in  
Of all the many ways a man will lose his home  
Well, there ain't none better than the girl who's movin' on  
True love, I knew thought some of leavin' you  
Bad thoughts I had, when valentines were due  
Of all the many ways a man will break his heart  
Well there ain't none meaner than he pulls his own apart  
Valentine, the destroyer, valentine, you belong  
In the stars, where you are, always rollin' on  
Cried, I've cried till I couldn't carry on  
It's a lonely, lonely feelin' when your valentine was wrong  
It's a lonely, lonely feelin' when your valentine was wrong

No, there ain't none better than the girl who's movin' on
