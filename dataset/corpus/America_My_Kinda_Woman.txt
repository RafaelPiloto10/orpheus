Found on your move and the very best of america.  
  
I've been in love, girl, so many times before  
They'd love me and leave me, i thought i knew the score  
I'd fall in love no more  
I was walking in shadows then, my life a lonely road  
I was walking to nowhere, with a heavy loaded heart  
To laugh i played the part  
  
(do, do, do ... ) then came that magic day  
I saw you as you walked my way  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
The longer together then, the more we fell in love  
No makin' or breakin' up, now i know i found real love  
And i can't get enough (oo, i love you, i really love you)  
So good to be winnin' now, i never thought i'd do  
You got me spinnin', honey it's all down to you  
You're there to see me through (oo, i love you, i really love you, yes i love
you)  
  
(do, do, do ... ) and from just one kiss  
Who would believe that it would be like this  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
My kinda woman i know that this is really love  
There'll be no breakin' up, oh no  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are)  
Oh, yes you are
