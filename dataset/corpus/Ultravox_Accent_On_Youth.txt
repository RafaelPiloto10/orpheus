What is this phase that I am going through  
O these precious years  
Please take my hand and let me breathe again  
Young depressive tears  
We stumble blindly chasing something new and something sinful  
You take my time you live my life for me  
What have I done to rate this penalty  
You suck me dry  
My body cries  
We stumble blindly chasing instant thrills and lasting memories  
  
Accent on youth  
Attention  
Ascends on you  
  
I scream with frustration and lost control  
Open for the blows  
My hands fall limp and hang down by my side  
Take my soul and go  
We stumble blindly chasing dancing lights and others' wishes  
  
(Chorus)  
Just let me close my eyes and slip away  
Dream a dream alone  
You give me just enough rope for the task  
Let this man alone  
We stumble blindly chasing silhouettes and vacant faces  
So well rehearsed our moves once so graceful turn against us  
We stalk dark passages, we're looking for that sweet surrender  
  
(Chorus)
