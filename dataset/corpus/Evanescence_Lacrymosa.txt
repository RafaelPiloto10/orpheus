Out on your own, cold and alone again  
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?  
  
Blame it on me, set your guilt free  
Nothing can hold you back now  
  
Now that you're gone, feel like myself again  
Grieving the things I can't repair and willing  
  
To let you blame it on me and set your guilt free  
I don't want to hold you back now, love  
  
I can't change who I am, not this time  
I won't lie to keep you near me  
And in this short life there's no time to waste on giving up  
My love wasn't enough  
  
And you can blame it on me, just set your guilt free, honey  
I don't want to hold you back now, love
