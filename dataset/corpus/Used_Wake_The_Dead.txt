This is not natural  
A bunch of holes where the dead used to be underground  
Forget supernatural  
'Cause all those resting in peace are out walking the streets  
Yeah, with no heartbeat  
  
[Chorus:]  
Across the sky they can hear you on the other side  
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead  
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead  
  
Oh, this is not possible  
An empty hole in your chest where your heart used to beat  
Does this mean what I think it means?  
How could both you and me be about as dead as we could be?  
Yeah, with no heartbeat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a walk with me  
Walk with the dead  
'Cause you knew that we'd have to die sometime  
Well, darling, tonight could be...  
  
Let your voice shred miles (of diamond skies)  
Just to walk as they wake in the darkness (yeah)  
Well, darling, tonight could be a beautiful night to die  
(A beautiful night to die, yeah)  
  
Wake the dead  
Fuck it, you're dead  
Wake the dead  
Fuck it, you're dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
  
Across the sky they can hear you  
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead  
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
  
Across the sky they can hear you on the other side  
A scream that's loud enough to wake the dead  
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead
