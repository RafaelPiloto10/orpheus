Caught in the middle of a moonbeam, oh a flicker of light  
I took a look and then it run away, back on into the night  
Oh, stopped, stopped tickin' of my heartbeat, a look in his eye  
Had the hunger of a mountain lion and the thunder in fire  
  
And every time he appears it comes as a surprise  
And he thinks he's clever as fox fire dancin' on a distant rise  
Then when I catch that devil, ooh, there gonna be a slow down  
There gonna be a mighty slow down, yeah  
  
Caught in the embers of my night fire, in the cracklin' and glow  
I get the feeling he's a-watching me somewhere there in the cold  
  
And one of these days I'm thinking I'll take him by surprise  
He's not so clever as fox fire, dancing on a distant rise  
And when I catch that devil, there gonna be a slow down  
There gonna be a mighty slow down
