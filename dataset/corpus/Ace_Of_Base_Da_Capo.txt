Da capo  
Da capo  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
  
One level ahead  
I'm calling to you  
But touch you I cannot do  
To tell you I can't  
I'm drawing the line  
To greetings to understand  
  
You will find me waiting out in the dark  
I'm your everlasting property  
You're the one I'm living for  
And feed all the time  
  
Da da capo  
Once again  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
I'm longing to see  
The offspring of me  
To hold it with my bare hands  
So talk about me as you used to do  
I'm with you from time to time  
  
You will find me waiting out in the dark  
I'm your everlasting property  
You're the one I'm living for  
And feed all the time  
With your deeds all the time  
  
Da da capo  
Once again  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
Da da capo  
Once again (woo hoo yeah)  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
  
Once again (woo hoo yeah)  
I'm telling you I am your friend  
But you can't hear me in your dream  
You're living in a dreamer's dream  
Da da capo  
  
Gone with the wind I am not  
And I visit you too a lot  
Passing the gridlock  
Is a hard thing to do  
  
Da da capo
