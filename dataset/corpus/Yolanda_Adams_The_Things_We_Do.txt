Everyday that goes by  
Every moment you'll find  
There's a broken heart  
A tear is cried  
A wish is made  
That never comes true  
And somewhere someone needs to be found  
  
The things we do  
The things we say  
Are gentle rays of hope  
That touch us all each day  
Each day  
The things we do (the things we do the things we say)  
The things we say (the greatest gifts we give away)  
These are the greatest gifts we give away  
The things we do  
  
Now everyday in this life  
Every moment you'll find  
A heart is healed  
A dream is found  
A tear is dried and laughter is heard  
And somewhere someone's life will be changed  
  
For the things we do (the things we do the things we say)  
The things we say (the way we live our life each day  
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all  
Each day  
(its all about the things we do its all about you and you)  
The things we do (the things we do the things we say)  
The things we say (the greatest gifts we give away  
These are the greatest gifts we'll give away  
The things we do  
  
Oh Every hand that has been held  
Has reached out for somebody else  
In every move we make  
Every day we pass along this way  
The things we do  
The things we say  
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all  
Each day  
Oh The things we do  
The things we say  
These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away  
The things we do (the things we do)  
  
So when you wake up in the morning  
and you find someone whose lost and lonely  
Just take him by the hand and help him find his way  
When you're walking down the street and you see a man who has no food to eat  
Just reach into your pocket and help make his day  
I have a dream  
I have a dream  
I want to make a change  
The things we do
