The blue pill opens your eyes  
Is there a better way  
A new religion prescribed  
To those without the faith  
The hero holding a knife  
And blood is not enough  
Is it too late to go back?  
Is it too late to go?  
  
There's no one here  
And people everywhere, you're on your own  
  
Let's see if I'm hearing this right  
Is it just I should take  
And never endings are glad  
To carry out the dead  
Your idols burn in the fire  
The mob comes crawling out (take us down and out)  
I'm reclaiming their minds  
Destroying everyone  
  
There's no one here  
And people everywhere, you're all alone
