I got a guy  
He don't dress me in sable  
He looks nothing like Gable  
But he's mine  
And I think he's too divine  
  
I got a guy  
When he starts into pet me  
He's the sauce on spaghetti  
He's the kind  
That you can't keep off your mind  
  
I got a guy  
And he's tough  
He's just a gem in the rough  
But when I polish him up, I swear  
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire  
  
I'm riding high  
'Cause I'm happy and carefree  
There is nothing that can scare me  
'Cause I got a guy  
  
I got a guy  
And he's tough  
He's just a gem in the rough  
But when I polish him up, I swear  
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire  
  
I'm riding high  
'Cause I'm happy and carefree  
There is nothing that can scare me  
'Cause I got a guy
