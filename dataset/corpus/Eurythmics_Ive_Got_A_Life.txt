Turn it down so I can tear it  
Turn it up so I can see it  
It's just useless to ignore  
We're goin' down, you don't feel it  
Turn it around, you don't mean it  
And I can't stand it anymore  
When the whole world sighs  
And it's makin' you so deflated  
I've got a life, though it refuses to shine  
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over  
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine  
All I'm asking for is tenderness, a little tenderness, tenderness  
Ooh, it's a cruel place, you never asked to be here  
Nobody cares and no one's gonna help you now, oh no  
It's dog eat dog, the human race  
The only thing they'll do is hate you, hate you  
Such a crime to be unkind  
You turn your cheek, pretend you're blind  
I've got a life, though it refuses to shine  
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over  
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine  
All I'm asking for is tenderness, tenderness  
I've got a life, though it refuses to shine  
I've got a life, it ain't over, it ain't over  
I've got a way, it's the only thing that's mine  
All I'm asking for is tenderness, a little tenderness  
Be strong now baby, oh  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Oh, gotta be strong  
Strong now baby, oh  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Gotta be strong now, baby  
Oh, gotta be strong
