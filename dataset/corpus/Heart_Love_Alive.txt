The sky was dark this morning  
When I raised my head  
I stood at the window  
Darkness was my bane  
  
Suddenly a sunbeam arch  
Thrilled me to my weary heart  
It was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen  
  
I knew I had to keep my love  
Keep my love alive  
Keep my love keep my love live  
  
Baby I want you to roll me  
Hold me in your love  
No more habits, promises and jive  
Ever since I was a baby girl  
Wanted one thing most in this world  
It was to keep my love  
Keep my love alive  
  
I want to keep my love  
Keep my love alive  
Keep my love keep my love alive  
  
You're up there under the spotlight  
Your silver trophy shines  
With all you got, my lord!  
You must get high  
You need a whole lot more than money  
You need more than to survive  
You need to keep your love  
Keep your love alive
