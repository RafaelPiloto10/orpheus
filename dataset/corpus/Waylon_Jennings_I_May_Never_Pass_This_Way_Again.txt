Little girl don't be so quit to give your love so free  
Little girl what makes you want to throw yourself with me  
Just in your teens you're lookin' more like twenty one  
You run ahead of life when it's only just begun  
Don't you know I may never pass this way again  
Little girl you'd better go before I'd change my mind  
Little girl walk away while you still have the time  
It's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see  
Then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me  
Don't you know I may never pass this way again  
Mama sets home awaitin' you to call by now daddy's lookin' tired  
Wonder what can she be and what she's doin' out now late at night  
Little girl you better go before I lose all sense and my control  
I'll be crossed bridge down on the road and you'll be left behind to pay the
toll  
I may never pass this way again  
Little girl wait for him he'll soon be on his way  
Little girl you think within what I'd do today  
It's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see  
And then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me  
Don't you know I may never pass this way again I may never pass this way again
hmm
