I'm getting ready to rock  
I'm getting ready to roll now baby  
I'm in the mood to dance  
I'm in the mood for sweet romance  
  
Take it easy let it go  
Sweet emotions start to flow  
  
I'm ready to rock  
Ready to rock  
Ready to rock  
  
I'm getting ready to move  
I'm getting ready to groove now baby  
I'm running so hot  
I'm getting ready to shoot my shot  
  
Take it easy let it go  
Sweet emotions start to flow  
  
I'm ready to rock  
  
I'm going to lose control  
Of my heart and soul  
If I keep on watching you  
And those things you do  
It's going to be all right  
We're going to dance all night  
Anything you want to do  
Here it comes  
  
I'm getting ready to rock  
I'm getting ready to roll now baby  
I'm in the mood to dance  
I'm in the mood for sweet romance  
  
Take it easy let it go  
Sweet emotions start to flow  
Take it easy you will see  
Take my hand child come with me  
  
I'm ready to rock  
Ready to rock
