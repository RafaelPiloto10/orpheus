Life has cast a smile  
In this game of chance  
But you can't take for granted  
That you've got it all worked out  
  
Fool if you think there's nothing left to learn  
You got to get down, get down, get down  
Back down to earth  
  
How could you not know?  
There's quite a way to go  
The wheels won't stop from turning  
The chapters ever changing  
  
We can't allow ourselves to be blinded by pride  
We are so small in the plan of creation  
Gravitate, gravitate, gravitate  
Elevate, elevate, elevate  
Your mind  
  
So, you think there's nothing left to learn  
You got to get down, get down, get down  
Back down to earth  
  
There's a story of a man  
Who bragged he knew it all  
Arrogance outspoken  
He died alone and broken  
  
Fool if you think there's nothing left to learn  
You got to get down, get down, get down  
Back down to earth
