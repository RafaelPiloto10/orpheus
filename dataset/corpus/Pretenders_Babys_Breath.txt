There was a time you thought  
I was in love with you  
Well think again,  
You can't read my thought  
You're so pretty,  
I'd like to break your smile in two  
You're so correct,  
I'd like to disconnect the dots  
You're such a child,  
But you're not innocent  
Another kid for rent  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath  
  
There was a time I thought  
You were magnificent  
But you've got nothing to have or to hold  
You're so pensive  
But your thoughts are insignificant  
Wrap 'em up another twenty billion sold  
You think you're wild and you know  
What danger means  
In your designer jeans  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath  
  
I'd like to have you alone tonight  
And rearrange your mind  
I'd like to have you  
But I know I'd be wasting my time  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath  
  
Why do you send me roses?  
Save them for someone's death  
The love you have to offer  
Is only baby's breath
