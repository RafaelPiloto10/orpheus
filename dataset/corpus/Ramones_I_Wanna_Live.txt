I've been thinking it over and I know just  
What to do I've been thinking it over and  
I know I just can't trust myself  
  
I'm a gypsy prince covered with diamonds and jewels  
But then my lover exposes me I know I'm just a damn fool  
  
I give what I've got to give  
I give what I need to live  
I give what I've got to give  
It's important if I want to live  
I want to live  
I want to live my life  
I want to live  
I want to live my life  
  
As I load my pistol of fine German steel  
I never thought I'd be so down and out having my last meal  
But I know I can do it it just took a few years  
As I execute my killer the morning is near  
  
I give what I've got to give  
I give what I need to live  
I give what I've got to give  
It's important if I want to live  
I want to live  
I want to live my life  
I want to live  
I want to live my life
