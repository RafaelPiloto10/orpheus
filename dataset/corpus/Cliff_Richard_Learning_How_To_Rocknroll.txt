Billy on his way to school  
Didn't care too much about the teachers and rules  
But he had a plan he said he'd try it one day  
One he knew would leave them all with nothing to say  
He had a friend who said he'd teach him how to rock and roll  
After school when he was feelin' good  
He'd go home and do the things that he understood  
He would rock in the kitchen and roll in the hall  
And Billy's mother said you got no sense at all  
But we know too well that he was  
Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
Willy turns to the mirror and gives his hair a flip  
He would mime to Elvis and curl his lip  
Ha ha in the kitchen  
Ha ha in the hall  
Willy's mother said you got no sense at all  
But we know too well that he was  
Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
He learnt to rock and roll  
And sing the blues  
He learnt to head shake  
While singing blue suede shoes  
He learnt a hand clap  
Off the beat  
And at the gig he had them out of their seats  
It's the only way to do it so long live rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...
