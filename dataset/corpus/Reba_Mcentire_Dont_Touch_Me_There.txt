These hands  
You can hold them all night if you want to  
And these lips  
Won't mind your kisses  
No they don't care  
You can lay your head on my shoulder  
Maybe even get a little bolder  
But when it comes to my heart  
Oh don't touch me there  
  
Oh these arms  
You can wrap around me gently  
And your fingers  
You can run them through my hair  
But there's one place that's off bounds  
From the last time love came 'round  
When it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there  
  
Last time I gave my heart so sweetly it broke  
He broke it so completely  
And even now it's more then I can bear  
Now someday I know I'll try again  
Someday but until then  
When it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there  
  
Oh these hands you can hold them all night if you want to  
And these lips won't mind your kisses  
No they don't care  
You can lay your head on my shoulder  
Or maybe even get a little bolder  
But when it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there  
  
Oh when it comes to my heart  
Don't touch me there
