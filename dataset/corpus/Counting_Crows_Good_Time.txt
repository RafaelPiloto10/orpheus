The gentleman caller in the blue suede shoes  
He don't know what to do  
He just wants to look good for you  
So he rushes in to tell you what he did today  
But he can't think of what to say  
I think you listen anyway  
  
He wants to have a good time just like everybody  
He doesn't want to fall apart  
  
You watch him as he stutters over what to say  
It's just a little game you play  
It's no easier for you some days  
You wish that you could tell him it'll be okay  
But you feel a little shy these days  
Cause everybody goes away  
  
You just want to have a good time  
Just like everybody else  
You don't want to fall apart this time  
  
I can look into your eyes and see the  
mess we're in  
Well darling, if it's shit came out  
Then I suppose it's shit went in  
Even though I couldn't say I've been the  
places you've been  
You know he made my heart real strong  
Even if he made my head real thin  
  
I want to have a good time  
Just like everybody  
And I don't want to fall apart  
  
I just want to have a good time  
Just like everybody else  
And I don't want to fall apart this time  
So would you please invite me in  
  
I really love the red haired girls  
I'm just another boy from Texas  
Come on and take a spin  
I got a brand new set of wings
