Excuse Me, I Think I've Got A Heartache  
From Wheels-EP (iTunes exclusive)  
  
They just don't know how lost I feel without you  
My teardrops never see the light of day  
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth I'd have to say...  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
There's an aching deep inside  
And it just won't be denied  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
And I'd better say goodbye  
Before I cry  
  
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow  
I live a lie in all I do and say  
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth I'd have to say...  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
There's an aching deep inside  
And it just won't be denied  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
And I'd better say goodbye  
Before I cry
