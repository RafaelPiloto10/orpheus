In your dreams  
The pain is so real  
Before the dead  
You'll have to kneel  
Hear your future screams  
See your epitaph  
As you scream  
The dead they laugh  
  
Pain, growing stronger  
Life, exists no longer  
Welcome, to a world of pain  
Death and despair  
  
Denial of life (Vile denial)  
Denial of life  
Denial of life  
  
Created by your mind  
To overtake your life  
Sacrificial suicide  
End it with a knife  
Much too late  
To change your mind  
A bloody corpse  
Is left behind  
  
Pain, growing stronger  
Life, exists no longer  
Welcome, to a world of pain  
Death and despair  
  
Denial of life (Vile denial)  
Denial of life  
Denial of life
