Every morning you wake up alone  
And you shake up your soul  
But nothing stirs  
So you take the love of whoever  
You please  
But you can't find no reason  
For giving yours.  
  
'Cause, once upon a time  
You held a love so strong and fine  
That all the others simply don't compare  
She's always on your mind  
But once upon a time  
You had her there.  
  
Drive into town 'most every night  
On the chance that there might be someone  
Waiting for you  
You tell yourself you'll  
Give it your best  
Maybe settle for less  
But you never do.  
  
'Cause, once upon a time  
You held a love so strong and fine  
That all the others simply don't compare  
She's always on your mind  
But once upon a time  
You had her there.  
  
Every morning you wake up alone  
And you shake up your soul  
But nothing stirs  
So you take the love of whoever  
You please  
But you can't find no reason  
For giving yours.  
  
'Cause, once upon a time  
You held a love so strong and fine  
That all the others simply don't compare  
She's always on your mind
