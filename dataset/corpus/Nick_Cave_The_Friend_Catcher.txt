I, cigarette fingers  
Puff and poke  
Puff and poking the smoke  
Touches the ground  
  
  
You, your lungs and your wrists  
They throb like trains  
Choo choo choo  
It's a prison of sound  
  
  
Of sound  
  
  
She, by my chinny chin chin [buying chilly chin-chin?]  
Eee-oh Eee-oh  
Like a zippo smokes the way  
Hope, around  
  
  
You, your lungs and your wrists  
They throb like trains  
Choo choo choo  
It's a prison of sound  
  
  
A prison of sound  
  
  
She, by the hair of my chinny chin chin  
Eee-oh Eee-oh Eee-oh Eee-oh  
Like a zippo smokes the way  
Hope, around  
  
  
You, your lungs and your wrists  
They throb like trains  
Choo choo choo  
It's a prison of sound  
  
  
I poke around...
