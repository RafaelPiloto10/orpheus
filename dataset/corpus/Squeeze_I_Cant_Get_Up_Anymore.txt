I can't get up anymore, my heart ticks so slow  
There's nothing to do, I'm picking my nose  
I'm counting the days that you have been gone  
My heart went to jail, my love's out of song  
I can't get up anymore, I'm lying in bed  
I'm watching the day through a hole in my head  
I turned myself down, I can hardly be heard  
Now I'm without a heart, now I'm without a girl  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
I can't get up anymore I'm a cold piece of toast  
The doormat is full, the newspapers and post  
There's a letter from you, but I'm growing a beard  
It will never be read, cause I'm going so weird  
Look what women can do I've bolted the door  
Now I'm losing a screw  
All this hunger and trial won't achieve a result  
But a nut cant keep tight without the help of a bolt  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I won't get up anymore  
I won't get up anymore  
(I won't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(Won't get up anymore)  
I won't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I won't get up anymore  
I can't get up anymore
