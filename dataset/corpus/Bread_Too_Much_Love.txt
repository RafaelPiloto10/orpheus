Too much sorrow  
Too much pain  
Too many reasons  
No to go back again  
Leavin' without her  
Is too much to bear  
But when we're together  
Too much nothin' to share  
But too much love  
I've never seen  
Too much love  
I don't know what it means  
  
Not enough caring  
Too many lies  
Sooner or later  
One too many goodbyes  
I got no reason  
For hangin' around  
And all my possessions  
Start to weighin' me down  
But too much love  
I've never known  
Too much love  
I need some of my own
