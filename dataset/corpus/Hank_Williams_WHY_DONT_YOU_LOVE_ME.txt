Well, why don't you love me like you used to do  
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe  
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue  
Why don't you love me like you used to do?  
  
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'  
In a long, long while  
We don't get nearer or further or closer  
Than a country mile.  
  
Why don't you spark me like you used to do  
And say sweet nothin's like you used to coo  
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through  
So why don't you love me like you used to do?  
  
Well, why don't you be just like you used to be  
How come you find so many faults with me  
Somebody's changed so let me give you a clue  
Why don't you love me like you used to do?  
  
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin'  
In a long, long while  
We don't get nearer or further or closer  
Than a country mile.  
  
Why don't you say the things you used to say  
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay  
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue  
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
