I don't want to hear it no more fussin' and a fightin' baby hold me tight  
Just let bygones be bygones let's think about tomorrow our future's bright  
I know I was wrong I was just a fool too blind to see you were the only one
for me  
But now I see the light and everything's gonna be alright baby hold me tight  
[ Pa pa pa pa pa pa ]  
I know I was wrong I was just a fool too blind to see...  
[ Pa pa pa pa pa pa ]
