Sometimes I wake up  
And I watch you sleep  
And in the darkness  
I wonder if I'm in too deep  
  
Help-what if it's true  
I say the wrong things  
'Cause I'm just a jealous guy  
And I hurt you sometimes  
  
I make you cry  
Oh I'm so sorry  
You and I fit together hand and glove  
What we've got is an act of love  
  
That's all  
There are good times  
And bad times too  
You're always there for me  
  
No matter what I do  
Don't ever turn away  
You're everything I know  
You're all I want to see  
  
Feel like a king  
When you're standing next to me  
And if we disagree don't forget  
You and I fit together hand and glove  
  
What we've got is an act of love  
Here we go  
My love's gigantic as the weather  
Our luck can come and go  
  
But as long as we're together  
I'm never never gonna wave goodbye  
I light a fire  
And I lock the doors  
  
I look into your eyes  
And I see what I'm looking for  
Though sometimes I'm so unsure  
You could say I'm out of control  
  
Don't you know what this feels like  
What I do-I do everything for you  
When I look I look to you  
For an act of love  
  
It's all I feel inside  
Is just an act of love  
The other side of me that hides  
Behind an act of love  
  
It's only an act of love  
Comin' back on me  
Takin' you away  
It's only an act of love  
  
Comin' back on me  
Comin' back on me  
It's only an act of love  
Keepin' me wide awake at night  
  
I know it's an act of love  
It's only an act of love
