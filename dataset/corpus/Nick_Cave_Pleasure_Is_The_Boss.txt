They're working us like dogs around here  
'Cause pleasure is the boss  
And I'm the happiest slave alive round here  
'Cause pleasure is the boss  
And nothing is safe that don't stand still  
If it's O. K. With the boss  
I'm gunna walk right up and take it yeah  
If it's O. K. With the boss  
  
Walk  
  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me
