Got my snake skin britches, alligator shoes,  
Money in my pocket, and a Memphis attitude.  
Wear my downtown Stetson with a silver on the crown,  
When I get started rolling baby, there ain't no slowin me down.  
I'm your midnight man, guaranteed to love you like nobody can.  
I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you
understand,  
I'm your midnight man and I love you till the daylight babe.  
Got my six shooter, gonna shoot it up in the air,  
If it feels real good, I might shoot it just everywhere.  
Got my best mojo, and my hoochie coochie too,  
Gonna put it all together gonna get after you  
I'm your midnight man, guaranteed to love you like nobody can.  
I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you
understand,  
I'm your midnight man and I love you till the daylight babe.  
One thing's for certain since I been foolin' with you,  
My reputation's hurtin' and I don't know what to do.  
All of my little downtown girls, say I'm wasting time,  
There ain't no use to fight it, I just can't get you outta my mind.  
I'm your midnight man, guaranteed to love you like nobody can.  
I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you
understand,  
I'm your midnight man, and I love you till the daylight babe.  
Hey, midnight, midnight man.
