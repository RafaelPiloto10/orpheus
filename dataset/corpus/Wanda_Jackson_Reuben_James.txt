Reuben James in my song you'll live again  
And the phrases that I rhyme are just the footsteps out of time  
From the time when I knew you Reuben James  
Reuben James all the folks around Madison County cussed your name  
Just a no count sharecroppin' black man who'd steal anything that he can  
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James  
Reuben James you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind  
Faded shirt the wrinkled brow the calloused hand upon the plow  
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James  
Flora Gray the gossip of Madison County died with child  
And although your skin was black you were the one who didn't turn your back  
On a hungry white child with no name Reuben James  
Reuben James with your mind on my soul and Bible in your right hand  
You said turn the other cheek there's a better world waitin' for the meek  
In my head these words remain from Reuben James  
Reuben James you still walk...  
Reuben James one dark cloudy day they brought you from the fields  
To your lonely pine box came a preacher me and the rain  
To sing one last refrain for Reuben James  
Reuben James you still walk...  
Reuben James you still walk...
