I watch you go to church on Sunday  
But you forget all you learned on Monday  
You see your smiling face can't hide  
How you hate your brother inside  
  
So I'ma telling you  
Run, Charlie, run  
Look the niggers are coming  
(The niggers are coming?)  
Run, Charlie, run  
Look the niggers are coming  
(The niggers are coming?)  
  
You built this great big beautiful city  
But you ran away and left it to die, what a pity  
You could have made friends with your neighbor  
But you are much too prejudiced to try, tell me why  
  
So I'ma telling you  
Run, Charlie, run  
Look the niggers are coming  
(The niggers are coming?)  
Run, Charlie, run  
Look the niggers are coming  
(The niggers are coming?)  
  
But the greatest wrong, you know you've done  
Is you passed this sickness onto your son  
(Your one and only boy)  
He came into this world with a mind so clean  
You took it, molded it, and made it mean  
  
So I'ma telling you  
Run, Charlie, run  
Look the niggers are coming  
(The niggers are coming?)  
Run, Charlie, run  
Look the niggers are coming  
(The niggers are coming?)
