Well, I'm black and blue  
From kickin' myself  
For givin' you up to somebody else  
Just treatin' you human is all I had to do  
  
I got corns walkin' the floor  
My shoes are all worn  
And the carpets half torn  
I'm kickin' myself  
'Til I'm black and blue  
  
Child, I'd be so happy  
If you come back again  
I've been getting slappy  
From all this punishment  
  
Well, I'm runnin' away  
Is it doing me harm  
Go and spend my days on a funny farm  
If I can't spend them being close to you  
'Cause I'm kickin' myself  
It's making me black and blue  
Over you
