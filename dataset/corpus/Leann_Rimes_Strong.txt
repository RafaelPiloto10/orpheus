The light of my life's been stolen  
I've walked in every shade of black and I never thought I would get me back  
It's funny how life can change you and make you who you are today  
I wonder if God set it up that way for me to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Strong even when it hurts  
The heat it's gonna burn gotta let it burn  
Strong, strong  
To make a big mistake now I've run away  
  
There's nothing like this feeling to be free and unafraid  
And who ever thought I could be this brave  
Learning every day  
  
Strong even when it hurts  
The heat it's gonna burn gotta let it burn  
Strong, strong  
To make a big mistake now I've run away  
  
I wanna push away the boundaries  
I wanna love outside the lines  
I wanna stare at the sun I don't care if I go blind  
Whatever comes, whatever breaks, I'll stand up straight  
  
[Chorus]
