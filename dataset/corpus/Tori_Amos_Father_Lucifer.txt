Father Lucifer  
You never looked so sane  
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain  
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid  
How's the Lizzies  
How's your Jesus Christ been hanging  
  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
  
He says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain  
He says I run and then I run from him  
And then I run  
He didn't see me watching  
From the aeroplane  
He wiped a tear  
And then he threw away our appleseed  
  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
  
Everyday's my wedding day  
Though baby's still in his comatose state  
I'll die my own Easter eggs  
Don't go yet  
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's but that's OK  
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave  
And girls that eat pizza but never gain weight  
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
