Lovely lovely locket love  
You could use a little of  
Hang a chain around you  
You're hangin' too  
Hang on a little bit longer  
Hang on you're a goner  
  
Lovely lovely locket love  
Cause a picture never does  
Try to expose you  
For what you put me through  
Hang on a little bit longer  
Hang on you're a goner  
  
Never never can tell  
How hard you fell  
Lovely lovely locket 'cause  
The best poison of  
  
Lovely lovely locket love  
You got a pocket of  
Lovely little tricks you do  
Now I'm hangin' too  
Hang on a little bit longer  
Hang on you're a goner
