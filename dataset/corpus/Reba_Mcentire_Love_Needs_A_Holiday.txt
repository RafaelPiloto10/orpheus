She was circling the Holiday Inn  
Just about to go 'round again  
When her cell phone rang  
And it was him sayin', "Room 183"  
  
They've never done this before  
But when he met her at the door  
They broke out smiling 'cause they were sure  
That this is what they need  
She said, "Mama's got the kids"  
And he said, "We got the room for the weekend"  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
He hung out the 'Do Not Disturb'  
To shut out the rest of the world  
48 hours of just him and her  
You can't get this at home  
  
She pulled the covers back and  
He said, "Yeah I'm in to that"  
They flopped down together and took a nap  
No, you can't get this at home  
They woke up in each other's arms  
And that's where they spent the rest of the weekend  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
Room service dinner with candles and wine  
A night with no homework and no baby crying  
They hold each other like they used to do  
He whispers, "Girl, I've missed you"  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but it's hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday, needs a holiday  
  
He hung out the 'Do Not Disturb'  
Love needs a holiday  
(Love needs a holiday)  
Just shut out the rest of the world  
Love needs a holiday  
(Love needs a holiday)
