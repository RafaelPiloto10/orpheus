The old man stopped and thought  
Well, now I'm 85  
And while I'm still alive  
I must rectify a few things  
  
I never dreamed way back when I was 21  
There'd be so much left undone  
And I would never grow wings  
Should there be a need to delay my certain sunset  
Will there be a plan for me to try?  
  
I know the only way to fly  
I must find a golden eagle  
Resting somewhere on the ground  
And ride him ever westward  
Never see the sun go down  
  
Sometimes the challenge presses hard upon my brow  
And I know the time is now  
But my wits are stiff and swollen  
I pay my dues and limp a rough and rocky climb  
As I try to buy some time  
Before the dark has fallen  
  
I am but a man  
Can I stop encroaching shadows?  
Would that I could keep the black away  
I have a scheme to save the day  
  
I will find a golden eagle  
Resting somewhere on the ground  
And ride him ever westward  
Never see the sun go down  
And I'll ride him for circles  
A hundred million times  
And then if I have finished  
All the half-done chores that I'm now facing  
I'll bring him on home
