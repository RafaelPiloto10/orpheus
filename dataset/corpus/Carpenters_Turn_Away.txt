I guess you know what it's all about  
All the answers seem so clear to you  
You know just exactly what do you want to do  
And never allow a feeling of doubt  
I guess you see where your road can lead  
And all the pain that you have in store  
For now you have chosen to lock every door  
And find on your own what you think you need  
(Think you need)  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
I'll still be calling your name  
And if I tried to show you how  
Tomorrow is never like yesterday  
Would you change your mind and see things my way  
(Try and and see things my way)  
Or are you afraid that I'll bring you down?  
(Bring you down)  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  
Turn away, find a way of your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  
Turn away, find a way of your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  
Turn away, find a way of your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name
