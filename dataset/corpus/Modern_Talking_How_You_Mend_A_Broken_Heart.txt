Oh, Somewhere There Is A Chance For Me  
I Said To My Friends And Family  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
And Somewhere There's A Love For Me  
  
I Want To Find My Own Reality  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
Tell Me There's A Heaven - I Know That's It's No Dream  
Sometime's I'm High And Low Girl - And Sometime's Inbetween  
  
Tell Me How You Mend A Broken Heart  
I Don't want to Be The Lonely Eye  
Tell Me How I Find A Brand New Start  
I Will Never Be A Heart Survivor  
I Will Make My Dreams Come True  
Oh, I Will Try - Just For Me And You  
  
It's All Or Nothing - Forever Girl  
I Said Goodbye To My Old Old World  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
And Somewhere More Than Thousand Miles Away  
  
I'll Find My Heart - But, I Have To Say  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
I Will Find My Heaven - I'm Halfway To My Dream  
I See A Tiny River - Like In An Old Old Movie Scene
