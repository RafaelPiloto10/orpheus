Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear  
Sealed with lies through so many tears  
Lost from within, pursuing the end  
I fight for the chance to be lied to again  
  
You never were strong enough  
You you never were good enough  
You were never conceived in love  
You will not rise above  
  
[Chorus]  
They'll never see  
I'll never be  
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger  
Burning deep inside of me  
  
But through my tears breaks a blinding light  
Birthing a dawn to this endless night  
Arms outstretched, awaiting me  
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree  
  
Rest in me and I'll comfort you  
I have lived and I died for you  
Abide in me and I vow to you  
I will never forsake you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
