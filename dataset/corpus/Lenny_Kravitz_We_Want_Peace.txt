Come on people  
It's time to get together  
It's time for the revolution!  
  
Here is once again in our face  
Why haven't we learn from our past  
We're at the crossroads of our human race  
Why are we kicking our own ass  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We're on the eve of destruction my friends  
We are about to go to far  
Politicians think that war is the way  
But we know that love has the power  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
The solution is simple and fame  
There won't be peace if we don't try  
In a war there is nothing to gain  
When so many people will die  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast
