We're much too young and life's so big  
We don't know yet what the future brings  
In its hands for us  
What tomorrow brings the future knows  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
We are united  
Young and proud  
  
Young and proud  
We're marching on the same side of destiny  
On the same side of destiny  
Anyway anyway you do it wrong  
  
I'm calling out your name  
But you never hear me  
Anyway anyway you do it wrong  
I'm giving you my love  
  
Though it's never for sale  
Anyway anyway...
