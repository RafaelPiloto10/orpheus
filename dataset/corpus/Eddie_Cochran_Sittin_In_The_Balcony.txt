I'm just a-sittin' in the balcony  
Just a-watchin' the movie  
Or maybe it's a symphony, I wouldn't know  
I don't care about the symphonies  
Just a-cymballs and a-timpanies  
  
I'm just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row  
I'll hold your hand and I'll kiss you too  
The feature's over, but we're not through  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony  
  
Holdin' hands in the balcony  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row  
  
We may stop lovin' to watch Bugs Bunny  
But he can't take the place of my honey  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony  
Just a-snootchin' in the balcony  
  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row  
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin'  
With my baby in the very last row
