Are you ticklish  
Or did I just hit a funny bone  
Are you ticklish  
Are we really alone?  
  
Do you like me  
Or am I just hoping for too much  
Do you like me  
Do you like to touch  
Do you like me  
  
I hear there's another side to you  
Well there's another side to me too  
Let's get over to the other side  
Real soon  
  
I hear there's an underneath to you  
Well there's an underneath to me too  
Let's get down underneath  
Real soon  
  
Are you lonesome  
Well everybody's lonesome  
So it's safe to assume you're lonesome  
But are you ticklish  
Are you ticklish
