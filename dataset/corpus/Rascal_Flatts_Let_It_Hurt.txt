Seven forty two in the morning  
Eight seconds before it all sinks in  
Put your best face on for the world  
Fake another smile and just pretend  
But you're just puttin' off the pain  
Nothing's ever really gonna change  
  
So let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Let it burn to the worst degree  
May not be what you want, but it's what you need  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
And let it hurt  
Yeah, let it hurt  
  
Three twenty eight in the morning  
Countin' up the spaces between the rain  
You're gettin' used to the rocks at the bottom  
Your heart goes numb, but the lonely stays the same  
And that's the price you're bound to pay  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
Oh, there's only just one way  
  
So let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Let it burn to the worst degree  
May not be what you want, but it's what you need  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
So go on  
Yeah, let it hurt  
  
You might just find you're better for it  
When you let go and you learn  
To let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Oh  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
So go on  
And let it hurt  
Oh, let it hurt  
  
Seven forty two in the morning  
Eight seconds before it all sinks in
