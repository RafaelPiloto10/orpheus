So we're lookin' out on the world and what do we see  
Another screen full of horror, another atrocity,  
What can I do as simple man who wants to make a difference,  
Wants to do what he can, not just talk about it.  
  
Stone drops in a pond, stirs the sediment, sends ripples, to the edge of the
world,  
  
A teenage boy with a rubber band around his arm, finds a vein and a back road
into the dark and stops the pain.  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
A young woman with a deadly belt around her waist,  
Steps on the bus with no regret for her life and the lives she will take,  
A leader in the rapture of his absolute right will not connect with a young
man wrapped in the flag, in a black bag.  
  
Voice raised in a room of silence, conquers fear, takes action, starts the
journey, starts the journey  
  
Baby born with an open mind and a trusting face has no regard for distinction,
says to have hope is to be human  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again
