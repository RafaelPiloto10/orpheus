I'm older than I wish to be  
This town holds no more for me  
All my life I try to find another way  
I don't care for your attitude  
You bring me down I think you're rude  
All my life I try to make a better day  
  
It's hard enough being alone  
Sitting here by the phone  
Waiting for my memories  
To come and play  
  
It's hard enough sitting there  
Rockin' in your rockin' chair  
It's all too much for me to take  
When you're not there  
  
It's hard enough being alone  
Sitting here by the phone  
Waiting for my memories  
To come and play  
  
It's hard enough sitting there  
Rockin' in your rockin' chair  
It's all too much for me to take  
When you're not there
