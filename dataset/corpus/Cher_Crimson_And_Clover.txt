Elijah:  
  
Ohhhh  
  
Now I don't hardly know her  
But I think I could love her  
Crimson and clover  
  
Ahhhhh  
  
She would ya' come walkin' over  
Now I been waitin' to show her  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over  
  
Cher:  
  
Yeeeeeah  
  
Yeah my mind's such a sweet thing  
Wanna do everything  
What a beautiful feeling  
  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over  
  
Crimson and clover  
Over and over X10
