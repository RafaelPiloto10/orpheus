Did I park my car?  
If I found it I would drive so far from here  
The city streets are dim  
And my hands are tempted once again  
To give in  
  
I'm having trouble seeing  
I'm punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
It'd be a miracle if you'd oblige  
  
I will survive  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight?  
  
On the road my thumb is out  
I'm hitchin' home tonight I am without a name  
Where was it that I lived?  
Well nevermind just take me with you  
And forget  
  
The lack of information  
I'm punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
It'd be a miracle if you'd oblige  
  
I will survive  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight?  
  
I will survive  
Tonight I wander and I roam  
Just lookin' for a way back home tonight  
  
The sun is coming up  
I think I've had my fill  
Wait, who the fuck are you?  
Where did I park my car?  
Please forgive my  
  
Lack of information  
I'm punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
It'd be a miracle, oh  
  
I'm having trouble seeing  
I'm punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
It'd be a miracle if you'd oblige  
  
I will survive  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight?  
  
I will survive  
Tonight I wander and I roam  
Just lookin' for a way back home tonight  
  
Spare me, a ride, a ride tonight  
Spare me, a ride, a ride tonight  
  
(On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight?)
