Oh no  
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath  
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh  
I made a promise to myself last night  
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I lose it all  
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall  
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing  
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it  
I lose it all, if I lose it all  
  
Wouldn't matter anyway  
  
Don't change a thing  
Perfect as you are  
Time has a way  
Time is all I've got  
If my heart should shatter watching you  
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we will be waiting when I fall into your open arms  
I believe you'll find me there  
You'll find me there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Wouldn't matter anyway
