Well it's good to know that you'll be okay  
I've been waiting for this and I'll be there  
To sit while you pray no one's blaming me I'm  
Not supposed to wait when they open up your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I have been good I understood and  
Like a machine they'll fix you from  
The start I'm in repair the life that  
We share I know that I'll be lost  
But we are always in repair  
  
And it's good to know that you'll drive away  
From this car crash nightmare and  
I'll be there to help you again there's  
No danger we're just killing time  
Again until they order up new parts  
  
[Chorus]
