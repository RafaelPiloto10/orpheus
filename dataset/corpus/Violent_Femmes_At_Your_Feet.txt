At your feet would fall many kings  
At your feet will fall many things  
At your hands I'd kiss every one of your rings  
And this song in silence sings... my love  
At your feet I'd kiss every one of your cool toes  
My dumb heart is not as smart as what a fool knows  
At your kiss I'd curse everyone  
For my bad luck I wish but to whisper  
"I love you" but I will not not fuck up your life  
At your feet will fall many tears  
And your hands will form many fears  
Before your face will pace many a peer  
I'm the one who comes but to disappear  
And reappear oh my dear  
I want you near... here  
At your feet would fall many queens  
At your feet the willow tree leans  
And my love will follow you there  
Lightning strikes but I don't know where  
Is my love  
I love you  
All my life
