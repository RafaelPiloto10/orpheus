Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine  
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul  
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning  
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah  
  
We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever  
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits  
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending  
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air  
  
In dreams I think of you  
I don't know what to do with myself  
Time has let me down  
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,  
the endless search for where you are  
(sail on, sail on)  
  
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine  
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul  
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady  
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!  
  
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!  
Don't leave your heart on the other side!  
Her eyes are an endless flame  
Desire with a special name  
Don't ever fall in love!  
Don't give your heart away!  
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!
