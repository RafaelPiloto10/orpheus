Don't be sad that it's over  
Just be happy that it happened to us  
Don't look back and remember  
Drunken tears, oh remember the love  
  
In my head, I see you laughing  
From the words I said, felt like a new beginning  
In my head, I see you standing there  
The words you said felt like a story ending  
  
We will never, ever be the same  
Picture's changing, but not the frame  
When I'm sleeping, I still kiss your face  
I can't have it, when I'm awake  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted, we can't turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic  
  
I wonder if you're wearing  
That gold chain with a promise from me  
Honestly felt so real then  
Even now it's not hard to believe  
  
In my head, I see you laughing  
From the words I said, felt like a new beginning  
In my head, I see you standing there  
The words you said felt like a story ending  
  
We will never, ever be the same  
Picture's changing, but not the frame  
When I'm sleeping, I still kiss your face  
I can't have it, when I'm awake  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted, we can't turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic  
  
[Bridge]  
We will never, ever be the same  
We will never, ever be the same  
We will never, ever be the same  
Never be the same  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted, we can't turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic  
  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Even if we wanted, we can't turn back the hands of time  
And I know we lost it, I still get nostalgic  
Nostalgic
