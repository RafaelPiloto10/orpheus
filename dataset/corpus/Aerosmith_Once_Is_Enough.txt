Been lucked out  
Broke a woman's heart  
With only myself to blame  
Fate ran it's course  
I suffered a loss  
I learned a lesso in pain  
  
Cheated, lied  
I took love for granted  
Oh, I paid the price  
I won't last a night  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
  
Love went trough such sudden change  
Taken a turn for the worst  
The joy turned to fear  
The pain got so severe  
Lord, I thought I was cursed  
  
Get what you give  
It comes around full circle  
Oh, I paid the price  
Love so fast  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough
