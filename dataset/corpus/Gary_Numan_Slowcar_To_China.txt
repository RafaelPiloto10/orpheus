She'll take a slowcar to China  
She'll pay the rent for the use of you  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
She'll pay the rent for the use of you tonight.  
  
We are not afraid to love, but no new ideas  
You almost get used to such things you know.  
The mechanics on the phone again, we break down.  
The others you'd remember if I could spare some time.  
  
In love with this elegant bitch  
And here am I just a shy young fool  
In love with this elegant bitch  
She only sparkles at times for you tonight.  
  
She forgets that we know,  
She forgets who we are  
  
I suppose the things I overheard were quite by chance  
The only story I ever knew or cared for  
Best left unheard I suppose, don't you?  
You look for somewhere to start to look  
  
We'll take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here  
We'll take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here tonight.  
  
I forgot not to call,  
And now we're out of love.  
  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head tonight.  
  
There's nothing much to keep us alive, but 'Dance'.  
All that she can say is goodbye. All things change I suppose  
We'll sing without voice, without heart and leave no address  
I well never ever see you again. I know.  
  
Don't take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one so  
Don't take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one here tonight.  
  
You will pay like before.  
Always one step behind.  
You will pay Mr Jones.  
Always one step away.  
  
There's no one here to leave you behind but me.
