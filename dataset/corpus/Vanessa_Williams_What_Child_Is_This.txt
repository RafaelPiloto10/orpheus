What child is this who laid to rest  
on Mary's lap asleeping  
whom angels breed with anthems sweet  
while shepherds watch our keeping  
  
This, this is Christ the king  
whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
  
Haste, haste bring him lord  
the babe the son of Mary  
  
So bring him incense, bring him gold  
come pleasant king to him  
The king of kings salvations brings  
let loving hearts enthrone him  
  
Raise, raise the son on high  
the virgin sings a lullaby  
  
Joy, joy for Christ is born  
the babe was son of Mary  
  
What child is this who laid to rest

Raise, raise the son on high  
the virgin sings a lullaby  
  
Joy, joy for Christ is born  
the babe was son of Mary
