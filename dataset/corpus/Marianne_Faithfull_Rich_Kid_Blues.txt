Havin' bad times, now I'm paying dues,  
Got shoes and money, good friends, too.  
I always play to win, and always seem to lose,  
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues.  
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues.  
  
And I know what's going on,  
And I know that the way is too long.  
And I know just exactly what's on your mind,  
You'll be back and I'll lose you forever.  
  
But I'm wondering why, girl, should I ask your name  
All the people standing by, are they in my game ?  
Love is just a story, a story without words,  
Words are even never seen and never even heard.  
  
And I know what's going on,  
And I know that the way is too long.  
And I know just exactly what's on your mind,  
You'll be back and I'll lose you forever.
