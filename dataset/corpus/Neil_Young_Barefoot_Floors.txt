Sleep, baby sleep,  
I know your day has been oh so long  
Sleep, baby sleep,  
I know your day has been oh so long  
The night falls at your feet  
Now the day feels so complete  
Compared to darkness  
Sleep, baby sleep.  
  
Talk, baby talk  
Sweet talk is all it's made of  
Talk, baby talk  
Sweet talk is all it's made of  
Promises of the morning ways,  
New beginnings for another  
Day to spend together  
Talk, baby talk.  
  
Love, baby love  
Has got me walkin' on these  
Barefoot floors  
Love, baby love  
Has got me walkin' on these  
Barefoot floors  
Find the light  
Surrounding you  
Sleep the night 'til morning's dew  
I will be here for you  
Love, baby love.
