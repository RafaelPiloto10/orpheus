Jojo was a man who thought he was a woman, but he knew it couldn't last  
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona for some California grass.  
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged  
Get back Jojo, go home, get back, get back Joe  
Sweet Loretta Molin thought she was a woman, but she was another man  
All the other girls around here said she's got it coming  
But she gets it while she can.  
Oh, get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged  
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged  
Get back Loretta, go home, get back to where you where you once belonged  
Get back, your monny's waiting for you  
Wearing her high heeled shoes and her low neck sweater, get back home Loretta
