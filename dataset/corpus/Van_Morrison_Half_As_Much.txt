If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do  
You're nice to me when there's no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never be this blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
  
If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do  
You're nice to me when there's no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never be this blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
One more time  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
