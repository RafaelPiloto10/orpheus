I was born on the muddy water  
I didn't know right from wrong  
My ma said, ''now look here son  
I'll show you how it's done  
Take you a woman and treat her right  
She'll be by your side night and day  
The first time you deceive her  
You've broken her spell''  
But then I had bad blood  
Like a fool I fell where I stood  
I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied  
Tryin' to find a dry place to hide  
To hide.  
Well I'd rather sleep than say a word  
I don't believe a word is heard  
The first time I deceived you  
I held it inside  
Take you a woman and treat her right  
She'll be by your side every night and day  
The first time you deceive her  
You've broken her spell  
I held it inside  
Like a fool I swallowed my pride  
I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied  
Tryin' to find a dry place to hide  
I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied  
Tryin' to find a dry place to hide  
To hide.  
I was walking in the rain
