We were going together for a long long time and it breaks my heart girl  
To see you walking with some other guy  
I been sitting alone here with a worried head  
I've been talking to some downtown girls but don't believe the things that I
have said  
  
Cause girl don't you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I don't really love you, I don't really want you,  
I don't want to have you, I don't really love you  
  
Now we're hitting the daylight, morning looking sad  
Never knew a guy could feel as lonely as I'm feelin oh so bad  
Time is going slowly dragging like a weight  
Like to say I'm sorry but deep down in my heart it's just too late  
  
Cause girl don't you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I don't really want you, I don't really need you,  
I don't want to have you, I don't really love you  
  
We were going together for a long long time  
And it breaks my heart girl to see you walking with some other guy  
Still I keep on trying lonely as I've been  
Got to get your sweet, sweet smile to get that lovin feeling back again  
  
Cause girl don't you know I only tried to hide the pain when I said  
I don't really want you, I don't really need you, I don't want to have you,  
I don't really love you, I don't really want you I don't really need you,  
I don't want to have you, I don't really love you
