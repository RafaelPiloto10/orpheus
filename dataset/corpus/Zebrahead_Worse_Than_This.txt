I know things will get better when I stop looking out through a broken
window...  
I know things will get better when I just break down that door...  
I can fall down, get pushed around, plant myself into the ground but...  
I know things will get better cause it just can't get any worse than this...  
  
TRAPPED ANOTHER ONE!  
I'm bad fish, served on a cold dish, never gonna get it right cause I'm high
and I'm foolish...  
I never fit in, no matter where I'm sittin'... if the story's got a hero, then
I guess that I'm the villain.  
  
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh...) what you got, what you got?... I'll keep my head
low!  
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh...) what you got, what you got?... Can't let it go!  
  
I know things will get better when I stop looking out through a broken
window...  
(Ooh-woah-oh-oh...)  
I know things will get better when I just break down that door... (HEY! )  
Fall down, get pushed around, plant myself into the ground but...  
I know things will get better cause it just can't get any worse than this...  
  
Just can't get any worse than this... No it just can't get any worse than
this...  
  
I spread a mean lie, my hope is low fly, riding on a curse the worse my tank
is bone dry.  
I'm fortune tellin', you're not buying what I'm sellin', if that look is a
cry... then call me a villain...  
  
So (Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh...) what you got, what you got?... I'll keep my head

(Ooh-woah-oh-oh...)  
I know things will get better when I just break down that door... (HEY! )  
Fall down, get pushed around, plant myself into the ground but...  
I know things will get better cause it just can't get any worse than this...  
  
So pathetic, just forget it now (Woah-oh-oh! )... never make it sit and pass
it round (Woah-oh-oh! )...  
Disappointment apathy, I'll take a double shot of misery (HEY! )... you can't
fake it so far, hold it down... (Woah-oh-oh! )...  
Yeah ignorance is bliss, but it can't get worse than this...
