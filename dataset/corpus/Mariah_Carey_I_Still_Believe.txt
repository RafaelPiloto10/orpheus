No, oh No.... Yeah, Yeah... Oh..  
You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside  
I know its crazy, but you still can touch my heart  
And after all this time you think that I wouldn't feel the same  
But time hasn't done nothing, nothing has changed  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I had a dream  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
Each day of my life, I am filled with all the joy I could find  
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type  
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'd hold it with both  
Hands  
It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance  
  
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby  
I still believe that we can be together, no  
If we believe that true love never has to end  
Then we must know that we will love again, mmm..  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again (Oh, baby, yeah)  
  
I had a dream  
You and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I still believe (Ooh, baby, I do)  
Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)  
In love again  
  
I had a dream (I miss your love)  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me(will find ourselves in love...)
