[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]  
Uh, smoke weed everyday  
  
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]  
Young niggas get rich  
Rich niggas gon' ball  
Y'all niggas ask prices  
My niggas buy it all  
Rockin' shit that's foreign  
Driving brand new cars  
Youngest nigga in charge  
Now your bitch at large  
Hol up, what they sayin'  
OG Kush in my plane  
Diamonds all in my chain  
Young nigga doin' his thing  
Young nigga gon' stunt  
Buy whatever he want  
My section very important  
Came through the back, not the front (ooh!)  
Smokin' and flying  
No drinking and driving  
I ball till I fall  
Got no need for retiring  
Y'all niggas stessed out  
My niggas just chillin'  
Young niggas in the building  
Young niggas get millions  
  
[Chorus: Rico Love]  
And I want to celebrate  
Celebrate livin'  
I could've been dead  
I could've been in prison  
So I'ma celebrate  
Celebrate ballin'  
Back then I had no phone  
Now all these bitches callin'  
Smoke, drink, blow checks  
Rolex, more sex  
Cause I can afford it  
I fucked around and just bought it  
So I want to celebrate  
Celebrate livin'  
Celebrate livin'  
Look how we livin'  
  
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]  
Rich niggas go hard  
Never wanna be broke  
Broke niggas just hate  
Never wanna be rich  
Rich niggas buy it all  
Buy it all for the click  
Buy it all for my dawgs  
You buy it all for a bitch  
Broke niggas be jokin'  
Little niggas need coaching  
Them bottles ain't even open  
Homie, that ain't the shit  
My chain shit on your car  
My rolex fucked your bitch  
My chain shit on your car  
My rolex fucked your bitch  
Just came home from tour  
Half a mill when I'm bored  
Y'all niggas can't afford it  
Rich niggas want more  
Y'all niggas tapped out  
Rich niggas want more  
Bitch nigga I'm ballin'  
Rich nigga, Mike Jordan  
  
[Chorus: Rico Love]
