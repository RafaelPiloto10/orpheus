In between the doubts and the dreamin'  
Comes my humble quest for a plan.  
I've been out there hoverin' by,  
Don't forget to pull me in sometimes.  
Will you be with me as I make my journey  
Through the labyrinth of time?  
And I'm still waitin' for the good Lord  
To show me the way, babe.  
This is who you see, this is who I am.  
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,  
Just an ordinary man.  
Will my reckless courage invite you  
To become my clever companion?  
Madly in love and in love with the madness,  
Get ready to run baby.  
This is who you see, this is who I am.  
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,  
Just an ordinary man.  
Enjoyin' the ride,  
Savor the simple pleasure  
With you by my side.  
Who you see, this is who I am.  
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,  
Just an ordinary man.
