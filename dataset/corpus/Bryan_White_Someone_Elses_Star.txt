Alone again tonight  
Without someone to love  
The stars are shining bright  
So one more wish goes up  
Oh I wish I may, and I wish with all my might  
For the love I'm dreaming of  
And missing in my life  
  
You'd think that I could find  
A true love of my own  
It happens all the time to people that I know  
Their wishes all come true  
So I've got to believe  
That there's still someone out there who  
Is meant for only me  
  
[Chorus]  
I guess I must be wishing on someone else's star  
Seems like someone else  
Keeps getting what I'm wishing for  
Why can't I be as lucky as those other people are  
I guess I must be wishing on someone else's star  
  
I sit here in the dark  
And stare up at the sky  
And I can't give my heart  
One good reason why  
Everywhere I look  
It's lovers that I see  
Seems like everyone's in love  
With everyone but me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why can't I be as lucky as those other people are  
Oh I guess I must be wishing  
On someone else's star
