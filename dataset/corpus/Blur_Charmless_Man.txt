I met him in a crowded room  
Where people go to drink away their gloom  
He sat me dawn and so began, the story of a charmless man  
Educated the expensive way, he knows his Claret from a Beaujolais  
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray  
But then nature didn't make him that way  
  
He thinks he's educated, airs those family shares  
Will protect him that we will respect him  
He moves in circles of friends  
Who just pretend that they like him  
He does the same to them, and when you put it all together  
There's the model of a charmless man  
  
He knows the swingers and their cavalry  
Says he can get in anywhere for free  
I began to go a little cross eyed  
And from this charmless man I just had to hide  
  
He talks at speed he gets nosebleeds  
He doesn't see his days  
Are tumbling down upon him  
And yet he tries so hard to please  
He's just so keen for you to listen  
But no one is listening  
And when you put it all together  
There's the model of a charmless man
