Pollards mumbling here  
Rings of blue and  
Rings of gold  
So many stories to be told  
It hurts be worse than it hurt you  
You realize now that's not true..oohh  
Amber, neon, wet concrete  
A well-worn track a smothering heat  
They curious pet in an open cage subjected  
To his masters rage. oohh

A portait destroyed by fire
