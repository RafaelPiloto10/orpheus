Our finest gifts we bring pa rum pum pum pum  
To lay before the King pa rum pum pum pum

So to honor him pa rum pum pum pum  
When we come  
  
Little baby pa rum pum pum pum

That's fit to give a King pa rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum  
Shall I play for you pa rum pum pum pum  
On my drum

The ox and ass kept time pa rum pum pum pum
