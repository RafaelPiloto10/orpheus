Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters  
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea  
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently  
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee  
  
Every time I look into the Holy Book I wanna tremble  
When I read about the part where a carpenter cleared the temple  
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellers than what I confess
to be  
And it causes me shame to know I'm not the gal that I should be  
Put your hand in the hand...  
  
Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven  
And when I'm down on my knees that's when I'm close to heaven  
Daddy lived his life for eight kids and wife you do what you must do  
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through  
Put your hand in the hand...  
Put your hand in the hand...  
Put your hand in the hand...
