I get up in the morning  
For my dose of the news  
Crawl right back in the sack girl  
Had enough of the truth  
  
Spend your dollars and rubels  
Buy a piece of the wall  
Build it up in your backyard  
I'm so sick of it all  
  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
  
Drivin' down to the city  
Doin' 155  
Better late than never  
I'm more dead than alive  
  
We can find the Titanic  
Put a man on the moon  
But we can't fix out backyard  
Man we better start soon  
  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
  
I don't want to hear about it  
I wish it would be worlds away  
You know the more I think about it  
The more I feel we need to change  
  
I get up (In a crazy, crazy world)  
We all live (In a crazy, crazy world)  
Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world)  
I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world)  
  
Goin' home to my baby  
It's been another hard day  
Bust my balls for the tax man  
So what else can I say  
  
They spent our money on missiles  
For the third world war  
Now they're stacked in my backyard  
We don't need them no more  
  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world
