No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around  
Christian Brothers going to take him down  
But it can't help me get over  
  
Don't be cross, it's sick what I want  
I've seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man  
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand  
Well, I know how much you care  
  
Don't be cross, it's sick what I want  
I've seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Come here by me, I want you here  
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear  
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
