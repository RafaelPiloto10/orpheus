I've got the key to the highway  
Billed out and bound to go  
Gonna leave here runnin'  
Walking is most too slow  
I'm going back, back to the border  
Where I'm better known  
I'm going back to the border, baby  
And all you can do is mourn  
When the moon peeps over the mountain  
Yes baby, I'll be on my way  
I'm gonna roll this highway until the break of day  
When I was so long, so long, baby  
Yes baby, I must say goodbye  
I'm gonna roam this highway until the day I die  
Give me one more kiss, baby  
Yes, before I go long  
When I leave this time  
I ain't comin' back no more
