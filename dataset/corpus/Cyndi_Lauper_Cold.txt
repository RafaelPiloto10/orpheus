I met a man who drew the line  
He couldn't cross his fear of intimacy  
He just sighed  
Because he left behind all his fantasy  
ooh-hoo, ooh, woo, woo, yeah  
  
If you build a wall up, high  
You start to crumble  
And you never know why  
Your tears never dry  
  
If you're running from the vision  
That's in your eyes  
There's a collision with what's inside  
This ain't livin'  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
  
You say you need a little time  
To heal from some romantic injury  
And I say fine  
But if you change your mind  
You can lean on me  
ooh, woo, woo, yeah  
  
But I'm going on with my life, oh  
I've seen it everyday  
People get burned  
And they throw love away  
  
If you're running from the vision  
That's in your eyes  
There's a collision with what's inside  
This ain't livin'  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
  
If you build a wall up, high  
You start to crumble  
And you never know why  
Your tears never dry  
  
If you're running from the vision  
That's in your eyes  
There's a collision with what's inside  
This ain't livin'  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
  
Cold, so cold  
Cold, so cold  
Cold, cold, cold, cold  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
It's coming from the kitchen  
It's coming from the sky  
It's coming round the corner  
Straight for you and I  
It gets so cold...
