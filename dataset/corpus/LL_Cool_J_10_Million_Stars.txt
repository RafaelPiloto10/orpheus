You can call it a comeback  
I lay back, analyze the rhymes and realize  
I own that crown for lyrical combat  
Spit more raps to count more stacks  
Kicking back in the coup  
I got loops relax, I'm hotness  
Monotonous fans is running bizzack  
L please don't leave the game like thizzat  
Never in a million years  
I'll never let you down baby  
I drop 50, I steal gravy  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I look back on Venus  
I look (I look) back on Mars  
And (and) I burn with the fire  
Of ten (of ten) million stars (LL: guess who's back, uh)  
  
I'm more then a conqueror  
Double up your bets  
Come and rumble with the decks  
I know you had that clown picked  
Mind blowing out 'cause L still sound sick  
You dream you was me  
I gleam lyrically  
I love 'em for it it's the highest form of flattery  
Doin' the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery  
My, clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'  
Rippers is just learning by stacks I been earnin'  
I'm the uncle, hell, future of the funk  
Turn my joint up, find out why I'm different from all these chumps  
And tell your favorite rapper that I'm ready to dump  
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Six figure interest on the cheddar  
From music, fashion, film and television  
Poppin' amaretto, so what got a vendetta?  
I never felt better  
Now forever competition get severed by skills you can't measure  
I'm a champ, you a peon  
Kiss the ring, begone  
Known and respected on any block you be on  
And be on, stand there, get your mad on  
I chuckle cause there's nothing to waste energy on  
There you have it  
The uncut raw for rap addicts  
Waited three years to see if L still had it  
Ten million stars  
Got beef to the deck  
End of my contract, I'm the last one left!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
L's worth paper  
Dash that damn who put em up in that skyscraper (yeah)  
(I take them seriously baby)  
Ask my dogs up in old five, who made a major?  
LL playa  
Now who's next to need a paper  
Drop a bomb on them  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I look back on Venus  
I look back on mars  
And I burn with the fire  
Of ten million stars
