There are things you should know  
The distance between us seems to grow  
But you're holding on strong  
Oh how hard is it to let go  
Oh so hard to let go  
  
I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
I'm losing my faith in you  
You don't want it to be true  
But there's nothing you can do  
There's nothing you can do  
Yes I lost my faith in you  
  
I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
How long we have to wait  
For love is fading so slowly  
I know it's too late  
Oh my God you're so lonely  
  
(2x)  
I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
In my heart  
In my heart  
In my heart
