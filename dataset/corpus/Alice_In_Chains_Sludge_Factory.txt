You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time  
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake, and I'm high?  
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time  
Twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size  
Carton size, carton size  
Call me up congratulations ain't the real why  
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day 9  
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time  
By the way, by the way, by the way  
Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away  
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me  
Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die  
You have always told me you'd not live past 25  
I say stay long enough to repay all who cause strife  
Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away  
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me (2x)  
"I bear true and an existing witness  
To this barrel of monkeys.  
A self proclaimed immoral success,  
Perfected by each whereof  
Individually deadly and equally so  
And spread about the surrendered troops,  
For even thousands of miles will not  
Tear apart their communication, or the lack thereof.  
Vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence  
In no suggestion or rhyme, your weapon is contained in  
The wrecking of the keeping the desired effect.  
The breaking of the spirit of what was once a whole being.  
Your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt.  
Guilt."
