I saw red, stayed at home  
Placed a big pillow over the phone  
In this town where I'm from  
I've learned two is so much better than one  
  
But you left me alone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
  
Well, you hurt to the core  
You used to kiss like no one had done before  
And your taste turned me on  
Now you drive me real crazy just by being born  
  
'Cause you left (left, left, left) me alone (left me alone)  
And you can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
  
Baba b-baba b-baba ba  
Baba b-baba b-baba ba  
  
Took the tram 'round the bay  
Where everyone tells you to have a nice day  
And my pride almost broke  
When the tears don't fit you, you look like a joke  
  
And you left (left, left, left) me alone (left me alone)  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Cryin' eyes gettin' worn  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
  
Hey, you left (left, left, left) me alone (left me alone)  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
Watch you sink like a stone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
  
Baba b-baba b-baba ba  
Baba b-baba b-baba ba
