Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing, anew,  
The song your heart first learned to sing when he  
First gave his life, to you,  
The life goes on and so must the song,  
You gotta sing, again,  
The song born in your soul when you  
First gave your heart, to him,  
Sing his praises, once more  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing, aloud,  
The song that someone is dying to hear  
Down in the madd'ning crowd,  
As you once were before your heard the song,  
You gotta let them know,  
The truth is a life to shine upon the way,  
So maybe they, can go,  
Sing his praises, once more  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to let the name of the Lord,  
Be praise, both for now, and evermore,  
Praise him all ye servants,  
  
Give him praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing, sing sing,  
Come on, sing, sing, sing,  
I can hear you now, sing, sing, sing,
