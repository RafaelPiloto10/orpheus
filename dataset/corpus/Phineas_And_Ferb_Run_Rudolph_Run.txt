Out of all the reindeer,  
You know you're the mastermind.  
Run, run, Rudolph.  
Randolph ain't too far behind.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run, run, Rudolph!  
Santa Claus is coming to town.  
Santa, make him hurry,  
Tell him he can take the freeway down.  
Run, run, Rudolph.  
'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round.  
  
Said Santa to a boy child,  
What have you been longing for?  
All I want for Christmas is a rock n' roll electric guitar.  
And then away went a-Rudolph, whizzing like a shootin' star.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Said Santa to a girl child,  
What would please you most to get.  
A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet.  
And then away went a-Rudolph, whizzing like a saber-jet.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run, run Rudolph! (x5)  
Randolph ain't too far behind.  
Isabella: Phineas, who's Randolph?  
Phineas: I have no idea.
