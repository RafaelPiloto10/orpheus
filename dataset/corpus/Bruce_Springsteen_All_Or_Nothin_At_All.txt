Said you'd give me just a little kiss  
And you'd rock me for a little while  
Well you'd slip me just a piece of it  
Listen up little child  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
Said you'd take me for a little dance  
If you had a little time on your hands  
Well all I do is push and shove  
Just to get a little piece of your love  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
Well now I don't want to be greedy  
But when it comes to love there ain't no doubt  
You just ain't gonna get what you want  
With one foot in and one foot out  
You got to give it all or nothin' at all  
All or nothin' at all  
Now I only got a little time  
So if you're gonna change your mind  
Then shout out what you're thinking of  
If what you're thinkin' of is love  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all
