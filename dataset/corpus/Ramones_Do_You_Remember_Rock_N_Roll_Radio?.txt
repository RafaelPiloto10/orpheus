(This is Rock 'n' roll radio  
Come on, let's rock 'n' roll with the Ramones)  
  
[Chorus]  
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio  
Let's go  
Rock'n, rock 'N' roll radio  
Let's go  
Rock'n, rock 'N' roll radio  
Let's go  
Rock'n, rock 'N' roll radio  
Let's go  
  
Do you remember Hullabaloo  
Upbeat, Shindig and Ed Sullivan, too?  
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?  
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?  
  
Do you remember Murray the Kid  
Alan Freed, and High Energy?  
It's the end, the end of the seventies  
It's the end, the end of the century  
  
Do you remember lying in bed  
With the covers pulled up over your head  
Radio playin' so no one can see?  
We need change, and we need it fast  
Before rock's just part of the past  
'Cause, lately, it all sounds the same to me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Will you remember Jerry Lee  
John Lennon, T. Rex and old Moulty?  
It's the end, the end of the seventies  
It's the end, the end of the century  
  
Do you remember lying in bed  
With the covers pulled up over your head  
Radio playin' so no one can see?  
We need change, and we need it fast  
Before Rock's just part of the past  
Cause, lately, it all sounds the same to me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(This is rock 'N' roll radio  
Stay tuned for more rock 'n' roll)
