I hold no grudge  
There's no resentment und'neath  
I'll extend the laurel wreath and we'll be friends  
But right there is where it ends  
  
I hold no grudge  
And I'll forgive you your mistake  
But forgive me if I take it all to heart  
And make sure that it doesn't start again  
  
Yes I'm the kind of people  
You can step on for a little while  
But when I call it quits  
Baby that's it  
I'm the kind of people  
You can hurt once in a while  
But crawling just ain't my style  
  
I hold no grudge  
Deep inside me there's no regrets  
But a gal who's been forgotten may forgive  
But never once forget
