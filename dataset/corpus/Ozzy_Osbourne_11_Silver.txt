Your words they go right through me  
They circle 'round my head, yeah  
I can't believe I'm still here  
I know I should be dead, yeah  
  
This desperation makes me feel so filthy  
But I know if I don't stop I won't feel guilty  
Take me higher  
Crabk me faster  
Help me get the  
Thrill I'm after  
  
One time to take away all pain  
One more to turn myself insane  
One time to keep me high all day  
Makes my reality fade away  
  
There is no future waiting  
There is no morning after  
Can't stop obsessive craving  
  
An itch I just can't scratch, yeah  
This paranoia stops my mind from sleeping  
I don't know if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming  
  
Take me in, you won't deny me  
Spit me out all bright and shiny  
  
One time to take away all pain  
One more to turn myself insane  
One time to keep me high all day  
Makes my reality fade away  
  
One time to take away all pain  
One more to turn myself insane  
One time to keep me high all day  
Makes my reality fade away
