Young man come to me  
And asked me for a smoke  
Straight off of Bourbon Street  
Alley cat with a dirty coat  
  
He said it's hard out here just being me  
And the people ain't the way that I want them to be  
When I get the chance to build this world I see  
Make me believe, this life's for me, and I will be free  
  
That night the architect can't sleep  
He laying out his plan  
For the building of a new foundation  
Put together by a million hands  
  
Beyond the wires just meant to fly  
Getting out there beyond the fences, into the sky  
You know I'll find a place for my design  
A new space for me and my piece of mind, yeah  
  
I'm gonna build a home by the ocean  
Underneath the sky  
Gonna leave the door wide open  
So I can see everything  
  
Gonna build a home by the ocean  
Burried in the sand  
Gonna leave the door wide open  
So I can sing  
  
I'm gonna build a home by the ocean  
Underneath the sky  
Gonna leave the door wide open  
So I can see everything  
  
Gonna build a home by the ocean  
Burried in the sand  
I'm gonna leave the door wide open  
So I can sing  
  
Woah Woah Woah  
  
So I can see everything
