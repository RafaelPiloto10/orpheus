[Incomprehensible]  
Fell real good wavin' your hands in the air  
Admit two shots in the atmosphere  
Put 'em up, put 'em up  
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend  
The one you let hit it and never called you again  
Remember when he told you he was about the Benjamins?  
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim  
To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend  
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?  
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him  
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again  
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian  
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin  
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in  
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?  
Showing off your ass 'cause your thinking it's a trend  
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again  
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine  
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem  
Baby girl, respect is just the minimum  
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him  
Now Lauryn is only human  
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament  
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been  
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in  
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans  
Fake nails up out Koreans  
Come again  
Yo, when when come again  
When when come again  
My friend come again  
Guys you know you'd better, watch out  
Some girls, some girls are only, about  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
The second verse is dedicated to the men  
More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women  
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans  
Don't care who they offend poppin' game, like you got yen  
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pissed out by they waste men  
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement  
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men  
Need to take care of their three and four kids  
But they face a court case when the child support's late  
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men  
The sleepy silent men, the punk domestic violence men  
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?  
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?  
Come again  
Yo yo, come again  
Bro-straight come again  
Sit straight come again  
Watch out, watch out  
Look out, look out  
Watch out, watch out  
Look out, look out  
Watch out, watch out  
Look out, look out  
Watch out, watch out  
Look out, look out  
Girls you know you'd better, watch out  
Some guys, some guys are only about  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
Guys you know you'd better, watch out  
Some girls, some girls are only about  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
Girls you know you'd better, watch out  
Some guys, some guys are only about  
That thing, that thing, that thing  
That thing, that thing, that thing
