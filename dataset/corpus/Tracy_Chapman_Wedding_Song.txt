I've been having dreams and visions  
In them you are always standing  
Right beside me  
I reach out for your hand  
To see your arms extending  
outstretched towards me  
  
For you I don the veil  
By your light  
Others pale by comparison  
I place my faith in love  
My fate in this communion  
  
I've been having dreams and visions  
In them you are always standing  
Right beside me  
I reach out for your hand  
To see your arms extending  
Outstretched towards me  
  
To you I give my pledge  
I honor all that's good  
In this life we're living  
To think not only of myself  
But of the greater union  
  
Can I get a witness  
There is salvation and rapture for the lonely  
Can I get a witness  
Bless this day sacred and holy  
Sacred and Holy  
  
I've been having dreams and visions  
In them you are always standing  
Right beside me  
I reach out for your hand  
To see your arms extending  
Outstretched towards me  
  
With you I am revealed  
All my shame all my faults and virtues  
Behold body mind and spirit  
Heart and soul devoted all to you  
  
Can I get a witness  
There is salvation and rapture for the lonely  
Can I get a witness  
Bless this day sacred and holy  
Sacred and Holy
