There's nothing I can say  
There's nothing I can do  
To show you the love  
That I got for you  
  
There's nothing in this world  
That could ever take your place  
When I look into your eyes  
I see a sweet face  
  
I'll never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I love you (I'll never set, set you free)  
And I need you (I'll never set, set you free)  
Yes, I want you (I'll never set, set you free)  
'Cause I love you (I'll never set, set you free)  
  
Will you open up your heart  
So love could make a start?  
I know that if you do  
Dreams will come true  
  
I'll never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
There's nothing you can do  
To stop my love for you  
  
[Chorus]
