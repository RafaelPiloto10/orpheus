[Verse 1]  
Magpies on fire  
Making love like little whirls on out the porch can lead to medicine  
Oh well, I'm game for anything at all  
Scarecrows are liars  
Spins the yarn and no one ever checks it out to see if it was real  
Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall  
All along it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love  
  
[Hook]  
What more do you want  
How much more can you take  
I love my mistakes  
I've been here before  
  
[Bridge]  
All in all it's just the call of something wild beyond your room  
There's a changing of the major chord  
Your minor thread will do, love  
  
[Verse 2]  
My gun misfired, shot myself instead  
I guess I always knew I'd be the one to lose  
Light screen door slams, time to make a move  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Bridge]  
All along it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love  
A bird who's born to live at half your age, girl  
A bird who never really had a say  
  
[Hook]  
All along it's like a bird who's now been freed from someone's cage
