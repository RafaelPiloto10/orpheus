There's nowhere to run from the heat of the sun  
There's nowhere to hide from your face  
Black is the night, won't you show me the light  
The road only leads to one place  
  
For your love and emotion  
I promise you love till I die  
Faith as deep as the ocean  
Keeps me believin' you're alive  
  
There's nowhere to run from the things that we've done  
There's nowhere to hide from the truth  
Something is wrong when my woman is gone  
My world ain't no good without you  
  
For your love and affection  
I give you my soul for all time  
Faith as high as a mountain  
Keeps me believin' you're mine  
  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
For your love and emotion  
I promise you love till I die  
Faith as deep as the ocean  
Keeps me believin' you're alive  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
  
Oh (for your love and emotion), oh  
Oh (for your love and emotion), oh
