I have fallen from grace, and my ashes are scattered  
No longer a passion and flesh  
My flame is alive, though my wings have been shattered  
They laid my body to rest.  
  
My spirit is breathing, my senses are pure  
Like reincarnation my soul will endure  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
The spirit it never lets go  
  
Like fountains of sorrow, the faces are crying  
I'm witnessing all of their pain  
Death is so final for only the living  
The spirit will always remain  
  
Bury me deep just to cover my sins  
My soul is redeemed as the journey begins  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
The spirit it never lets go  
  
ah ah ah ah  
ah ah ah ah  
  
Another dimension, a river of light  
I'm twisting, I'm turning, my soul is entwined  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh......  
  
Back on earth (you thrill me)  
Back on earth (reveal me)  
Back on earth (still breathing)  
Back on earth (release me)  
Back on earth (you thrill me)  
Back on earth (reveal me)
