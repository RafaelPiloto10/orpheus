I hear you knockin' but you can't come in  
You wear your stockings like you think it's a sin  
Don't try to tell me you ain't been where you been  
'Cause I know that you've been messin' round with him  
So slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Come on down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Oh down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
I met you dancin' at the high school gym  
You rubbed against me my head started to spin  
You turned around gave me a wink and a grin  
And then you told me that you'd like to be friends  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
Take it!  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't try to tell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
You'll never sell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
I said before it gets too late  
You know before it gets too late  
Oh, hey
