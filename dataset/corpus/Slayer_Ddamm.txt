Swerving through the street  
Drunk as fuck  
Searching for a open store  
I think I'm out of luck  
Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol  
  
Hit her car  
Smash it up  
Pull her out  
Beat her up  
Take her money  
Run her down  
  
Can't find any beer  
It's way past two  
There's just one thing  
We can do  
  
Hit her car  
Smash it up  
Pull her out  
Beat her up  
Take her money  
Run her down  
Drive her face out of town  
  
Drunk drivers against mad mothers
