Y'know that I want your loving  
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen  
And then my defense'd say I didn't want it anyway  
But you know sometimes I'm a liar  
  
Could you ever want me to love you  
Could you ever want me to care  
Disregard my nervousness  
Please ignore my vacant stares  
  
'Cause just what I've been through  
Is nothing like where I'm going to  
Give me some sign to pursue  
A promise  
  
And your unhappy  
This is only a guess  
Do you know what it's like to hate  
When it's way down deep inside  
  
Oh god I hate what's been done to my life  
I could rule the pain  
I could rule the night  
Or would I ruin my salvation  
  
Ruin my mind rules your pains  
Rulers of the night  
Ruin your salvation  
Ruin your mind
