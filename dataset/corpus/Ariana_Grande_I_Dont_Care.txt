[Verse 1]  
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before  
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more  
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be  
But if I can't be me, then fuck's the point? No...  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care about it anymore, oh  
I don't care about it anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me  
Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold  
Like what you think and what he thinks and what they think  
But I love me  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care about it anymore, oh  
I don't care about it anymore  
  
[Outro: Harmonization]  
Yeah  
I-i-i-  
I-i-i don't care about it anymore  
I-i-i don't care about it anymore
