The light shines down the valley  
The wind blows up the alley  
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary  
  
She took the pains of boyhood  
And turned them into feel good  
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary  
  
Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know  
She out me right on my first mistake  
  
Summer wasn't gone  
when I learned all she had to give  
She really gave all a boy could take  
  
So now when I get lonely  
Still lookin for my one and only  
That's when I wish was lyin' in  
The Arms of Mary  
  
Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know  
She out me right on my first mistake
