(Guess who?)  
Where's the girl who hurt herself last night?  
(Guess who?)  
Didn't kiss you and thought she was right  
Everyone had told me  
Be careful when he holds me  
And I was  
  
(Guess who?)  
Had to listen to all that she hears  
(Guess who?)  
Has a pillow that's all wet with tears  
You were oh-so tender  
But I wouldn't surrender  
Now you're gone  
  
I told my friends "He'll never get my heart"  
And when I kissed you  
Had to resist you  
Said "Better go"  
I hurt you so  
  
Wished you had stayed  
But I made you go away  
(Guess who?)  
Tried to be much too cool yesterday  
(Guess who?)  
Let the boy that she loves get away  
I never should have listened  
'Cause now your love I'm missin'  
It's too late  
Woah, it's too late, ahh, ha  
  
I never should have listened  
'Cause now your love I'm missin'  
It's too late  
Oh, it's too late  
Ah, oh, ah, ah, oh  
It's too late, mmm
