What freezes love in your eyes  
What steals the force from your life  
What holds us ransom tonight  
What stops you seeing yourself?  
Only fear can stand  
On potential's hands  
This is the greatest day of your life  
If you make it  
And the old spells you know  
They can be broken  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
The greatest faults can be beaten  
The grandest problems defeated  
Impossible choices completed  
Infinite pain will be treated  
Only fear can stand  
On potential's hands  
This is the greatest day of your life  
And we made it  
And the old spells you know  
'cause they can be broken  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
This is the greatest day of your life  
And we've made it  
Break the old spells  
Oh, let them be broken  
Nothing to fear  
No, nothing to fear  
This is the greatest day  
Break the old spells and throw them away  
Break the old spells  
Don't why'know they can be broken  
No, nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear
