Hey y'all,  
I think we need a lil' excitement in our relationship  
A lil' role playin' no wha' I mean  
You could be the doctor  
Ill be the patient  
  
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat  
Chest to chest  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
Pull up your dress  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat  
  
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat  
Chest to chest  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
Pull up your dress  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat  
  
Baby its time to switch out the way things go  
Tonight's the night you'll be in control  
I bought you a uniform so your could play the role  
Now here's the stethoscope  
  
Lady, I know before we was going kinda cold  
The same old the same old we seem to take a toll  
Tryin' to take it back take a sip all go  
And try a couple things we never did before  
Maybe you could be a freak for me at the door  
I come up to the crib you dressed ready to go  
Girl take it down low n make it clap real slow  
I never had so much fun without spending dough  
Baby you the star of the big boy show  
I love you even more now you unpredictable  
Once we in the bedroom there no telling wha' we do  
So what you wanna do?  
  
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat  
Chest to chest  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
Pull up your dress  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat  
  
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat  
Chest to chest  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
Pull up your dress  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat  
(I like it when your close than visible  
This condition it critical off to the bathroom  
There we go you ride better than my new convertible)  
  
Yeah time for you to buss out the new red pumps  
I'ma lick shots let the box spring jump  
Go ahead n play the roll I'ma give you what you want  
Side to side bring it back to the front  
Dress up like the marshal's on a man hunt  
Leave all my jewels cos you love it when I stunt  
Ill play any role accept being the chump  
My Jon lil' girl you love it when I crunk  
Your boy told sniff I'm the future of the funk  
Pretend we lil' kids play tag and dry hum  
Feel my whole movie back to work just before lunch  
That's what I want  
  
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat  
Chest to chest  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
Pull up your dress  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat  
  
I'ma let you feel my heartbeat  
Chest to chest  
Can you feel my heartbeat  
Pull up your dress

We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat  
(I like it when your close than visible  
This condition it critical go to the bathroom  
There we go you ride better than my new convertible)  
(I like it when your close than visible

Feel the excitement building baby  
Its exciting, its thrilling, its passionate you know what I mean  
Your heart is beating faster and faster  
You feel that  
What if you felt it ten times more than that  
What about twenty times more than that  
What about thirty times more than that  
Heartbeat
