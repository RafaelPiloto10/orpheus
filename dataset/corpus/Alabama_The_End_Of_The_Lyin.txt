The End Of The Lyin'  
Alabama  
Album: Roll On  
You took me for a fool  
Then you took me for a ride  
You really had me going  
Till I looked into your lies  
I let you keep me hangin' on  
But honey here's where I get off  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end of the line  
Don't tell me a story  
I don't care where you've been  
Girl I'm out for glory  
And I won't be back again  
I let you keep me hangin' on  
But honey here's where I get off  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end of the line  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end of the line...
