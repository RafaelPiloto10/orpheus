Here we are  
We drift like gas  
On someone else's bed  
I pay high you know  
  
Here we are  
How old are you  
It's just a job to me  
  
Here the ladies always ring twice  
Thought you'd slip away tonight with me  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  
Hello you no more this talk of  
'My boys will be yours'  
  
No more 'I'  
This conversation drains  
My patience dry.  
  
Here the business always rings twice  
No relaxing for the boys tonight  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  
Here the tension always slows twice  
Shed one tear it's just routine for now  
In a subway I called 'you'
