Sometimes  
For a moment of bliss  
In the passion  
We're craving  
There's a message we miss  
  
Sometimes when  
The spirit's left alone  
We must believe in something  
To find if we've grown  
  
Tragic reflex  
Shattered calm  
Static progress  
Senses gone  
Numb awareness  
Final psalm  
  
Swept away with the tide  
(Swept away with the tide)  
Through the holes in my hands  
(Through the holes in my hands)  
Crown of thorns at my side  
(Crown of thorns  
At my side ye ye yeah)  
Drawing lines in the sand  
  
Sometimes  
If you're perfectly still  
You can hear the virgin weeping  
For the savior of your will  
  
Sometimes  
Your castles in the air  
And the fantasies you're seeking  
Are the crosses you bear  
  
Sacred conflict  
Blessed prize  
Weeping crosses  
Stainless eyes  
Desperate addict  
Faith disguised  
  
Swept away with the tide  
(Swept away with the tide)  
Through the holes in my hands  
(Through the holes in my hands yeah)  
Crown of thorns at my side  
(Crown of thorns at my side)  
Drawing lines in the sand  
  
We fabricate our demons  
Invite them into our homes  
Have supper with the aliens  
And fight the war alone  
We conjure up our skeletons  
Enlist the den of thieves  
Frightened from our closets  
Then sewn upon our sleeves  
  
In the stream of consciousness  
There is a river crying  
Living comes much easier  
Once we admit  
We're dying  
  
Sometimes  
In the wreckage of our wake  
There's a bitterness we harbor  
And hate for hatred's sake  
  
Sometimes  
We dig an early grave  
And crucify our instincts  
For the hope we couldn't save  
  
Sometimes  
A view from sinless eyes  
Centers our perspective  
And pacifies our cries  
  
Sometimes  
The anguish we survive  
And the mysteries we nurture  
Are the fabrics of our lives  
  
Swept away with the tide  
(Swept away with tide yeeah)  
Through the holes in my hands  
(Through the holes  
Holes in my hands)  
Crown of thorns at my side  
(Crown of thorns at my side yeah)  
Drawing lines in the sand
