What'll I tell him  
When he comes to me for absolution  
Wouldn't you know it  
Hope I don't make a bad decision  
  
'Cause I'd like to believe  
That there is a God  
Why sinful angels suffer for love  
I'd like to believe  
In the terrible truth, in the beautiful lie  
  
Like to know you  
But in this town I can't get arrested  
If you know me  
Why don't you tell me what I'm thinking  
  
Hey don't look now  
But there goes God  
In his sexy pants and his sausage dog  
And he can't stand Beelzebub  
'Cause he looks so good in black, in black  
  
Hey don't look now  
But there goes God  
In his sexy pants and his sausage dog  
And he can't stand Beelzebub  
'Cause he looks so good in black, in black, in black  
  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
  
There is a God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God
