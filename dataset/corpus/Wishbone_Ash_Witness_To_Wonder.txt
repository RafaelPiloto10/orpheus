When lovers walk the streets at night  
They are hand-in-hand, and walk in time  
Lovers fall in love, and realize  
Love will always be their mystery  
All the time in the world is theirs  
Take it away, we won't be stripped bare  
  
Love  
It is cold to me, as the heartbeat chills  
It goes to encounter witness to wonder  
Love  
  
When lovers leap from cloud to cloud  
They refuse to see the world around  
Locked out of the sight and the surrounding sound  
Love will always be their mystery  
What is love when its a surprise?  
Fall in deep and realize  
  
Love  
It is cold to me, as the heartbeat chills  
It goes to encounter witness to wonder  
Love
