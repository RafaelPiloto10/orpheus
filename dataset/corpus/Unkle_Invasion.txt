Show them only  
Flesh you needed  
You want it for you too  
(stares, stares that follow)  
(stares, stares that follow)  
  
They want it for you  
Are you all that  
You're cracked up to be  
We all want it for you  
Sacrificial  
Made for TV  
(laughter's coming)  
  
And goodbye kisses  
Gave him family  
Pray your dream  
Pray you're dreaming  
  
Are you all that  
You're cracked up to be  
We all want it for you  
Stares that follow  
Friends to call on  
Don't be desperate  
(show them once)  
  
Sacrificial  
Made for TV  
Laughter's coming  
Goodbye kisses  
(pray you stutter)  
(pray it's not old)  
Goodbye.
