Good to see you  
Good to see you again  
Good to see your face again  
Good to see you  
  
I'm the suitcase in your hallway  
I'm the footsteps on your floor  
When I'm lookin' down on you  
I feel like I know what my life is for  
  
Good to see you  
Good to see you again  
Good to see your face again  
Good to see you  
  
I've been down on the endless highway  
I passed on the solid line  
Now at last I'm home to you  
I feel like making up for lost time  
  
Good to see you  
Good to see you again  
Good to see your face again  
It's good to see you
