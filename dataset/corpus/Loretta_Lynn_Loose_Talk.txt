So long we've been married last burden we've carried  
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true  
But plans that we'd make up someone seems to break up  
Oh darling what else can we do  
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear  
Some place where we can live a life all our own  
I know you love me and happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
  
They say you are leavin' that you are deceivin'  
But you tell me they say the same about me  
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm  
And hope that's the truth they will see  
We may have to leave here  
  
When I go out walkin' there's lots of loose talkin'  
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart  
But darling that's not true because I still love you  
And I do with all of my heart  
We may have to leave here
