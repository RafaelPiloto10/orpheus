Break it down again.  
So those are my dreams  
and these are my eyes.  
Stand tall like a man.  
Headstrong like a horse.  
When it's all mixed up,  
better break it down.  
Oo, oo. Oo, oo.  
In the world of secrets.  
In the world of sound.  
Oo, oo.  
  
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light.  
See for yourself, you have been sitting on a time bomb.  
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else,  
could show you something new about you and your inner song.  
  
And all the love, and all the love in the world  
won't stop the rain from falling,  
waste sleeping underground.  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down,  
Break it down again.  
  
Break it down again.  
So those are my schemes  
and these are my plans.  
Hot tips for the boys.  
Fresh news from the force.  
When it's all mixed up,  
better break it down.  
Oo, oo. Oo, oo.  
In the world of silence.  
In the world of sound.  
Oo, oo.  
  
"No sleep for the dreaming" say the architects fo life.  
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice?  
They make no mention of the beauty of decay.  
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella, save it for a rainy day.  
  
And all the love, and all the love in the world  
won't stop the rain from falling,  
waste sleeping underground.  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down,  
Break it down again.  
  
Horsing around.  
Pray to the power.  
Play to the crowd  
with your big hit sound.  
And they won't simmer,  
won't simmer,  
won't simmer down.  
Play to the crowd.  
Play to the crowd.  
  
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light.  
Last off to heaven just like moses on a motorbike.  
No revolution maybe someone else somewhere else.  
Could show you something new to help with the ups and downs.  
  
Break it down again.  
I want to break it down.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
  
No more sleepy dreaming.  
No more building up.  
It is time to dissolve.  
Break it down again.  
No more sleepy dreaming.
