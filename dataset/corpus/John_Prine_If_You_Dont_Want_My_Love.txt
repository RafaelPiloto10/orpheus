If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
I know who  
I'll give it to  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
Anymore.  
  
If you don't want the thrill  
If you don't want the thrill  
If you don't want the thrill  
I know who  
I know who will  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
Anymore.  
  
If that's the way that the world goes round  
Then that's the way  
That it all comes down  
And when you want me  
I won't be around  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
I know who  
I'll give it to  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
Anymore.
