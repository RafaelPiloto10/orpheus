Have you seen me lately?  
What was it you saw  
Are you gonna catch me  
With my hand in the jar, naked singing in the choir?  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Did I look O.K.  
Are you gonna shame me and take my toys away?  
  
Don't wake me unless you love me  
It takes too long to fall back to sleep  
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine  
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Did I miss a beat  
Are you gonna make me get back on my feet?  
  
Don't wake me unless you love me  
It takes too long to fall back to sleep  
Don't wake me unless you're a friend of mine  
I'd rather just fall back on my dreams  
  
Have you seen me lately?  
Was I crazy?  
Don't wake me  
Don't wake me  
Don't wake me
