Yeah (8x)  
Ninety days on the road is what I need  
When my axe cuts me deep, I let it bleed  
On the stage, off my strings, down my face  
And all over me  
Pumpin' up for the show  
Feelin' like something's gonna blow  
It's got me all fired up  
Yes, I'm all fired up  
UH!  
Through the ice into the fire  
Blowin' steam  
North and South, East n' West, right n' left  
I'm always extreme  
Don't like the middle squeezing me  
I don't like nothin' in between  
Yes, I'm all fired up  
Got me all fired up  
When the rest have packed it up  
I'm alive, I'm electric, inspired  
I, I'm naturally wired  
Wired, naturally wired  
Wired, wired  
I'm naturally wired  
Naturally wired  
Wired, naturally wired  
Wired, naturally wired
