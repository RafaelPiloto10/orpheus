[Intro: Camila]  
Tired, tired, you're all I want, yeah  
  
[Verse 1: Camila]  
It'll be 'til the end, give me nothing I've ever tried  
It'll be the perfect sin, something like the truest lie  
[Normani]  
Everywhere somehow, the only place I'll ever be  
As long as you hold me down, oh such a liberty  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Dinah]  
Warm me with your touch, pressure from your fingertips  
Never be enough, I'll do nothing but submit  
  
[Chorus: Lauren]  
I just wanna feel a thousand hands from you, only you  
Can you make me feel a thousand hands from you, only you?  
  
[Verse 2: Normani]  
Grab a hold of my soul and make me feel complete within you'll be the one to
show these goosebumps on my skin  
[Ally]  
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve, I need you to feel the pain  
Would you take a bullet for me? Cause you know I'll do the same  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Dinah]  
Warm me with your touch, pressure from your fingertips  
Never be enough, I'll do nothing but submit  
  
[Chorus: Camila]  
I just wanna feel a thousand hands from you and only you  
Can you make me feel a thousand hands from you and only you?  
  
[Outro: Camila]  
I just want to feel a thousand, from you  
A thousand hands from you  
Just wanna feel a thousand  
A thousand hands from you  
Feel a thousand hands from you
