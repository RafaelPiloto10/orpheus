You left the motor running  
But I know you're so attractive  
Getting in some sharp practice  
You better not do anything reckless  
  
But everybody is going through the motions  
Everybody is going through the motions  
Are you really only going through the motions?  
  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me  
  
Don't make any sudden movements  
These are dangerous amusements  
When did you become so choosy?  
Don't act like you're above me  
Just look at your shoes  
  
But everybody is going through the motions  
Everybody is going through the motions  
Are you really only going through the motions?  
  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me  
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me  
But if you change your mind, you can send a little letter to me
