When I was young, I would look in the mirror  
Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer  
Yeah, I remember being filled with such wonder  
Before learning that the world can be harsher  
  
Who you love or the colour of your skin  
Or the place that you were born or grew up in  
Shouldn't decide how you should be treated  
'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing  
  
Waiting for a change to set us free  
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me  
Waiting for hope to come around  
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found  
Waiting for a change  
Waiting for a change (change, change)  
  
For all the brave, and the souls who went before us  
Stand tall, be proud and lift your voices  
Let 'em know who we are, and our choices  
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus  
  
Waiting for a change to set us free  
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me  
Waiting for hope to come around  
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found  
Waiting for a change  
Waiting for a change (change, change)  
  
Hold on!  
Waiting for a change (Change)  
  
When I was young, I would look in the mirror  
Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer
