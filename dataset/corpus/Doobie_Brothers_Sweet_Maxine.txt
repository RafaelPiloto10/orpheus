She can capture your heart,  
When they start the music playin'  
Sparkle in her eyes,  
You better be wise or you will end up lose your mind  
I said baby, pretty baby,  
Got to get my hands on you  
Something's got a hold on  
Something's got a hold on  
Something's got a hold on me  
She was born with it in her soul  
Lord she knows how to rock and roll  
  
She's the answer to poor boy's dream  
Never seen such a sweet young thing  
She's a teaser, love to squeeze her  
An actress from a fantasy scene  
I said baby, pretty baby  
Open your eyes to the truth  
  
She's got the power, power in her soul  
She's got the power, rock and roll
