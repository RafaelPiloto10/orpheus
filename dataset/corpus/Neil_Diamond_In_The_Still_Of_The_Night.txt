In the still of the night  
As I gaze from of my window  
At the moon in its flight  
My thoughts all stray to you  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh the times without number  
Darling when I say to you  
Do you love me  
As I love you  
Are you my life to be  
My dream come true  
Or will this dream of mine  
Fade out of sight  
Like that moon growing dim  
On the rim of the hill  
In the chill, still of the night  
Do you love me  
As I love you  
Are you my life to be  
My dream come true  
Or will this dream of mine  
Fade out of sight  
Like that moon growing dim  
On the rim of the hill  
In the chill, still of the night
