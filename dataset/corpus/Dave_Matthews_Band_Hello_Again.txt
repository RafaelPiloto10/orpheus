She was my one and only  
She was my girl, she love me always  
She was mine and I was a fool, I was a fool and now, she's gone  
  
Sitting here I've done my share of this, still I hope the lord forgive me my
sin  
Ten years ago down by the lake, I sunk my sweet love a watery grave  
Well I close my eyes and still see her face, I'd give my soul to take back
that day  
  
Hello again it's been too long, too long, too long, hello again  
You know you got what it is I want anyway I'm gonna take it from you  
  
Hello again you know you got what it is I want anyway gonna take it from you  
  
Hello  
You know  
Hello  
Hello again  
  
Like to talk you come a love away man  
Over and over I'm gonna see her face  
Stuck between the eye of the devils stare man  
Over and over I'm gonna see her face blown away on that day, I'm sinking  
  
I am not worth the flesh on my bones  
I am a waste of the air in my lungs  
Stay far from me go and be safe  
The serpent I got pours through my veins  
  
Hello again it's been too long, too long, too long, hello again  
You know you got what it is I want anyway I'm gonna take it from you  
Hello again you know you got what it is I want anyway I gonna take it from you  
  
Hello, Hello  
You know  
Hello again  
  
Like to come and light it all the way man  
Over and over I'm gonna see her face  
I saw me just like a devils stare man  
Over and over I'm gonna see her face blown away on that day, yeah  
  
This whole life time gone away but over and over I'm gonna see her face  
But over and over I'm gonna see her face blown away on that day, I am  
  
Sitting here I've done my share of this still I hope the lord forgive me my
sin  
  
Don't make me sigh
