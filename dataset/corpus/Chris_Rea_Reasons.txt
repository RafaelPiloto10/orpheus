Set my sails out on a sunny day  
Pretty soon i was on my way  
Though what for sure it was  
I could not say  
  
Two thousand reasons  
Maybe more  
Eight hundred chances on faraway shores  
Searching for something  
Searching for more  
Deep down inside me burning  
Reasons for the learning  
  
Now you can pick up reasons so easily  
Where you've been and where you've got to be  
And when the truth don't show you'll always see  
Lots of reasons  
  
And pretty soon you've got a heavy load  
Dragging those reasons down an endless road  
I got to thinking and i got to see  
So many reasons coming at me  
  
The one that leaves you high and dry  
He says you still owe him, there's a reason why  
He'll leave you crying till the tears run dry  
He's the one, always the one with all the reasons  
So many reasons the come and they go  
The reasons for them i'll never know  
I've seen so many, they've come and they've gone  
I've turned all mine in and i'm happy with one  
  
So don't talk of friendship, do it to me  
Make me an offer and make it for free  
Don't give me reasons ''cause i wrote that song  
I only want love now so i'll just take the one
