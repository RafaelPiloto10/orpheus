I'm the one whose got a religion  
I'm the one I couldn't take my knife  
  
Are you gonna be ready to use it  
If you hesitate they'll pursue it  
Put the gun to the dome and no question  
Now the holy ghost is in question  
What about the banks when they say go  
Standing at the top they can't let go  
Standing at the gate can't take that time  
When I try sometimes I can't stay high  
  
Are you gonna be ready to use it  
If you hesitate they'll pursue it  
Good and evil came from above  
Death peace heaven eternal love  
Bleeding at the gates I can't come in  
Courage that abates a life of sin  
Sure that it holds and it holds no other  
With the lies of the brave, the kid don't matter
