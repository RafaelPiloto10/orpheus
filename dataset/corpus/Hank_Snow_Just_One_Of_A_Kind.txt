Within the prison of my soul  
Locked within my troubled mind  
Is a love I can't forget  
'Cause she's just one of a kind  
  
Just a plain old fashioned girl  
The kind a man don't have to tame  
When he starts to settle down  
He's proud to let her wear his name  
  
Within my hand I hold the key  
Do I dare to set her free  
Got a feelin' in my mind  
That she's just one of a kind  
  
Pulled away from my hometown  
Thought I'd leave her love behind  
But Mary rode with me  
On the highways of my mind  
  
Seen a million pretty girls  
Pretty girls aren't hard to find  
But she's a rare breed, I'm convinced  
Mary's just one of a kind  
  
Within my hand I hold the key  
Do I dare to set her free  
Got a feelin' in my mind  
That she's just one of a kind  
  
Within the prison of my soul  
Locked within my troubled mind  
Is a love I can't forget  
'Cause she's just one of a kind
