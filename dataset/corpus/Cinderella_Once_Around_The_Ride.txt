See me, feel me, come and touch me  
The way I touch you  
In the crossfire, live wire  
Who said maybe  
I said maybe won't do  
  
The sands of time are slipping by  
Dust to dust, no second try  
  
You're only goin'  
Once around the ride, yea  
You're only goin'  
Once around the ride  
  
Rock hard, got an ace card  
I ain't crazy  
Just got nothin' to do  
Day breaks, I'll take  
Can't wait forever  
'Cause my life will be through  
  
The sands of time are slipping by  
Dust to dust, no second try  
  
You're only goin'  
Once around the ride, yea  
You're only goin'  
Once around the ride  
  
Dust to dust, no second try  
You're only goin'  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride
