I woke up the other day walked out to blue suburban skies,  
Skies filled with dreams and butterflies  
And I wondered to myself how do I fit in this game?  
Just a nameless face or faceless name  
Then I remembered an old friend of mine how we'd watch tv all night  
Tell each other about our dreams, but I don't see him no more, no.  
Light a cigarette and watch this day go by,  
Burned another six minutes to the sky  
I need a fucking answer but I guess that's why we live this life  
A constant search for something right  
Now my mind is wondering how am I going to get fucked up today,  
Light a bowl and see it all fade away  
It happens everyday
