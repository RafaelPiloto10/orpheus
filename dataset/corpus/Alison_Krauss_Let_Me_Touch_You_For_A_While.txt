It's been a long time coming  
As you shed a lonesome tear  
And now you're in a wonderama  
I wonder what you're doing here  
The flame no longer flickers  
You're feeling just like a fool  
You keep staring into your liquor  
Wondering what to do  
I don't hardly know you  
But I'd be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you smile  
Let me touch you for a while  
I'm gonna ruin my black mascara  
You're drinking whisky when it should be wine  
You keep looking into that mirror  
But to me you're looking really fine  
I don't hardly know you  
But I'd be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you  
Laugh at that cowgirl as she's walking out your door  
I know a way to make you smile  
Just let me whisper things you've never heard before  
Just let me touch you, baby  
Just let me touch you for a while  
I don't hardly know you  
But I'd be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you smile  
It's been a long time  
Let me touch you for a while
