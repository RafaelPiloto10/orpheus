Summer's gone and love has withered  
I believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seems  
All is gone and promises slithered  
You have me nothing yet nothing is what it seems  
  
Summer is gone  
  
Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end  
The dawning of a seething design  
Kept a secret from the light  
And felt the weight on my shoulders increase  
  
A bleeding heart led my desperation  
Like a bird on a wire  
A broken promise of dedication  
Never ever again
