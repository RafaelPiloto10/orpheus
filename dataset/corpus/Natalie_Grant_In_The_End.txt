Can't catch a break  
You've had your fill of old cliches  
Like 'life is hard, but God is good'.  
  
But even though it's true  
It won't stop what you're goin' through  
I wish that I could say it would.  
  
That he's outside of what you feel  
It might not make sense  
But one day it will.  
  
There's comin' a day the sun will always shine  
He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes.  
Hold on, my brother  
Things are gonna get better  
You're gonna smile again  
'Cause we win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
You're standing still  
Life has handed you a bitter pill  
Once again you're on your face  
  
You've got questions  
Plenty of secret confessions  
Wonderin' if you've run out of grace  
  
But he's outside of what you feel  
This life is just a moment  
But our forever is sealed  
Oh yeah  
  
There's comin' a day the sun will always shine  
He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes.  
Hold on, my brother  
Things are gonna get better  
You're gonna smile again  
'Cause we win in the end  
  
It won't be about  
Streets of Gold, Pearly Gates  
Harps or wings, Diamond Lakes  
All I know is that He's gonna hold you, hold me  
  
Heartache will disappear  
Questions will become clear  
Life will all make sense  
In the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
We win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
Oh yeah  
There's comin a day the sun will always shine  
He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes  
Hold on my brother  
Things are gonna get better  
You're gonna smile again  
Cos we win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
We win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
We win in the end  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
We win in the end  
  
We win in the end
