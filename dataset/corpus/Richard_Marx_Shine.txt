The tree you planted  
Is still holding on  
Leaves are turning  
Like nothing's wrong  
Oh, what freedom  
To only need the rain  
  
Been without you since May, ninety-four  
Tricks of the mind make it feel like it's more  
But I'm not special  
It's the same for everyone  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on, baby  
I'm coming for you  
I can hear your voice through the wine  
Teach me how to turn the page  
And show me how to shine  
  
Times I wished I was already gone  
Ain't no place I can't leave when I want  
But then I see their faces  
And I'm frozen in my shame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes the sun shuts down the little I can see  
And I remember what it felt like to be me  
But all at once I know that nothing is the same  
And all I'm left with is the pain  
  
[Chorus]
