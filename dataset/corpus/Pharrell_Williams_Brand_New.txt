My love, ooo  
My love  
  
A winner never quits  
And a quitter never wins  
I thought about what I wanted  
And you were on my list  
  
Remember where I was?  
In the desert with no love  
No cactus's, just dust  
And you swept me from above  
  
My love  
  
So I just wanna say  
Thank you for this day  
'Cause it is so good  
Good  
  
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new  
You got me feelin' brand new  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
So good morning, ooh girl  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
  
My love, ooo  
My love  
  
Life to me is easy  
People make it complicated  
When love is the tool  
No reason we can't make it  
  
Come on, let's go, be brave  
Feel somethin' at the [?]  
Once we know that amaze  
Then give it all the way  
  
My love  
  
So I just wanna say  
Thank you for this day  
'Cause it is so good  
Good  
  
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new  
You got me feelin' brand new  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
So good morning, ooh girl  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me, oh  
  
Listen, all my life, when I describe  
What I want, I've been misunderstood  
The more I try, at bein' satisfied  
And didn't think that I could  
But then you came along, and you made me strong  
Like God said you would  
  
So I just wanna say  
Thank you for this day  
'Cause it is so good  
Good  
  
Good  
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new  
You got me feelin' brand new  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
Jumpin' 'round in your bag  
So good morning, ooh girl  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)  
Like the tag's still on me  
Got the tags still on me
