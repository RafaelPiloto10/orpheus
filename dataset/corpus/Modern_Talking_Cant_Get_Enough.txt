Oh, Juliet Is Crying All The Night  
She Does'nt Know What's Wrong And What Is Right  
She Packed Her Things - And Want's To Leave Her Home  
She Has A Broken Heart And She's Alone  
Oh, Juliet Is Crying - She's Crying All Those Night's  
Don't You See The Love We Have Inside?  
  
I Just Can't Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Baby  
Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Lady  
Get Enough - Sweet Love, Tonight  
  
I Just Can't Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Baby  
Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Lady  
Baby, Hold Me Tight.....  
  
(High Pitch Vocals)  
I Just Can't Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Baby  
Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Lady  
How Can We Be Wrong?  
  
I Just Can't Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Baby  
Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Lady  
Where My Heart Belongs.....  
  
For Juliet It's Just The End Of Time  
She Does'nt Know That Love Is Hard To Find  
But, If There's Anything That I Can Do  
Oh, Juliet - I'll Do It Just For You  
Oh, Juliet Is Crying - She's Crying All Those Night's  
Don't You See The Love We Have IS Right?
