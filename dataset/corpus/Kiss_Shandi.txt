I just can't pretend no more, I keep runnin' out of lies  
Lovin' you is killin' me inside  
Every time I find the words to end it, something in your eyes won't let it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shandi, tonight must last us forever,  
Forever we say goodnight and go home  
But you know me very well, and I know you,  
You can't tell me goodnight  
(say goodnight)  
  
We been holding on so tight, we're afraid to let it go  
Shake it loose, we both could use the ride  
Here's another mess I got myself in, and when you touch me you ain't helpin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Say goodnight when we should say goodbye (say goodbye)  
  
(Shandi, Shandi) Tonight must last us forever and ever  
Forever we say goodnight and go home  
Shandi, Shandi, tonight must last us forever
