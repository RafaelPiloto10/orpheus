  
  
Yeah, I saw you coming down the street.  
  
I could tell by your look that you didn't want to meet.  
  
So this time, I went away, but next time,  
  
I'm just gonna have to say,  
  
can I buy you a dress or something?  
  
Could I buy you some drewery or something?  
  
Would you go out with me or something?  
  
Would you sleep with me or something?"  
  
  
Better watch out, if you're train is moving to fast.  
  
You better look out, if you're living in the past  
  
because that's why you'll never lose these sweet misery blues.  
  
That's why you'll never lose these sweet misery blues.  
  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna corner you in an elevator  
  
and then you won't be able to put me off till later.  
  
I'll put on my charm and I'll tingle your spine.  
  
I'll take off my charm and then you'll want to die.  
  
Could I buy you a dress or something?  
  
Could I buy you some drewery or something?  
  
Would you go out with me or something?  
  
Would you sleep with me or something?"  
  
  
You better watch out, cause you can't get rid of me.  
  
You better look out, now babe don't you see?  
  
That's why you'll never lose these sweet misery blues. (2 times)
