Just one innocent smile that I could have missed  
That's all it took to start all this  
One word so softly spoken when I needed it most  
Why you, why right now, who knows?  
  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
  
Last kiss until tomorrow out on the front porch swing  
Till then nothin' means anything  
  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
  
I can't let go when I'm holdin' you tight  
All I dream of is that day when we don't have to say goodnight  
  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
  
Just one innocent smile that I could have missed  
That's all it took to start all this  
Oh no, I don't want to say goodnight  
Oh no, I don't want to say goodnight  
Oh, I don't want to say goodnight  
Oh no, just want to hold you tight
