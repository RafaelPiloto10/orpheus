She'd brought along the oranges  
He'd brought the tea  
They'd both brought along a sick-bag just in case  
  
The plate of chicken sandwiches  
Were lovely they agreed  
And I watched him spit the bits into her face  
  
'Do you love me like you used to' he sighs  
'I love you twice as much' she replies  
They were on the train to Venice, where else?  
I think tonight I fancy myself  
  
I'd rather drink that toast to my own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
And if you drink that drink to your own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
  
Later in the evening  
The sun came rolling down  
And they talked about their fantasies and fears  
  
Between the heavy breathing  
And those lighter licking sounds  
I heard him whisper this question in her ear  
  
'Would you still love me if I lost my legs?'  
'I'd see that you were loved and you were fed'  
'I end up in a car crash almost dead'  
'For richer and for partly severed head'  
  
I'd rather drink that toast to my own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
And if you drink that drink to your own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
  
The neighbours ask them out but they flatly refuse  
'We're saving up for a world-wide cruise'  
With a choice between loneliness and love-sick QE2's  
Well tonight I choose - self-abuse  
  
A four-pack in the fridge  
A good book on the shelf  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself
