Just say that I'm a friend of yours and maybe they won't get wise,  
And if they see us together, I'll brush the dream from my eyes.  
I'll tell my heart it mustn't seem the song of remember when,  
  
Just say that I'm a friend of yours that you happen to meet again.  
I'll tell my heart that it mustn't seem the song of remember when,  
Just say that I'm a friend of yours that you happen to meet again.
