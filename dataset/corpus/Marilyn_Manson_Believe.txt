In a favor of a good intention  
Never mind the destination  
  
(future lay) your sure destruction  
Back and down is not an option  
  
That's what you've said,  
You gotta believe in me, i am everything  
I'm the final step you take toward insanity  
You gotta believe in me, i am everything  
I'm the only one still after your reality  
You gotta believe in me  
You gotta believe in me  
  
You dug a hole in (favor) side  
Your perfect world was compromised  
  
You still don't know who, what the hell you are  
You're olny worried about the palace when you're good as god  
  
That's what you've said,  
You gotta believe in me, i am everything  
I'm the final step you take toward insanity  
You gotta believe in me, i am everything  
I'm the only one still after your reality  
You gotta believe in me  
You gotta believe in me  
  
See these suns of (pacrocy)?  
It's feeding off your apathy  
About the surface all as well  
But (dig a bed) and go to hell  
Just put a bullet in my head  
Or all our deed been love for dead (?)  
Just shut your mouth and close your eyes  
Reality's alive  
  
That's what you've said,  
You gotta believe in me, i am everything  
I'm the final step you take toward insanity  
You gotta believe in me, i am everything  
I'm the only one still after your reality  
You gotta believe in me  
You gotta believe in me
