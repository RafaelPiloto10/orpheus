I told Althea I was feeling lost  
Lacking in some direction  
Althea told me upon scrutiny  
That my back might need protection  
I told Althea that treachery  
Was tearing me limb from limb  
Althea told me, now cool down boy  
Settle back easy, Jim  
  
You may be Saturday's child all grown  
Moving with a pinch of grace  
You may be a clown in the burying ground  
Or just another pretty face  
You may be the fate of Ophelia  
Sleeping and perchance to dream  
Honest to the point of recklessness  
Self-centred to the extreme  
  
Ain't nobody messin' with you but you  
Your friends are getting most concerned  
Loose with the truth, maybe its your fire  
Baby I hope you don't get burned  
When the smoke has cleared, she said  
That's what she said to me  
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head  
And a little sympathy  
  
There are things you can replace  
And others you cannot  
The time has come to weigh those things  
This space is gettin' hot  
You know this space is gettin' hot  
  
I told Althea, I'm a roving sign  
That I was born to be a bachelor  
Althea told me, OK that's fine  
So now I'm trying to catch her  
Can't talk to you without talking to me  
We're guilty of the same old things  
Thinking a lot about less and less  
And forgetting the love we bring
