I don't want to sleep with you  
I don't need the passion too  
I don't want a stormy affair  
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere  
All I want is the comfort and care  
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet -  
Mother love ah ha  
  
I've walked too long in this lonely lane  
I've had enough of this same old game  
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong  
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone  
  
Out in the city, in the cold world outside  
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide  
Mama please, let me back inside  
  
I don't want to make no waves  
But you can give me all the love that I crave  
I can't take it if you see me cry  
I long for peace before I die  
All I want is to know that you're there  
You're gonna give me all your sweet -  
Mother love ah ha (mother love)  
  
My body's aching, but I can't sleep  
My dreams are all the company I keep  
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down  
I'm coming home to my sweet -  
Mother love  
  
(Mother love mother love love love love love)  
God works in mysterious ways  
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop  
I think I'm goin' back to the things I learnt so well in my youth
