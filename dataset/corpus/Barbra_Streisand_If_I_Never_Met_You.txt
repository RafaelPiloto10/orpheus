If I never met you  
If I never saw your face  
This world, this world would be a colder place, I bet.  
If we'd never met...  
If I never met you  
If I never knew your love  
My life, my life might be a sad song of regret.  
If we'd never met...  
But we said one "hello."  
And look at how the world begins to spin  
Look at how the shadows disappear  
Now that you are here.  
If I never met you  
If I never felt your kiss  
My days, my nights would not be filled like this, it's true.  
I don't know who I'd love  
I don't know what I'd do if I never met you.  
Just look at how the shadows disappear  
Now that you are here.  
If I never met you  
If I never felt your kiss  
My days, my nights would be filled like this, it's true.  
I don't know who I'd love  
I don't know what I'd do  
If I never met you.  
I don't know who I'd love  
I don't know what I'd do  
If I never met you.  
"we must be loving right"  
Some folks got nothin' but troubles  
So little joy in their lives.  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows.  
We must be lovin' right.  
It might be the way I adore you.  
Or the way that you hold me tight.  
I don't know the reason  
But I'm believin'  
We must be lovin' right  
All of our friends say  
Love fades away with time.  
But I know they're wrong  
'Cause they've never known  
A love like yours and mine.  
So if the whole world goes crazy  
Let everyone else fuss and fight.  
When all's said and done  
We'll be the lucky ones.  
We must be lovin' right.  
Some folks got nothin' but troubles.  
Oh so little joy in their lives.  
But wherever we go  
Happiness follows.  
We must be lovin' right.  
We must be lovin' right.
