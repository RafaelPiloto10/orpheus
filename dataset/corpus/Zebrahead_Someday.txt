Late out the door, grab my clothes off the floor,  
Backpack and books cause school is a chore  
Coming straight out the block, punk rock ain't no shock,  
Blue hair everywhere cause we got the stock  
Slide by all the narcs, as the late alarm barks,  
Take a nap in the class on a film about sharks  
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,  
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you  
  
Didn't want to go, didn't want to stay, didn't want to lie by my side  
I don't really care cause I'll still be there swallowing my pride  
Someday I'm going to be there  
  
Step out in the hall, with the girls dressed like dolls,  
And the burn-outs are baked as they step out the stalls  
See the games that they play, cause they practice all day,  
And the more that I see the less I have to say but  
It's a quarter to ten, by your locker again,  
Cause I know you'll be coming round the corner with your friend  
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,  
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you  
  
Listen when I say  
Today is the day  
And I'm on my way  
  
See you when you're wandering by  
And you still catch my eye  
Blow my mind  
Cause my face you won't recognize  
  
I know that it's crazy, how you seem to phase me,  
When nothing else matters but that all escapes me  
This is a new trip, got to get a better grip,  
A day in the life and you know I'm going to take it  
And then you turn and walk away, before I have a chance to say,  
I know that you can make this all okay  
Try to make my way through, but it's all I can do,  
Cause I keep coming back and all I think about is you
