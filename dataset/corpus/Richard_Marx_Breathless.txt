Never knew love before  
Never dreamed there could be something more  
Felt my heart overflow  
With the danger of needing you so  
  
It's a mystery I can't explain  
But I shiver when I hear your name  
  
[Chorus]  
You are the fire  
Every desire  
Breathless we fall in love  
Love is the answer  
We are the dancers  
Breathless we fall in love  
We fall in love  
  
You've crept into my soul  
And I'm ready to lose all control  
Let our hearts fill with light  
Every moment you make is so right  
  
It's a mystery I can't explain  
But I shiver when I hear your name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No need to worry  
No need to hurry  
Breathless we fall in love  
Love is the answer  
We are the dancers  
Breathless we fall in love  
We fall in love  
  
It's a mystery to me I can't explain  
But I shiver when I hear your name  
  
[Chorus]
