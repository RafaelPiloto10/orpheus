Dreamer sending your vision  
Into the night  
Dreamer swinging you sword of light  
  
Running where the road is broken  
Singing where no words are spoken  
  
Dreamer sending your vision  
Into the night  
Dreamer swinging you sword of light  
  
Running where the road is broken  
Singing where no words are spoken  
  
I remember when I was a girl  
How your bright eyes reflected the African plains  
You told me of Laos and the Ivory Coast  
And of all your friends with unsayable names  
You taught me to never hide my wings  
To strive for all the craziest things  
And always believe in the goodness men  
You told me all this  
And took off again  
  
Dreamer let all the cynics laugh  
You're on your own path  
  
I remember you when you drank your beer  
And the crack in your voice when you said  
Don't you worry  
You know I must go, but I'll come back again  
In the book of your face I could read your story  
A torch in the disillusioned night  
You raged and raged and raged  
Against the dying of the light  
And I still believe in the goodness of men  
You told me all this  
And I'll say it again  
  
Dreamer let all the cynics laugh  
You're on your own path  
  
Running where the road is broken  
Singing where no words are spoken
