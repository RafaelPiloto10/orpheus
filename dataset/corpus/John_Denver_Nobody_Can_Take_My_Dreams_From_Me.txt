They are minstrels and beggars  
Always in the sight of the king  
Sometimes they sleep in the daytime  
Come out in the night time and sing  
They come into the castle  
Through whatever window they can find  
They come into your mind  
Dreams of flying  
Dreams of being free  
Nobody can take my dreams from me.  
Nobody can take my dreams from me.  
  
You can bind me in chains  
Lock me up in a jailhouse to rot  
And if you come to see me  
You might think I'm there, but I am not  
They can sail into prison  
Find a way through any basement door  
They can offer you more  
Dreams of flying  
Dreams of being free  
Nobody can take my dreams from me  
Nobody can take my dreams from me  
You can take my money  
Take my reputation  
Even take my colour TV  
Nobody can take my dreams from me  
Nobody can take my dreams from me
