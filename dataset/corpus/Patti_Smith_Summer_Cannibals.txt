I was down in Georgia  
Nothing was as real  
As the street beneath my feet  
Descending into air  
  
The cauldron was a-bubbling  
The flesh was lean  
And the women moved forward  
Like piranhas in a stream  
They spread themselves before me  
An offering so sweet  
And they beckoned and they beckoned  
Come on darling eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
They circled around me  
Natives in a ring  
And I saw their souls a-withering  
Like snakes in chains  
And they wrapped themselves around me  
Ummm what a treat  
And they rattled their tales hissin'  
Come on let's eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
I felt a rising in my throat  
The girls a-saying grace  
And the air the viscous air  
Pressed against my face  
And it all got too damn much for me  
Just got too damn rough  
And I pushed away my plate  
And said boys I've had enough  
And I laid upon the table  
Another piece of meat  
And I opened up my veins to them  
And said come on eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
'Cause I was down in Georgia  
Nothing was as real  
As the street beneath my feet  
Descending into hell  
  
So eat eat eat  
You eat eat eat  
You eat eat eat  
Eat eat eat
