I can tell you got plans for me  
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully  
But tonight I have to say there just might be another way  
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
I'm the one you want, that's all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
You made the prettiest speech I've heard  
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words  
To a heart that's open wide and from the start was on your side  
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
I'm the one you want, that's all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
I'm the one you want, that's all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I can't wait, I can't wait
