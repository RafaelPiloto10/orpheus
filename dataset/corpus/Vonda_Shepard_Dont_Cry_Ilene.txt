He had his father's eyes  
And his mother's point of view  
There was no disguise  
He couldn't see through  
Sometimes the little things  
They don't seem so small  
But they had a good thing overall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene  
  
There was a rainbow over here  
He didn't see it from over there  
Black and white are fine  
But he's color blind  
Watching over me  
There must have been some kind of mystery  
Because I wanted him too  
But it was all wrong, all wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene, no don't cry  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene  
Oh no, Don't cry
