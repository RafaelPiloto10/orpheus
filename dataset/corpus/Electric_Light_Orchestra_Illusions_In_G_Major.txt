On the seven seas there was aphantom ship acoming,  
Shinin' in the dead of night,  
I heard the crew a hummin'  
Tunes that sounded like the Rolling Stones and Leonard Cohen.  
But they didn't know the words,  
So I assumed that they was foreign.  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach 'em,  
I just want to please 'em, doctor let me teach 'em.  
  
I looked up in the sky there was a phantom plane a comin',  
Shinin' in the dead of night,  
I heard the pilot saying,  
Poems that were written by John Keats and Robert Browning.  
But he didn't know the words so,  
I suppose that it was nothing.  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach 'em,  
I just want to please 'em, doctor let me teach 'em.  
  
Doctor please believe me, I know you won't decieve me,  
But do these things I'm seein', have any hidden meaning.  
It's all good entertainment and it doesn't cost a penny.  
So please doc, let me teach 'em, if I could only reach 'em.  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach 'em,  
I just want to please 'em, doctor let me teach 'em.
