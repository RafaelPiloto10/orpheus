I feel so blue, after all that we've been through -  
You always had it made, but still you betrayed -  
And I see into your heart, and it looks like  
There's no water in the well.  
You tied me down to just one love,  
Making out that you were true.  
Your fire makes me cry, my tears will never dry.  
Now there's no doubt in my mind, it looks like  
There's no water in the well.  
If you let the river flow, oh god, just let me know.  
Your turn will come, and it looks like  
There's no water in the well.
