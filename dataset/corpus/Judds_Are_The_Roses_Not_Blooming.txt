Are the roses not blooming this morning  
Has the sun lost it's beautiful ray  
Have the children no reason for laughing  
Or my darling are you walking away  
Has the sky lost it's brilliant blue color  
Are the robins not singing today  
Has that river no reason for running  
Or my darling are you walking away  
  
Has my heart found a reason for breaking in two  
Have my eyes found a reason to cry  
Have my ears heard the voice of a stranger  
Or my darling are you saying goodbye  
  
Has the earth lost it's power for turning  
Has the winter decided to stay  
Are the roses not blooming this morning  
Or my darling are you walking away  
Are the roses not blooming this morning  
Or my darling are you walking away  
Or my darling are you walking away
