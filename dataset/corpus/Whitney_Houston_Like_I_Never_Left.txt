Akon and Whitney, yeah  
  
Oh, yeah  
(Oh, yeah)  
  
Did you ever wish  
(Wish)  
You could get  
Back something  
(Uh, huh)  
That you did in your past  
(Yeah)  
  
If it wasn't for me  
I know what we had  
Would definitely gonna last  
  
I admit  
(Admit)  
That we say some things  
(Uh, huh)  
We don't mean  
When we're mad  
(Yeah)  
  
But I realize  
(Yeah)  
That I've been foolish  
I never should have  
(Yeah)  
Turned my back  
  
'Cause it's  
A cold world  
When you  
Are out there  
(Uh huh)  
All alone  
(All alone)  
  
So many times  
That I wanted to just  
Pick up the phone  
(Up the phone)  
  
And tell you  
Ooh, baby  
Baby  
I miss your love  
  
And so  
I ain't holding  
Back no more  
(Yeah)  
  
Your girl  
Is coming home  
(Yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
And I want you  
To love me  
Like I never left  
And I want you  
To hold me  
Like I never left  
And I want you  
To touch me  
Like I never left  
Come give me  
What I'm missing  
Like I never left  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
Do you think  
(Think)  
We could pick up  
(Uh, huh)  
Where we left off  
Before the day  
(The day, yeah)  
  
That I told you  
It was over  
Packed my things  
And moved away  
(Moved away)  
  
'Cause I see  
(See)  
That without you  
(Uh, huh)  
My world is just  
An empty place  
(Place)  
  
Taking one step away  
(Yeah)  
From you feels  
Like a million miles away  
(Yeah)  
  
'Cause it's  
A cold world  
When you  
Are out there  
(Uh, huh)  
All alone  
(All alone)  
  
So many times  
I wanted to just  
Pick up the phone  
(Up the phone)  
  
And tell you  
Ooh, baby  
Baby  
I miss your love  
And so  
  
But I ain't holding  
Back no more  
(No)  
  
'Cause your man  
Is coming home  
(No)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had enough  
I miss you bad  
What I did  
Leave in the past  
  
Yes, your girl  
Is coming back  
Like I never left  
(Oh)  
  
Say back  
In the building  
Back on the block  
You and me together  
  
We back on top  
Kinda love we got  
It just don't stop  
Like I never left  
  
I had enough  
I miss you bad  
(I miss you bad)  
What I did  
Leave in the past  
(Yeah)  
  
Yes, your girl  
Is coming back  
Like I never left  
(I'm coming back homeboy)  
  
Say back  
In the building  
  
I'm coming back home, boy  
  
Back on the block  
You and me together  
We back on top  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Kinda love we got  
It just don't stop  
Like I never left  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, baby  
Come love me  
Come hold me  
Come touch me  
  
Come give me  
Like I never left  
I never left you, baby  
  
Oh, baby  
Come love me  
Come hold me  
Come touch me  
  
Come give me  
Like I never left  
I never left you, baby
