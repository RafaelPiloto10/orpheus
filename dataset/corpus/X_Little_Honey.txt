Little honey, won't you come over here?  
Little honey, we gotta get something clear  
Little honey, I promise I won't get mad  
If you tell me about a boyfriend that you had  
Who lied last night? Who made you mad?  
Left you cryin' by the side of the road  
Left you cryin' to hitchhike home alone  
All alone  
Little honey, are you goin' out tonight?  
Little honey, I don't want to start a fight  
Little honey, if you don't answer me soon  
You'll come home tomorrow to an empty room  
With a light left on, the door open wide  
Window broken and pictures smashed  
Window broken and our bed covered in trash  
All with trash, I ain't lookin' for fight  
Little honey, are you goin' out tonight?  
Little honey, won't you please come over here?  
Little honey, won't you please bring me a beer?  
Little honey, I promise I won't get mad  
If you tell me about a boyfriend that you had  
'Cause you know I care but what can I do?  
Sit here waitin' by the side of the road  
Sit here waitin' till you come home alone  
All alone, I ain't lookin' for fight  
Little honey, are you goin' out tonight?  
'Cause you know I care but what can I do?  
Sit here waitin' by the side of the road  
Sit here waitin' till you come home alone  
All alone, I ain't lookin' for fight  
Ooh, little honey, are you goin' out tonight?  
Honey, honey, honey  
Honey, honey, honey
