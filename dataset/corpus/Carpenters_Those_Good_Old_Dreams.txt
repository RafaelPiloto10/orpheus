As a child I was known for make-believing  
All alone I created fantasies  
As I grew people called it self-deceiving  
But my heart helped me hold the memories  
  
As I walk through the world I find around me  
Something new, yet familiar's in the air  
I feel it ev'rywhere  
Like a child's eyes  
On a Christmas night  
I'm lookin' at you now  
Finding answers to my prayers  
  
(1) It's a new day for those good old dreams  
One by one it seems they're comin' true  
Here's the morning that my heart had seen  
Here's the morning that just had to come through  
Same old stage but what a change of scene  
No more dark horizons, only blue  
It's a new day for those good old dreams  
All my life I dreamed of lovin' you  
  
You're a spark of a long forgotten fire  
You're a touch of a slowly growing wind  
You're a taste of the ever-changing seasons  
Telling me there are some things that don't end  
We have left all the darkness far behind us  
All those hopes that we held along the way  
Have made it to this day  
Like an old love song  
Gone for much too long  
You hear it once again  
And it carries you away  
  
Repeat (1)  
It's a new day for those good old dreams  
And It's all because of you
