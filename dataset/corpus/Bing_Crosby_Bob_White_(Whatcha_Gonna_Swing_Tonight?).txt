I was talkin' to the whippoorwill  
He says you got a corny trill  
Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight?  
I was talkin' to the mocking bird  
He says you are the worst he's heard,  
Bob White! Whatcha gonna swing tonight?  
  
Even the owl-tells me you're foul  
Singin' those lullaby notes,  
Don't be a bring down  
If you can swing down  
Gimme those high notes  
  
There's a lotta talk about you, Bob  
And they're sayin' you're "off the cob"  
Fake it, Mister B  
Take it, follow me, Bob white  
We're gonna break it up tonight
