Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home  
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone  
'Cause she is moving somewhere far away not slow  
And though I tried so hard to please her  
She said she really had to go  
  
Even though this time it really hurts me bad  
I've been through similarities, it's not the first break I've had  
And I just can't let it bring me down so low  
And though I tried so hard to please her  
There must be something more to know  
  
Never thought that we would find our end this way  
It seemed that everything was going fine  
Still with all the things that I can do or say  
It won't change the fate I know so well is mine  
  
So I'll stop and look right past the pain  
Because I've been in love before and I can love again  
While she's moving somewhere far away not slow  
I know I tried so hard to please her  
She said she really had to go
