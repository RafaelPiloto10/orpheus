I have been out wandering  
I have traveled far  
One conclusion I have made  
Is God don't own a car  
He don't wear no fancy clothes  
He'd rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He don't have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
He'll join our band then we'll understand  
Why God don't own a car  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la
