There's a certain feeling  
Known to all who hear the sound  
The call of morning rising  
You're in a mystic space  
Can't you feel the force embrace, the chill of the wind  
As it names you  
  
Oh, can't you see the lies in front of you  
Your journey ends so far, and still the distance  
Spins round and round you  
Now you cry - give me sanctuary  
You scream but no one listens  
Again you cry - give me sanctuary  
Until the end I'll fight and die, to be free  
Oh! No sanctuary  
  
You're walking halfway in  
But crawling halfway out  
There's a void in your mind that you cling to  
You feel lost in time, you've got no words to rhyme  
No more charms, no more spells to protect you  
  
Oh can't you see the lies in front of you  
Your journey ends so far, and still the distance  
Spins round and round you  
Now you cry - give me sanctuary  
You scream, but no one listens  
Again you cry - give me sanctuary  
Until the end I'll fight and die  
Oh I've got to be free
