Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat at home.  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat at home, eat at home, eat at home.  
  
Bring the love that you feel for me  
Into line with the love I see,  
And in the morning you'll bring to me love.  
  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, now don't do that.  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, now don't do that, do that, do that.  
Ah, ah, ah.  
  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat in bed,  
Eat in bed, eat in bed.
