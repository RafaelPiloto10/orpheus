I see you in the front row, dancing up and down  
You're ripped and ready for the night downtown  
And all the pretty boys are chasing you around  
Cause they all wanna win your affections  
  
You spent three hours getting ready for the show  
Nothing on underneath and everybody knows  
Mama said wear a coat or catch your death of cold  
What's wrong with a little flirtation?  
  
[Chorus]  
And then you smile at me  
Is that a wink I see?  
Did I catch your eye?  
Should I even try?  
Oh, My Margarita (Margarita)  
Like to meet you (Margarita)  
Margarita (Margarita)  
Think I need you (Margarita)  
  
Take your time, dance real slow  
Remember that song from the radio  
Got your old man's, got a place to go  
Cause we all need a little temptation  
  
Those two big fellas are looking for a fight  
It's what they like to do on a Saturday night  
Maybe it's the alcohol, maybe it's the lights  
But they just want to get your attention  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Talk to me , baby, it's all right  
I might look strange, but I don't bite  
And if you let me hold your hand  
I can find a way to make you understand  
  
Called last call, now it's time to go  
But I'm not the guy who gets to walk you home  
We could have made history, I guess we'll never know  
I'll see you in dreams  
  
Oh, my Margarita (Margarita)  
Like to meet you (Margarita)  
Margarita (Margarita)  
Think I need you (Margarita)  
Oh, my Margarita (Margarita)  
Like to meet you (Margarita)  
Margarita (Margarita)  
Think I need You (Margarita)
