Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I woke up this mornin'  
From a dream  
That you were saying goodbye  
We had a simple argument  
But not enough to keep out  
Each other's life  
  
I want to be happy  
But I can't be happy  
If I can't be with you  
'Cause you're my baby  
My sweet honey  
And no other girl will do  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I can't seem to figure out  
Just what went wrong with us  
You must've thought I was selfish  
But everything I did I did for us  
  
I want to be happy  
But I can't be happy  
If I can't be with you  
'Cause you're my baby  
My sweet honey  
And no other girl will do  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I can't eat or even sleep  
Till I have you  
Back inside my world  
My life won't be complete  
Unless you stay my girl  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
Come on girl let me break it down  
  
Don't leave me girl  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
Don't go  
  
Don't leave me (I don't want to let you go)  
'Cause you need me (I don't want to be alone)  
I never want to be without you (I never want to be alone)  
Don't leave me (Oh baby I need to be)  
'Cause you need me (In your life)  
I never want to be without you (Girl, I'll never let you go)  
  
Don't leave me girl  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
Don't go
