The beautiful days are long gone  
And I can't seem to breathe  
Feels like it hasn't been that long  
Since you walked away from me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
I still think of you that way  
You should know that  
  
The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights  
They don't mean a thing  
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right  
Without you here with me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
It's hard for me to say  
You were my soul  
  
Now I could say that I don't love you no more  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal  
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel  
I thought that you would never do me that way  
  
But even after all I still think of you that way  
Now I could say that I don't love you no more  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
Now love is a game that we both like to play  
When I win or lose, if I go or if I stay  
  
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside  
Girl, you know me inside out  
And I can't get you off of my mind  
And I could say that I don't love you no more  
  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
La, la, la, la
