Turn me around, Don't let me walk out forever  
If there's a chance, the slightest chance, darling never say never  
You know it's out of my hands  
Cause I'm in way over my head  
  
But it won't take me too long  
You could blink and I'll be gone  
In your dark oversight  
There must be one last breath of our life  
  
[Chorus]  
Now if there's something I can say  
To make you see it half my way  
Just tell me once, before I go  
And if there's something I can do to make it all back up to you  
Just tell me once, before I go  
  
Angel of pride  
Girl, won't you come and release me  
Is it such a crime, oh, such a crime  
To surrender so easy  
You know how hard I've tried  
Well, maybe I've tried too damn hard  
But it won't take you long, you can break this liaison  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't know where this road ever ends  
The point of existence, your die-hard resistance  
And I don't know where the shoulder begins  
And gravity crumbles, tenacity tumbles  
  
But it won't take me long  
You could blink and I'll be gone  
In your dark oversight  
There must be one last breath of our life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if there's something I can say  
To make you, make you see it half my way  
Just tell me once, before I go, before I go  
  
Ooh, tell me once before I go  
If there, if there's something I can say to make you see it half my way,  
Tell me, tell me  
If there's something I can say, oh, now baby, to make you turn  
Around
