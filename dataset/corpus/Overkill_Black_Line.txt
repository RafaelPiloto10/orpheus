What was done is licking me with fire  
Do with me,do what you will  
I'm cold and sick,I'm cold and sick and tired  
Yeah I've had enough.I've had my kill  
And dare I say that I'm walking on today  
With no direction ever had  
Please forget me,leave me to what will  
I'll be with you again at the end of the line  
We all walk in a long black line  
We all walk in time  
We all walk in the black sunshine  
We don't know who we are  
we all walk in a long black line  
We all walk in time  
We all walk in the black sunshine  
We don't know who we are  
What is done still licking me with fire  
Do with me,do what you will  
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired  
Yeah I've had enough,I've had my kill  
And dare I say that I'm missing you today  
With no direction ever had  
I can't forget you,or leave you to what will  
I'll see you once again at end of the line
