Once a beautiful Miss America married Mr. Right  
Had a little baby girl, born on a stormy night  
But that was once upon a time, now it's a brand new world  
  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Somewhere just between the past and somethin' dawnin' new  
  
There's a break in the chain, a skip in the clock  
Girl that's where I'm gonna find you  
Between the boy I was before and what I'm gonna be  
There's a clash on the border, a flame in the sky  
Girl that's where you're gonna find me  
  
Can't you hear the planet groanin' like a broken down machine  
Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens  
But you and I stand innocent, baby it's a brand new world  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future, gimme the future with a modern girl)  
  
We're the son and the daughter on a new freeway  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)  
Laughin' while the road maps blow away  
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)  
We're the son and the daughter and we ain't afraid  
  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)  
Won't be makin' the mistakes our fathers made  
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future) oh, gimme the future with a modern girl  
(Gimme the future, gimme the future) oh, gimme the future with a modern girl
