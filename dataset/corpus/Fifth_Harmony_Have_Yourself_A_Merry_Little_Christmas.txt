[Camila:]  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
[Normani:]  
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight  
  
[Ally:]  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on, our troubles will be miles away  
  
[Lauren:]  
Here we are, as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
[Dinah Jane:]  
Through the years, we all will be together  
And if the fates allow,  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now
