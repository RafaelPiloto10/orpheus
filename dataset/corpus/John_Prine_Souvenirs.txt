All the snow has turned to water  
Christmas days have come and gone  
Broken toys and faded colors  
Are all that's left to linger on  
I hate graveyards and old pawn shops  
For they always bring me tears  
I can't forgive the way they rob me  
Of my childhood souvenirs  
  
[Chorus]  
Memories they can't be boughten  
They can't be won at carnivals for free  
Well it took me years  
To get those souvenirs  
And I don't know how they slipped away from me  
  
Broken hearts and dirty windows  
Make life difficult to see  
That's why last night and this mornin'  
Always look the same to me  
  
I hate reading old love letters  
For they always bring me tears  
I can't forgive the way they rob me  
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs  
  
[Chorus]
