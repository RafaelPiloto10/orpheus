Now come here baby, get ready to go  
'Cause I'm in the mood to rock and roll  
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all  
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all  
  
We'll start to rockin', I don't like to stop  
You better get ready to rock around the clock  
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all  
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all  
  
Don't worry about the time, I got plenty to spend  
If the clock run down, we'll wind it up again  
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all  
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all, yeah  
  
You can learn everything they teach you in school  
But if you can't rock and roll, you're not a fool  
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all  
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all  
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all
