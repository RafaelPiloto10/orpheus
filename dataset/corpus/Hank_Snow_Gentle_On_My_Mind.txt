It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up and stashed behind your
couch  
And it's knowin' I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that
binds me  
Or somethin' that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking  
It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines  
And the junk yards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone  
I still run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads  
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train
yard  
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and
find  
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind  
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry  
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind
