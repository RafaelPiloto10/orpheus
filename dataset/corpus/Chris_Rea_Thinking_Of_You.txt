(3. 30)  
Somewhere in this crazy night  
With all this noise, and all this light  
I'm out upon the crowded street  
I play the game and I keep the beat  
Woo-oo  
But I'm thinking of you  
Woo-oo  
But I'm thinking of you  
And I remember the summer days  
Your strenght and yet your gentle ways  
Now I'm back on the crowded street  
Through the darker days I keep the beat  
Woo-oo  
But I'm thinking of you  
Woo-oo  
But I'm thinking of you  
Through all the grey, I see skies of blue  
I close my eyes cause I'm thinking of you  
And I pray to god, that what we had  
We will have again someday  
So I telephoned to tell you what  
I'd hoped you'd like to hear me say  
Woo-oo  
But I'm thinking of you  
Woo-oo  
But I'm thinking of you
