The rain attacks my bedroom window  
The thunder roars above  
Tonight's the night, well should have been  
A night spent with my love  
  
But the rain still pours above my head  
And fills me with despair  
What am I doing waiting for him?  
The man with no name doesn't care  
  
When the time comes, who will reveal  
The love I once had, and the way I now feel?  
For the man with no name, I did love so well  
So when the time comes, whom shall I tell?  
  
I walk through this old lonely house  
The tears fill up my eyes  
How could I have fallen for his old tricks?  
His cheating ways and lies  
  
I know I should have read the signs  
But he lured me to his lair  
What am I doing waiting for him?  
The man with no name doesn't care  
  
So when the time comes, who will reveal  
The love I once had, and the way I now feel?  
For the man with no name, I did love so well  
So when the time comes, whom shall I tell?  
  
He said that he would treat me right  
He said he loved me so  
But here I am waiting for him  
But the man with no name doesn't care  
  
No, the man with no name doesn't care
