If we speak of lovin'  
Will it come from our hearts  
Do we want this night of love to last forever  
Or do we just part  
Listen to yourself  
Are you sure that's what you wanna say  
We know that things sound different  
In the cold light of day  
Don't get dizzy and lose our heads  
On the merry go round  
I don't wanna be taken for a ride  
Keep both feet on the ground  
When we wake up in the morning  
Will there be anyone there  
Whoever is the first one to rise  
Will be the one who cares  
So, let's close our eyes and go to sleep  
With a thought for the day  
Waiting for tomorrow  
Just to see if there's truth in what they say  
Let's say goodnight  
You know goodbye is a hard word to say  
Hold me close  
We've reached the end  
So let's drift on away  
With a thought for today  
Break  
I'm hopin', you're wishin'  
I'll stay by your side  
I'm wishin', you're hopin'  
That a flame doesn't die  
  
And if we speak of lovin'  
Will it come from our hearts  
Do we want this night of love to last forever  
Or do we just part  
So, let's close our eyes and go to sleep  
With a thought for today  
Waiting for tomorrow  
Just to see if there's truth in what they say  
Let's say goodnight  
You know goodbye is a hard word to say  
Hold me close  
We've reached the end  
So let's drift on away  
Drift on away  
Drift on away  
Drift on away
