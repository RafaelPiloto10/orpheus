[Verse:]  
My cold heart needs some company  
Shine a light in there, maybe I can see  
Wild hostiles on an open frame  
Sun shining when it could be rain.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Give me all that I ask, some Californian grass  
Bring it over to me, I want everything that I see.  
We can stop at a grocery store,  
Buy a thing for a few dollars more.  
  
[Verse:]  
My hand, it shakes, my pulse is high.  
And my complications I can't describe.  
Cause your cold heart will break one day  
So don't you throw this chance away.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Give me all that I ask, some Californian grass  
Bring it over to me, I want everything that I see.  
We can stop at a grocery store,  
Buy a thing for a few dollars more.  
  
Sun shining when it could be rain.
