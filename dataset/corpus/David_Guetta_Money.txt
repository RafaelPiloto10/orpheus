She don't care, 'bout education,  
Money is, her motivation,  
He don't live, but love and passion,  
When he can buy, his satisfaction.  
  
[Chorus]  
Money, money.  
Get rich, or die tryin'.  
Money, money.  
Get rich, or die tryin'.  
Money, money.  
Get rich, or die tryin'.  
Money, money.  
Get rich, or die tryin'.  
  
Get diamonds, and celebrity,  
Big payments, or die tryin',  
The power, the legend be,  
Be a star, or die tryin'.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I drive a, a limousine,  
Big payments, or die tryin',  
A bodyguard, some jewellery,  
Be a star, or die tryin'.  
  
She don't care, 'bout education,  
Money is, her motivation,  
He don't live, but love and passion,  
When he can buy, his satisfaction.
