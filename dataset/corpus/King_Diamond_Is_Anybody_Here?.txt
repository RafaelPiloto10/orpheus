Oh the night is here  
It?s hot tonight  
Look into the shadows, oh don?t you see  
Minute by minute they?re being born around me  
I need a little light  
In the darkness my eyes can?t see  
And I got a feeling that someone?s watching me  
It?s hot tonight  
Listen? To the darkness, can you hear it breathe?  
I can feel it all around me  
I need a little light  
In the darkness my eyes can?t see  
And I got a feeling that someone?s watching me  
Is anybody there? Hiding in the shadows  
Is anybody there? Hiding, looking in from the dark  
[Solo : Andy]  
?Help me? Help me?, what is that I hear?  
?Help me?, There it is again ?Help me?, is anybody there?  
?Help me?, must be in my head ?Help me?  
?Cause there is only me in here and then my Magic cat  
[Solo : Mike]  
Is anybody there? Hiding in the shadows  
Is anybody there? Hiding, looking in from the dark  
Is anybody there? Is anybody here?  
It?s hot tonight  
Listen? to the darkness, can you hear it breathe?  
I can feel it all around m  
I need a little light  
[Solo: Mike]  
Is anybody here? ? ?Help me ? Help me?
