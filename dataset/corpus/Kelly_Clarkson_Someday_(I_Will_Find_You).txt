Ooh ooh yeahhh

Boy don't think for  
A second that I forgot  
About you cause I didn't.  
But after I woke up and you  
Were gone and I didn't understand  
Why. Was it something I said? Was it  
Something I did? Ohh I need to  
Know but boy just so you know  
  
(Chours)  
Someday I will find you  
And ask you why you left me  
Broken hearted but boy oh boy  
Don't you that someday oh someday  
I will find you yehhh.  
  
Boy I have been searching  
Everywhere for you but I can't  
Seem to find you anywhere it's like  
You didn't exist but to me and I will  
Do anyhthing to find you

Someday I will find you  
And ask you why you left me  
Broken hearted but boy oh boy  
Don't you that someday oh someday

Boy it's like you where a dream  
Like everything that happened between  
Us didn't happen but I know that in my  
Heart oh in my heart that we will  
Be together forever cause

Now my broken heart is mended  
And we can go on living with each  
Other cause that someday was today yeahhhhhh
