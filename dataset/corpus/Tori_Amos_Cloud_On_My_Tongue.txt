Someone's knockin on my kitchen door  
Leave the wood outside  
What all the girls here are freezing cold  
Leave me with your Borneo  
I don't need much to keep me warm  
  
Don't stop now what you're doing  
What you're doing my ugly one  
Bring them all here  
Hard to hide a hundred girls in your hair  
It won't be fair if I hate her  
If I ate her  
You can go now  
  
You're already in there  
I'll be wearing your tattoo  
You're already in there  
  
Got a cloud sleeping on my tongue  
He goes then it goes  
And kiss the violets as they're waking up  
  
Leave me with your Borneo  
Leave me the way I was before  
  
You're already in there  
I'll be wearing your tatoo  
I'm already in circles and circles and circles again  
The girl's in circles and circles got to stop spinning  
Circles and circles and circles again  
Thought I was over the bridge now
