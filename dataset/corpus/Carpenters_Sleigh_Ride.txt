Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling yoo-hoo  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a Christmas party  
At the home of Farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending  
Of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing  
Without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop  
Pop pop pop  
  
There's a happy feeling nothing  
In the world can buy  
As they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing another chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you
