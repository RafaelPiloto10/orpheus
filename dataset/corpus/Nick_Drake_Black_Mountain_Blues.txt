Old Black Mountain  
Tried to spit in your face  
Old Black Mountain  
Tried to spit in your face  
Baby's grubbing whiskey  
Oh she's practising bass  
Old Black Mountain  
Mean as they can be  
Old Black Mountain  
Mean as they can be  
They use gunpowder  
Just to sweeten the tea  
Had a girl in Black Mountain  
Sweetest girl in town  
Had a girl in Black Mountain  
Sweetest girl in town  
But she met a sweet black man  
Then she threw me down  
Well, old Black Mountain  
Can't keep man in jail  
Well, Black Mountain  
Can't keep man in jail  
Jury call him guilty  
Judge will grant him bail  
Goin' back to Black Mountain  
Me and my razor and my gun  
Goin' back to Black Mountain  
Me and my razor and my gun  
Gonna cut her if she stands there  
And shoot her if she runs
