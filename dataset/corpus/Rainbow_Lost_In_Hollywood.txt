Got to get a message through  
'Cause I think I'm losing you  
Am I too late?  
Drinking habit's a loose sometime  
  
I got to know if you're still mine  
And I can't wait  
Last time I saw your face  
You tried to hide the tears  
  
But I could see the trace  
I'd be there if I could  
But it's so far away from home  
Lost in Hollywood  
  
In the dark the vultures wait  
I can hear them  
Knocking at my gate  
But I'm not here  
  
The brew was cold  
The meat is stale  
In the L.A. night the sirens wail  
The song you can feel  
  
Pale stars that never shine  
Scotch and the whiskey  
And the Rainbow local wine  
She's done more bad than good  
  
I gotta get away somehow  
Lost in Hollywood  
On the streets the sun is fine  
Don't you feel the advantage hit your mind  
  
Feels all right, oh yeah  
But I'm a lover  
Like a loaded gun  
Chasing shadows on the run  
  
Out in the night  
I'm gonna lose control  
If I been losing you  
To pay for rock'n'roll  
  
Get back I know I should  
Gotta get back home to you  
You don't know what I been through  
But there's nothing I can do, oh no  
  
Lost in Hollywood
