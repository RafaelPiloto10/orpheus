How do you keep  
The music playing?  
How do you make it last  
How do keep  
The song from fading  
Too fast  
  
How do you lose yourself  
To someone  
And never lose your way  
How do you not run  
Out of new things  
To say  
  
And since you know  
We're always changing  
How can it be the same  
And tell me how  
Year after year  
You're sure your heart  
Will fall apart  
Each time  
You hear her name  
  
I know the way  
I feel for you  
Is now or never  
The more  
I love the more  
There I'm afraid  
That in yours eyes  
I may not see forever  
Forever  
  
If we can be  
The best of lovers  
Yet be the best of friends  
If we can try with every day  
To make it better as it goes  
With any luck than I suppose  
The music never ends
