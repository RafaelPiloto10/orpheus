Once upon a dream  
Moonlit wings come into view  
Winter casts her spell  
And all the world is born anew  
  
A child sees a star through a window  
He knows with all his heart  
That wonder is coming  
Waiting  
  
Hoping  
Believing  
  
Only in December  
Are hearts so full  
Or feel more alone  
Could it be the same  
For everyone  
  
Only in December  
Can the broken heart  
Feel so alive  
And the autumn ashes  
  
Become the fires of December  
Can I be inside  
And out of the cold  
Still I know  
  
December always leads me home  
I still believe in magic  
Always leads me home  
And I still believe in miracles, mmm yes  
  
Still believe in Christmas  
I still believe in love
