[Chorus]  
As long as there is time, and one breath left in me  
There will always be one more song for You  
As long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Verse 1]  
You were there with your songs of laughter, words of hope for my fears  
But what are songs when no one will sing them,  
What are words when no one hears  
Everytime was filled with questions, and when I asked, no one knew  
Till I found the answer in You  
  
[Chorus]  
So long as there is time, and one breath left in me  
There will always be one more song for You  
As long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Verse 2]  
Love is in the air around me, hope abounds everywhere  
Living life in the arms of Jesus, learning how to really care  
Every day is filled with purpose, all the old is made new  
And I know I owe it all to You  
  
[Chorus]  
So as long as there is time, and one breath left in me  
There will always be one more song for You  
And as long as there is room for one more voice in praise  
And a need for a word of love and truth, to help my brother through  
There'll be one more song for You  
  
[Outro x4]  
There will always be one more song for You
