Driving in my car, smoking my cigar,  
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.  
  
Sailing in my yacht, what a lot I got,  
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.  
  
I've been in and I'm out, I've been up and down,  
I don't want to go until I've been all around.  
  
What's it all about, anyone in doubt,  
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.
