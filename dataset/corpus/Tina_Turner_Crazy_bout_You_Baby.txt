Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!  
I can't sleep at night. I cat nap through the day, can't go on much longer
babe, I can't live this way.  
Chorus: You know I'm crazy bout you baby and I wonder do you ever think of me.
You know I'm wild about you baby, and you don't care, nothin in the world for
me.  
You know it ain't but one thing baby, sittin next to your favorite drink, but
to hear you say you don't love me, then I begin to think, cause now you know
I'm so crazy bout you baby...repeat chorus.
