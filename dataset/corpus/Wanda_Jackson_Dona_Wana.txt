You say, you got a lotta vinegar and spices  
In the kisses that you wanna give to me  
But mama told'a me that sugar is the nicest  
So take your vinegar away and let me be  
(Let her be)  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a your vinegar too  
I've already got a sugar baby dolly-hoo  
Always can supply me with enough to satisfy me  
So go leave'a me alone, ah  
You know I don'a wan'a  
(Don'a wan'a)  
You say you wan'a me to smoke'a your tobacco  
I've'a gotta me a cigarette too  
You think I wan'a ride your big'a Cadillac'a  
But I will make my little Chevrolet'a do  
(Let it do)  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  
Don'a wan'a ride your big'a Cadillac'a too  
I've already got a sugar baby dolly-hoo  
Always can supply me with enough to satisfy me  
So go leave'a me alone, ah  
You know I don'a wan'a  
(Don'a wan'a)  
You know I don'a wan'a  
(Don'a wan'a)  
You got'a line'a like you wan'a go a'fishin'  
You got a story like a bucket full of bait  
You might as well'a stop a' hang around a'wishin'  
The season's over and a'fishin's out of date  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a go fishin' too  
I've already got a sugar baby dolly-hoo  
Always can supply me with enough to satisfy me  
So go leave'a me alone  
You know I don'a wan'a  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you
