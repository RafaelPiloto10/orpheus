Nobody knows what human life is.  
Why we come, why we go.  
So why then do I know  
I will see you,  
I will see you in far off places?  
  
The heart knows why I grieve  
And yes one day I will close my eyes forever  
But I will see you  
I will see you in far off places.  
  
It's so easy for us to sit together  
But it's so hard for our hearts to combine  
And why?  
And why?  
Why? Why? Why? Why?  
  
Destiny for some is to save lives  
But destiny for some is to end lives  
But there is no end  
And I will see you in far off places.  
  
If your god bestows protection upon you  
And if the USA doesn't bomb you  
I believe I will see you somewhere safe  
Looking to the camera, messing around  
And pulling faces.
