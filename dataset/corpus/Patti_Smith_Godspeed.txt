You are the adrenaline  
Rushing through my veins  
Stimulate my heart  
Heavy crystalline  
You are the sulphur  
Extinguished by the flame  
You are everything to me  
All this in your name  
  
Oh, walking in your blue coat  
Weeping admiral  
All the twisted cellars  
They had to hand your name  
Ended all that's static  
In a myth of sin  
Mirror minor static  
Pale adrenaline  
  
Take it  
Ah, take it  
That day you said to me,  
"it could never be"  
Say the hour of sea to seep  
"have you said godspeed? "  
  
Love is a vampire  
Energy of dead  
Love is like a boomerang  
Comin' back again  
On a rack of red leather  
On a rack of skin and sin  
Tell me how to pale  
In adrenaline  
  
And you said to me,  
"it could never be"  
Say the hour of sea to seep  
And you said to me,  
"have you said godspeed? "  
  
I could make it all  
All the twisted sand and foam  
I'll never, ever return  
I could make it  
Make it all  
  
I'm walking, follow me  
Down the twisted stair  
Stuck inside a memory  
Shot and shot again  
Hand upon a railin'  
Courtin' fate and fate  
We're sailin', sailin', sailin' sailin'  
Down a black, black river  
And I plunge right in  
And I plunge right in  
In adrenaline  
In adrenaline  
  
I move inside my vein  
Ah, you're the speed I need  
Throw the pistol in  
Oh, your love's a vampire  
Comin' in to suck  
Stop, stop, stop, stop  
Oh, I fell and fell and fell  
Down, down, down, down  
Oh, I'm gonna duck
