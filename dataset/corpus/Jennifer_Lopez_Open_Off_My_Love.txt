[Chorus]  
Baby come with me  
I know I can set you free  
If you take this trip with me  
You'll be open off my love  
If only for one night  
  
I know I can make you mine  
Touch you in that place you like  
You'll be open off my love  
Take a moment to stop and think about  
The last time you felt like this  
Come on baby, nobody's gonna see  
'Cause I know you're feeling me  
I can see it in your eyes  
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't waste another moment  
Don't hold back  
I'm gonna give you what you need  
I'm gonna take you where you want to go  
On a trip to ecstasy  
I can see it in your eyes  
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna be where he wants me to be  
When he wants me to be  
When he wants me  
I'm gonna keep him feelin' me  
I'm gonna keep him wanting me  
I wanna be where he wants me to be  
When he wants me to be  
When he wants me  
I'm gonna keep him up all night  
I'm gonna keep it on his mind  
  
[Chorus]
