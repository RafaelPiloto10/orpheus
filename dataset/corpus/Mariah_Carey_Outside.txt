[Verse: 1]  
It's hard to explain  
Inherently it's just always been strange  
Neither here or there  
Always somewhat out of place everywhere  
Ambiguous  
Without a sense of belonging to touch  
Somewhere halfway  
Feeling there's no one completely the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Standing alone  
Eager to just  
Believe it's good enough to be what  
You really are  
But in your heart  
Uncertainty forever lies  
And you'll always be  
Somewhere on the  
Outside  
  
[Verse: 2]  
Early on, you face  
The realization you don't  
have a space  
Where you fit in  
And recognize you  
Were born to exist  
  
[Chorus]  
Standing alone  
Eager to just  
Believe it's good enough to be what  
You really are  
But in your heart  
Uncertainty forever lies  
And you'll always be  
Somewhere on the  
Outside  
  
And it's hard [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Irreversibly  
Falling in between  
And it's hard [Repeat: 1]  
To be understood  
As you are [Repeat: 1]  
  
Oh, and God knows  
That you're standing on your own  
Blind and unguided  
Into a world divided  
You're thrown  
Where you're never quite the same  
Although you try,try and try  
To tell yourself  
You really are  
But in your heart-uncertainty forever lies  
And you'll always be  
Somewhere on the outside
