I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
  
I grab my hat and I  
Grab my shoes  
Tonight I'm gonna hit  
The streets and cruise  
  
Down the main strip and  
Check it out  
With those schoolgirls  
A hangin' around  
  
Now I'm a sucker for a pretty face  
I don't care if she's in leather or lace  
Cause I'm just lookin' for a little kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
You've got the love I need tonight  
  
Long legs and short skirts  
These girls hit me where it hurts  
  
I can't wait to get my hands on them  
I won't give up until they give in  
  
Now I'm not lookin' for a love that lasts  
I need a shot and I need it fast  
If I can't have her, I'll take her and make her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, sweetheart, slide on in here  
No, not in the front, jump in the back  
Why?  
'Cause there's something back there I want to show ya  
I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
Ah, come on honey, I wasn't that bad!  
Oh, well  
  
[Chorus]
