She's a little girl  
In a rich man's world  
Everything she'll do  
She'll do for you  
  
He's a monster mash  
Living on fame and cash  
Badly spoiled  
A loving dad  
  
Some might say just give it up  
There's no more hope, no fair  
Move the limits  
Ooh wake up the animal in you  
  
Some might say just give it up  
There's no more hope, no fair ?  
Move the limits  
Ooh wake up the animal in you  
  
Girl, can't you see?  
Come on now, set him free  
Try open up his eyes  
And make him realize his misery  
  
He do not care  
Sittin' over there  
Get up, stand up now  
Wake up the animal inside of you  
  
I think it should be inside
