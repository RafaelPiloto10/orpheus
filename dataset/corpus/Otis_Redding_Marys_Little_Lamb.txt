Mary had a little lamb  
His bleeks was white as snow  
everywhere that Mary went  
The lamb was sure to go  
  
He followed her to school one day  
And that was against the rules  
He made the children laugh and play  
You've seen that lamb  
Oh that lamb in school  
  
Oh Mary  
Listen let me tell you something  
  
Ever since I was four years old  
I hated a silly rule  
Ever since they ran Mary's lamb  
Oh all the way home from school  
  
You should have seen Mary cry  
When she waved to her lamb goodbye  
The teacher said Mary come inside  
Come on and dry, oh, dry your eyes  
  
Oh, oh, oh Mary  
Wait a minute  
  
Mary don't you be so blue  
And bring that lamb back to school  
And Mary don't you be no fool  
You see the lamb daily through  
  
When you go, oh, home today  
You and your lamb can play  
You can even do the twist  
And then it goes  
Something like this  
  
oh, oh, oh Mary  
oh, oh, oh Mary  
Come on Mary  
Don't you be such a moaner  
Don't moan no more  
Hey, hey, hey Mary, hey, hey  
Come on Mary, oh  
Come on Mary.
