So upset  
Nervous wreck  
I can't believe you said goodbye  
  
Sit and smoke  
Cry and joke  
About these tears in my eyes  
  
How could you do what you've gone and done to me  
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me  
But that's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you  
  
A million times  
A million lines  
And I've bought 'em, every one  
  
You don't care  
You rip and tear  
Every dream I've counted on  
  
I guess that I should thank my unlucky stars  
That I'm alive and you're the way you are  
But that's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you  
  
How could you do what you've gone and done to me  
I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me  
But that's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you  
  
I could raise hell  
But what the hell  
It wouldn't do a bit a good  
  
Pack and leave  
My heart agrees  
It seems to think that I should  
  
There won't be no more next time doing me wrong  
You'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone  
But that's what you get  
You should expect that from me  
  
That's what I get  
I've come to expect it from you
