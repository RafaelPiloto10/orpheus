Long before I ever saw your face  
I got to know you in a dream  
But things aren't always what they seem  
You learn along the way  
  
I just can't stop myself from breaking down  
It's just no good unless you come around  
I turn into a monster  
all my friends agree  
  
So goodnight  
I'm going to bed  
I'm falling upstairs to meet you  
I wake up with memories in my head  
I'm someone else instead  
Fallin' upstairs to you  
  
You came to me from secret place  
You're beautiful and strange to me  
Just like an antique melody  
Too sad for me to play  
  
I hope you'll wait for me behind closed eyes  
I know I'll search for you all through the night  
'Till when the dawn breaks in and throws it's light  
Around the room  
  
Goodnight  
I'm going to bed  
I'm falling upstairs to meet you  
I wake up with memories in my head  
I'm somewhere else instead  
Falling upstairs to you  
Falling upstairs to you
