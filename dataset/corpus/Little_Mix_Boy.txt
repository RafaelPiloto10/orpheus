Do you remember what he said?  
I do, he told you, he'd never ever hurt you  
Oh, here we go again  
Another break-up, make-up.  
When you're gonna wake up?  
  
I'm gon' be the one to call him out  
Look how many times he let you down  
When's he gonna learn to be a real man  
How to be the one to say you're beautiful  
One more word, he never said at all  
I'm just sayin' you need to go  
  
Forget that boy, forget that boy  
I know a bad boy ain't good enough for you  
You're holding back tears in your eyes  
Bad boy wanna fight but I never see him fighting for you  
He'll never realize what he's got  
Until it's gone and he'll lose you forever  
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy  
  
Girl don't you know you set the tone?  
I'll make you stop that, fight back  
He won't get away with that  
Look who's ringing up your phone  
You wanna call back, leave that  
Ain't nobody got time for that  
It's funny how the tables turned  
When he's the one who's left at home  
You'll find your own real man and go  
  
Forget that boy, forget that boy  
You know a bad boy ain't good enough for you  
You're holding back tears in your eyes  
Bad boy wanna fight but I never see him fighting for you  
He'll never realize what he's got  
Until it's gone and he'll lose you forever  
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy  
  
See what you're worth girl  
Look what you've got  
He knows you're out of his league  
If he likes it or not  
  
I know what you're worth girl  
You know what you got  
We know you're out of his league  
If he likes it or not (likes it or not)  
  
Forget that boy, forget that boy  
You know a bad boy ain't good enough for you  
You're holding back tears in your eyes  
Bad boy wanna fight but I never see him fighting for you  
He'll never realize what he's got  
Until it's gone and he'll lose you forever  
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy  
  
I know what you're worth girl  
You know what you got  
We know you're out of his league  
If he likes it or not  
Girl you'll be alright, forget that boy, hah
