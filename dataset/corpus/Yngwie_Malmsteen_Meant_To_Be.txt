I've been searching  
all my life  
I've been hurting  
living lies  
in the dark  
trying to find true love  
in my heart  
no time to lose, goodbye to blues  
why can't you see  
we were meant to be  
we're walking through fire  
we're stronger than steel  
we've joined our souls  
now we're free  
we've reached our souls  
we finally see  
yesterday we lived in sorrow  
we live today for tomorrow  
no time to lose, goodbye to blues  
why can't you see  
we were meant to be  
we're walking through fire  
we're stronger than steel.
