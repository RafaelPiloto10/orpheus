I don't want to be no clock watcher  
Standin' in line  
I don't want to be someone in love  
Wastin' my time  
Can I get right to the point, baby  
You know I care  
Tell me what you want, yeah, baby  
And I'm right here  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now tell me what it is I'm supposed to do  
And someday I'll get to you  
But in the meantime  
I know what I gotta do  
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby  
On your love  
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby  
On your love  
I don't want to be your standby, girl  
Hangin' around  
  
I know you would tell me, baby  
If I ever let you down  
But I cannot second guess you, huh  
From what I see  
You're not saying nothin', baby  
But I know you want to talk to me, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now tell me what it is I'm supposed to do  
And someday I'll get to you, girl  
But in the meantime  
I know what I gotta do  
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby, ooh  
On your love  
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby  
On your love  
Hurry up and wait  
I don't want to be your standby, baby  
Hangin' around, yeah, girl  
I don't want to be someone in love  
Wastin' my time  
  
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby  
Waitin' here on your love  
[Repeat x 3]
