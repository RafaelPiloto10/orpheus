Everybody groove to the music  
Everybody jam, we've been waiting so long  
Just can't hold it back no more  
Creepin' up and down now  
It's time for me to let it go  
If you really wanna see  
What we can do for you  
Send the crazy wildin' static, sing it  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  
Well, I'm creepin' up on your left  
Straight up funky when I get with you  
I get ruthless when I get wet  
Keep the party packed in my corner  
Tough like to keep the crowd hype  
Get up on this just to get right  
What you want is what you're gonna get  
Backstreet's got the special effects  
If you really wanna see  
What we can do for you  
Send the crazy wildin' static, sing it  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  
We've got it going on for years  
We've been waiting so long  
Just can't hold it back no more  
Creepin' up and down now  
It's time for me to let it go  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years
