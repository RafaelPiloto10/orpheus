I found the perfect picture, of a perfect stranger.  
It looked as if, it were taken in the forties sometime,  
Judging by the style.  
He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane,  
Perhaps he died in a car crash, years ago.  
Right now, it's impossible to tell.  
I almost thought I saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge.  
I asked him the time, but when he turned around,  
I saw it wasn't him at all.  
I'm still searching.  
I'm still searching.  
I saw him in an airport, while he was sitting on a wing.  
And I waved to him, but I don't think he noticed me.  
I've got a funny feeling I know who he is.  
Mr. X (Repeat 14 times and fade)
