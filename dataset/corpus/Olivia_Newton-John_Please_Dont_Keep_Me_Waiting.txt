I want to love you once again  
Couldn't you love me too  
Don't turn away from all that we've been through  
Everyone changes, be my friend  
Haven't you got the time  
Help me I need you, throw me down a line  
  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't hold on much longer  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't love you any stronger  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again  
  
Living on dreams from yesterday  
Waking and you're not here  
I want to see your face  
I want you near  
Now is the moment we must live  
You can't run and hide  
I know you want me too  
Down deep inside  
  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't hold on much longer  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't love you any stronger  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again  
  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't hold on much longer  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't love you any stronger  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again
