Since Supernatural ain't nothin' changed  
All new players still the same old game  
Well if you're low-ridin' or your up in your range  
Let me see you blow your horn  
  
For the mommies that be lookin' good at he bus stop  
The ones at the club that be makin' the fires start  
Your fools with the thugs that be makin' the guns spark  
Why can't we all just get along?  
  
LAPD, riots, beating  
Streets on fire, people fleeting  
Someone said there's O.J. speeding  
Cochran beef in that club ain't fittin'  
  
Tyson's fight, Vegas lights  
Tupac lost his life that night  
And Biggie dies  
And hip-hop prize  
And that's when the East and the West unite  
So, come on
