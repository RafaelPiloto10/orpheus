Why is it that u can see the worst in me  
I swear sometimes it feels like it natures me  
But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin' me  
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me  
So I'm a just tell myself that it works for me  
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des  
And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces  
Yeah that'll make me transform to Hercules  
  
[Chorus]  
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am  
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am  
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am  
  
(I love who I am, I love, whoa)  
  
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old  
And the only thing that change is the price of gold  
Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul  
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold  
So do you take me to be who I am?  
To have and to hold till death do us part  
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part  
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?  
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe  
Then you say I won't survive if I leave  
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve  
I no longer need your attention, at ease  
  
It's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
It's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
Now it's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
It's a joke, it's a game,  
Why am I still keeping score?  
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed  
I'm a woman, hear me roar  
  
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
