-From Clone High-  
  
The ancient pharoh's were not to bright they say  
But they made one contribution, that I live by to this day  
It's the food pyramid, and it's approved by the U.S.D.A.  
  
Oh, grains are the foundation, so please take my advice  
Have five to eleven servings of bread, cereal, or rice  
Three to five of vegitables, and four of fruits is best  
Thier anti-oxidents and fiber help you to digest  
Three servings of yogurt, milk, and cheese  
Will help your bones and subsidise the cattle industry  
A body needs to grow  
And growing takes proteins  
That's why meat can be a tasty treat like fish or human beings  
And when you eat your sweets, make sure you try  
To limit your servings, or you'll DIE!!!  
  
EVERYBODY!  
  
My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy food  
So do what we say  
(yeah)  
Eat right every day  
(food)  
I love you.
