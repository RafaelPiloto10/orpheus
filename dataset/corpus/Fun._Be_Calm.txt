As I walk through the streets of my new city  
My back feeling much better, I suppose  
I've reclaimed the use of my imagination  
For better or for worse, I've yet to know  
But I always knew you'd be the one to understand me,  
I guess that's why it took so long to get things right.  
Suddenly I'm lost  
On my street  
On my block  
  
Oh why, Oh why  
Oh why haven't you been there for me?  
Can't you see, I'm losing my mind this time?  
This time I think it's for real, I can see  
  
All the tree tops turning red  
The beggars near bodegas grin at me  
I think they want something  
I close my eyes, I tell myself to breathe  
  
And be calm.  
Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes.  
Be calm.  
  
I'm scared that everyone is out to get me.  
"These days before you speak to me you pause."  
"I always see you looking out your window."  
"After all, you lost your band, you left your mom."  
Now every single crack, every penny that I pass,  
Says I should either leave or pick it up  
But with every single buck I've made  
I'm saddled with bad luck that came  
  
The moment I was baptized  
Or when I found out one day I'm gonna die  
If only I could find my people or my place in life  
A when they come a'carolin'  
So loud, so bright, the theremin  
Will lead us to a chorus  
Where we'll all rejoice and sing a song that goes:  
  
Oh be calm.  
Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
I know that it gets so hard sometimes,  
Be calm.  
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.  
You hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive  
And everything's wrong  
It just gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm.  
  
I don't remember much that night,  
Just walking, thinking fondly of you  
Thinking how the worst is yet to come  
When from that street corner came a song  
And I can't remember the man,  
The panhandler or his melody.  
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change I'd given thee.  
  
Oh be calm.  
Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes,  
Be calm.  
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.  
You hate your pulse because it still thinks you're alive  
And everything's wrong  
It just gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm.  
Be calm.
