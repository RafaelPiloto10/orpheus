Ran into you yesterday  
Memories rushed through my brain  
Its starting to hit me  
Now you're not with me  
I realize I made a mistake  
I thought that I needed some space  
But I just let love go to waste  
Its so crystal clear now  
That I need you here now  
I gotta get you back today  
  
This time I want it all  
This time I want it all  
Showing you all the cards  
Giving you all my heart  
This time I'll take the chance  
This time I'll be your man  
I can be all you need  
This time its all of me  
  
I hit the bar every night  
Looking to score a good time  
Its not like I planned it  
Left empty handed  
Cause Im still alone in my mind  
Now what will it take to feel right  
Can I come see you tonight  
Is there someone new now  
What can I do now  
Cause I need you back by my side  
  
This time I want it all  
This time I want it all  
Showing you all the cards  
Giving you all my heart  
This time Ill take the chance  
This time Ill be your man  
I can be all you need  
This time its all of me  
  
Last time I wasnt sure.  
This time I will give you more  
I'm more mature  
Ill show you  
Last time I didn't know  
I messed up let her let you go  
I need you, don't say no  
  
Laying alone in this room  
All that is missing is you  
Pick up the phone  
Wont you come home  
  
This time I want it all  
This time I want it all  
I' m showing you all the cards  
Giving you all my heart  
This time Ill take the chance  
This time Ill be your man  
I can be all you need  
This time its all of me  
All of me
