I've got your picture in the palm of my hand  
And I'm squeezin' it I'm teasin' it  
I'd follow you to the edge of this land  
But I'm losin' it, confusin' it  
  
This is a man who has lost control  
Lost the road to a higher soul  
Stop me from fallin' you know I need you  
  
To lift me up  
Won't you lift me up yeah  
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew  
And when you can see  
You've always been there for me  
I'm waiting for your love  
  
There'll be a time when all our rhythms of love  
Are shakin' it we're makin' it  
There'll be a place where life is livin' to give  
This harmony it will come to me  
  
And when I think of those who love you now  
If I had my chances again somehow  
Stop me from fallin' you know I need you  
To lift me up  
Won't you lift me up yeah  
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew  
And when you can see  
Another side of me  
I'm waiting for you  
  
I'm not eating I'm not sleeping this tension this worry  
You don't call you don't write me  
I need your love in a hurry  
Teach me, reach me, meet me, beat me,  
Tease me, please me,  
Come and seize me  
  
This is a man who has lost control  
Lost the road to a higher soul  
Catch me from fallin' you know I need you  
  
To lift me up  
Won't you lift me up yeah  
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew  
And when you can see  
You've always been there for me  
I'm waiting for your love  
And when you can see  
The changes I've made in me  
Well I'm waitin' for, you know I'm waitin' for your love
