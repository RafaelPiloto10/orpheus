Central park looks like a graveyard  
It never rained like that before  
I took the ferry to new jersey  
Never coming back no more  
In my hand I hold a ticket  
Statue points up to the clouds  
Now I'm leaving New York city  
I can hear the seagulls cries  
  
Whenever I saw you, it felt like the first time  
Whenever I kissed you, just like the furst time  
Whenever I hold you it was never the same  
And I thought that the last time  
Would never come  
Today  
  
Autumn's sun burns down on berlin  
A turkish bride just passes by  
Someone plans a revolution  
Little kites dance in the sky  
I will always hear your heartbeat  
I will always think of you  
Laughter's ringing from the playgrounds  
As I watch the children play  
Ain't no doubt  
  
Whenever I saw you, it felt like the first time  
Whenever I kissed you, just like the furst time  
Whenever I hold you it was never the same  
And I thought that the last time  
Would never come  
Today  
Here comes the rain  
Right now!
