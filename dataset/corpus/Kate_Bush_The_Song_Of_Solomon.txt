The song of Solomon  
The song of everyone  
Who walks the path  
Of the solitary heart  
The soul cries out  
Hear a woman singing  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't want your bullshit, yeah  
Just want your sexuality  
Don't want excuses, yeah  
Write me your poetry in motion  
Write it just for me, yeah  
And sign it with a kiss  
  
Just take any line  
"Comfort me with apples  
For I am sick of love  
His left hand is under my head  
And his right hand  
Doth embrace me"  
This is the Song of Solomon  
Here's a woman singing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'll do it for you  
I'll be the Rose of Sharon for you  
I'll do it for you  
I'll be the Lily of the Valley for you  
I'll do it for you  
I'll be Isolde or Marion for you  
I'll do it for you  
Ooh I'll come in a hurricane for you  
I'll do it for you  
  
Don't want your bullshit  
Just want your sexuality
