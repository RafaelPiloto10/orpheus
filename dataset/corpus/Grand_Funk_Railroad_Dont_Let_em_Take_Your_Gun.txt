Ohhh, people why don't you come in here and let me talk to you a while.  
That's right, step right up and listen to a concerned citizen speak his piece.  
  
I'll tell you a little something that my daddy told to me.  
My basic fundamentals if you want to be free.  
'cause son, there's somthing wrong internally.  
So, if you want your freedom son.  
Don't want your country to be overrun.  
You got to keep america number one.  
  
(chorus)  
My daddy told me "son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
That's what they tryin' to do.  
Son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
They're takin' your bill of rights away from you."  
My daddy said "son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
That's what they tryin' to do.  
Son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
Don't let 'em take your gun away from you."  
  
Ohhh, this year is our anniversary.  
Two hundred years, people we've been free.  
Won't be nobody takin' over our land.  
If everybody's brother's got a gun in his hand.  
I'm tellin' you we learned to fight for justice.  
We're willing to die for freedom.  
Hand in hand.  
You got to understand.  
We are american men.  
  
Said they want your gun.  
Said they want your gun.  
Send 'em on the run.  
Send 'em on the run.  
Hip-hurray for fun.  
Hip-hurray for fun.  
If they do we're done.  
If they do we're done.  
  
(chorus)
