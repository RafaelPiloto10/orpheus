I hit the coast with the faith of a preacherman. I saw a ghost with a face
like a madman. I had this dream I was sleeping at the Royal Ball. I hit the
streets, hey watch me in the monitor! I saw a clone who looked just like a
senator. I checked the clock, I felt that it was time to go go go.  
  
Then came you.  
  
Why did you keep me waiting so long?  
Why did you keep me waiting so long?  
Why did you keep me waiting so long?  
  
I was a spy, I was captured by the enemies. I made a million selling secret
fantasies. I saw my love wasted in a pale grey zone. I was the quake shaking
every monument. I had to fi-find out what all the money meant. I checked the
sun, I knew that it was time to go go go.  
  
Then came you...
