Shh... Here they come  
Now Louie Louie had his day  
Nothin' gonna change it now  
The rats and snakes will never fade away  
Not while I'm alive  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
There come the cossacks  
The road spiders  
The super gliders  
Burnin' trash, flickin' class, all the white trash  
Yeah!  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
  
Now Louie Louie had his time  
Seemed like only yesterday  
Sandy and harry got married and moved away  
'Cause they had nothin' left to say  
Yeah!  
You with the glasses, I'll see you later  
We'll find love I know  
Rockin', reelin', double dealin', one more time this time with feelin'  
Yeah!  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Go boys, yeah!  
  
You move so fine  
Yeah what a scene I said  
Mmm, kinda aquiline  
Yeah baby saw through this now  
You smell so good  
Yeah, and your shirt's always pressed  
You'll be the best inside my baby  
Yeah, we're all under arrest now!  
  
Louie Louie made his mark  
On this tender heart of mine  
The Jamaican moon don't let it get dark  
Though we rock out in the night time  
  
Yeah! let's get on outta here now, let's go!
