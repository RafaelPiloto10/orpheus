Crimson flames tied through my ears  
Rolling high and mighty traps  
Pounced with fire on flamin' roads  
Usin' ideas as my maps  
We'll meet on edges soon said I  
Proud 'neath heated brow  
Ah, but I was so much older than  
I'm younger than that now  
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth  
Rip down all hate I screamed  
Lies that life is black and white  
Spoke from my skull I dreamed  
Romantic facts of musketeers  
Foundation deep somehow  
Ah, but I was so much older than  
I'm younger than that now  
Girls faces formed the forward path  
From phony jealousy  
To memorizin' politics  
Of ancient history  
Flung down by corpse evangelists  
Unthought of, though, somehow  
Ah, but I was so much older than  
I'm younger than that now  
Ah, but I was so much older than  
I'm younger than that now  
My guard stood hard  
When abstract threats too noble to neglect  
Deceived me into thinkin'  
I had somethin' to protect  
Good and bad, I define these terms  
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow  
Ah, but I was so much older than  
I'm younger than that now  
I'm younger than that now  
I'm younger than that now  
I'm younger than that now  
I'm younger than that now
