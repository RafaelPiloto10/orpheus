With this heart open wide  
From the depths from the heights  
I will bring a sacrifice  
With these hands lifted high  
Here my song here my cry  
I will bring a sacrifice  
I will bring a sacrifice  
  
I lay me down  
I'm not my own  
I belong to you alone  
Lay me down  
Lay me down  
Oh, hand on my heart  
This much is true  
There's no life apart from you  
Lay me down  
Lay me down  
  
Letting go of my pride  
Giving up all my rights  
Take this life and let it shine, shine, shine  
Take this life and let it shine  
  
I lay me down  
I'm not my own  
I belong to you alone  
Lay me down  
Lay me down, oh oh oh  
Hand on my heart  
This much is true  
There's no life apart from you  
Lay me down  
Lay me down  
Oh oh oh  
Lay me down  
Lay me down  
  
It will be my joy to say  
Your will, your way  
It will be my joy to say  
Your will, your way  
It will be my joy to say  
Your will, your way, always  
  
It will be my joy to say  
Your will, your way  
It will be my joy to say  
Your will, your way  
It will be my joy to say  
Your will, your way, always  
  
I lay me down  
I'm not my own  
I belong to you alone  
Lay me down  
Lay me down, oh oh oh  
Hand on my heart  
This much is true  
There's no life apart from you  
Lay me down  
Lay me down, oh oh oh  
Lay me down  
Lay me down, oh oh oh  
Lay me down  
Lay me down
