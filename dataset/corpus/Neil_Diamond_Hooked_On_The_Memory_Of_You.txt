Stay with me, here with me  
I want you near with me  
I'm a man  
That's hooked on the memory  
Of you and I, who knows why?  
I only know that I'm sure, I am  
Hooked on the memory of you  
  
Time, time standing still  
I know it's you, I always will  
Need you too,  
Lay with me, lie with me  
Spend your desire with me, if you can  
I'm hooked on the memory  
Of you and I, who knows why?  
I guess I just wanted for you to be  
Hooked on the memory of me  
  
Time, time standing still,  
I know it's you, I always will  
Want you to, be here with me  
I want you to stay right here with me  
I need you to love with me,  
Laugh with me,  
Forgive the past with me  
I know you can  
  
I'm hooked on the memory  
Of you and I, who knows why?  
Guess I just wanted for you to be  
Hooked on the memory of me  
Oh you know that it's true  
Not a thing I can do  
I'm hooked on the memory of you
