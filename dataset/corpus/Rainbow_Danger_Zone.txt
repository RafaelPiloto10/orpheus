Shaking off the tresholds of a long forgotten dream  
And you just can't make it last  
Coaching paradise on a personal line  
But you get fired to fast  
And you lie, memories drifting by  
Love don't make it on those pin-striped nights  
When you're looking through someone's disguise  
You can't make it alone, so you gotta make a move  
But you're looking at nobody's eyes  
Well that's love, or maybe love come and go  
Looking for love is a danger zone  
Love don't go begging in the danger zone  
You won't get nothing from the danger zone  
Tales that you tell from the stories that you'll hear  
And you'll get what you can while you may  
Don't understand when you're looking for a dame  
But it's only a heartbreak away  
And you'll learn, faking has no return  
No way when you're feeling that way  
Will your feet get caught up in the crowd  
And the song that you sing is too soft to be heard  
But your speakers are way too loud  
Like the pain, loving is no big game  
Looking for love is a danger zone  
No don't go living in the danger zone  
You won't get nothing from the danger zone  
Don't take no chances in the danger zone  
Love don't go begging in the danger zone  
No don't go living in the danger zone  
You won't get nothing from the danger zone  
Don't take no chances in the danger zone  
Love don't go begging in the danger zone
