Clinging to me  
Like a last breath you would breathe  
You were like home to me  
I don't recognize the street  
  
Please don't close your eyes  
Don't know where to look without them  
Outside the cars speed by  
I never heard them until now  
  
I know you care, I know it is always been there  
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it  
You are just saving yourself when you hide it  
Yeah, I know you care  
I see it in the way that you stare  
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it  
I'll be saving myself from the ruin  
And I know you care  
  
I use to run down the stairs, to the door  
And I thought you were there  
To shape to the comfort of us  
Two lovers loved out of love  
  
Oh, but I know you care  
I know it is always been there  
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it  
You are just saving yourself when you hide it  
Yeah, I know you care  
I see it in the way that you stare  
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it  
I'll be saving myself from the ruin  
  
I know it wasn't always wrong  
But I've never known a winter so cold  
Now I don't want my hands in a coat  
But I still hope  
'Cause this is how things ought to have been  
And I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed  
Why can't I dream?  
Do I care to dream?  
  
'Cause I know you care  
And I know you care  
I know you care  
I know you care  
I know it's always been there
