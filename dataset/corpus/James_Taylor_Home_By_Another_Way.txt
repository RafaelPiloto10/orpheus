Those magic men the Magi, some people call them wise or Oriental, even kings.  
Well anyway, those guys, they visited with Jesus, they sure enjoyed their
stay.  
Then warned in a dream of King Herod's scheme, they went home by another way.  
Yes, they went home by another way, home by another way.  
Maybe me and you can be wise guys too and go home by another way.  
We can make it another way, safe home as they used to say.  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way.  
  
Steer clear of royal welcomes, avoid a big to-do.  
A king who would slaughter the innocents will not cut a deal for you.  
He really, really wants those presents, he'll comb your camel's fur  
Until his boys announce they've found trace amounts of your frankincense, gold
and myrrh.  
Time to go home by another way, home by another way.  
You have to figure the Gods, saying play the odds, and go home by another way.  
We can make it another way, safe home as they used to say.  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way.  
  
Home is where they want you now,  
You can more or less assume that you'll be welcome in the end.  
Mustn't let King Herod haunt you so or fantasize his features when you're
looking at a friend.  
Well it pleasures me to be here and to sing this song tonight,  
They tell me that life is a miracle and I figured that they're right.  
But Herod's always out there, he's got our cards on file.  
It's a lead pipe cinch, if we give an inch, old Herod likes to take a mile.  
It's best to go home by another way, home by another way.  
We got this far to a lucky star, but tomorrow is another day.  
We can make it another way, safe home as they used to say.  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way.
