Chris Brown:  
You know what I'm thinkin'  
You know that it's you,  
But some things need perfection,  
Unlike you,  
  
Chris Brown and Rihanna:  
So why am I so in love?  
Your the best thing in my life and always will be  
  
Rihanna:  
I'm so glad your mine,  
You mean the world to me,  
  
Chris Brown:  
Your like a summers day,  
  
Both:  
I asked for your love,  
You gave it to me,  
I needed your trust,  
The same as can be,  
  
Rihanna:  
I thought I would lose you,  
But I knew I was wrong,  
  
Chris brown:  
So why did it have to happen,  
When you sing this song,  
  
Both:  
I know my mistakes,  
So light as a dove,  
I learn from them all,  
Why am I so in love,  
  
Rihanna:  
'Coz I need to know,  
What's in my heart,  
  
Chris Brown:  
Like a love,  
In my love chart,  
  
Chorus  
Both:  
I asked for your love,  
You gave it to me,  
I needed your trust,  
The same as can be,  
Repeat chorus  
  
Both:  
My love is strong,  
Why am I so in love?
