The golden light above you shows me where you're from  
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon  
You stand up on your hill, behop all around you  
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah  
They wonder where I found you  
  
Oh my love it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way  
  
I tried to understand you, I tried to love you right  
The way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight  
Your lips are like a fire burning through my soul  
And people ask me where you're from  
They really wanna know  
  
Oh my soul it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way  
  
Magic woman wreckin' up my soul  
Things you tell me have never been told  
Magic woman I don't know  
Electric before me, I love you so, I love you so  
  
You're racing like a fireball dancing like a ghost  
You're Gemini and I don't know which one I like the most  
My head is getting broken and my mind is getting bust  
But now I'm coming with you down the road of golden dust  
  
Oh my love it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way  
  
The golden light above you show me where you're from  
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon  
You stand up on your hill, behop all around you  
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah  
They wonder where I found you  
  
Oh my love it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way
