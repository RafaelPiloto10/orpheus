May the memories not be forgot  
May we never lose our mind  
May no one tamper with our thoughts  
For the sake of open eyes  
  
For open eyes my dear  
For open eyes  
We will not drink to blindness dear  
We'll drink to open eyes!  
  
The mindless cretin on parade  
They may fill our lives with fear  
Should we forgive and look away  
Well perhaps, but not this year!  
  
For open eyes my dear  
For open eyes  
We will not drink to blindness deat  
We'll drink to open eyes  
  
Our enemies may come on strong  
They may try to break our will  
Should we forgive and look away  
Just before we spring to kill!  
  
For open eyes my dear  
For open eyes  
We will not drink to blindness dear
