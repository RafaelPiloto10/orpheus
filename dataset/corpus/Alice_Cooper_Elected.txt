I'm your top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice,  
I want to be elected,  
I'm your Yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce,  
I want to be elected,  
Kids want a savior, don't need a fake,  
I want to be elected,  
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make,  
I want to be elected,  
Elected, elected  
Respected, elected  
  
I never lied to you, I've always been cool,  
I want to be elected,  
I gotta get the vote, and I told you 'bout school,  
I want to be elected, elected, elected,  
Hallelujah, I want to be selected,  
Everyone in the United States of America.  
  
We're gonna win this one, take the country by storm,  
We're gonna be elected,  
You and me together, young and strong,  
We're gonna be elected, elected, elected,  
Respected, selected, call collected,  
I want to be elected.  
  
"And if I am elected  
I promise the formation of a new party  
A third party, the Wild Party!  
I know we have problems,  
We got problems right here in Central City,  
We have problems on the North, South, East and West,  
New York City, Saint Louis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles,  
Detroit, Chicago,  
Everybody has problems,  
And personally, I don't care."
