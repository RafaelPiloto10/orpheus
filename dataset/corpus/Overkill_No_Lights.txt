You know when I think of you  
And I feel to let it out  
For what we did pursue  
And all we were about  
And when I think of Who  
Flooding me with light  
Don't think you need to hear this  
Yeah, you did it right  
  
[Chorus]  
It's over, but yeah, we have taken the light  
It's over, by winning for losing the fight  
Over, it's over, it's over  
It's gone into flight  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
  
I found meaning  
In the words that you would speak  
And I found strength  
Inside the fact that we were weak  
And when I picture you  
Covered in our rags  
If this man shall fall  
Who will take the flag  
  
Hard rubber and a wind-blown face  
Got a full-blown eight-eight  
To get us home  
No trouble got an extra ace  
A stand-up, throw-up  
Never let me be alone  
Over, it's over, it's over  
You've taken my lights  
Over, it's over, it's over  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
  
To have known you  
Still helps to get me through  
And to thank you now  
Is all that I could do  
And when I motor on  
On into the night  
I know that you are there  
I know you are my lights  
  
Over, it's over, it's over  
You've taken my lights  
Over, it's over, it's over  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
There's no light  
As I ride
