I see you driving round town with the guy I love  
And I'm like forget you  
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough  
I'm like forget you and forget him too  
  
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with you  
Ha, now ain't that some sh..  
And although there's pain in my chest  
I still wish you the best with a forget you  
  
Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari  
But that don't mean I can't get you there  
I guess she's an Xbox and I'm more an Atari  
But the way you play your game ain't fair  
  
I pity the fool that falls in love with you  
Well, I've got some news for you  
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend  
  
I see you driving around town with the guy I love  
And I'm like forget you  
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough  
I'm like forget you and forget him too  
  
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with you  
Ha, now ain't that some sh...  
And although there's pain in my chest  
I still wish you the best with a forget you  
  
Now I know, that I had to borrow  
Beg and steal and lie and cheat  
Trying to keep you, trying to please you  
'Cause being in love with your face ain't cheap  
  
Now, I pity the fool that falls in love with you  
Well, I've got some news for you  
I really hate you right now  
  
I see you driving 'round town with the guy I love  
And I'm like forget you  
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough  
I'm like forget you and forget him too  
  
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with you  
Ha, now ain't that some sh  
And although there's pain in my chest  
I still wish you the best with a forget you  
  
Now baby, baby, baby  
Why'd you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?  
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me,  
"This is one for your dad."  
  
Yeah, she did  
Uh, why? Ugh, why?  
Ugh, why baby? Oh, I love you  
I still love you, ooh  
  
I see you driving 'round town with the guy I love  
And I'm like forget you  
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough  
I'm like forget you and forget him too  
  
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with you  
Ha, now ain't that some sh  
And although there's pain in my chest  
I still wish you the best with a forget you
