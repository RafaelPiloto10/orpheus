I see the world on a string  
It's hanging from a wire  
It gets tangled up and spun around  
Like the truth inside a liar  
Sometimes you wanna get high  
And sometimes you run and hide  
'Cause it eats you up and spits you out  
It swallows you alive  
  
[Chorus]  
When I'm down on my knees  
And it hurts to believe (I'm bleeding)  
You'll bring me back to life  
When there's no songs to sing  
And no flowers to bring (no feeling)  
And you'll bring me back to life  
And you'll bring me back to life  
  
I see the world on a beach  
It's sinking in the sand  
Oh it tries to suck you down with it  
You better get out while you can  
Sometimes you wanna scream out  
And sometimes you just can't  
'Cause your lips  
Feel like they're glued together  
And no one gives a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the world on a string  
There's no songs left to sing  
Just sing  
Sing  
  
I see the good  
I see the bad  
The revolution  
I see the happy  
I see the sad  
The absolution  
I see hate  
And I see love  
When the world's on a string  
  
I see the good  
I see the bad  
The revolution  
I see the happy  
I see the sad  
The absolution  
I see hate  
And I see love  
When the world's on a string  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm down on my knees  
And it hurts to believe (I'm bleeding)  
You'll bring me back to life  
When there's no songs to sing  
And no flowers to bring (No feeling)  
And you'll bring me back to life  
And you'll bring me back to life  
And you'll bring me back to life.
