You've been treatin' me like dirt now you don't care how I hurt now  
But there's no thing you better try and understand  
You gonna come home one of these nights find your mama ain't doin' you right  
You got a hanky panky woman on your hand  
Well I'm tryin' to be good now a doin' everything I should now  
But you come home just when you want to mend  
Better listen to what I say now cause a gonna come a day now  
You'll have a hanky panky woman on your hand  
What will you say now what will you do now  
You gonna lose your lovin' woman you better listen man  
You better stop and realize now ain't tellin' no lies now  
You'll have a hanky panky woman on your hand  
[ guitar ]  
Well you know you been doin' me wrong now it ain't a gonna be too long now  
And I try to tell you exactly where you stand  
You know what you've been doin' you headed straight toward ruin  
You got a hanky panky woman on your hand  
What will you say now...  
You'll have a hanky panky woman on your hand  
You'll have a hanky panky woman on your hand
