I know if I'd been wiser this would never have occurred  
But I wallowed in my blindness so it's plain that I deserve  
For the sin of self-indulgence when the truth was writ quite clear  
I must spend my life amongst the dead who spend their lives in fear  
Of a death that they're not sure of, of a life they can't control  
It's all so simple really if you just look to your soul  
  
Some say that I'm a wise man, some think that I'm a fool  
It doesn't matter either way: I'll be a wise man's fool  
For the lesson lies in learning and by teaching I'll be taught  
For there's nothing hidden anywhere, it's all there to be sought  
And so if you know anything look closely at the time  
At others who remain untrue and don't commit that crime
