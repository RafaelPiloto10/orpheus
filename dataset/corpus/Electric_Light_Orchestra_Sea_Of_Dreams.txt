Little girl in the sea of dreams  
There's a smile on her little face  
She looked around she could see no peace  
Her heart was sad and her body weak  
  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
  
But in her dream she was big and strong  
She fell in love with a sailor  
He travelled far off to distant lands  
He never travelled to see her  
  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum  
  
Then one night a strange man did come  
He whispered words unto her mother  
Little girl in the sea of dreams  
She closed her eyes and met her maker
