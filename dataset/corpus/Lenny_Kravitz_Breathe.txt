I'm so into you  
Don't know what to do  
I feel that cupid's hit me with an arrow  
I know this is true  
'Cause all I see is you  
If you're my queen  
Then I will be your pharaoh (pronounced farrow)  
  
I thirst in you love  
I can't get enough  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
You burn in the blood  
I'm drownin' in the flood  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just  
Wanna hear you breathe  
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just  
Wanna hear you breathe  
  
Our souls have aligned  
To me you were designed  
You are my charm  
And no one else can take it  
If you're so inclined  
I'll keep your love enshrined  
Inside my heart where no one else can break it  
  
I thirst in you love  
I can't get enough  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
You burn in the blood  
I'm drownin' in the flood  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just  
Wanna hear you breathe  
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just  
Wanna hear you breathe  
  
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just  
I thirst in you love  
I can't get enough  
I just want to hear you breathe  
You burn in the blood  
I'm drownin' in the flood  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
I thirst in you love  
I can't get enough  
I just wanna hear you breathe  
You burn in the blood  
I'm drownin' in the flood  
I just wanna hear you breathe
