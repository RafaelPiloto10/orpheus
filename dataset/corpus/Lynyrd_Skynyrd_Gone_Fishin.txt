The only time I'll get up early  
Is to meet my mules at the fishin' hole  
I want to catch the one that got away  
I want to feel my pole bending in that way  
Since I was a kid I've felt this way  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
  
Gone Fishin' Yeah  
  
St John's River runs north not south  
Smart enough to have a large mouth  
If you can hook 'em, you can mount 'em, you can keep 'em around  
But if they break your line they're gonna go back down  
  
Since I was a kid I've felt this way  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
  
Gone Fishin' Oh  
  
Ain't nothing like sunrise on a lake  
But when the moon comes up at night  
There's things out there that can take your life  
You might just die of fright  
  
But I'll be there come rain or shine  
You see it's what I like to do  
Only thing better than settin' a hook  
is settin' my hook in you.  
  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
Gone Fishin' Oh Oh Yeah, Yeah, Wooo Yeah  
  
I been everywhere, tried everything  
But there ain't nothing that feels the same  
When you find the right one it's a magical thing  
Next thing you know it's a diamond ring  
  
She hooked me and took my name  
I fell, hook, line and sinker.  
  
Gone Fishin' Yeah  
Gone, Gone Fishin'  
She Hooked Me  
  
Gone, Gone Fishin' Yeah  
Gone, Gone, Gone Fishin' Yeah  
  
She's my baby  
Well I'm gone  
  
Gone Fishin' Yeah Yeah Oh Oh  
Gone Fishin'
