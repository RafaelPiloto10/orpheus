Sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
Ain't turnin' back for me and you  
Don't look over your shoulder  
No time for regrets  
You got your demons I got mine  
Our paths have crossed at a crucial time  
Suddenly we're older  
Scared of what's ahead  
We were looking for the answers in all the wrong places  
But now the chance is knocking on our door  
To grab hold of what we been readin' for  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
No need to wonder where the future lies  
It's right before our very eyes  
Don't even think it over  
Just say yes  
We were clinging to some old cliches and old familar faces  
But now they're only shattered dreams  
So let's dry our eyes and start away clean  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
We were lookin' for the answers in all the wrong places  
But now the chance is knocking on our door  
To open up our aliing hearts once more  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away  
It's just a motion away
