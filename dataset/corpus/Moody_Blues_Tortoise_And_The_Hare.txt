You know he's moving fast,  
Be he's still going slow,  
He's ahead in the race,  
And there is not far to go,  
And your load is so heavy  
And your legs want to rest.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
  
You think he's way up in front  
But he's so far behind.  
He's asleep in the grass,  
And he's run out of time.  
While your load was so heavy  
You never wanted to stop.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
  
Your friend is heavy  
But he was ready  
And never stopped for a while  
And while you were sleeping  
He went on keeping the final line in his mind.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
Your friend is heavy  
But he was ready  
And never stopped for a while  
And while you were sleeping  
He went on keeping the final line in his mind.  
  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
