I'm gonna tell you a story  
'Bout ol' Mary Lou  
I mean the kind of a girl  
That make a fool of you  
  
She make a young man old  
And an old man pay  
The way she took my money  
Was a crying shame  
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my watch and chain  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my diamond ring  
She took the keys to my Cadillac car  
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar  
  
Put a detective  
On her trail  
The post office thought  
They'd chase her by the mail  
  
She got picked up  
And then was put in jail  
Stroked the judge  
Just to go her bail  
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my watch and chain  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my diamond ring  
She took the keys to my Cadillac car  
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar  
  
She left Detroit  
To go to Kalamazoo  
Made her a fortune  
Out of fools like you  
  
Met her a rich man  
Who was married and had some kids  
Stroked that cat  
Until he flipped his lid  
  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my watch and chain  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my diamond ring  
She took the keys to my Cadillac car  
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar  
  
She came back into town  
About a week ago  
Told me she's sorry  
She had hurt me so  
  
I had a '65 Ford  
And a two dollar bill  
The way she took that  
Lord, it gave me a thrill  
  
Mary Lou  
She took my watch and chain  
Mary Lou, Mary Lou  
She took my diamond ring  
She took the keys to my Cadillac car  
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar
