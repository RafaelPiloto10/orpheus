Now he's brought down the rain  
And the Indian summer is through  
In the morning you'll be following your trail again  
Fair play to you  
  
You ain't calling me to join you  
And I'm spoken for anyway  
But I will cry when ye go away  
I will cry when ye go away  
  
Your beauty is familiar  
And your voice is like a key  
That opens up my soul  
And torches up a fire inside of me  
  
Your coat is made of magic  
And around your table angels play  
And I will cry when ye go away  
I will cry when ye go away  
  
Somebody left his whisky  
And the night is very young  
I've got some to say and more to tell  
And the words will soon be spilling from my tongue  
  
I will rave and I will ramble  
I'll do everything but make you stay  
Then I will cry when ye go away  
I will cry when ye go away  
  
When ye go away...  
When ye go away...
