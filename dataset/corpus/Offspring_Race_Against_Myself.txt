All I want  
All I need  
Always lies just out of reach  
I've been coming up empty  
  
I've run as fast  
As I can run  
I've pushed as hard as anyone  
Still there's nothing for me  
  
I've tried as hard as I can  
I've taken all I can stand  
But I am running a race  
Against myself  
  
Burning out  
Strung along  
Now my sorrow is my song  
My whole world is half-hearted  
  
For my pain  
I have none  
After all is said and done  
Now I'm back where I started  
  
I've gone as far as I can  
I've taken all I can stand  
But I am running a race  
Against myself
