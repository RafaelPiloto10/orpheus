All hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
  
It's amazing how everything turns out so right  
You were lost, now you're found by the love, by the life  
That you kindely meet it's time you're near  
Gonna love you the way I'm created to do  
  
All hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
Can you show me that stone? Can you tell me that rock?  
That is larger than us and can move what is right?  
No coincidence I'm in love with you  
Gonna love you the way I'm created to do  
  
Oh oh oh believe me  
  
Believe me when all hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
  
All hope is gone  
You've lost your guts for fightin'  
You're hangin' your head  
and don't know where to turn  
Don't cry, don't fear,  
'Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me
