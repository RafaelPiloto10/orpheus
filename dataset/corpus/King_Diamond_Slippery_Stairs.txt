"Wake up Abigail", midday, Henry was at her door  
The Count would not rise 'til the afternoon and lunch was for two  
So they talked about Miriam and then Abigail said:  
"What about Little One?"  
Henry froze: "Oh, you mean our ghost?"  
  
"Downstairs on the lowest floor  
That's where you will find THE DOOR  
Beyond which there ware slippery stairs  
Leading down to the crypt  
  
And Little One sleeps there during the day  
But at night she'll rise, searching for her Mom  
Don't you ever go there at night, it's a sinister place  
There's so much pain, so much death, so much nothingness"  
  
When night time came on the second day and dinner it was done  
Jonathan's headache it was gone  
"Miriam please take my hand", then his mood really changed  
"Time is right to produce an heir"  
  
Playing along with his eerie game she followed him up the stairs  
Up to a room where love they would share  
To a room that smelled as if Miriam was still in there  
  
Jonathan was a hideous sight  
So Abigail she hilled the candlelight  
What was to come, should have never been done  
She was blocking her mind from his awful thing  
In her mind his moaning became  
Nothing but falling on slippery stairs  
Falling and crying, crawling and dying  
At the end of the stairs  
  
Her eyes turned black in disgust  
Hating him more with every thrust  
And then it was over before it begun  
He was done oh what a man  
  
The only time he would call her MINE
