So you think you know just what goes on inside your head, my friend  
There is so much more than you and I can comprehend  
Things that make you laugh, things that make you cry  
Let you love when you feel like you wanna die  
  
There's no answer to the questions that we find inside, my friend  
But when we start to wonder why, we wind up further behind, my friend  
All we see has always been shown  
But there's so many things that I've never known  
  
So you think you know, my friend  
But you don't know, my friend, my friend  
You think you know  
But you don't know  
  
All for one and one for all  
It's everything or nothing at all  
Listen, my friend  
You don't know  
No, my friend  
You don't know
