I've got the blues before sunrise  
Tears standing in my eyes  
I've got the blues before sunrise  
Tears standing in my eyes  
It's such a miserable feeling  
A feeling I do despise  
  
Seems like everybody  
Everybody's down on me  
Seems like everybody  
Everyone's down on poor me  
I'm gonna take my troubles  
Cast them in the deep blue sea  
  
Yes, I love my baby  
But my baby won't be here  
Yes, I love my baby  
But my baby won't be here  
I'm gonna buy me a 45  
Put my baby in her grave
