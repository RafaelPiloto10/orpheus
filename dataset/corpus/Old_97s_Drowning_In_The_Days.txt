I've been reading books when no one's lookin'  
I've been listenin' to the sirens in the night  
Robert says, "I'm goin' straight to hell, yeah"  
If I hang around here I just might  
And I'd like to take some medicine  
And like to drink some wine  
I'd like to wake up numb like all my friends  
There's a road to where I came from  
It gets longer all the time  
There's a road to where I'm goin'  
It never ends  
And my moon, it always sways  
And my guitar always plays and plays  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
I've been writing fairy tales on postcards  
Writing down the story of my life  
Carrie says, "I make everything so hard"  
Carrie says, "I'm difficult, she's right"  
And I'd like to take some medicine  
I'd like to take you home  
I'd like to get that woman off my mind  
Well I like your pouty lips  
I like your pert little bones  
But I'm sleeping with the porcelain tonight  
And my cloud, it always rains  
Ken's feedback always fades  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days
