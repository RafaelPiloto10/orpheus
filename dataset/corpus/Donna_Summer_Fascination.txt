No escaping  
No spell is over me  
Fantasy's fact you see in my life  
Time and motion  
Seem to have made a stop  
And if the whole world passes by  
I wouldn't bat an eye  
If you say you were mine  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
Such devotion  
I've never felt before  
You opened up a door in my life  
No tomorrow  
Could there be without you  
And if you should say goodbye  
I think that I would die  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
I can't think about anything else  
But you  
There's nothing I can do  
Oh no, oh no  
Nothing I can do  
Nothing I can do  
I can't think about anything else  
But you  
There's nothing I can do  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
Fascination...
