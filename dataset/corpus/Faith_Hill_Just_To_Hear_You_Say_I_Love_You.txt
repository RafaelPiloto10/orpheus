Song: By Faith Hill and Tim..  
If I could win your heart  
If you'd let me in your heart  
I'd be so happy, baby  
Just for these arms to be  
Holding you close to me  
There's nothing in this world I won't try  
No limit to what I'd do  
To make you mine, cause  
  
I'd climb right up to the sky  
I'd take down the stars  
Just to be in your arms, baby  
I'd go and capture the moon  
That's what I would do  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
  
If I could taste your kiss  
There'd be no sweeter gift  
Heaven could offer, baby (oh baby)  
I want to be the one (I want to be the one)  
Living to give you love  
I'd walk across this world just to be  
Close to you 'cause I want you  
Close to me, yeah  
  
I'd climb right up to the sky  
I'd take down the stars  
Just to be in your arms, baby  
I'd go and capture the moon  
That's what I would do  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
  
For the rest of your life  
(for the rest of your life)  
Love me for the rest of all time  
(oh baby, baby)  
Just say the word  
And I'll give you my world  
There's nothing I won't do  
Baby, Just to be with you  
I'd climb right up to the sky  
Take down the stars  
Just to be in your arms, baby  
I'd go and capture the moon  
That's what I would do  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just to hear you say that you love me, baby  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Oh, I need to hear you say  
That you love me, baby  
Just to hear you say that you love me  
Just say you love me  
Just say you need me  
Just to hear you say that you love me
