Did you know I can feel your smile?  
You and I grow closer all the while.  
Can't think of a time when you're more than I love you away.  
You are the moon in my night.  
You're the sun in my day.  
  
Shine on, shine on  
  
Have I told you, you're my morning star?  
You're my rainbow, you're my Summer shower.  
Can't think of a time when you're more than a raindrop away.  
You are the moon in my night.  
You're the sun in my day.  
  
Shine on,  
  
Do my ears deceive me?  
Or did you say you'd not leave me?  
That from now on, we could be together.  
Closer than a hand is to a glove.  
That I'm the only one you love.  
It's forever.  
  
Love on,  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
Do my ears deceive me?  
Or did you say you'd not leave me?  
That from now on, we could be together.  
Closer than a hand is to a glove.  
That I'm the only one you love.  
It's forever, forever, forever.  
  
Love on (forever)  
Love on (forever)
