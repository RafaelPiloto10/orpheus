The killers lie and wait for innocent blood  
Swallow a lives of harmless souls  
Walking a crooked path their wicked names will rot  
Evil lives in the dark (it's right is doing wrong)  
The torment never ends(it never ends)  
  
The fire that burns inside!  
That's blistering their brains!  
That makes them sacrifice!  
That's driving them insane!  
Trapped in this no man's land  
Where angels dare to tread  
Forever banned to the realms of the never dead!  
  
There is no one you can trust from this grave  
Die with those things with flu to sin ?  
Feeding all the wars  
They'll feed up in the end  
Evil lives in the dark (it's right is doing wrong)  
The torment never ends (it never ends)  
  
The fire that burns inside!  
That's blistering their brains!  
That's makes them sacrifice!  
That's driving them insane!  
Trapped in this no man's land  
Where angels dare to tread  
Forever banned to the realms of the never dead!  
  
Dead swifts before you, to press on the suicide  
Life spills out of your body, you wither and die  
  
For the rest of your life!  
In the realms of the never dead!  
  
The fire that burns inside!  
That's blistering their brains!  
That's makes them sacrifice!  
That's driving them insane!  
Trapped in this no man's land  
Where angels dare to tread  
Forever banned to the realms of the never dead!
