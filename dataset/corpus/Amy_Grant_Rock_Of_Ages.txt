Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy riven side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Cleanse me from it's guilt and pow'r  
  
Nothing in my hand I bring  
Simply to Thy cross I cling  
Nothing in my hand I bring  
Simply to Thy cross I cling  
  
Naked, come to Thee for dress  
Helpless, look to Thee for grace  
Vile, I to the fountain fly  
Wash me, savior, or I die  
  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee
