Tonight everything but me  
Taken out to sea  
All gone  
A wish written in the sand  
Washed away tomorrow  
This time  
Look what I've become  
  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
  
And I wanted everything  
Salted you could bring me  
Daylight  
A dream burning in the sky  
Leaves my spirit dry  
And you lied  
Now look what I've become  
  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
Couldn't run  
Lost in what you'd done  
Look what I've become.  
  
This time  
Look what I've become  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
Couldn't run  
Lost in what you'd done  
Look what I've become.
