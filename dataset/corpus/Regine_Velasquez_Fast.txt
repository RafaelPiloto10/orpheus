I can't believe what's happening to me  
My heart leaps when I hear your name  
You're all I think about whenever I'm alone  
I think I'm falling  
I'm falling  
I can't believe what's happening to me  
Can't believe the joy seeing you can bring  
I never thought I'd know what it means to be in love  
But I'm falling  
I'm falling  
CHORUS:  
Falling fast, oh so fast  
I'm falling fast for you  
Oh, so fast  
Hold me fast and make my dreams come true  
Hear my heart beat faster  
Now happy ever after  
I think I've found true love in you at last  
And, love, I'm falling fast  
Oh so fast.  
I can't believe what's happening to me  
Things are brighter than they've ever been  
You've brought the light into my life  
In the wink of an eye  
Iam falling  
I'm falling  
(Repeat Chorus twice)
