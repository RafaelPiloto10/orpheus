Air... Air  
Hit me in the face  
I run faster  
(Faster faster faster)  
Faster into the air  
(I say to myself)  
What is happening to my skin?  
Where is that protection that I needed?  
Air can hurt you too  
Air can hurt you too  
Some people say not to worry about the air  
Some people never had experience with...  
  
Air... Air  
It can break your heart  
So remember when the weather gets rough  
(You'll say to yourself)  
What is happening to my skin?  
Where is that protection that I needed?  
Air can hurt you too  
Air can hurt you too  
Some people say not to worry about the air  
Some people don't know shit about the...  
Air...
