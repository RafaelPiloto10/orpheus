Rain on the river turns the torrent to a flood  
Swim or you'll never rise above  
Two lonely people can mend a broken heart  
Love and you'll never fall apart  
But can you tell me why?  
They made a good bowl of chili at the jazz club  
They played a good game of football in Mucron  
They ripped everyone off at the top rank, babe  
If you could ever get into their suite  
Avenue, Tombola and Social  
We just drove right on by  
We was on our way to the big time, babe  
To the great gold record in the sky  
Sun in the morning brings the flowers from a bud  
Hail to the giver, life and love  
Two lonely people can mend a broken heart  
Love and you'll never fall apart  
But can you tell me why?  
They made a good bowl of chili at the jazz club

We just drove right on by  
We was on our way to the big time, babe  
To the great gold record in the sky  
Can you tell me why?  
Can you tell me, tell me why?  
To the great gold record in the sky
