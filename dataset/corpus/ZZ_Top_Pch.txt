I was out on the coastline  
Getting a little shake  
Do it every day  
For mercy sake  
Sometime surf's up  
Sometimes it's flat  
Eatin' up asphalt  
Prowlin' like a tomcat  
Stunned at what I see  
Should I stay or should I leave?  
Too much, not enough P-C-H  
Too much, not enough P-C-H  
Feelin' kind of free  
By the deep blue sea  
A true blood blue sud  
Hangin' on me  
Want to head north  
But I might go south  
Can't make up my mind  
'Cause I'm thinking like Brian  
I'm hangin' in and out  
I'm pullin' up 'cause it's about  
Too much, not enough P-C-H  
Too much, not enough P-C-H
