I've never felt this way before  
There's nothing else I could want more  
Than something real, only passion can reveal yeah  
  
With body and soul, I'm used to controlling  
Every, everything  
Now, I can let go, let down my guard  
And we'll see how far this love can go  
  
[Chorus:]  
I surrender my heart, I'm giving up  
And I don't want to fight, I just want to love  
I surrender it all, I'm giving in  
To the power of love - surrender  
  
This feels to good, can't bring me down  
Feels like I could never touch ground  
And how I've waited, true love anticipated yeahyeah  
  
With body and mind, I know that there's time  
For every, everything  
Now, I can let go, let down my guard  
And we'll see how far this love can go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And it's just to strong and I can't hold on  
What used to be and clear to me  
It's just a fantasy  
I'm breaking down right here right now  
I want you to know gonna take you slow just  
Let the feeling flow  
  
I surrender  
I surrender my heart, I'm giving up  
I don't want to fight  
Let it flow, just want to now  
  
I surrender it all, I'm giving in  
To the power of love  
I'm giving in baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause it's just to strong and I can't hold on  
What used to be, just in clear to me  
I'm breaking down, right here right now  
Want you to know gonna let the feelings flow  
  
I surrender  
My heart my heart  
I don't want to fight no more  
My heart my heart
