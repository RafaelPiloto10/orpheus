Never squeal on the pusher  
Don't lie to your mama  
Just do what you want to and it'll be okay  
Don't swim in the water  
Don't fly in the daytime  
Just do what you want to and it'll be okay  
  
Never smuggle no candy  
Can't be whatcha want to  
When you hafta go  
Down to the darkest places  
Yeah you're gonna be okay  
  
Don't say what's really on your mind  
Gotsta give it just a little more time  
And try to remember this rhyme and you'll be okay  
  
Now I know I turn you on  
And I think you and I could get along  
Don't, don't get me wrong you gonna be alright  
  
Say it with me now  
Never squeal on the pusher  
Don't lie to your mama  
Just do what you want to and it'll be okay  
  
Never squeal on the pusher  
Don't lie to your mama  
Just do what you want to and it'll be okay  
Don't swim in the water  
Don't fly in the daytime  
Just do what you want to and it'll be okay
