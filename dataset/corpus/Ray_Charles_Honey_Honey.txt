When I got misery, oh my where are you, honey  
Honey, oh honey honey, where can you be  
Whisperin' when the lights are low, to each  
Teardrop on my pillow  
Honey honey, honey honey, where are you  
I crossed the scalds in dessert, just to be where  
You are  
I want you need you love you, but still we're apart  
When I want to hold you, oh my where are you  
Honey honey, my honey honey, where can you be  
  
When I want to hold you, oh my where are you  
Honey honey, my honey honey, where can you be
