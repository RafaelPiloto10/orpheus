A moon beam through the prune In June  
Reveals your chest I see your lovely beans  
And in that magic go-kart I bite your neck  
The cheese I have for you, my dear  
Is real and very new  
  
A moon beam through the prune In June

And in that magic go-kart I bite your neck  
The love I have for you, my dear  
Is real and very new  
  
Prune! (pa-da-dah!)  
If it is a real prune Knows no cheese  
(cheeky chanky, cheeky chanky)  
And stands (Oh no!)  
Taller or softer than any tree (or bush)  
And I know The love I have for you  
Will grow and grow And grow, I think  
And so my love I offer you  
A love that is strong A prune that is true  
  
Lalalalalala...lalalalalaaa  
My darling, you mean so very much to me,  
I love you so deeply  
It just makes me...  
Duke, duke, duke, duke of prunes, prunes, prunes  
I'll never forget you darling...  
  
And you'll be my duchess, my duchess of prunes
