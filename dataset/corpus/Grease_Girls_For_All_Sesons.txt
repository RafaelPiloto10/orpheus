Sharon  
I'll be yours in springtime when the flowers are in bloom.  
We'll wander through the meadows, in all their sweet perfume.  
And every night I'll hold you tight beneath that April moon.  
  
Chorus  
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh  
I'll be your girl for all seasons, all the year through.  
Your girl for all seasons,  
'Cause I love, yes I love to be everything to you, just you.  
  
Paulette  
I'll be yours in summer, when we're playin' in the sand.  
We'll spend the day together, makin' love and gettin' tanned.  
And on the beach at sunset, when we're walking hand in hand.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rhonda  
If you fall in the fall, you'll see, September can be heavenly.  
If you fall, say you'll fall for me,  
When autumn leaves are fallin' from the trees.  
  
Stephanie  
I'll be yours in winter, when the snow is on the ground.  
I'll warm you through December, and I'll always be around.  
We'll kiss below the mistletoe, when Santa comes to town.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Girl for all seasons, I'll be your girl for all seasons.  
Summer in sunshine, winter in snowflakes.  
Springtime in showers, falling in love.  
Summer, winter, spring, and fall  
Yes, I'll be everything to you.
