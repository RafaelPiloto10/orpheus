Waist down, deep tied, now it's chest high.  
Pressure pours down from the top down, all sides.  
Something seeps down inside,  
you can't suppress when it's your want.  
To revise, could have skipped the slide,  
But you did not try.  
Change it all when you get time.  
When your first try's not so bad.  
Change it all when you get time.  
Stay inside, it's as safe as you can get.  
Trust in sleep, your delivery from what your feeling,  
In the time, your awake.  
Try to fake out yourself,  
The second you get wind of,  
What went wrong this time.  
Could have skipped the slide, but you did not try.  
Change it all when you get time.  
When your first try's not so bad.  
Change it all when you get time.  
Stay inside, it's as safe as you can get.  
Safest from the life that you got.  
Try to catch yourself, you slipped, again.  
Try to catch yourself, you slipped, again.  
But don't let it keep you in.
