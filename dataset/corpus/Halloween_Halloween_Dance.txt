Halloween night, really such a sight,  
All my friends are dressed up right.  
Gonna have a party, come on everyone.  
Let's get together and have some fun.  
  
When we dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance.  
Come on everybody, let's take a chance.  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance.  
Move it all over in England and France.  
  
Look over there, wearing phony hair,  
I see a werewolf sleeping on a chair.  
He tried to be scary but he ran out of steam.  
Now he's only scary in a Halloween dream.  
  
Let's dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance.  
Come on everybody, let's take a chance.  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance.  
Move it all over in England and France.  
  
I see Pocohantas dancing with a king,  
Shakin' and twistin' like everything.  
Dance to the left, dance to the right.  
Having lots of fun on Halloween night.  
  
When we dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance.  
Come on everybody, let's take a chance  
When we dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance,  
Havin' lots of fun with your uncle and aunts.  
  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance.  
Move it all over in England and France.  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance,  
Come on everybody, let's shake your pants.
