The sirens scream wanton attention  
Time to take heed and change directions  
Time to take stock and make omissions  
  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
  
Time to take leave all formal functions  
Time to plant seeds of reconstruction  
No time this time to feign reluctance  
  
It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way  
Bets put aside, you're evil, let's crawl into your face  
A vision, vague or not, raising a frightful wake-you-up  
  
Time for evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
  
There was a solemn man who watched his twilight disappear in the sand  
Altered by a fallen eagle, a warning sign  
He sensed worry could be strength, with a plan said time for  
  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
Evacuation  
  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation  
Evacuation, evacuation
