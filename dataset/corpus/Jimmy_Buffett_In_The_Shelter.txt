In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,  
"What is it all about? I just don't know,  
But I can't go back home."  
  
Lonely princess, all the days out  
On your own are growing empty.  
Nothin' is goin' well, if you  
Could only tell them how you feel.  
But they're too real to understand.  
  
Too many trite expressions ending in  
Forced rejection long ago.  
Too many innocent faces in too many  
Far-out places, something's wrong.  
  
Let me tell you that something's wrong.  
It's been that way so long, and it's a shame.  
  
On the street car to the city,  
Where she knows that she may lose it all,  
Riding for just a dime,  
Takin' her own sweet and knowing well  
That this could be her final fall,  
Past the boutique, to the alley,  
Down the river, people pass her by.  
She sits on the big gray rocks,  
Takes off her boots and socks,  
Not knowing what she will do next,  
Just starts to cry.  
  
To many wild rejections ending in  
Angry questions from her dad.  
To many TV dinners, ah, everyone  
Loves a winner, but she was lost.  
No ones knows the trials she had.  
  
In the shelter, in the morning as  
The sun was brightly gleaming,  
I heard her crying out,  
"What is it all about? I just  
Don't know, but I can't go back home."  
Hell, I just don't know, but  
I can't go back home.
