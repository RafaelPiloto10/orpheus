Deep as a river, wide as the sea  
Changin' the ways of a captain and me  
I could be happy, lord, so then should he  
If all of the universe unveiled itself to me  
So then a day flows into night  
Down the street the beggar man who finds himself in wine  
If i am a good man and sure in all my ways  
The captain of a starship that's homeward bound today  
  
Growin', growin', changin' ev'ry day  
Knowin', showin' all my worldly ways  
Hear the chimes, hear how they ring  
Marking time all through the day  
  
A whisper, an answer, a cry in the night  
Break down, turn around, a feeling of fright  
The Indian, the black man, the Asian who see  
A door that is opening, and they're goin' to be free  
  
Growin', growin', changin' ev'ry day  
Knowin', showin' all my worldly ways  
Hear the chimes, hear how they ring  
Marking time all through the day  
  
We are all acceptable, we are all a place in time  
Moving through a passageway, bringing forth the end of time  
Growin', growin', changin' ev'ry day  
Knowin', showin' all my worldly ways  
Hear the chimes, hear how they ring  
Marking time all through the day  
Light the fire, start the day, mark the light that shows the way  
Changing times of fortunes past, we will all be free at last  
  
We are the people of the round about  
We are the sails upon the sea  
We're gonna be there when ev'ry body laughs about  
The way that we are changin', you and me, yeah  
We are the people of the round about  
We are the sails upon the sea  
We're gonna be there when ev'ry body laughs about  
The way that we are changin', you and me, yeah  
We are the people of the round about  
We are the sails upon the sea
