I tried so hard my dear to show  
That you're my ev'ry dream  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do  
Is but some evil scheme  
In anger unkind words are said  
That makes the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold, cold heart.  
  
Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart fell at your feet  
I can't help it  
If I'm still in love with you  
Another love was by your side  
And he looked so satis-fied  
I can't help it  
If I'm still in love with you.

The news is out, all over town  
That you've been seen, out runnin' 'round  
I know that I should go, but then  
I just can't go, you win a-gain.  
  
If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares  
There is one whose smiling face that god would see  
For she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs  
Oh, they'll never, never take her love from me.

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me.  
  
Change to key of e:  
So take these chains from my heart and set me free  
You've grown cold and no longer care for me  
All my faith in you is gone, but the heartaches linger on  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free.  
  
Change to key of f:  
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep  
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep  
But sleep won't come the whole night through  
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you-ou-ou.
