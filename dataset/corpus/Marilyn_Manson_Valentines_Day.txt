She was the color of TV  
Her mouth curled under like a metal snake  
Although Holy Wood was sad  
They'd remember this as Valentines day  
Flies are waiting  
  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
They slit our wrists and send us to heaven  
The first flower after the flood  
  
I saw that pregnant girl today  
She didn't know that it was dead inside  
Even though it was alive  
Some of us are really born to die  
Flies are waiting  
  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
They slit our wrists and send us to heaven  
The first flower after the flood  
  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death  
In the shadow of the valley of death
