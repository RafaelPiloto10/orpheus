If the sun refused to shine  
I don't mind, no baby I don't mind  
And if the mountains fell in the sea  
It ain't me, you know you've got to be free  
  
I got my own world to live through  
And I ain't gonna copy you  
  
Now if six turned out to be nine  
I don't mind, no baby I don't mind,  
If all the hippies cut off all their hair,  
I don't care, no baby I don't care  
  
Because I, I've got my own world to live through,  
And I ain't gonna copy you  
  
White collar conservative walkin' down the street  
Pointin' their plastic finger at me,  
Hopin' my kind will drop and die  
But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high,  
So..., play on drummer  
  
I've got my own world to live through,  
And I ain't gonna copy you
