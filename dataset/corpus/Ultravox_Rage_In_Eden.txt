We sit and watch these lifeless forms  
Stark and petrified  
The high suspense of an empty stage drawing in clutching to its breast  
With murmured words we sigh and focus on the main facade  
  
Beyond the hard reluctant windows  
News from magazines  
We wrote their names on books we'd borrowed as if to bring us closer still  
And threw it all away to focus on the main facade  
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence  
But no-one could see the end  
  
And they were the new gods  
And they shone on high  
Their heavy perfume on the night sucked them down in red tide  
All is through the looking glass focus on the main facade  
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence  
But no-one could see the end  
  
Disciples of the new way  
Portraits in the new sand  
See when they run their longest mile holding caps in wet hands  
Eyes upon them try to focus on the main facade  
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence  
But no-one could see the end
