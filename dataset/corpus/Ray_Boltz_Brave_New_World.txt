Caught in the valley of shadow,  
Fear and doubt  
Desperately searching  
There was no way out  
But then the hand of mercy  
Came reaching for me  
Lifted me out of my broken past  
And brought me  
Into the land of the free  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Here in the brave new world  
My faith is standing strong  
Here in the brave new world  
I'm right where I belong  
Its Your amazing grace  
That brought my heart  
Right to this place  
The fear is gone  
I'm living in a brave new world  
  
I stand on a mountain of possibilities  
I hear You calling me to spread my wings  
I know you'll hold me up, Lord  
When I feel too weak to fly  
Cause its through the power of your love  
That keeps me soaring through the sky  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]  
It was a universe of dark despair  
Now I see You shining everywhere  
I know you're always there  
  
[CHORUS (repeat 2X)]
