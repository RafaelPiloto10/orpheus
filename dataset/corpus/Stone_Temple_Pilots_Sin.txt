Holy water clouds my thinking, sinking low now, keep on drinking  
Down you go, suffer long, Down you go, sin make me strong  
  
You control me, soul you stole, mine wishful thinking, six feet under  
Down you go, suffer long Down you go, sin make me strong  
  
So feel what were my eyes  
Sink into the holes in my eyes  
My sins have made me blind  
sink into the holes in my eyes  
  
Dead by dreaming, sleep you steal, mine Pools of cold sweat hatred burns me  
Down you go, suffer long, Down you go, sin make me strong  
  
Still shackled to the shadow  
Still shackled to the shadow That followed you...
