I thought I was doing all right being alone  
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again  
I was never gonna let my guard down, not for anyone  
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me moving' in  
And tonight these walls are all coming down  
  
And my heart is open  
I'm lettin' you in  
'Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again  
And your love is healing  
I'm finally breathing  
And I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment  
My heart is open  
  
These days it seems like everybody's just walking away  
Like there's no forever and love is just a game  
But don't you know that you can believe me when I say that I'm your man  
  
And my heart is open  
I'm lettin' you in, baby  
'Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again  
And your love is healing  
I'm finally breathing  
I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment  
My heart is open  
  
I can't wait anymore, no no  
Because I've got nothing left to prove  
And I've got so much love for you  
That's why I'm tearing out the walls, and baby I'm kicking down the doors  
  
And your love is healing  
Baby, I'm finally breathing  
And I can hear you calling, I'm ready to fall in love again  
My heart is open  
  
Yeah, my heart is open  
Oh, baby  
My heart is open.  
Oh, yeah,  
Oh, yeah.
