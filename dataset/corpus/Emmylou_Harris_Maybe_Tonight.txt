Maybe tonight I'll get lucky  
I've been lonely too long  
Maybe tonight some dark stranger  
Will hear me singing this song  
I've been down, I've played around  
I don't like it that way  
Love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Maybe this time I'll be saying  
The words that I wanted to say  
Maybe this time I'll be staying  
For more than just a day  
I've been down, I've played around  
I don't like it that way  
Love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
I'm so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Maybe tonight I'll get lucky  
I've been lonely too long  
Maybe tonight some dark stranger  
Will hear me singing this song  
I've been down, I've played around  
I don't like it that way  
Love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Well, I'm so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Well, I'm so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight, maybe tonight?
