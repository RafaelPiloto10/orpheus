This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
  
I'm not a saint but stand accused  
You're with someone who thinks love's the same as being used  
Now suspicious minds may say, it's over, over  
Whether I live or die, you are my savior, you're my savior  
  
It's my deja vu, sweet deja vu  
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you  
Sheltering arms, reach out to you  
  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
  
The silent nights, I cry your name  
You're with someone who says, they can get you through your pain  
These golden years keep on returning, it's hurting  
Precious and few, you're my savior, you're my savior  
  
It's my deja vu, sweet deja vu  
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you  
Sheltering arms reach out to you  
  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
Cherish what they've lost  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
When often it's too late  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
It's my deja vu  
(My deja vu)  
Sweet deja vu  
(Keep coming through)  
Through the feast or famine, I'll be with you  
(All that is true)  
Sheltering arms, reach out to you  
(Ooh)  
  
Oh, baby  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication  
This is my dedication
