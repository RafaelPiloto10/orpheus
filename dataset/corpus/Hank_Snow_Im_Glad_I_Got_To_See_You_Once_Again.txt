I'm glad I got to see you once again  
Although we're through I still love you  
I guess I'll have to call you just a friend  
'Cause someone new has just stepped in  
I try to say that I don't really miss you  
But in my heart I know it's just a lie  
And if someday his love should prove untrue  
I'll be around when he has said goodbye  
(I try to say that I don't really miss you)  
But in my heart I know it's just a lie  
And if someday his love should prove untrue  
I'll be around when he has said goodbye  
(Goodbye)
