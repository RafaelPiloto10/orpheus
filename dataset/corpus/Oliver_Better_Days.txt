The sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
When did you lose that big bright smile  
I used to love so well?  
Where did she go, that happy child  
I guess it's hard to tell  
  
Well, maybe I've been too close to see  
How far apart we've grown  
But you can put the blame on me  
Although you should've known  
That the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
Where did you find that point of view  
You love to point at me?  
I'd like to know what happened to  
The two we used to be  
  
Well, maybe the rain's about to fall  
You'd best believe it's here  
But the weatherman says that overall  
The air is beginning to clear  
And the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
Now, baby the rain's about to fall  
You'd best believe it's here  
But the weatherman says that overall  
The air is beginning to clear  
And the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
My love  
  
Well, the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
The sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love
