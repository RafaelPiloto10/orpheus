[Fabolous (talking):]  
I don't got time for all this  
Just fast forward to the part where he start killing shit  
Yeah like right here  
Yeah (yeah)  
Yeah (yeah)  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Tough times don't last but tough people do  
I father n-ggas the way wayne and puff reproduce  
Lil rap bastards  
Running round with your snapback caps backwards  
Should be in rap caskets  
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting  
And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing  
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something  
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing  
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing  
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing  
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens  
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams (swish)  
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones  
I feel like n-ggas done found one of my old phones  
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans  
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes  
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe  
If you can't be yourself, then who you gonna be?  
Dad to your swag, your style was like a son to me  
Your stylist got thank yous, you never sent one to me  
Lets pray for 'em  
Y'all repeat this one with me  
"now I lay me down to sleep, I pray for those who run with me  
If I die before I wake, arrest the girl I brung with me  
I give the Lord my swag to take whenever God is done with me"  
  
[Hook:]  
I be saying to myself as I put on da gloves  
It hurts when you gotta kill a n-gga you love [x4]  
  
[Paul Cain:]  
Yeah  
It's painful when bestfriends become ya enemies  
And you finding out that they not who they pretend to be (wow)  
The whole time you conspired to put an end to me  
And I'm still trying to show this n-gga love, silly me  
So I might she'd tears as I put on my gloves  
But I won't show emotions when I fill him with slugs  
Cause n-ggas die everyday here  
And you can get hit picking ya seed up from daycare  
N-ggas don't play fair  
That's why I'm straightforward, f-ck being all discrete  
If I can knock 'em off quick, f-ck beefing all for weeks  
So we was up late night hunting, y'all was sleep  
Cause we the wolves hiding in clothes, y'all the sheep  
Who taught ya the game, who showed y'all the streets?  
And who bought 'em them things they sold y'all for cheap?  
And who came up the bill when them hoes called police?  
Now you fronting so I gotta expose y'all to see  
Ungrateful motherf-cker, who fed you when you was hurting? (me)  
Whenever drama came up, who was putting the work in? (me)  
I was spitting live on hot 9  
You was still rehearsing  
Already my son and this was before I met you in person  
So no matter how many colorful fake chains you purchase  
Like that bullshit you wearing  
You're always gonna b worthless  
You just spit it, I lived it  
Who's really writing the verses  
Lose put em in the casket who you think driving the hearses
