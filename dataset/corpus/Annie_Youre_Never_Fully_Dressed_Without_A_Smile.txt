(spoken) This is Bert Healy saying...  
(singing now) Hey, hobo man  
Hey, Dapper Dan  
You've both got your style  
But Brother,  
You're never fully dressed  
Without a smile!  
  
Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly  
They stand out a mile --  
But Brother,  
You're never fully dressed  
Without a smile!  
  
Who cares what they're wearing  
On Main Street,  
Or Saville Row,  
It's what you wear from ear to ear

So long for a while  
Remember,  
You're never fully dressed  
Without a smile!

Without an
