Two in a row, everybody knows  
At the green light you rev it on the red line  
Been waitin' all week to get my wheels on the street  
Get my hands on the wheel, slide down in the seat  
  
She's wearin' new colors and runnin' pretty good  
I got four hundred horses tucked under the hood  
But there's no need to panic, it's under control  
We're aerodynamic and ready to roll  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Rev on the red line  
Just let it go  
  
Runnin' all night on lake avenue  
It's a piece of cake  
If you know what to do  
You've got to lose a few  
'Til the stakes get high  
When the odds are right  
You just blow by  
  
And make no mistake, there's women who just wait  
For the man and machine with the best time  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Feels like a lifetime  
But soon you'll know  
  
Wasn't long ago I could've lost my wheels  
Had to outrun the law, it was no big deal  
I guess they had a grudge, they were hot on my tracks  
I had to pay off the judge to get my license back  
Now I need to pin those needles, got to feel that heat  
Hear my motor screamin' while I'm tearin' up the street  
  
Rev on the red line  
You're on your own  
Rev on the red line  
Just let it go  
  
Rev on, rev on  
Rev on, rev on  
  
Don't think I'll ever learn to slow down  
Rev on, you'll still be here and I'll be gone  
Rev on, rev on
