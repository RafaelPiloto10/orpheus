Oh yeah, oh  
Oh yeah  
  
What good is the money  
When lately we've been missing each other  
Cause we've got work and kids, you know how it goes  
Monday through Friday, nine to five  
We spend most of the time chasing that dough  
  
But not tonight, we're gonna both get fly  
Call your momma, tell her come over  
So we can have quality time  
Cause it's been too long since I held you in my arms  
I can't wait no more, I'm ready to oooo  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
  
Tonight we gon' forget our worries  
Put the kids to bed  
I'm going out instead with you  
  
Steppin' out with you  
I'm steppin on out with you, darling  
  
Girl put that "celly" down  
Don't even peek at your pager now  
Just chill, relax, the kids will be cool  
Grab two more Cosmos, we ain't thinkin' about tomorrow  
We're in a club full of people  
But it feels just like me and you  
  
My baby's looking hot tonight  
Catching everybody's eye  
Look at them starin', but I ain't carin'  
Cause I know you're mine  
We should do this more often  
Got a fella feelin' kinda flossy  
I can't wait to make your body go ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
  
(You know how it goes)  
(Keep chasin' that dough)  
  
I'll ring the bell like I used to do  
Hold the door for you, let you through  
Take your hand and talk to you  
Make you know you're my star  
I'm gonna woo ya (yeah yeah)  
Say pretty words to ya (yeah yeah)  
Send chills right through ya (oh yeah)  
And remind you how loved you are  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you
