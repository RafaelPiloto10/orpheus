I know you vie for the good ol' days  
And with less of us around, we were a cinch to sway  
Does it feel like it's the end of the world  
Well maybe it is, but when was it not,  
'Cause it's true, me and you  
We are all tomorrow's food today  
  
There's no such thing as the good ol' days  
The older we all get, the better we all were  
There's no such thing as the end of the world  
(But just in case!) you'd best batten down and button up  
Because it's true, me and you  
We are all tomorrow's food today
