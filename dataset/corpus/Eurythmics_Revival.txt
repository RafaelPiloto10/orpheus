Well I passed you by this morning  
You were stumblin' down the street  
And by the look upon your face  
I could tell you wasn't  
Feeling too sweet  
You dropped down to the bottom  
That's what you gone and did  
Livin' in a bad dream  
Finally flipped your lid  
  
Well, superman I've got news for you  
And every body else that's listenin' too  
There's a new way out if yer ready to hear  
We're gonna make it clear  
What we need is revival yeah!  
  
Revival Woohoo  
are are are Revival  
Revival yeah  
  
Look at that girl  
She's the saddest thing you've ever seen  
Washed up and faded  
Like a dirty old pair of jeans  
She's running round in circles  
But she don't have a single friend  
Looks like her own bitterness  
Has twisted her till the end  
  
Well, Mona Lisa look me in the eye  
And tell me when you're gonna get satisfied  
I'm gonna spell it out right in front of you  
This is what you have to do  
Get ready for revival!  
  
Revival  
are are are Revival Yeah  
Revival [Repeat: x5]  
  
R.E.V.I.V.A.L.  
It's gonna lift you right up  
From your prison cell  
Play it out loud  
Like a ringing bell  
You go R.E.V.I.V.A.L.  
  
Revival
