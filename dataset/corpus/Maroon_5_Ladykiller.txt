Baby it's not alright  
The second that you turn your back she'll be outta sight  
Baby she'll break your heart  
The second that you spend the night apart  
How could you do it?  
Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made  
How could you do it?  
Oh you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller  
  
Baby she'll eat you live  
As soon as she smells your blood in the water  
You better run to survive  
Before she makes you her latest slaughter  
How could you do it?  
Oh, just come back to me, baby I'm begging please  
How could you do it?  
Oh she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller  
  
Ooh  
She's in it just to win it  
Don't trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
It's like a cheap thriller  
She's such a ladykiller
