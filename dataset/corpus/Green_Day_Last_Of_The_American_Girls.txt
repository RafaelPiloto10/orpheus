She puts her makeup on  
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland  
She's got her little book of conspiracies  
Right in her hand  
She is paranoid like  
Endangered species headed into extinction  
She is one of a kind  
She's the last of the American girls  
  
She wears her overcoat  
For the coming of the nuclear winter  
She is riding her bike  
Like a fugitive of critical mass  
She's on a hunger strike  
For the ones who won't make it for dinner  
She makes enough to survive  
For a holiday of working class  
  
She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated.  
She won't cooperate  
She's the last of the American girls  
  
She plays her vinyl records  
Singing songs on the eve of destruction  
She's a sucker for  
All the criminals breaking the laws  
She will come in first  
For the end of western civilization  
She's an endless war  
She's a hero for a lost cause  
Like a hurricane  
In the heart of the devastation  
She's a natural disaster  
She's the last of the American girls  
  
She puts her makeup on  
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland  
She's got her little book of conspiracies  
Right in her hand  
She will come in first  
For the end of western civilization  
She's a natural disaster  
She's the last of the American girls
