Love hurts, love scars, love wounds  
And mars, any heart  
Not tough or stong enough  
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud  
Holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts oh, oh love hurts  
  
I'm young, I know, but even so  
I know a thing or two  
And I learned from you  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame  
It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts oh, oh love hurts  
  
Some fools think of happiness  
Blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves I guess  
They're not foolin' me  
  
I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts oh, oh love hurts  
Ooh,ooh love hurts  
  
I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie  
Made to make you blue  
Love hurts oh, oh love hurts  
Oh, oh love hurts
