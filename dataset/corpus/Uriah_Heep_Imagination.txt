Sometimes I'm certain  
Sometimes my mind is  
Filled with doubt  
Some thoughts lay heavy here  
Sometimes I think it's figured out  
Imagination  
Endless voyage of discovery  
I'm at once impatient and afraid  
Some day you may walk out on me  
  
At least when you're with me  
I'm not afraid to live with mystery  
I'm sure you know how sad  
One night without a dream can be  
Imagination, bitter-sweet companion  
As my time flies by  
Love-hate relation  
Hand in hand toward infinity  
  
Lead me here, lead me there  
Everywhere if you really dare  
Today, tonight, tomorrow  
You don't have to take my hand  
I'll take it just the way it's planned  
Lead on, speed on, I'll follow  
  
When you see me coming  
You're gonna know I'm not alone  
Me and my imagination  
We'll be side by side any way  
The wind is blown  
Love songs and fantasies  
They've kept us busy  
Since the day we met  
Each new horizon  
Reminds us now it's not over yet
