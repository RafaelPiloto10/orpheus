I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
I still remember how it used to be  
Seclusion in our love so deep  
A world to touch that meant so much to me  
And promises we couldn't hope to keep  
  
The cool romance and nights of ecstasy  
Slip slowly by on paper wings  
The cold reality of you and me  
Came creeping like a storm cloud gathering  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
The balance of our love hangs tenderly  
A careful step through broken glass, yeah  
One thoughtless word could kill a memory  
And days we loved together in the past  
  
I give and take i do my very best  
To keep this vision that i've seen  
I give respect if you could just accept  
There never really was a perfect me  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
You walk away and see yourself in retrospect  
Remember all of love's first visions  
Step aside try to see just what went wrong  
Living together isn't easy all the time  
  
I believe in you if you believe in me, oh  
There's still the chance that we can find romance, yeah  
I know we can  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'llstand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
I believe in you, if you believe in me  
I believe in you, i believe in you...  
United undivided...
