Sometimes tears say all  
There is to say  
Sometime your first  
Scars wont ever fade, away  
Tried to break my heart  
Well it's broke  
Tried to hang me high  
Well I'm choked  
Wanted rain on me  
Well I'm soaked  
Soaked to the skin  
  
It's the end where I begin  
It's the end where I begin  
  
Sometimes we don't learn  
From our mistakes  
Sometimes we've no  
Choice but to walk  
Away, away  
Tried to break my heart  
Well it's broke  
Tried to hang me high  
Well I'm choked  
Wanted rain on me  
Well I'm soaked  
Soaked to the skin  
  
It's the end where I begin  
It's the end where I begin  
  
Now I'm alive  
And my ghosts are gone  
I've shed all the pain  
I've been holding on  
The cure for a heart  
Is to move along, is to move along  
So move along [Repeat: x3]  
What don't kill a heart  
Only makes it strong  
  
Sometimes tears say all  
There is to say  
Sometime your first  
Scars don't ever fade, away  
Tried to break my heart  
Well it's broke  
Tried to hang me high  
Well I'm choked  
Wanted rain on me  
Well I'm soaked  
Soaked to the skin  
  
It's the end  
End where I begin  
It's the end  
End where I begin  
  
Sometimes we don't learn  
From our mistakes  
Sometimes we've no  
Choice but to walk  
Away, away
