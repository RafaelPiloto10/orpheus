I like a woman with a future and a past  
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last  
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast  
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that  
Only you can do it just like that  
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower  
Runnin' on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin' you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and you'll always be the one  
One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl  
Maybe it's just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl  
They want you in their life as a wife  
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest  
Why you want to fight for your right  
'Cause you don't love them boys  
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise  
  
[Chorus]  
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go  
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?  
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine  
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time  
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you  
  
B-b-b-b-bet I am  
All of them bitches I'm badder than  
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in  
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'  
And my shit's so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat  
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too  
Apparel, I'm dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly I'm flying high  
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch  
  
But baby, if you ask me to take a break  
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say  
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'  
I'm a star, sheriff badge  
What's the point if I'm guarding?  
Double D up, hoes, Dolly Parton  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you  
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back  
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
