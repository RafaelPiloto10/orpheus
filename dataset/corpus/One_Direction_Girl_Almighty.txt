[Verse 1: Liam]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
No, she floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say she's such a fake  
That her love is made up, no  
No, no, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan]  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn] Am I the only  
Only believer?  
[All Members]  
(Da da da da)  
There's something happening here  
There's something happening here  
[Zayn] The only, only believer  
[All Members]  
There's something happening here  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
  
[Verse 1: Louis Tomlinson]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah

I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you
