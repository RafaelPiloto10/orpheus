I should of quit you  
A long time ago  
I should of quit you baby  
A long time ago  
But you got me messin' round with you baby  
You got me cryin' on a killin' floor, yeah  
If I don't fallow, yeah  
My first mind  
If I don't fallow pretty baby  
My first mind  
I would have been gone since my second time  
Yeah  
  
Lord knows, right now  
I should've been gone  
Lord knows, I should've been gone  
You got me messin' round with you baby  
You got me cryin' on a killin' floor  
Yeah, that's all  
  
Ooh, you got me cryin' baby  
Ohh, you got me cryin'...
