I don't ever wanna go out like a light  
  
Have you got the right  
To lay your burden on me?  
Have you got the right  
To lay your burden on me?  
  
Is it ever right  
Make it all out when it will never be?  
  
But it?s different, so different  
So different from before  
And it gets no easier  
  
Do you have the right  
To come on over so strong?  
Does it make it right  
When it makes it all so very wrong?  
  
But it?s different from before  
This is different from before  
This is different from before
