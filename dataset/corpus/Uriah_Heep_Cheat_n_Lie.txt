Well, it seems to me  
That I've been cheated  
And it would appear  
That I've been lied to  
All the promises  
That you repeated  
Were never destined  
To come true  
  
When I stop to think  
How I once trusted you  
It's harder still  
To bear this doubt  
I'm a innocent victim of  
Heartbreaking circumstance  
And I still can't get it figured out  
  
'cause all you did was cheat and lie  
Now you're gone and  
Made me cry  
When my heart is heavy and  
I just can't get it straight  
Just the way you made me feel  
A wound that only time can heal  
Won't you take a little time  
To show me my mistake  
  
'cause all you did was cheat and lie  
Now you're gone and  
Made me cry  
When my heart is heavy and  
I just can't get it straight  
Just the way you made me feel  
A wound that only time can heal  
Won't you take a little time  
You know you gotta  
Show me my mistake
