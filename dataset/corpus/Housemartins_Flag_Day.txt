Too many Florence Nightingales  
Not enough Robin Hoods  
Too many halos not enough heroes  
Coming up with the goods  
  
So you though you'd like to change the world  
Decided to stage a jumble sale  
For the poor, for the poor  
  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
Try shaking a box in front of the Queen  
'Cause her purse is fat and bursting at the seams  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
  
Too many hands in too many pockets  
Not enough hands on hearts  
Too many ready to call it a day  
Before the day starts  
  
So you thought you'd like to see them healed  
Got blue Peter to stage an appeal  
For the poor, for the poor  
  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
Try shaking a box in front of the Queen  
'Cause her purse is fat and bursting at the seams  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
  
Flag Day, Flag Day, Flag Day
