[Verse 1]  
Say it louder, say it louder  
Who's gonna love you like me, like me?  
Say it louder, say it louder  
Who's gonna touch you like me, like me?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooh, said you wanna be good but you couldn't keep your composure  
Ooh, said you wanna be good but you're begging me to come over  
Ooh, come over  
Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me? Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna hurt you but you live for the pain  
I'm not tryna say it but it's what you became  
You want me to fix you but it's never enough  
That's why you always call me cause you're scared to be loved  
But I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you  
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame  
I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you  
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame  
  
[Verse 2]  
Say it louder, say it louder  
Who's gonna love you like me, like me? Yeah  
Say it louder, say it louder  
Who's gonna touch you like me, like me?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooh, said it'd be the last time, all you needed was a little closure  
Ooh, said it'd be the last time but you're begging me to come over  
Ooh, come over  
Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me? Hey
