As merry as the days were long  
I was right and you were wrong  
  
Back at the old grey school  
I would win and you would lose  
  
But you've got everything now  
You've got everything now  
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life  
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life  
  
No, I've never had a job  
Because I've never wanted one  
  
I've seen you smile  
But I've never really heard you laugh  
  
So who is rich and who is poor?  
I cannot say...oh  
  
You are your mother's only son  
And you're a desperate one  
Oh...  
  
But I don't want a lover  
I just want to be seen...oh...in the back of your car  
  
A friendship sadly lost?  
Well this is true...and yet, it's false  
Oh...  
  
But did I ever tell you, by the way?  
I never did like your face  
  
But you've got everything now  
You've got everything now  
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life  
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life  
  
No, I've never had a job  
Because I'm too shy  
  
I've seen you smile  
But I've never really heard you laugh  
  
So who is rich and who is poor ?  
I cannot say...oh  
  
Oh...  
You are your mother's only son  
And you're a desperate one  
Oh...  
  
But I don't want a lover  
I just want to be tied... oh...to the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
To the back of your car  
Oh...
