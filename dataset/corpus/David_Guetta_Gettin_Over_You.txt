All the things I know right now  
If I only knew back then  
There's no gettin' over  
No gettin' over  
There's just no getting over you  
  
Wish I could spin my world into reverse  
Just to have you back again  
There's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over  
There's just no getting over you, no, no  
  
Bring it back  
Hey, hey, I can't forget you, baby  
I think about you everyday  
I tried to masquerade the pain  
That's why I'm next to the roof  
D-d dancing to the groove  
But there is no, there is no getting over you  
Baby, it feels so (right)  
To dance to the beat of (night)  
That heat between you and I  
Freak freak to the morning light  
We like to live like (that)  
And pour them shots up in the (glass)  
But there is no, there is no getting over you  
  
I'm-a party and party and party and party  
And party and party and party  
I'm-a party and party and party and party  
And party and party and party  
  
All the things I know right now  
If I only knew back then  
There's no gettin' over  
No gettin' over  
There's just no getting over you  
  
Wish I could spin my world into reverse  
Just to have you back again  
There's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over  
There's just no getting over you  
  
I'm a party, and party and party and party  
And party and party and party  
I'm a party, and party and party and party  
And party and party and party  
  
People in the place  
If you've ever felt love  
Then you know, yeah, you know, what I'm talking about  
There is no getting over  
  
I'm a party, and party and party and party  
And party and party and party  
I'm a party, and party and party and party  
And party and party and party
