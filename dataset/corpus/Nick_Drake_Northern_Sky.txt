I never felt magic crazy as this  
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea  
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand  
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree  
But now you're here  
Brighten my northern sky.  
  
I've been a long time that I'm waiting  
Been a long that I'm blown  
I've been a long time that I've wandered  
Through the people I have known  
Oh, if you would and you could  
Straighten my new mind's eye.  
  
Would you love me for my money  
Would you love me for my head  
Would you love me through the winter  
Would you love me 'til I'm dead  
Oh, if you would and you could  
Come blow your horn on high.  
  
I never felt magic crazy as this  
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea  
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand  
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree  
But now you're here  
Brighten my northern sky.
