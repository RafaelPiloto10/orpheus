I once knew a girl  
I can't remember her name but I remember her face 'cause her sister looked the
same.  
  
They both left school, but they couldn't find a job  
So they said farewell and stole a small town car.  
  
As they were riding by the beach some summer night  
The radio shouted out one of those songs that might just change your life  
It went like this: "Checkin' in checkin' out  
Making love I like watching all your fireworks  
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes  
Just like fireworks in the sky"  
Yes it did...  
  
Throwing some poems to the ports and docks  
They were sleeping outdoors pushing all their luck.  
  
They sent me a letter full of pills and thrills  
Then they both got rich and moved to Hollywood Hills.  
  
Yea they made lots of money playing folk guitar  
'Cause everywhere the boys went crazy just to hear these words of art:
"Checkin' in checkin' out  
Take it to the sky  
Making love I like watching all your fireworks  
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes  
Just like fireworks in the sky".  
  
They're coming to get you  
They're coming to get you now  
Coming to get you now  
Watch the sky!
