Oh I've been traveling on a boat and a plane  
In a car on a bike with a bus and a train  
Traveling there and traveling here  
Everywhere in every gear  
  
But oh Lord we pay the price with a  
Spin of a wheel with the roll of a dice  
Ah yeah you pay your fare  
And if you don't know where you're going  
Any road will take you there  
  
And I've been traveling through the dirt and the grime  
From the past to the future through the space and the time  
Traveling deep beneath the waves  
In wattery grottoes and mountainous caves  
  
But oh Lord we've got to fight  
With the thoughts in the head with the dark and the light  
No use to stop and stare  
And if you don't know where you're going  
Any road will take you there  
  
You may not know where you came from  
May not know who you are  
May not even wondered how  
You got this far  
  
I've been traveling on a wing and a prayer  
By the skin of my teeth by the breadth of a hair  
Traveling where the four winds blow  
With the sun on my face, in the ice and the snow  
  
But ooee it's a game  
Sometimes you're cool, sometimes you're lame  
Ah yea it's somewhere  
And if you don't know where you're going  
Any road will take you there  
  
But oh Lord we pay the price  
With the spin of a wheel, with the roll of a dice  
Ah yea, you pay your fare  
And if you don't know where you're going  
Any road will take you there  
  
I keep traveling around the bend  
There was no beginning, there is no end  
It wasn't born and never dies  
There are no edges, there is no sides  
Oh yea, you just don't win  
It's so far out - the way out is in  
Bow to God and call him Sir  
  
But if you don't know where you're going  
Any road will take you there
