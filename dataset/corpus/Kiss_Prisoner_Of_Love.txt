If I can survive, and if you can't deny it  
Don't give me love, no, don't even try it  
Just give me your trust, and I'll tell you no lies  
This is the truth, and I don't know why  
  
Can't you hear your heart is beatin' (Don't you hear it beatin')  
Don't you feel that sweet sweet feelin' (Can't you feel that feelin')  
Anytime you need some lovin'  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again  
  
And if you can't believe all your alibis, I can tell by that look in your eyes  
When we make love, you play hard to bet, you bet, what you give is what you
get  
  
Anytime I see you goin' (Anytime I see you gone)  
Everytime the feelin's growin' (This feelin's growin')  
Anytime I need your lovin'  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again  
I know it's much too late, but I can't help this feelin', no I can't look away  
  
Yeah, I know, I'm a prisoner of love, and I can't break these chains  
Yeah, yes I know, but here comes that feelin' again
