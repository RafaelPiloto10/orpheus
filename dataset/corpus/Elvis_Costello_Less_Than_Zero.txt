Calling Mr. Oswald with the swastika tattoo  
There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo  
Carving "V" for "vandal" on the guilty boy's head  
When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed  
To teach him he's alive before he wishes he was dead  
  
[Chorus:]  
Turn up the TV, no one listening will suspect  
Even your mother won't detect it, so your father won't know  
They think that I've got no respect but  
Everything is less than zero  
Hey, oo hey-ey  
Hey, oo hey-ey  
  
Oswald and his sister are doing it again  
They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen  
They've got a thousand variations, every service with a smile  
They're gonna take a little break and they'll be back after a while  
Well, I hear that South America is coming into style  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A pistol was still smoking, a man lay on the floor  
Mr. Oswald said he had an understanding with the law  
He said he heard about a couple living in the USA  
He said they traded in their baby for a Chevrolet  
Let's talk about the future, now we've put the past away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, oo hey-ey  
Hey, oo hey-ey...
