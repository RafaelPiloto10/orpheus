How do I get through one night without you  
If I had to live without you  
What kinda life would that be  
Oh I need you in my arms, need you to hold  
You are my world, my heart, my soul  
  
If you ever leave  
Baby you would take away  
Everything good in my life  
And tell me now  
  
How do I live without you?  
I want to know  
How do I breathe without you?  
If you ever go  
How do I ever, ever survive  
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live  
  
Without you  
There would be no sun in my sky  
There would be no love in my life  
There'd be no world left for me  
  
And I, baby, I don't know what I would do  
I'd be lost if I lost you  
  
If you ever leave  
Baby you would take away  
Everything real in my life  
And tell me now  
  
How do I live without you  
I want to know  
How do I breathe without you  
If you ever go  
How do I ever, ever survive  
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live  
  
Please tell me baby how do I go on  
  
If you ever leave  
Baby you would take away everything  
Need you with me  
Baby don't you know that you are  
Everything good in my life  
  
And tell me now  
How do I live without you  
I want to know  
How do I breathe without you  
If you ever go  
How do I ever, ever survive  
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live  
  
How do I live without you?  
How do I live without you, baby?  
How do I live without you?
