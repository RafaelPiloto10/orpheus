If it weren't for kids have you ever thought  
There wouldn't be no Santa Clause  
Look what the store just brought  
Thank God for Kids  
  
We'd all live in a quiet house  
Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse  
And cool-aid on the couch  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Thank God for kids there's magic for a while  
A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
Daddy how does this thing fly?  
A hundred other where's and why's  
You really don't know but we try  
Thank God for Kids  
  
When you look down in those trusting eyes  
That look to you, you realize  
Its love that you can't buy  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Thank God for there's magic for a while  
A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
When you get down on your knees tonight  
To thank the Lord for his guiding light  
And pray they turn out right  
Thank God for Kids
