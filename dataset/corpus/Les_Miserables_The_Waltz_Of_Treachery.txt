Thenardier  
What to do? What to say?  
Shall you carry our treasure away?  
What a gem! What a pearl!  
Beyond rubies is our little girl!  
How can we speak of debt?  
Let's not haggle for darling Cosette!  
Dear Fantine, gone to rest  
Have we done for her child what is best?  
Shared our bread, shared each bone  
Treated her like she's one of our own!  
Like our own, Monsieur!  
  
Valjean  
Your feelings do you credit, sir  
And I will ease the parting blow  
  
[He pays them.]  
  
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed  
Now, may I say, we are agreed?  
  
Mme. Thenardier  
That would quite fit the bill  
If she hadn't so often been ill  
Little dear, cost us dear  
Medicines are expensive, M'sieur  
Not that we begrudged a sou  
It's no more than we Christians must do!  
  
M. And Mme. Thenardier  
One thing more, one small doubt  
There are treacherous people about  
No offense, please reflect  
Your intentions may not be... Correct?  
  
Valjean  
No more words, here's your price.  
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice  
Come, Cosette, say goodbye,  
Let us seek out some friendlier sky.  
Thank you both for Cosette  
It won't take you too long to forget.  
  
[Valjean and Cosette leave the inn.]  
  
Come, Cosette, come, my dear  
From now on I will always be here  
Where I go, you will be.  
  
Cosette  
Will there be children  
And castles to see?  
  
Valjean  
Yes, Cosette,  
Yes, it's true  
There's a castle just waiting for you...
