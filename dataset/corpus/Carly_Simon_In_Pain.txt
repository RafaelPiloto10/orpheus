This gray sky  
Is good for cryin'  
These November gray woods  
Open to the fields  
I came out here  
In the cold  
For my poor heart  
Has turned to frost  
  
I don't understand  
What you just told me  
What is all this about  
About just being friends  
It's a lousy lie  
And a far cry  
From what goes on  
Between you and me  
  
Pain, in pain  
I'm in pain  
  
You held me close to you  
I didn't tell you what to do  
We were burnin', burnin'  
Burnin', burnin'  
You made love to me  
We were cryin', we were flyin'  
We were dyin' in these fields  
We'd come out here in the soft nights  
I was sunburned under you  
  
Pain, in pain  
I'm in pain  
  
So you want me to say  
Do you want me to say, you want me to say  
Say that I don't love you  
Do you want me to smile, try, lie  
And look away  
How far away all the stars seem  
And that gypsy moon  
Cries, "You're a fool"
