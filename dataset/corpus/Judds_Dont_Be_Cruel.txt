Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of  
Well you know I can be found  
  
Sitting home all alone  
If you can't come around  
Well at least please telephone  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
Baby if I made you mad  
For something I might have said  
Please let's forget the past  
'Cause the future looks bright ahead  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of  
Well now don't stop thinking of me  
  
Don't make me feel this way  
Come on over here and love me  
You know I want to say  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
Why should we be apart  
I really really love you baby  
  
Cross my heart  
Well lets walk up to the preacher  
And let us say I do  
And then you'll know you have me  
And I'll know I'll have you too  
  
Don't be cruel  
To a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of
