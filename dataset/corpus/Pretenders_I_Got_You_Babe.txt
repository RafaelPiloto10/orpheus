Her:  
They say we're young and we don't know  
We won't find out until we grow  
  
Him:  
Well I don't know if all that's true  
'cause you got me, and baby I got you  
  
Both:  
Babe, I got you babe, I got you babe  
  
Her:  
They say our love won't pay the rent  
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent  
  
Him:  
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot  
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got  
  
Both:  
Babe, I got you babe, I got you babe  
  
Him:  
I got flowers in the spring  
I got you to wear my ring  
  
Her:  
And when I'm sad, you're a clown  
And if I get scared, you're always around  
  
Don't let them say your hair's too long  
'cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong  
  
Him:  
Then put your little hand in mine  
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb  
  
Both:  
Babe, I got you babe, I got you babe  
  
Him: I got you to hold my hand  
Her: I got you to understand  
Him: I got you to walk with me  
Her: I got you to talk with me  
Him: I got you to kiss goodnight  
Her: I got you to hold me tight  
Him: I got you, I won't let go  
Her: I got you to love me so  
  
Both:  
I got you babe, I got you babe  
I got you babe, I got you babe  
I got you babe
