Someday I'll be coming for you  
You know what I'm wanting to do  
I know the words to say  
To draw you in so close to me  
  
Over and over  
We swore it was over  
But just like wild clover  
Love grows at light speed  
  
Hang on 'til I see you again  
I'm going to be more than a friend  
You know that this isn't the end so hang on  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
  
This was just a very first start  
There's more that I hold in my heart  
I'm waiting for a chance  
To show you how I long to be  
  
Over and over  
We swore it was over  
But just like I'm solar  
You warm up to me  
  
Hang on 'til I see you again  
I'm going to be more than a friend  
You know that this isn't the end so hang on  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
Hang on 'til the break of the day  
We'll cast all our troubles away  
You know that this isn't the end so hang on  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
  
Sweet thing  
As long as I'm breathing  
And my heart is still beating  
I'm gonna be coming for you  
  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
  
Hang on 'til I see you again  
I'm going to be more than a friend  
You know that this isn't the end so hang on  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
Hang on 'til the break of the day  
We'll cast all our troubles away  
You know that this isn't the end so hang on  
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)  
  
(Hang on) Hang on 'til I see you again  
(Hang on) I'm going to be more than a friend  
(Hang on) You know that this isn't the end so hang on  
Hang on
