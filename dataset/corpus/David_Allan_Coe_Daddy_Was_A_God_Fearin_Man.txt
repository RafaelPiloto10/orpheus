Used to go with my grandpa up to the town square  
Set him down up there on a picnic bench  
And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there  
They used to tell stories bout when they were kids  
Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old  
I believe it  
Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world  
Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch  
Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow  
Said they was so young took two of them boys  
To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger  
Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit  
But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County  
  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor  
They always called my daddy Preacher Dan  
But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect  
Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was  
Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the
same  
  
Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself  
He had the best tobacco crop around  
And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall  
Papa made his livin' on the ground  
Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand  
I guess he felt at home in his old clothes  
But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church  
Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord....  
Someday when I'm grown I'll be the same someday when I'm grown I'll be the
same
