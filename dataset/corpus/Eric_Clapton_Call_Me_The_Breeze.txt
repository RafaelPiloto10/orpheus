They call me the breeze,  
I keep blowing down the road  
They call me the breeze,  
I keep blowing down the road  
I ain't got me nobody,  
I ain't carrying me no load  
Ain't no change in the weather,  
Ain't no change in me  
Ain't no change in the weather,  
  
Ain't no change in me  
I ain't hidin' from nobody,  
Ain't nobody hidin' from me  
I got that green light, babe,  
I got to keep moving on  
I got that green light, babe,  
I got to keep moving on  
I might go out to California,  
Might go down to Georgia,  
Might stay home
