Warren Zevon, Zevon Music BMI  
I can saw a woman in two  
But you won't want to look in the box when I do  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer  
I can pull a rabbit out of a hat  
I can pull it out but I can't put it back  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer  
It's lonely up here  
When the tricks have been played  
And the spotlights have faded  
And the plans that we made  
Have fallen apart  
It's lonely as hell  
And there's no magic spell  
For a broken heart  
You can put me in chains and I will escape  
Better not wait up 'cause I might be late  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer  
It's lonely up here  
When the tricks have been played  
And the spotlights have faded  
And the plans that we made  
Have fallen apart  
It's lonely as hell  
And there's no magic spell  
For a broken heart  
I can saw a woman in two  
But you won't want to look in the box when I do  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick I'll need a volunteer
