Standin' on a corner,  
Suitcase in my hand.  
Jack's in his corset, Jane she's in her vest,  
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.  
Riding that Stutz Bearcat Jim,  
Those were different times.  
All the poets studied rules of verse,  
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes  
  
Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane  
  
Now, Jack, he is a banker,  
And Jane, she is a clerk.  
And the both of them save their money...  
And when they come home from work.  
Sittin' by the fire...  
Radio just played that classical music for all you protest kids,  
The march of the wooden soldiers  
And you can hear Jack say  
  
Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane  
  
Some people like to go out dancing  
And other people, (like me) they gotta work  
And there's even some evil mothers  
They'll tell you life is just made out of dirt.  
That women never really faint,  
That villans always blink their eyes.  
And that children are the only ones who blush.  
And that life is just to die.  
But, anyone who has a heart  
Wouldn't turn around and break it  
And anyone who ever played a part  
He wouldn't turn around and hate it  
  
Sweet Jane
