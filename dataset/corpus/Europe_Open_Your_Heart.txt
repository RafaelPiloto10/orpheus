Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow  
I don't know just what to do  
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow  
Everything depends on you  
  
I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door  
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before  
  
Open your heart and tell me what's wrong  
Why can't you talk like you used to do before  
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if I'm strong  
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore  
  
I've been waiting...  
  
Open your heart, let me hear you  
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call  
Open your heart, want to come near you  
Make up your mind, oh girl, before I fall  
  
Maybe the sun will continue to shine  
Maybe the rain will continue to fall  
Maybe you want to leave me behind  
Maybe you'll change and give me a call
