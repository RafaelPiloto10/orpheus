The same ones that I'm drowning in.  
You lead your casual slaughters  
And I'm the one who helps you win.  
You've got your grand piano.  
  
You don't even play piano.  
I'm the one who plays piano.  
You don't even play piano.  
You part the waters  
  
The same ones that I'm thirsty for.  
You invite your friends to tea  
But when it's me you lock the door.  
You've got your credit cards  
  
And you thank your lucky stars.  
But don't forget the ones who foot the bill.  
You've got your grand piano.  
And you don't even play piano.  
  
I'm the one who plays piano.  
You don't even play piano,  
But you part the waters.
