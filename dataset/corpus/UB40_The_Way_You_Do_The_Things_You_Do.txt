You got a smile so bright  
You know you could have been a candle  
I'm holding you so tight  
You know you could have been a handle  
The way you swept me off my feet  
You know you could've been a broom  
And babe you smell so sweet  
You know you could've been some perfume  
  
Well you could of been anything that you wanted to  
I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
  
As pretty as you are  
You know you could've been a flower  
If good looks were minutes  
You know you could have been an hour  
The way you stole my heart  
You know you could have been a crook  
And baby your so smart  
You know you could have been a school book  
  
Well you could of been anything that you wanted to  
I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
  
Well you could of been  
  
You make my life so rich  
You know you could've been some money  
And baby you're so sweet  
You know you could have been some honey  
  
Well you could of been anything that you wanted to  
I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
  
Well you could of been  
  
As pretty as you are  
You know you could've been a flower  
If good looks were minutes  
You know you could have been an hour  
The way you stole my heart  
You know you could have been a crook  
And baby your so smart  
You know you could have been a school book  
  
Well you could of been anything that you wanted to  
I can tell  
The way you do the things you do  
  
Well you could of been
