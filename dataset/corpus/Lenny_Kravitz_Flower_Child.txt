Dressed in purple velvets  
With a flower in her hair  
Feel her gentle spirit  
As the champa fills the air  
  
She wears rubys on her fingers  
Tiny bells upon her toes  
She's the finest thing  
I've ever seen  
Love that ring inside her nose  
  
Flower Child yeah  
Flower Child yeah  
  
She's a psychedelic princess  
On a magic carpet ride  
And where her trip will carry you  
Is somewhere you can't find  
  
She's on a plane of higher consciousness  
Meditation is the key  
She's got her shit together  
'Cause her soul and mind are free  
  
Flower Child yeah  
Flower Child yeah  
  
She's a child of Martin Luther  
As a freedom fighter she  
Speaks of liberation on the land  
And on the sea  
Her eyes are made of sunshine  
And her lips are jelly sweet  
  
Flower Child yeah  
Flower Child yeah
