Beautiful beautiful beautiful truth  
Don't leave because I can't see you  
You know the hours that I passed without you  
Every heartbeat that I chose to flout you  
And how I felt no shame  
I know this problem is of my own making  
I know you're giving here and I'm not taking  
But please don't leave this place  
Let me complicate what you made simple  
By looking fancy or sounding boastful  
Please bring me down  
Arid now that I have said what's on my mind  
And its obvious that I am blind  
Please say you'll stay  
Spin me round  
Bring me down  
He my sound  
But don't leave.
