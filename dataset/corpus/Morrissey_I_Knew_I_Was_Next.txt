So what do you think I am?  
And how precisely could you tell  
A decent skin is all I am?  
People think badly of me  
But one day maybe they'll praise  
Oh but meanwhile...  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didn't mind  
Here I offer you my life for any debts you're due  
And when you've been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
The shadows of trees, they reach to me  
They know a decent skin is all I am  
People think badly of me  
But when I'm in grave maybe they'll praise  
Oh but meanwhile...  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didn't mind  
Here I offer you my life for any debts you're due  
And when you've been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
Oh but meanwhile...  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didn't mind  
When you've been slapped around  
And one more slap can't hurt you  
And when you've been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didn't mind  
When you've been slapped around  
And one more slap can't hurt you  
And when you've been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can say to hurt you
