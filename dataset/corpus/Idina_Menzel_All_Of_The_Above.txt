I am your sexy girl  
I am your baby girl  
I am your innocence  
I am your mother  
I'm Lady Chatterly  
Or Lady Chastity  
Or some anonymous lover  
  
I can be your little virgin (At the Commack Motor Inn)  
Or your dominatrix (In your parent's bed)  
We'll play some spin the bottle  
We'll play some Marvin Gaye  
Or we can dress you up in women's clothing  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's go shopping at the Pink Pussycat  
You talk to the salesman  
I'll hide in the back  
I may be bashful but  
I got the cash 'cause  
I ain't afraid to try new things like that  
Whatever you're thinking  
Whatever you're feeling  
I'll be either one or  
All of the above  
Whatever you're thinking  
Whatever you're feeling  
I'll be either one or  
All of the above  
  
I'm a widow in mourning (Lonely for your love)  
I'm the bride on her wedding day (And you are not the groom)  
I'm a singing telegram at 2AM  
Or the french maid who comes to clean your room  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll keep you guessing, babe  
You won't need confession, no  
I'll be either one or  
All of the above  
Well I couldn't imagine  
If I couldn't be myself  
'Cause if you're afraid to ask for what you want  
Then you might rebel  
But if you've got that combination, where  
You can play some 'show and tell'  
Well don't be shameful  
I am your rainbow  
Liberate your body and  
Soothe your soul  
  
I can be your baby-sitter (Who let you stay up late)  
Or your best friend's mother (Really hot date)  
Or your favorite cousin (She taught you how to french kiss)  
Or Miss Finnegan from health class  
I'm a school girl in knee socks (With pig-tails in her hair)  
I'm Aphrodite for dinner (Or Linda Carter)  
I'm rose petals  
I'm ruby wine  
And if you want  
I'll be the president's wife  
  
[Chorus]
