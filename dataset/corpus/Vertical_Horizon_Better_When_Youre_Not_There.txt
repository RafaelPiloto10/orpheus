It's good to see your face in the morning  
It helps me to face the day  
I see you lighting candles  
As I turn away  
  
I want you, I need you in a way that confuses me but  
It's good to hold you  
But it's better when you're not there  
It's better when you're not there  
It's better when I don't care about the things you say in the world's worst
way  
It's better when you're not there  
  
But somehow it waits 'til the morning  
I feel your eyes on me  
It's a such a perfect moment  
It almost sets me free  
  
I wanted to keep you holding in while you're pulling away  
It's good to know you but it's better when you're not there  
It's better when you're not there  
It's better when I don't care about the things you say in the world's worst
way  
It's better when you're not there  
It's better when you're not there  
  
It's good to see your face in the picture  
It's amazing what I miss  
It's always right in the moment  
When you're colored by your kiss  
  
I wanted to tell you there are times when I think of your face  
It's good to know you  
But it's better you're not there  
It's better when you're not there  
It's better when I don't care about the things you say in the worlds worst way  
It's better when you're not there  
It's better when you're not there
