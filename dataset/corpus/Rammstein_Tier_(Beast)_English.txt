What does a man do?  
What does a man?  
That can't distinguish a person from an animal?  
What?  
  
He will go to his daughter so late  
She is young and she's such sweet bait  
Just as if he were a dog  
With his own flesh and blood he will mate  
  
What - do you do?  
What - do you feel?  
What - are you?  
Only an animal  
  
What does a woman do?  
What does a woman do?  
That can't tell the difference between a man and an animal?  
  
She dips the feather in his blood  
Writes herself so many lines  
A lifeless letter from her childhood  
As her father slept by her side  
  
What (animal) do you do?  
What (animal) do you feel?  
What (animal) are you?  
Only an animal
