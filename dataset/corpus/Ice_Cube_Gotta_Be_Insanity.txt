Uhh, gotta get it...uhhh....hmmm....get it, get it  
  
Baby  
  
Stab thru the neighborhood, these spinin'  
Weez winin', scrap with the John Lennon  
Head rests, TV's in 'em  
Best in the nation, on this playstation  
The Don Daata, gotta get you hotter  
Been a buck naked nigga smokin' water  
On a friday, the get high day  
Blowin' at a hot date, findin' Shade  
Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?  
A sight to behold, break the mold  
Just tryin' to get some before the world explode  
I see you tryin' to get caught  
Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought  
We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry  
Told the truth and we lie  
  
You be good to me, i'll be good to you  
Anything you want, anything you do  
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you  
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot  
  
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?  
Explain it to your family  
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me  
You know you ain't right standin' at the light  
Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight  
And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me  
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me  
Now see the haterism increase  
They hate when you got a dime piece  
And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one  
When i'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh  
If you let me handcuff your wrist  
Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this  
Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk  
But most of my money see it's all legit baby  
It's all about your state of mind  
Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?  
Are you feelin' me?  
Would you stay down like Hillary?  
Even if you thought about killin' me?  
  
You be good to me, i'll be good to you  
Anything you want, anything you do  
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you  
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot  
  
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?  
Explain it to your family  
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me  
Are you the type of girl that would call them folks  
Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes  
Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court  
On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse  
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out  
Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex  
Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi  
Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni  
But fuck the world don't aks me for shit  
Unless you my boo, and i'm fuckin' you  
The rest of these broads ain't knowin'  
That i'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign  
Come thru blow the horn  
Stick your wrists out the window  
And wave to your kinfolks  
Let 'em know who you with  
And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get  
  
You be good to me, i'll be good to you  
Anything you want, anything you do  
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you  
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot
