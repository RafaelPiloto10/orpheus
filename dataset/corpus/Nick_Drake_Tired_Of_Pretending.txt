You have never tried  
To conceal or deny  
That this love is my ruin  
My peril and trial  
All of the promises were nothing but lies  
But now that you're here  
Why don't you stay for a while  
  
Most of my friends  
Fell under your spell  
Some fell into heaven  
But most fell back in to hell  
The beauty forgotten  
Like the snow-covered crops in the field  
Where the wind knows no mercy  
And she howls and she reels  
  
But I'm tired of pretending  
Yes I'm tired of pretending  
That I still care  
I still care  
  
And the smoke curls like a river  
To some forgotten land  
Floating abandoned the mystery concealed  
Like the moonlit shadows  
On a snow-covered field  
Where the wind knows no mercy  
And she howls  
And she reels  
  
But I'm tired of pretending  
Yes I'm tired of pretending  
That I still care  
I still care
