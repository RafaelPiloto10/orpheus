After I died, and the makeup had dried  
I went back to my place  
No moon that night  
But a heavenly light shone on my face  
  
Still I thought it was odd  
There was no sign of God just to usher me in  
Then a voice from above  
Sugar coated with love, said, "Let us begin"  
  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
  
Okay, a new kid in school  
Got to follow the rule  
You got to learn the routine  
Woah, there's a girl over there  
With the sunshiny hair, like a homecomin' queen  
  
I said, "Hey, what you say?  
It's a glorious day,  
By the way how long you been dead?"  
Maybe you, maybe me  
Maybe baby makes three  
But she just shook her head  
  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
  
Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat  
Had to stand in the line  
Just to glimpse the divine  
What you think about that?  
  
Well it seems like our fate to suffer  
And wait for the knowledge we seek  
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line  
No one here, likes a sneak  
  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
  
After you climb, up the ladder of time  
The Lord God is here  
Face to face, in the vastness of space  
Your words disappear  
  
And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,  
And the current is strong  
But all that remains when you  
Try to explain is a fragment of song  
  
Lord is it, be bop a lu la  
Or ooh poppa do  
Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do  
Be bop a lu la
