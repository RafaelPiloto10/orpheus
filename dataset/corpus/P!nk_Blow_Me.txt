[Verse 1]  
White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight,  
Clench of jaw, I've got another headache again tonight.  
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire, and the burn from all the tears,  
I've been crying, I've been crying, I've been dying over you.  
Tie a knot in the rope, trying to hold, trying to hold,  
But there's nothing to grab so I let go.  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much,  
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss).  
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit,  
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss).  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!)  
You had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss,  
I think I've had enough of this, blow me on last kiss.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I won't miss all of the fighting that we always did,  
Take it in, I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left.  
I am sick, whiskey-dick, no more battles for me,  
You'll be calling a trick, cause you'll no longer sleep.  
I'll dress nice, I'll look good, I'll go dancing alone,  
I'll laugh, I'll get drunk, I'll take somebody home!  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much,  
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss).  
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit,  
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss).  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!)  
You had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss,  
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.  
  
[Bridge]  
(Blow me one last kiss)  
I will do what I please, anything that I want,  
I will breathe, I won't breathe, I won't worry at all.  
You will pay for your sins, you'll be sorry my dear,  
All the lies, all the wise, will be crystal clear.  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much,  
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss).  
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit,  
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss).  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!)  
You had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss,  
I think I've had enough of this, blow me on last kiss.  
  
Blow me one last kiss,  
Blow me one last kiss.  
  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a sh-t day (no!)  
You had a sh-t day (no!), we've had a sh-t day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss  
I think I've had enough of this. Blow me one last kiss...
