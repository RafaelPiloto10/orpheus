Tuesday's coming my baby  
I told you Wednesday morning  
It's not too late for us  
My bags aren't out the door baby  
don't you know life's a feeling  
But without you it's nothing  
It's not too late for us  
My bags aren't out the door baby  
Tuesday's coming and  
I'm not gonna leave you here darling  
  
It's a shame you can't hear me  
Scream my lungs out believe me  
The miles burn me up  
I'm living just to watch your fire darling  
I'm headed out for the road now  
The engines hold me while sleeping  
A road might take me away  
But its sure enough to bring me home baby  
Tuesday's coming  
And I'm not gonna leave you here darling  
  
Tuesday's coming.
