(Paul Stookey, 1963)  
  
And it came to pass on a Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
Outside standing, lonely boy-child  
Cold and shivering in the night  
  
On the street, every window  
Save but one, was gleaming bright  
And to this window walked the boy-child  
Peeking in saw, candle light  
  
Through other windows he had looked at turkeys  
Ducks and geese, cherry pies  
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady  
Table bare and tears in her eyes  
  
Into his coat reached the boy-child  
Knowing well there was little there  
He took from his pocket,  
His own Christmas dinner  
A bit of cheese, some bread to share  
  
His outstretched hands  
Held the food and they trembled  
As the door, it opened wide  
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner  
Gently said she, Come inside  
  
The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table  
Glasses two and her last drop of wine  
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas  
And especially, yours and mine  
  
And it came to pass on that Christmas evening  
While all the doors were shuttered tight  
That in that town, the happiest Christmas  
Was shared by candle light
