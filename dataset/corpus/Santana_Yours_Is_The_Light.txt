Yours is the light that will always shine  
And shine eternally, eternally  
Mine is the search, never ending search  
Until I am with you  
For you, fill my life  
All my days and nights  
With memories of you  
Yours is the light that will always shine  
And shine eternally  
Mine is the search, never ending search  
Until I am with you  
For you, fill my life  
All my days and nights  
With memories of you
