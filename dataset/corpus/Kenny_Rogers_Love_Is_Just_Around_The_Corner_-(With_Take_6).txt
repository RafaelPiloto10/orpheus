Oh, my love is just around the corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When I'm around you  
  
And I'm a sentimental mourner  
And I couldn't be forlorner  
When you keep me in the corner  
Just waiting for you  
  
Now Venus de Milo was noted for her charm  
But strictly between us  
You're cuter than Venus  
And what's more, you've got arms  
  
So let's go cuddle in a corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When I'm around you  
  
Now Venus de Milo was noted for her charm  
But strictly between us  
You're cuter than Venus  
And what's more, you've got arms  
  
So let's go, cuddle in a corner  
Any cozy little corner  
Love is just around the corner  
When I'm around you  
When I'm around you, when I'm around you
