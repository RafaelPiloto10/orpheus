Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds  
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down  
I went right home and I went to bed  
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.  
  
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun  
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run  
Made a good run but I run too slow  
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.  
  
Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill  
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill  
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown  
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.  
  
I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee  
If you've got a warrant just read it to me  
Shot her down cause she made me slow  
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.  
  
When I was arrested I was dressed in black  
They put me on a train and they took me back  
Had no friends for to go my bail  
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.  
  
Early next morning about a half past nine  
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line  
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat  
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court  
  
Into the court room my trial began  
Where I was handled by twelve honest men  
Just before the jury started out  
I saw that little judge commence to look about.  
  
In about five minutes in walked a man  
Holding the verdict in his right hand  
The verdict read in the first degree  
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me  
  
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen  
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen  
Ninety nine years underneath that ground  
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down  
Come on you gotta listen unto me  
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
