Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone and my dreams grow old  
There'll be no tears there'll be no regretting will she remember me will she
forget  
I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so  
Someday I know she'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef  
I'll send a thousand flowers
