I'm a zombie in the moonlight  
I'm sleepin' when it's daylight  
I really should be alright  
But I'm feelin' kinda uptight  
I'm messin' with a neighbour  
Who killed my amp and fender  
He looked to sweet and tender  
It's hard to tell his gender  
Got coffee on the paper  
My dog's an alligator  
I want you now and later  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you  
  
I'm rentin' the wrong movie  
I'm laughin' at the wrong guy  
I'm drivin' on the wrong side  
My brain is gettin' cock-eyed  
The flag is never chequered  
Can't find my f-beat records  
God, give a little lovin'  
The money's in the oven  
Got dead flies in my scotch with ice  
My talents always vaporize  
I want your bird of paradise  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you  
  
Crush! Crush! We got a good thing goin' on  
Crush! Crush! Such a good thing goin' on  
  
I'm freezin' in the summer  
I'm sweatin' in the winter  
No middle in the centre  
No colours in the printer  
No treatment at the pharmacy  
No lessons learned from history  
No future in the factory  
No meaning in the poetry  
No changin' in the weather  
No elvis in the leather  
I want you now or never  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you
