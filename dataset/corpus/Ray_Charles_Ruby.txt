They say, Ruby you're like a dream  
Not always what you seem  
And though my heart may break when I awake  
Let it be so  
I only know, Ruby, it's you  
  
They say, Ruby you're like a song  
You don't know right from wrong  
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me  
But from the start, who stole my heart?  
Ruby, it's you  
I hear your voice and I must come to you  
I have no choice what else can I do?  
  
They say, Ruby you're like a flame  
Into my life you came  
And though I should beware  
Still I don't care you thrill me so
