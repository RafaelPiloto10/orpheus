Lonestar where are you out tonight?  
This feeling I'm trying to fight  
It's dark and I think that I would  
Give anything  
For you to shine down on me  
  
How far you are I just don't know  
The distance I'm willing to go  
I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky  
Hoping for some kind of sign  
  
Lonestar where are you out tonight?  
This feeling I'm trying to fight  
It's dark and I think that I would  
Give anything  
For you to shine down on me  
For you to shine down on me
