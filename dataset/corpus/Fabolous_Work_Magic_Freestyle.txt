New shit DJ Envy featuring Fabolous  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Niggas won't be happy 'till they got price tags on 'em  
Layin' in hospital beds with ice bags on 'em  
I'm comin' through in coupes with the nice mags on 'em  
Diamond chain with a Jesus Christ tag on 'em  
Maybe I'm just feelin' the Kush  
Everybodys against war but right now I'm feelin like Bush  
When you get money theres nothin' that you can't do on the Earth  
Its not a problem for niggas to plant you in the Earth  
Better walk with Uzes  
The talk is useless  
Don't try to spoon ya reason or fork excuses  
Cause I don't feed into the bullshit (nah nigga)  
Without a ten millimeter and full clip  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
The kids too cool to let these young boys get the best of him  
The 4 fifth put 'em in one troy with the rest of 'em  
These niggas try to get they nose into my biz  
And get emotional cause they hos wanna try Spizz  
The shooters are beggin' me show who the guys is  
And when the cops find 'em they won't know who the guys is  
It ain't my fault that ya'll ain't comin' up yet  
But I'm probally responsible for makin' stomachs upset (WOW)  
My chain  
Give a nigga my brains  
When the coupe flow by  
Make a nigga throw drive  
And you fuckin' with a OG  
My new year's resoloution was to leave these suckas in the O three nigga  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly
