See the mountains  
With my lady  
As the eagle  
In the golden sky  
Towers over purple majesty  
  
In the mountains  
Lives a freedom  
There's a river  
You can hear it say,  
"From the delta flows the Liberty"  
  
As the twilight of evening is broken  
Lacy, silvery, starlight unfolding  
'Round and 'round in a wave of emotion  
Rings of love circles back to the spoken  
Nothing equals a sea of devotion  
Oh, desire sets the wheels into motion  
  
We all agree  
We live to be free  
They can't tell us  
They can't tell us, how to be  
  
We, we all agree  
You individually  
We the people  
Share the power  
Hold the key
