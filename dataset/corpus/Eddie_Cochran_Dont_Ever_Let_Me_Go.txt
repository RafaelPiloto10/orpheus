Love me true, don't ever let me go  
Go from you, please don't forget me  
Love me true, don't ever let me go (go-go-go)  
Let me go (go-go)  
Love me long, don't ever leave me  
Love me strong, don't ever grieve me  
Love me true, don't ever let me go (go-go-go)  
Let me go (go-go)  
Oh, you may see a lot of boys  
When you're out at night  
Honey don't forget your promise  
You'll treat me right  
And when you're walkin' all alone  
Just stay out sight  
'Cause you belong to me
