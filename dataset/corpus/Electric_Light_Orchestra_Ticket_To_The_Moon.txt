Remember the good old 1980's,  
When things were so uncomplicated,  
I wish I could go back there again  
And everything could be the same.  
  
I've got a ticket to the moon  
I'll be leaving here any day soon  
Yeah, I've got a ticket to the moon  
But I'd rather see the sunrise, in your eyes.  
  
Got a ticket to the moon  
I'll be rising high above the earth so soon  
And the tears I cry might turn into the rain  
That gently falls upon your window  
You'll never know.  
  
Ticket to the moon  
Fly, fly through a troubled sky  
Up to a new world shining bright.  
  
Flying high above,  
Soaring madly through the mysteries that come,  
Wondering sadly if the ways that led me here,  
Could turn around and I would see you there,  
Standing there  
  
Ticket to the moon  
Flight leaves here today from Satellite 2  
As the minutes go by, what shall I do,  
I paid the fare, what more can I say,  
It's just one way.  
  
Ticket to the moon.
