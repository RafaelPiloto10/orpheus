Although the sun has been around for a long time  
Still has the ability to shine  
And although the moon lights up the night  
Sometimes it likes to hang out in the sunshine  
  
And although green grass sometimes turn brown  
It's refreshed when rain drops come falling down  
Creations starts and it's renewed  
By a single touch from You  
  
So, I depend on You, no matter what I do  
I know You'll always come though  
You'll never change the rules  
I can depend on the alwaysness of You  
  
Never change, You'll remain  
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same  
Everlasting love for me, so heavenly  
That's the alwaysness  
  
The seasons change without a calendar  
And the breezeless know, how and when to blow  
Never have to wonder where the water goes  
'Cause it flows home to the ocean floor  
  
Everything reacting in common sense  
When placed beneath the of Your omnipotent  
Please won't You show me how I should live  
So, glory I can give  
  
'Cause I depend on You, no matter what I do  
I know You'll always come though  
You'll never changed the rules  
I can depend on the alwaysness of You  
  
Never change, You'll remain  
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
That's the alwaysness  
  
Never change, You'll remain  
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
That's the alwaysness  
  
It's so simple when I do things Your way  
So, I try everyday, sometimes my path can get hard  
Even when I start off with the best of intentions  
I get weak and fall short  
  
And I know when I'm down  
You'll be there to lift me up  
Your love will never wait  
  
Never change, You'll remain  
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
That's the alwaysness  
  
Never change, You'll remain  
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same  
Everlasting love for me so heavenly  
That's the alwaysness  
  
The alwaysness of God, of God
