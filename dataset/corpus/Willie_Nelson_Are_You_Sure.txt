Oh, look around you  
Look down the bar from you  
The lonely faces that you see  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be  
  
These are your friends  
But are they real friends  
Do they love you the same as me  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be  
  
You seem in such a hurry to live this kind of life  
You've caused so many tears and misery  
  
Look around you, take a good look  
And tell me what you see  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be  
  
Don't let my tears persuade you, I had hoped I wouldn't cry  
But lately, teardrops seem a part of me  
  
Oh, look around you, take a good look  
At all the lonely used-to-be's  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be
