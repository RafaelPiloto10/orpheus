Just round the bend  
No body knows  
Still that's where  
Everybody wants to go  
  
Might be a mile,  
Right up ahead  
All i really know is that I'm not there yet  
  
When I was a child,  
I thought like a child  
I had no fear  
Of all things wild  
  
Crawl turned to a walk walk  
Turned to a run run  
Turned to a leap here in the wind  
Taking that one step forward around the bend  
Here I go  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know what waits  
But I am not afraid  
I'll just make own sweet way  
Around the bend  
  
See I've been longed  
And I've been loved  
I've turned the other cheek  
I've taken off the gloves  
  
I still got the fight,  
Still go the fever  
Got the hunger,  
Got the thirst  
I just keep on searching for better or worse  
Here I go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I wake  
On a distant shore  
My soul some place  
It's never been before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Here I go
