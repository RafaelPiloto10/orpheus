La la la, la la lala,  
La la la, la la lala.  
  
I just can't get you out of my head,  
Boy it's more than I dare to think about,  
I-i-i-i just can't get you out of my head,  
Boy it's more than I dare to think about.  
  
La la la, la la lala,  
La la la, la la lala.

Boy it's more than I dare to think about,  
I-i-i-i just can't get you out of my head,  
Boy it's more than I dare to think about.  
  
I can't get you out can't get my head to think about,  
I can't get you out can't get my head to think about,  
I can't get my head to think about boys,  
I can't get my head to think about boys.  
  
La la la, la la lala,  
La la la, la la lala,  
La la la, la la lala,  
La la la, la la lala.

I can't get you out can't get my head to think about,  
I can't get my head to think about boys,  
I can't get my head to think about boys.
