There's a star in the east on Christmas morn  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
It'll lead to the place where the Savior born  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
  
Leave your ewes and leave your lambs  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
Leave your sheep and leave your rams  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
Follow the Star of Bethlehem  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
If you take good heed to the Savior's words  
  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
You'll forget your flocks,  
You'll forget your herds  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
  
Leave your ewes and leave your lambs  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
Leave your sheep and leave your rams  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
  
Rise up shepherd and follow  
Follow the Star of Bethlehem
