You say hello, I say goodbye  
You go your way and I go mine  
There's not much time for you and I these days  
We work too hard, we're gone too much  
And we're too tired to even touch  
So just how long can we go on this way  
  
Oh, life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
We can't keep up this pace we're on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns, we start again  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
Let's take some time, let's get away  
Let's pack our bags and leave today  
Girl, anyplace would be okay right now  
Just leave your pager here at home  
And I won't carry my cell phone  
We need to find some time alone somehow  
  
Yeah, life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
We can't keep up this pace we're on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns, we start again  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
We're spinnin' our wheels  
Forgetting how love feels  
Let's slow down before it's too late  
  
Cause life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
Love this fast  
Life's too short
