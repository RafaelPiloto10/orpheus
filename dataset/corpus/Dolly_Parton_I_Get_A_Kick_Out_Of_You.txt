I get no kick from champagne  
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all  
So tell me why should it be true?  
That I get a kick out of you  
Some people go for cocaine  
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff  
That would bore me terrifically too  
Still I get a kick out of you  
  
I get a kick every time I see you  
Standin' there before me  
I get a kick though it's clear to see  
You obviously don't adore me, aww  
  
I get no kick in a plane  
Flying too high with some guy in the sky  
Is my idea of nothin' to do  
Still I get a kick out of you  
Yes I get a kick out of you
