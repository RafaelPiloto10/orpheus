In the end will it matter that you've gone?  
In the end will I go on minding that you've gone?  
Will the night always seem so long?  
Is it really darkest before dawn?  
Will I see whiskey as a Mother in the end?  
In the end will I smash my brains with drinking?  
Till I fall down on the floor  
Will I hiccup and jabber  
Saying things I never meant?  
Will I kiss and cry and wake to find  
A sordid stranger by my bed?  
Will the world shake its sensible head  
And say the words that have to be said?  
She's got a problem  
Every problem has solution in the end  
And solutions must be final  
For help gets so unhelpful near the end  
When I take my last ride  
Down the big dipper slide  
Will I care, will it matter  
If the world should say?  
She had a problem  
She had a problem  
She had a problem  
In the end will it matter that you've gone?  
In the end will I go on minding that you've gone?  
Will the night always seem so long?  
Is it really darkest before dawn?  
Will I see whiskey as a Mother in the end?
