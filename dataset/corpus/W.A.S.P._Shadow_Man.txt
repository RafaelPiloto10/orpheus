Asleep in black  
There's no light in the crack  
The crooked fingers for you  
No don't ya dare say a prayer  
It's just the nights in your mare  
Oh the long forever you'll do  
  
No Mercy, no coming back  
No mercy, forever fade to black  
  
Oh where's the god that made you  
Oh you're Superman  
Going down forever - to never land  
Oh where's the God you pray?  
Forsaken again  
Giving you forever  
The Shadow Man  
  
Oh free at last  
With a heart in the black  
Forever Shadowing you  
Don't you swear to the terror  
Your god never cares  
Oh come oh whatever your do  
  
No Mercy, no coming back  
No mercy, forever fade to black  
  
Oh where's the god that made you  
Oh you're Superman  
Going down forever, to never land  
Oh where's the God you pray  
Forsaken again  
Giving you forever  
The Shadow Man  
  
Where's the god that made you  
Oh you're superman  
Going down forever to never land  
Don't runaway or hide again  
No gates of Heaven
