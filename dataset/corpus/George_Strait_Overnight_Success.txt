If it was in your mind to really cut me down  
If it was in your plan to walk me in the ground  
You left with him last night then daylight told the rest  
And if you planned on hurtin' me, you're an overnight success  
  
I couldn't blame someone who'd steal your love away  
Because I know what I've lost and all he's gained  
Sweetheart last night I know he got the very best  
And if you planned on hurtin' me, you're an overnight success  
  
Can you handle all you've won from breaking my pride  
Will he stay with you and help you spend all the tears I've cried  
Sweetheart I love you so and wish you happiness  
And if you planned on hurtin' me, you're an overnight success
