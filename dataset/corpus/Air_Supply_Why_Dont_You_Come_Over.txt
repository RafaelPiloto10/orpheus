VERSE 1  
Don't you worry, pretty baby  
Everything's alright  
Its another day tomorrow  
And another night.  
You can tell me how your feeling  
Every single word  
I was having trouble sleeping  
Like the early bird  
Who just want's to be heard  
CHORUS  
Why don't you come over  
I can't stop thinking of you  
Why don't you come over  
My heart won't rest "till you do  
pick up the phone  
Your clothes from the floor  
The sleep in your eyes  
And walk through the door  
I'll turn on the light  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over tonight  
VERSE 2  
We can sit down at the table  
Let your problems drown  
I know how to get you smiling  
How to be your clown  
There's no need to think about it  
Just come as you are  
I'll be waiting by the window  
For my shining star  
You know it's not that far  
CHORUS  
Pick up the phone  
Your clothes from the floor  
The sleep in your eyes  
And walk through the door.  
I'll turn out the light  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over  
Why don't you come over tonight.
