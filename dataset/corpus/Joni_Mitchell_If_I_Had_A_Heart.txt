Holy war  
Genocide  
Suicide  
Hate and cruelty...  
How can this be holy?  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
  
These ancient tales...  
The good go to heaven  
And the wicked ones burn in hell...  
Ring the funeral bells!  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
  
There's just too many people now  
Too little land  
Much too much desire  
You feel so feeble now  
It's so out of hand  
Big bombs and barbed wire  
We've set our lovely sky  
Our lovely sky  
On fire!  
  
There's just too many people now  
And too little land  
Too much rage and desire  
It makes you feel so feeble now  
It's so out of hand-  
Big bombs and barbed wire...  
Can't you see  
Our destiny?  
We are making this Earth  
Our funeral pyre!  
  
Holy Earth  
How can we heal you?  
We cover you like a blight...  
Strange birds of appetite...  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
If I had a heart I'd cry.
