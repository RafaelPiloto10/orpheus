I guess it all blew up in Missoula  
There just was no other way  
After months of going crazy  
There was nothing left to say  
But when the dust had finally settled  
And the air had quickly cleared  
Things were better off than I had feared  
  
And I miss you so badly  
Girl I love you madly  
Feelin' so sad now since I been gone  
Gone, gone  
And it gets quite confusin'  
It seems that I'm loosin' track of  
The long days since I been home  
  
Were stayin' in a Holiday Inn full of surgeons  
I guess they meet there once a year  
They exchange physician stories  
And get drunk on Tuborg beer  
Then they're off to catch a stripper  
With their eyes glued to her G  
But I don't think that I would ever let them cut on me  
  
And I miss you so badly  
Girl I love you madly  
I think I been had tho, for stayin so long  
Long, long  
And I'm just watchin' the Gong show  
Waitin' for Zorro  
Loosin' the long day since I been home  
  
I got a head of full of feelin' higher  
And an ear full of Patsy Cline  
There is just no one who can touch her  
Hell I'll hang on every line  
Oh crazy how things happen  
It's incredible but true  
Oh the longer I'm gone the closer I feel to you  
  
And I miss you so badly  
Girl I love you madly  
I'm feelin' so glad just to be headin' home  
Home, home  
And I been battling hotel maids  
Chewin' on Rolaids  
Countin' the hours 'til I get home  
Oh I been counting the hours 'til I get home
