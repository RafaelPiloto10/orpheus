Pull it out snap it in, let me begin  
Cut under the chin fresh out the loony bin  
You don't want me to act up, punk you'd better back up  
Swingin my axe everybody gets hacked up  
  
Get up, stand up, bloodying my hands up  
Can't control the feelin' here I come a wig peelin  
I can chop a hater up even though I'm drunk  
Yo, I'll stab 'em in the eye and then I'll take the punks home  
  
Freak show, funk it, bodies in the trunk'in  
Pullin drive by on the cops at a dunkin'  
Donuts shop, My hatchet goes chop  
Guts hit the floor and I'm losin it but I won't stop  
I came here to clown, I came here to clown  
Lets get lunatic and jump around!  
  
Jump around  
Jump around, jump up and down like a clown

I'll serve your ass like a rabid chef  
If your girl steps up, I'll stab her to death  
Word to your mother, A scrub from the gutter  
That'll cut through your neck, hot knife to butter  
  
I turn the moon off and dance in the darkness  
Choke the life, right up out of your carcus  
I got sick jokes for you, there not fun  
Fuck you in the ass with a shotgun  
  
I plead insanity, ' and shout to the death  
Had to muster WOO with my last breath  
Tell me to Chill.. I don't think I will  
'Cause when I shoot the shit, I shoot to kill  
  
I came here to clown, I came here to clown  
Lets get lunatic and jump around!  
  
Jump around  
Jump around, jump up and down like a clown

Jump, jump, jump  
Jump, jump, jump  
  
GET LOONY  
  
Jump, jump  
Jump, jump, jump  
Jump,  
  
GET LOONY  
  
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top  
I never eat a pig but I eat pig slop  
I swing a chainsaw through the brains and all  
Veins and jaws, sip it all through a straw  
  
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch  
Get used to one torture and yo then Im like SWITCH!  
Then up up and around buck buck it down  
Put your head up and you wake up in the dawn of the dead  
I'm comin to get ya, My hatchet'll split ya  
Twist off your head and snap a picture with ya  
They found ya in a ditch and said you're a bitch ya  
Just like me it was the rythem that hit ya  
  
I came here to clown, I came here to clown  
Lets get lunatic and jump around!  
  
Jump around  
Jump around, jump up and down like a clown
