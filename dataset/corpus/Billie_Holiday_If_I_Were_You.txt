If I were you  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd give my heart a break  
Instead of trying to break my heart  
  
It I were you  
I'd do this too  
I'd string along with me  
Instead of keepin' me on a string  
  
I'd love me the whole day long  
You'd never catch me nappin'  
Wouldn't have a change of heart  
Not for fear  
That such a thing should happen  
  
It I were you  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd stick to me  
My whole life through  
It I were you
