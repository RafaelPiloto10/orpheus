Another one of those  
Trackmasters, Rockland joints  
You know what I'm saying?  
  
[Girl]  
Trackmasters rock on  
Rockland rock on  
R. Kelly rock on  
(Kelly what'cha say baby)  
Rock on  
(Freestyle)  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Since conversation's not the same  
And he turned in some shine to rain  
Well boo I'm gonna ease your pain  
Because I'm gonna be your man  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all good  
See you've already been through enough baby  
It's all good  
That's why things are about to swing your way  
It's all good  
You see you don't have to worry baby  
It's all good  
'Cause tomorrow's sun is gonna bring a brighter day  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Yes we gon hit the shopping strip  
I'll buy you anything you want  
You deserve a first class trip  
Somewhere far away from home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Free your mind  
And I'll lead you to place  
Where the wind blows  
And your cares I cast away  
And it's all good  
  
Come on, come on, yo  
Yo dippin' in the six with the top let down  
Smirk on my face cause I'm Rockland bound  
While on the other side of town  
  
I be holding it down  
Wearing brigets around on my platinum crown  
why'all want to see my business clothes  
See me fold  
  
Keep me from rocking the white gold  
Bitches hail,  
When I roll we'll sit on chrome  
When we do shows we sell out super domes  
  
While you at home burning the hot coal  
Honey left you coming home to me like it's a curfew  
One nice day and now she calling me boo  
And she calling you through  
  
And you calling me singing the sad tune  
I wish Kelly would pick up the celly  
Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her belly  
Now I can get freaky with some K-why-jelly  
  
But I'd rather go cruise with my man  
What the deally?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[R. Kelly]  
It's all good  
See I just want to see you happy darling  
It's all good  
Yeah, and I can't stand to see your eyes crying  
It's all good  
And if it takes the rest of all my life  
It's all good  
Your whole world's gonna be a paradise  
It's all good  
  
Rockland, Trackmasters  
Nine-Eight  
You suckers, screw all of why'all
