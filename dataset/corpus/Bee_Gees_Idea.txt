I been thinking sitting on a pole.  
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told.  
Just me and the mirror and my brain.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
  
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground.  
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound.  
Fifteen million years I spent down the line.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
Get up and stand alone  
  
That was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
Get up and stand alone.  
  
That's when I got an idea [Repeat: x2]
