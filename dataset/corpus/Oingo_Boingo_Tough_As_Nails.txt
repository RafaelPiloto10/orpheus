Mr. Macho loves his women with such dedication  
Second only to his car that drives as fast as light  
On a highway bad jet fighters come from all directions  
Shooting verbal missiles, find their target right on sight, right on sight  
  
In the office things get rough as action is diminished  
Staring at a paper he is lost inside his head  
Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition  
All around, the bodies of the wounded and the dead, and the dead  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause he's tough as nails  
He's tough as nails  
He's tough as nails  
He's tough as nails  
  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
  
Now it's time for football and a bout with heavy drinking  
Holding so much liquor makes him feel like a man  
As he drifts out on the sea on a ship that's slowly sinking  
Quietly salutes himself and the courage he once had, he once had  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Walking round and round in circles  
Waking up in a cold sweat  
Falling down a stairway and the tv dinner's not done yet  
Smash a window, crash a car  
And buy a pair of leather shoes  
Take a sweetheart to a movie  
Cash a check and pay some dues  
  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
He's such a live wire  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Walking round and round in circles...
