Lyrics:  
It's the first annual global,  
Global carnival  
It's the first annual global, global carnival  
It's the first annual global,  
Global carnival  
It's the first annual global (Ah let's get down)  
Global  
Carnival  
Global carnival  
We go have a jamboree  
The biggest one you'll ever see  
We go revel in every nation  
It's go be a celebration  
Hear the music and feel the beat  
On every corner, and every street  
Close the Kremlin, the congress too.  
It's a worldwide hullabaloo  
At the first annual global,  
Global carnival.  
At the first annual global carnival (What ah say)  
At the first annual global,  
Global carnival  
At the first annual global carnival.  
(Ah let's have a party)  
Global  
Carnival  
Global carnival  
Israel and Palestine forming up a conga line  
The Ayatollah and the Pope  
Doing a limbo under a rope  
Princess Di and the I. Are. A.  
Well, they jamming with a Rasta from Montego Bay  
Forget the left, forget the right  
Ah ah we go party tonight  
At the first annual global,  
Global carnival.  
At the first annual global carnival (Ah hum)  
At the first annual global,  
Global carnival  
At the first annual global carnival.  
Global (ah, talk to me)  
Carnival  
Global carnival  
Ah let's do it do it do it do it do it do it  
Sikhs, Basques, Serbo-Croatian  
Cambodians all join in the festivities  
Hindu, Muslin, Jews, Christian  
It doesn't matter what ever your proclivities  
But let me make it very clear  
Nobody goes hungry here  
Margaret Thatcher parking cars  
Fidel Castro passing out cigars  
The C. I. A. And the K. G. B.  
Tye swapping se
