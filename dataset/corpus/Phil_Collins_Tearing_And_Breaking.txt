Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
There goes my heart again  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
Watch my heart fly away  
  
All the love that I have ever known  
Came from the sweetest of hearts  
Every time I was looking for love  
I found it in you  
  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
There goes my heart again  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
Watch my heart fly away  
  
All the tears you found in your eyes  
I know that they were mine  
All the love you were trying to disguise  
I never could desert  
  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
There goes my heart again  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
Watch my heart fly away  
  
Saw that look in the eyes and I felt so sorry for myself  
I could've cried  
Heard you saying goodbye and you know it felt so strange  
Cause I know we'd tried  
  
(With all the tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
There goes my heart again  
(Tearing and breaking down)  
(Tearing my heart)  
I can watch it fly away  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
All the tearing and breaking down  
(Tearing my heart)  
There goes my heart again  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Tearing and breaking down  
(Tearing my heart)  
Watch my heart fly away, fly away, fly again  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart
