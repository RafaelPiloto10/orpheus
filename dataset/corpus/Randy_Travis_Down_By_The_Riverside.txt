I feel so bad in the morning  
I feel so bad in the middle of the day  
I feel so bad in the evening  
That's why I'm going to the river to wash my sins away  
  
I'm going to lay down my heavy load down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
I'm going to lay down my heavy load down by the riverside  
I ain't going to study war no more  
  
I ain't going to study, no, no, no  
Study, study war no more  
Ain't going to study, no, no, no, study, no, no, no, no  
Study, study war no more  
  
I'm going to meet my loving mother down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
I'm going to meet my loving mother down by the riverside  
I ain't going to study war no more  
  
I ain't going to study, study war no more
