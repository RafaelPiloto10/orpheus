(How)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(Oh, yeah)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
I'm doing all I can to try and understand  
Why my feelings faded away  
She's been nothin' but good to me  
I don't wanna hurt her but I must be free  
I can't stay in this love, how do I say goodbye  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
She pretends she cannot see  
The love is gone from me  
She carries on as if it is what it was before  
But I don't love her anymore  
I have to let her know  
That I must let her go  
I can't stay in this life  
How do I say goodbye  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore

Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(Oh, girl)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
Oh, I don't know what to do about it  
Gotta tell her, gotta tell her, gotta tell her  
Oh, there's no way to go around it  
I've got to tell her now but I don't know how  
(Listen, listen, baby)  
(Listen closely, baby)  
I just gotta tell you  
All the love we once had is through  
(Listen, listen, baby)  
(Listen closely, baby)  
(Closely)  
I don't wanna be with you anymore  
(Anymore)  
I can't stay, I can't stay  
(I can't stay)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before
