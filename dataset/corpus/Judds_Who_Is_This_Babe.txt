Who is this baby  
Where did he come from  
He's the son of a carpenter  
The chosen one  
He's the hope of the angels  
A gift of his love  
Just a child in a manger  
Gods only son  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Shepards were watching  
Out under the sky  
When the star over Bethlehem  
Lit up the night  
He's the light in the darkness  
A gift from above  
He is held with the spirit  
Of Gods holy love  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Angels sing  
Worship our king
