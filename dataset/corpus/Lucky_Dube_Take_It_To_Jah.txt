All this pain in this world  
All the crying in this world  
I'll take it to Jah  
All the worries in the world  
And all the troubles in this world  
I will take to Jah  
  
All the suffering  
Right where we are  
I'll take to my father  
  
'Cause he said  
Come to I with all thine sins  
And I will wash away  
All the impurities  
He said I'm your father  
The creator of everything  
That's what I say  
  
(CHORUS):  
All this pain I'll take to Jah [2x]  
All these worries I'll take to Jah [2x]  
  
Come to I with your problems  
No problem too big or small  
No one, no one will be rejected  
I'm your father the creator  
  
OH-HO-HO-HO Lord I cry [2x]  
  
Even when Satan comes  
With him demons  
Turn everything I believed in  
Upside down  
I will never forget  
With Jah on our side  
Who can be against us  
Oh no  
Most high omnipotent one  
Praise him most high  
  
(CHORUS): [TO END]  
All this pain I'll take to Jah  
All this crying I'll take to Jah
