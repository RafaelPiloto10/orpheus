She likes wearin' lipstick, she likes French cuisine  
But she won't let me use my passion unless it's in a limousine.  
  
She got me under pressure,  
She got me under pressure.  
  
She likes the art museum, she don't like Pavlov's dog.  
She fun at the mind museum, she likes it in a London fog.  
She don't like other women, she likes whips and chains.  
She likes cocaine and filppin' out with great Danes.  
She's about all I can handle, it's too much for my brain.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.  
  
I'm gonna give her a message,  
Here's what I'm gonna say:  
"It's all over."  
She might get out a nightstick  
And hurt me real real bad  
By the roadside in a ditch.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.
