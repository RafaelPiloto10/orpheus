I don't want to lose  
This good thing  
That I got  
If I do now  
I would surely  
Surely lose a lot  
'Cause your love  
Is better  
Than any love I know  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like thunder, lightning  
The way you love me is frightening  
I better knock on wood, baby  
  
I'm not superstitious  
About you  
But I can't take no chance  
Got me spinning, spinning, baby  
Baby, I'm in a trance  
'Cause your love  
Is better  
Than any love I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I better knock, baby  
Ain't no secret  
That woman  
Fills my lovin' cup  
She sees to it  
That I get enough  
Just one touch  
Is better  
You know it means so much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Better knock back  
I think I better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
