Once in A lifetime  
Kenny Loggins and Human Nature  
Runaway Bride  
  
Something about you  
Oh, could it be I finally found  
My destiny  
Now here you are  
Within my reach  
  
How did I miss you? (how did I miss you)  
When you were out there all the time  
It took this moment  
To make me realize...  
  
Once in a Lifetime  
You find your reason for living  
You find the one that makes your every dream  
Come true  
(Find the one that makes your dreams...)  
Oh I could search the world forever  
But no one else could do  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone like you  
  
Ahh..  
Once in a lifetime, ohh  
  
I've waited for so long (so long)  
Makin this can't nothin be but a lie  
Cause all about  
Standing by wind, oohh  
Alone in the crowd, oh oh oh  
  
I went through the motion (went through the motion)  
Then out of heaven you arrived  
Whatever was wrong  
Suddenly is right  
  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find the reason for living  
You find the one who makes your every dream  
Come true  
(Find the one who makes your dream...)  
No, I could search the world forever  
And no one else would do  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone like you  
  
(Find someone like you...)  
Hearts that wait for love can grow so weary  
(Don't you know... A heart can grow?)  
But it doesn't matter anymore  
When you find the one you've waited for...  
  
You find your reason for living  
You find the one that makes your every dream come... Oh you make it come true  
Oh you could search the world forever  
But no one else would do  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone like you.....  
  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone.....  
Someone like you......  
  
(Ahhh...)  
Whoaaa......................
