The first time I saw you standing in the water  
You must have been all of a thousand feet tall  
Nearly naked - unashamed like Herod's daughter  
Your love was so big  
It made New York look small  
  
You've been the subject of so many dreams  
Since I climbed your torso  
Oh!  
My Statue of Liberty  
Boo boo  
Impaled on your hair  
What do you do  
Do do to me  
Boo boo  
  
I leaned right over to kiss your stony book  
A little jealous of the ships with whom you flirt  
A billion lovers with their cameras  
Snap to look and in my fantasy  
I sail beneath your skirt
