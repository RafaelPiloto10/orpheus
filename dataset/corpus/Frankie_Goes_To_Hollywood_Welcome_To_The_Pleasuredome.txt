The animals are winding me up  
The jungle call, the jungle call  
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan pleasuredome erect  
Moving on keep moving on-yeah  
Moving at one million miles an hour  
Using my power, I sell it by the hour  
I have it so I market it, you really can't afford it-yeah  
Really can't afford it  
  
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top  
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top  
There goes a supernova what a pushover-yeah  
There goes a supernova what a pushover  
We're a long way from home  
  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
On our way home  
Going home where lovers roam  
Long way from home  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
  
Moving on keep moving on  
I will give you diamonds by the shower  
Love your body even when it's old  
Do it just as only I can do it  
And never ever doing what I'm told  
  
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top  
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top  
There goes a supernova what a pushover-yeah  
There goes a supernova what a pushover  
We're a long way from home  
  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
On our way home  
Going home where lovers roam  
Long way from home  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
  
Keep moving on  
Got to reach the top, don't stop  
Pay love and life-oh my  
Keep moving on on again-yeah  
Shooting stars never stop shooting stars never stop  
  
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top  
There goes a supernova what a pushover  
  
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top  
There goes a supernova what a pushover  
  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
On our way home  
Going home where lovers roam  
Long way from home  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
  
Welcome to the pleasuredome  
Welcome, ha ha ha ha ha  
The world is my oyster, ha ha ha ha ha
