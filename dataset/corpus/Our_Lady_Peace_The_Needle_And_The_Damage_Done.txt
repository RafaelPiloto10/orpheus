Caught you knocking at my cellar door  
Love you baby can I have some more?  
Oh... The damage done  
I hit the city and I lost my band  
Watched the needle take another man  
Gone gone, the damage done  
Ow... Oh my my my...  
Sing the song because I love the man  
Know that some of you don't understand  
Milk blood to keep from running out  
Ow... Oh my my my....  
I've seen the needle and the damage done  
Oh a little part of us in everyone  
I've seen the needle and the damage done  
A little part, little part, little part  
I've seen the needle  
Oh I  
I've seen the needle  
Seen the needle and the damage done  
A little part of us in everyone  
Every junkie's like a setting sun
