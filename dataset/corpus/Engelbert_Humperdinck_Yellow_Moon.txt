The moon is on the rise it stares at me tonight  
I'm reminded of the arms that held me tight  
Last time I held you it ended all too soon  
We were lying underneath a yellow moon  
  
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Oh, I wonder if you're watching it too  
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Wherever you are, it's watching over you  
Oh, shine on, shine on yellow moon  
  
Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon  
I ask him, are you happy or if you're blue  
I start to reminisce to a summer night in June  
We fell in love under a yellow moon  
  
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Oh, I wonder if you're watching it too  
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Wherever you are, it's watching over you  
Oh, shine on, shine on yellow moon  
  
Yellow moon, oh, yellow moon
