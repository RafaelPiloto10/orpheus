What ya gonna choose the poison or the lines  
Lived with crazy pain in all your life  
Something in your mind just tells you no  
Hope in conversation starts to flow  
  
Stuck inside a wheel, inside a wheel  
Wondering everyday is it all for real  
Blinking every time a cold wind blow  
Our love don't fill a mile in rose  
  
Danger remains  
Wat ya gonna do when the old man reads you dry  
Step down from the plane and pluck the eye  
Slide in deeper closer to the bone  
Don't you just wish your heart was made of stone?  
  
Waxing like an old crack 45  
Counting out the ways you could stay alive  
Placing all the banks and feel the stones  
My love won't leave her ways of foam  
  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
  
Who killed tangerine?  
The prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Who killed tangerine?  
  
Who killed tangerine?  
The prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Who killed tangerine?  
  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over
