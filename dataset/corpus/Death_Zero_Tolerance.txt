In the dark of night  
Abusing a portion of light  
While others are sleeping  
And some are escaping  
A serpent spews out fantasy-  
Unjustified blasphemy  
That cannot be condoned  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done  
  
[Chorus]  
There will be zero tolerance  
For the creator of hallowed intentions  
There will be zero tolerance  
Fate is your deciding God  
  
Karma comes crashing down  
Leaving a very deep scar  
Exposing a door to the  
Source of a verbal whore  
Machines supply the altar  
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done
