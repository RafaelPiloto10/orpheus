Once in a lifetime, the suffering of fools  
To find our way home, to break in these palms  
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)  
Once in a lifetime  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
  
Once in a lifetime, the breaking of the roof  
To find that our home, has long been out grown  
Draw me a life line, 'cause honey I got nothing to lose  
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)  
Once in a lifetime  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
  
Look at my reflection in the mirror  
Underneath the power of the light  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a shot at the night  
I feel like I'm losing the fight  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night
