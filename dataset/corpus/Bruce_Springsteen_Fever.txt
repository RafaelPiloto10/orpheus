When I get home from my job  
I turn on my t.v.  
But I can't keep my mind on the show  
When I lay down at night  
I don't get no sleep  
So I turn on the radio  
But, lord, the only thing I hear  
Is you whisperin' in my ear  
The words that you used to say  
Well, now the days grow longer  
My love grows stronger  
And the fever gets worse every day  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
I can remember comin' home  
See you standin' at the stove  
With the dishes on the table  
Dinner ready to go  
Or maybe out to a movie show  
Something that you'd like to see  
Oh, you were my sun in the morning  
And my moon at night  
When you put your arms around me  
Made me fell alright  
Well, now the days grow longer  
And my love just grows stronger  
And the fever gets so bad at night  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
It's gonna be alright, now  
If I can make it to the morning  
I'm gonna be alright, now  
If I can just make it to the morning  
  
It's just this long and lonely nights  
Every time I close my eyes  
All I see is her face  
Every time I shut my eyes  
All I see is her face  
But I'm gonna be alright, now  
I'll be alright, now  
When I shut down all the lights  
When I turn off all the lights  
When I turn down all the lights  
And when I lay my head on the pillow  
I can't stop myself in thinking  
"Baby, where are you tonight? "  
"Where is she tonight? "
