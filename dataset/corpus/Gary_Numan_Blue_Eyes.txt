Well you're pretty quick to say you love me  
But I've met your kind before  
So I took you twice on our first night  
That doesn't mean I'm going to trust you too far  
  
Love your blue eyes  
When you cry  
Love your blue eyes  
  
You tried to make me crawl far too soon  
But you should know me better by now  
I didn't even feel like trying with you  
I knew that I could break you somehow  
  
Love your blue eyes  
When you cry  
Love your blue eyes
