Promise something,  
Kill me right away if I start to get slow  
And don't remember  
How to separate the worm from the apple  
Don't wait 'til tomorrow,  
Kill me right away if I start to listen  
To the voices  
Telling all the mouths what they need to swallow  
  
Do that for me, it's the least that you can do  
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
'Til I'm born again  
  
I was thirsty,  
I remember that you gave me some water  
I was angry  
Everything at once you gave me no trouble  
I was crying,  
I remember that you gave me your shoulder  
  
Do that for me, it's the least that you can do  
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
'Til I'm born again, born again  
  
Do that for me, it's the least that you can do  
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
'Til I'm born again, born again, born again, born again
