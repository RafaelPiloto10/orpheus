I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
I thought how as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along unbroken song  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head  
There is no peace on earth I said  
For hate is strong that mocks the song  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead, nor doubt he sleeps  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
'Til ringin' singin' on its way  
The world revolve from night to day  
A voice, a chime, a chance so blind,  
On earth goodwill to men.  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth goodwill to men.
