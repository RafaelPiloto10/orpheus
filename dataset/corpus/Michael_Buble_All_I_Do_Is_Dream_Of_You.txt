All I do is dream of you  
The whole night through  
With the dawn I still go on  
Dreamin' of you  
  
You're every thought, you're everything  
You're every song I ever sing  
Summer, winter, autumn and spring  
  
And were there more than twenty-four hours a day  
They'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away  
  
When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue  
Morning, noon and nighttime, too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you  
  
When sky's are grey,  
Even when they're blue  
  
And were there more than twenty-four hours in a day  
Oh they'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away  
  
When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue  
Morning, noon and nighttime, too  
All I do the whole day through is dream  
(I'm dreamin', dreamin' a dream)  
Of (Just dreamin', I dream a little dream)  
You
