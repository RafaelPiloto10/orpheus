I feel like I'm pounding on a big door  
No one can hear me knocking,  
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor  
No one can catch me from falling.  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand,  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands.  
The crew have abandoned ship  
The lights are on but now one is in.

I feel like I'm calling on a telephone  
No one can hear the ringing,  
I feel like I'm running up a steep hill  
No one can stop me from running.  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands.  
The little hand shakes it's fist  
The face is hanging out on a spring.

The hourglass has no more grains of sand,  
Little red grains of sand.  
My watch has stopped now more turning hands  
Little green neon hands.
