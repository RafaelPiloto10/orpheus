(You walk by and I fall to pieces)  
I fall to pieces each time I see you again  
I fall to pieces how can I be just your friend  
(You want me to act like we've never kissed)  
You want me to forget pretend we've never met  
Oh I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet you walk by and I fall to
pieces  
  
I fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to pieces time only adds to the flame  
(You want me to find someone else to love)  
Someone who'll love me too the way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new you walk by and I fall to pieces  
You walk by and I fall to pieces
