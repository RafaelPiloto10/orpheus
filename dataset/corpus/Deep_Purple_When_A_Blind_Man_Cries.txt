If you're leaving close the door.  
I'm not expecting people anymore.  
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.  
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.  
  
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.  
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.  
  
Had a friend once in a room,  
had a good time but it ended much too soon.  
In a cold month in that room  
we found a reason for the things we had to do.  
  
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.  
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.
