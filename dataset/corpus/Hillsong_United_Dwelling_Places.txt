Lovely are Your dwelling places  
Thirsty, I come after You  
Jesus my joy, my reward, Your love's restoring my soul  
Now I'm Yours and You are mine  
And from my heart a song will rise  
  
Chorus:  
I love You, I love You, I love You (x3)  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
Jesus there's none besides you  
Righteous, ruler of the earth  
Nations will come and bow down  
Name above all names I sing You praises  
And all I can say to you is...
