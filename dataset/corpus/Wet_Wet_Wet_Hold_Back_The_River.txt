Stop your pretending  
Listen to what I've got to say  
How your head's went away  
Only here for a day  
And that grave I just made  
Is for me when I get paid  
  
Won't you wait a while  
Move to the blue  
Sometimes people don't want to say  
Old time dancers don't die that way  
See that grave I've just made  
It's for me when I get paid  
  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
Do you love and surrender  
Sometimes I don't feel I can remember  
I think it's fair to mention  
About the days when I get paid  
  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
I want a little loving  
I told you all to listen  
But you never liked what you heard  
I take what I am given  
This may sound absurd  
I share a double vision  
That started the transition  
  
Hey where's Jimmy Jazz  
Steady on the scale  
  
I told you to listen  
I told you all to listen  
  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
You know that somebody  
You know that somebody  
You know that somebody  
But it ain't you
