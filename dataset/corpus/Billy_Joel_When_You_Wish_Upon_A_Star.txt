When a star is born, they receive a gift or two  
One of them is this, they have the power to make a dream come true  
  
When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires will come to you  
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind she brings to those who love  
Love's sweet fulfillment of their secret longing  
  
Like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true  
  
Ooh, like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and I sees you through  
When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true, ooh, ooh
