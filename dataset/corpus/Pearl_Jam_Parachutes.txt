Why deny all the troubles when combined  
With the missing links it don't feel like home now  
  
That your gone all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum  
You're always wishing and never here at home  
  
You all the dreams we shared and  
Lights we turned on  
But the house is getting dark  
  
And I don't want to know your past  
But together share the dawn  
And I won't need nothing else  
Cause when we're dead  
We would've had it all and died  
  
I would've fallen from the sky til you  
Parachutes have opened now  
  
Heaven knows if there's a ceiling  
Come so low with the kneeling  
Please know that I got all the friends I'm needing  
Before my light go out  
As the doors are closing now  
  
And far away will be my home  
And to grasp this, I don't know  
But I don't need  
Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today  
  
And love  
Wish the world could glow again with love  
One can't see to have enough  
  
And war  
Break the sky and tell me what it's for  
I'll travel there on my own  
  
And love  
What a different life  
Had I not found this love with you
