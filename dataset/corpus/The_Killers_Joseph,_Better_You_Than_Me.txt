The Killers  
Well your eyes just haven?t been the same, Joseph  
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph  
There?s a pale moonshine, above you  
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around  
Elton John  
Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph  
Are the rumors eating you alive, Joseph  
The Killers  
When the holy night is upon you  
Will you do what?s right, the position is yours  
Elton John  
From the temple walls to the New York night  
Our decisions rest on a child  
When she took her stand  
Did she hold your hand  
Will your faith stand still or run away  
Run away  
guitar solo  
Elton John  
When they've driven you so far  
That you think you're gonna drop  
Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop  
Neil Tennant  
With the plane and the lathe  
The work never drove you mad  
You're a maker, a creator  
Not just somebody's dad  
From the temple walls to the New York night  
Our decisions rest on a man  
When I take the stand  
When I take the stand  
Will he hold my hand  
Will my faith stand still or run away  
(run away)  
Elton John  
And the desert  
It's a hell of a place to find heaven  
Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God  
And you climb to the top of the mountain  
Looking down on the city  
Where you were born  
(On the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect)  
Better you than me (Better you than me)  
Better you than me  
Yes  
The Killers  
Well the Holy night is upon you (Better you than me 2x)  
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around  
Better you than me, Joseph (Better you than me)  
Better you than me  
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph, Joseph  
Than me  
Better you than me  
Better you than me (Better you, better you, better you)  
Than me  
Well your eyes just haven?t been the same, Joseph
