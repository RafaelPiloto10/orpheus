You're in the mood for love  
You're in the mood to dance  
You're in the mood for a little romance  
You're in the mood for love  
I see you've pressed those pants  
I see you've styled that hair  
There doesn't seems to be much of it there  
You're in the mood to dance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance?  
Can I have the stance?  
I am in the mood for love  
I am all dressed up tonight  
I've waited all night long  
When will they finally play your song?  
I am in the mood to dance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance?  
Can I have the stance?  
I am in the mood for love  
I am in the mood for love  
If it?s the only chance I get  
If it?s the only chance then get  
Ready to throw your shoes away  
For I will sweep, sweep, sweep  
you're off your feet  
I will sweep, sweep, sweep  
You're off your feet  
To be your little romance  
Can I have this chance  
To be your little romance?  
Can I have the stance?  
I am in the mood for  
You are in the mood for me  
We're in the mood for love
