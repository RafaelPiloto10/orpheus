What are you thinking?  
I know you see  
Your cell phone blinking  
Backwards  
And forward I'm pacing  
Trying to figure out  
Why you aint calling me back  
What does it all mean?  
Maybe you're trying  
To show me something  
But you aint  
Gotta do it this way, no  
Put yourself in my shoes  
Tell me what would you do  
  
[Chorus]  
She knows  
I've been hitting her  
On the phone  
And I know  
She's been gettin it  
Something's wrong  
Could it be  
That she's with the other dude  
From her past  
I know damn well that she aint  
Sittin there laughin  
With her girlfriends  
Lookin at the number  
Talking bout it's him again  
I know  
She better call pretty soon  
I'm gonna send the boys  
To find out  
Just why she's been M.I.A  
  
Is it a problem?  
And if it's really one  
I'ma solve it  
don't know how  
You handled other dudes  
But I'm not them  
Girl you runnin around  
Got 'em thinkin  
That I can't handle my thang  
Ooh, are you crazy?  
Did you really think you could play me?  
I'm bout to show up on your doorstep  
And you better answer when I knock  
Knock, you better be by yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
She knows  
I've been hitting  
Her on the phone  
And I know  
She's been gettin it  
Something's wrong  
Could it be  
That she's with the other dude  
From her past  
I know damn well that she aint  
Sittin there laughin  
With her girlfriends  
Lookin at the number  
Talking bout it's him again  
I know she better call pretty soon  
I'm gonna send the boys to find out  
Just why she's been M.I.A  
  
You can't run  
(Cause the boys are gonna find ya, girl)  
You can't hide  
(Cause you know I'm right behind ya, girl)  
If you tellin the truth  
Then why you actin like you scared?  
Over there  
You can't run  
(Cause them boys are gonna find ya, ooh)  
You can't hide  
(Cause you know I'm right behind ya, ooh)  
If what you say is true  
Then why you can't comin back baby  
Baby  
  
[Chorus]  
She knows  
I've been hitting  
Her on the phone  
And I know  
She's been gettin it  
Something's wrong  
Could it be that she's  
With the other dude  
From her past  
I know damn well that she aint  
Sittin there laughin  
With her girlfriends  
Lookin at the number  
Talking bout it's him again  
I know she better call pretty soon  
I'm gonna send the boys to find out  
Just why she's been M.I.A
