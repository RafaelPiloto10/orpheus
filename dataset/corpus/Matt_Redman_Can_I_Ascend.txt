Can I ascend the hill of the Lord?  
Can I stand in that holy place?  
There to approach the glory of my God,  
Come towards to seek your face.  
Purify my heart  
Purify my hands  
For I know it is, on holy ground I'll stand.  
I'm coming up the mountain Lord  
I'm seeking you and you alone.  
I know that I will be transformed  
My heart unveiled before you.  
I'm longing for your presence Lord  
Envelop me within the clouds.  
I'm coming up the mountain Lord  
My heart unveiled before you  
I will come.  
Can I ascend the hill of the Lord?

I'm coming to worship  
I'm coming to bow down  
I'm coming to be with you.
