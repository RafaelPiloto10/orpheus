Take a look at the great street  
It don't seem the same  
Remember how great it should be  
Shops are full of fashion  
People told what they want  
The street that was a part of the  
British monarchy  
British monarchy  
  
Who wants cafgans and all that  
We don't need them now  
Why should we accept the change  
And buy clothes of today  
  
Kids repel the change and  
Bring back the street  
Shops filled by whole nations  
Carnaby street  
Carnaby street  
  
The street is a mirror  
For our country  
Reflects the rise and fall  
Of our nation  
  
The street that was a legend  
Is a mockery  
A part of the British tradition  
Gone down the drain  
  
You don't need no glass ball  
To see its faults  
Take a walk along that street  
And you'll see what I mean  
  
Carnaby street  
Carnaby street  
(Not what it used to be)  
Carnaby street  
(Not what it used to be)
