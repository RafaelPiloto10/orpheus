Walking alone tonight  
'Cause I've only got room for two.  
Me and my burdened black heart,  
It's all we know how to do.  
  
Yet I look for a bigger bang  
Than the kind I continually see.  
Sick of all this inertia,  
Oh, won't you mend me?  
  
Lover, can you help me?  
I'm a child lost in the woods.  
A black heart pollutes me  
And I think  
  
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb,  
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
  
Pulled by a false inertia,  
Pushed out by circumstance.  
Pistol firing at my feet  
That's coercing me to dance.  
  
Yet I look for a bigger bang  
Than the kind I'm sorry to know.  
Here I am, first foot of the climb.  
Watch me go.  
  
Lover, can you help me?  
I'm a child lost in the woods.  
A lit path eludes me  
And I think  
  
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb,  
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
You're a bonfire and I'm gathered 'round you.  
Set this old black heart inertia aflame.  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
  
You're a mountain that I'd like to climb,  
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.  
You're a bonfire and I'm gathered 'round you.  
Set this old black heart inertia aflame.  
  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away  
Set it aflame, send it away
