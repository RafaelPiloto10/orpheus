Baby, yes  
Until the end of time  
I'll be there for you  
You own my heart and mind  
I truly adore you  
If God one day stroke me blind  
Your beauty I'd still see  
Love is too weak to define  
Just what you mean to me  
  
From the first moment I saw you  
Oh, I knew you where the one  
That night I had to call you  
I was rapping till the sun came up  
Telling you just how fine you look  
In a word, you were sex  
All of my cool attitude you took  
My body was next  
You made love to me  
Like you where afraid  
Was you afraid of me?  
Was I the first?  
Was I your every fantasy?  
That's why  
  
Until the end of time  
I'll be there for you  
You own my heart and mind  
I truly adore you  
If God one day stroke me blind  
Your beauty I'd still see  
Love is to weak to define  
Just what you mean to me  
  
When we be making love  
I only hear the sounds  
Heavenly angels crying up above  
Tears of joy pouring down on us  
They know we need each other  
They know you are my fix  
I know, that you know that I ain't cheating baby  
They know this is serious  
I ain't funking just for kicks, no  
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby  
You could say that I'm a terminal case  
You could burn up my clothes  
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride  
But I got to have your face  
All up in the place  
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste  
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace  
But nothing baby, I said nothing baby could compare  
To your lovely face  
Do you know what I'm saying to ya this evening  
I'm just trying to say  
I'm just trying to say  
That until, until the end of time  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
On my heart, on my mind, (Truly adore you)  
I truly adore you (Darling)  
You don't know what you're mean to me  
Baby, (Until the end of time)  
Baby, (I'll be there for you)  
Baby, (You own my heart and mind)  
'Till the end of time I'll be there for you  
(I truly adore you)  
Adore you (Adore you)  
  
Can I talk to you?  
Tell you what you mean to me  
Every time you wander  
I'll be your eyes so you can see  
I want to show you things  
That I show no other, I want to be  
More than, more than your mother  
More than your brother  
I want to be (Like no) like no other  
If you need me, I'll never leave  
I know, that you know, without you there is no me  
There is no me  
Without you there is no sea  
There is no shore  
Love is to weak to define how much I adore  
You, child  
You, child  
The last words you hear  
The last words you hear  
  
(Until the end of time)  
I'll be there for you, baby  
(Until the end of time)  
  
Be with me darling till the end of time (Until the end of time)  
I'll give you my heart  
I'll give you my mind  
I'll give you my body (Until the end of time)  
I'll give you my time (Until the end of time)  
(Until the end of time)  
  
For all time I am with you  
You are with me  
(Until the end of time)  
You are with me, you are with me
