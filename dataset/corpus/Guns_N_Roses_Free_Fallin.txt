She's a good girl, loves her mama  
loves Jesus and America too  
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis  
loves horses and her boyfriend too  
  
It's a long day livin' in Reseda  
there's a freeway runnin' through the yard  
and I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her  
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart  
  
And I'm free, I'm free fallin'  
  
All the vampires walkin' through the valley  
move west down Ventura Blvd.  
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows  
All the good girls are home with broken hearts  
  
I wanna glide down over Mulholland  
I wanna write her name in the sky  
I wanna free fall out into nothin'  
Gonna leave this world for awhile
