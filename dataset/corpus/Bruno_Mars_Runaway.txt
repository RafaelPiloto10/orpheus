[Verse 1]  
So easy to forget our love, the little things we do.  
Like callin' for no reason, just to say the words,  
"Baby, I love you."  
I know lately I've been busy, but a second doesn't go by  
Without you crossin' my mind.  
It's been so long since we had time,  
Let's take a day and make everything 'right.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.  
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.  
When everything in love gets so complicated,  
It only takes a day to change it.  
What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,  
So let's runaway.  
Let's runaway, just for the day,  
Runaway, runaway.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Girl, you've been so patient,  
Spendin' nights alone and not complainin'  
But I'll make it up to you and I promise today I won't keep you waitin'.  
Please give me this one chance to remind you of everything we have.  
I won't give up, I'm too much in love, and I want you to know that.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.  
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.  
When everything in love gets so complicated,  
It only takes a day to change it.  
What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,  
  
[Bridge]  
So let's runaway for the day,  
And I'll give everything in this moment.  
And I promise to make everyday just like the day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's runaway to the place where love first found us.  
Let's runaway for the day, don't need anyone around us.  
When everything in love gets so complicated,  
It only takes a day to change it.  
What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,  
So let's runaway.
