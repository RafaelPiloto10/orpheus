[female voice:]  
Hi ga Kureru  
Sore wa Toki no Mahou  
Asu Onaji Toki  
Mata Chigau Mahou  
Sore wa Iro ga Kaori ni  
Kaori ga Iro ni Kawaru Toki  
Soshite Kage wa Kagirinai  
Ao ni Tokeru  
  
The day falls into the twilight.  
It is a magic of time.  
The same time tomorrow,  
there'll be another magic.  
It is when colors turn to flavors,  
and flavors turn to colors.  
And it is when  
shadows melt into deep blue....
