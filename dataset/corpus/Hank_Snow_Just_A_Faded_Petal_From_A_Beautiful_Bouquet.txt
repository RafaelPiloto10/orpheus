Darling, I received your last long letter,  
And enclosed I found a petal from the rose  
That I picked and placed within your hair,  
Dear when we strolled beneath the moon-beams long ago.  
  
You say that you can understand today, dear,  
Why in tears I told you when you went away  
Now you're leaving and I'll be so lonely  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet.  
  
You tell me that tonight you're broken hearted,  
Your happiness in life sweetheart, you say, is through,  
And that you regret the day you left me  
And broken my heart to change an old love for the new.  
  
With aching heart in tears I write this letter,  
Old mem'ries I could never, never cast away.  
I forgive you and you'll find me waiting  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet.
