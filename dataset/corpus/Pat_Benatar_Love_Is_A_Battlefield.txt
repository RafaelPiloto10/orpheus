We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises, no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
(Woah)  
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong  
Searchin' our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield  
  
You're beggin' me to go then makin' me stay  
Why do you hurt me so bad  
It would help me to know  
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had  
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why  
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side  
  
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises, no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong  
Searchin' our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We're losing control  
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside  
And when all this gets old, will it still feel the same  
There's no way this will die  
But if we get much closer, I could lose control  
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold  
  
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises, no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong  
Searchin' our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield
