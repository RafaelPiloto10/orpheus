Lyin' here beside you in someone else's bed  
Knowin' what we're doin's wrong but better left unsaid  
Your breathin' sounds like screamin'  
It's all that I can stand  
His ring is on your finger but my heart is in your hands  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
Damned  
Damned  
  
The door slams like a shotgun  
You jump up to your feet  
But it's just the wind that's blowin' through those secrets that we keep  
Made me want to want you  
God knows I need to need you  
By the time this love is over I'll be sleepin' on the street  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
  
Why won't you talk to me?  
Because I'm too blind to see  
Why won't you look at me?  
Because I'm afraid to breathe  
What do you want from me?  
All that I can stand  
The lies are on my tongue and I can't go back  
I know my soul is damned  
  
Don't worry  
I ain't gonna call you or hear you say my name  
But if you see me on the streets  
Don't wave  
Just walk away  
Our lives are gettin' twisted  
Let's keep our stories straight  
The more that I resist it my temptation turns to fate  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
Damned  
Yeah I'm Damned  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
Damned  
I'm Damned
