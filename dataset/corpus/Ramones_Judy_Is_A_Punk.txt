Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They both went down to Berlin, joined the Ice Capades  
And oh, I don't know why  
Oh, I don't know why  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Second verse, same as the first  
Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They both went down to Berlin, joined the Ice Capades  
And oh, I don't know why  
Oh, I don't know why  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Third verse, different from the first  
Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They both went down to Frisco, joined the SLA  
And oh, I don't know why  
Oh, I don't know why  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah  
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
