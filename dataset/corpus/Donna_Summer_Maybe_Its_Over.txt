You were the first  
And you taught me how to love  
And you'll always stay close to my heart  
But it would not be fair it I wouldn't tell you now  
  
That it's over, baby it's over  
  
You took this lonely child  
And you taught it how to feel  
You took the rain clouds from my eyes  
You made fantasy seem real  
Still it hurts me so inside  
But I can't change and I can't hide  
  
That it's over, maybe it's over  
  
Oh now, I know you're not the one  
It's me  
I've changed inside  
I feel a need to be free  
It's over  
Maybe baby it's over  
  
I was a lonely girl  
Just calling out for him  
You taught me how to live  
You taught me how to love myself  
Still it hurts me so inside  
But I can't change and I can't hide  
  
That's it's over, baby it's over  
  
Oh, now I know you're not the one  
It's me  
I've changed, changed inside  
I feel a need to be free  
  
It's over  
Maybe baby it's over  
It's over  
Please don't hate me  
But it's over  
  
Don't you know that I love you  
Don't you know that I care  
Don't you know that I love you  
But I can't always be there  
It ain't you  
No, it's me  
Gonna fly like a bird  
Fly like a bird  
Yeah, I must be free
