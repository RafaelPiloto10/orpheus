One light for direction  
Through the valley of night  
One chance to be heard  
And it's well worth the fight  
  
Uh you better keep your body moving  
Don't wait for a feeling  
To finally grow  
Into an answer you've been hearing  
Because you already know  
  
But they can't take it away, they can't take it away  
But they can't take it away, they can't take it away  
  
Come on with me  
  
One voice and it's got to be you  
We can only get one heart  
And it's got to be through  
  
So if your love is breakthrough, turns voice  
You cannot live without a voice  
You cannot live without a voice
