This is a tale of a Northern Soul  
Looking to find his way back home  
He's coming from that same old road  
You know the one your folds don't know  
  
I want to see if you know me  
I was born in a rented room  
My mother didn't get no flowers  
Dad didn't approve of me, do you?  
  
I'm alive with something inside of me  
And I don't think I'm coming back  
So come on come in inside of me  
Let's spread it all around  
  
Give me your powder and pills  
I want to see if they cure my ills  
I've no time for love and devotion  
  
No time for old fashioned potion  
Take a look into my eyes  
I tell you so many lies and then I'll let you go into the night  
And I don't think I'm coming down  
I'm alive with something inside of me  
And I can't seem to get it out  
  
I'm gonna die alone in bed  
This is a tale of a northern soul  
Looking for his way back home  
And my friend said, "Come in side of me  
And your speakers are telling the truth  
Coming through and into your room on a river of sound"  
  
This is a tale of a northern soul looking for his way back home  
And if he sees it I know I'll know (repeat)  
And there's fighting on the street below  
I know there's fighting on the street below  
But I don't care 'Cause I'm a Northern Soul  
And I'm looking for a way back home  
  
Too busy staying alive (repeat)  
Too busy living a lie, too busy living my life  
Too busy staying alive
