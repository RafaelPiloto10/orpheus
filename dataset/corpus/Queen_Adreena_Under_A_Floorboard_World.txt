I got your secret  
And I sure ain't gonna keep it  
I've got your secret  
And I sure ain't gonna keep it  
I'm in the know  
And I sure do mean to reap it  
I got your secret  
And I sure ain't gonna keep it  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Ooh, oooh  
I got your secret  
And I sure ain't gonna keep it  
I got your secret  
And I sure ain't gonna keep it  
I'm in the know  
And I sure do mean to reap it!  
I got your secret  
And I sure ain't gonna keep it  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Ooh, oooh...
