Tell her that I'm blue and lonely  
Dreamy Carolina moon  
  
Carolina moon keeps shinin'  
Shinin' on the one who waits for me  
Carolina moon, I'm pinin'  
Pinin' for the place I long to be  
  
How I'm hopin' tonight you go, go to the right window  
Scatter your light, say I'm all right, please do, please do  
Tell her that I'm blue and lonely  
Dreamy, dreamy Carolina moon  
  
How I'm hopin' tonight you go, go to the right window  
Scatter your light, say I'm all right, please do, please do  
Tell her that I'm blue and oh, so lonely  
Dreamy Carolina moon  
Dreamy Carolina moon, oh moon
