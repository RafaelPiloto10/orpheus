It's been a long time since you went away  
I stop to think of you most every day  
With all my heart I'm hoping you're okay  
Guess who loves you? Somebody loves you  
I couldn't reach you by the US mail  
You didn't leave a very easy trail  
I tried to telephone to no one bail  
Guess who loves you ? Somebody loves you, I do  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you  
Mind over matter is the game I play  
I'll never each you any other way  
So I send this one thought to you every day  
Guess who loves you? Somebody loves you, I do  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you, I do  
I couldn't reach you by the US mail  
You didn't leave a very easy trail  
I tried to telephone to no one bail  
Guess who loves you? Somebody loves you, I do  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you
