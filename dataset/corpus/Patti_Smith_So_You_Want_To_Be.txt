So, you want to be a rock 'n roll star  
Well, listen now to what I say  
Get yourself an electric guitar  
And take some time and learn how to play  
  
And when your hair's combed right  
And your pants are tight, it's gonna be all right  
  
With time you go downtown  
To the agent man, he won't let you down  
Sell your soul to the company  
They're all waiting there to sell plastic wares  
  
And in a week or two, if you make the charts  
The girls will tear you apart  
  
What you pay for these riches and fame?  
Well, it's all a vicious game, you're a little insane  
What you get is the public acclaim  
Don't forget who you are, you're a rock 'n roll star  
  
Na, na na, na na na, na na  
Na na, na na, na na na  
  
Hey you, come here, get up  
Ah, this is the era where everybody creates  
Recognize my face? They call me broken glass  
That's because of the sounds [Incomprehensible]  
  
What you pay for all these riches and fame?  
Well, it's all a vicious game, you're a little insane  
Well, you're a little insane, oh a little insane  
Cause the thing that you gain is the public acclaim  
  
Don't forget who you are, don't forget who you are  
Don't forget who you are, you're a rock 'n roll star
