This is the ghoul's night out  
Suffer unto me  
Devils born in angels' arms  
Ghouls in heaven's fall  
  
This is the ghoul's night out  
All ghouls go to hell  
Humans held on eating flesh  
It's my destiny  
  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls  
Ghouls, ghouls, destiny  
  
Hell is where you want to be  
I feel the hell on you and me  
I feel it every day  
Hell is where you want to be  
I feel the hell on you and me  
It never goes away  
  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls, ghouls night out  
Ghouls, ghouls  
Ghouls, ghouls, destiny  
  
This is the ghouls night out  
Suffer unto me  
Devils born in angels arms  
Ghouls in heaven fall  
  
This is the ghouls night out  
All ghouls go to hell  
Humans held on eating flesh  
It's my destiny  
  
To eat meat, to eat flesh  
It's my destiny  
To eat meat, to eat flesh  
It's my destiny  
To eat meat, to eat flesh  
It's my destiny  
To eat meat, to eat flesh  
It's my destiny
