Guess who just got back today  
Them wild-eyed boys that had been away  
Haven't changed that much to say  
But man, I still think them cats are crazy  
  
They were askin' if you were around  
How you was, where you could be found  
Told 'em you were livin' downtown  
Drivin' all the old men crazy  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town again)  
  
You know that chick that used to dance a lot  
Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she got  
When I say she was cool she was red hot  
I mean, she was steamin'  
  
And that time over at Johnny's place,  
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face  
Man, we just fell about the place  
If that chick don't want to know, forget her  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town again)  
  
Spread the word around  
Guess who's back in town  
  
Just spread the word around  
  
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill  
Down at Dino's Bar 'n' Grill  
The drink will flow and the blood will spill  
And if the boys want to fight, you better let 'em  
  
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song  
The nights are getting longer, it won't be long  
Won't be long till the summer comes  
Now that the boys are here again  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
Spread the word around  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town again)  
  
The boys are back in town again  
Been hangin' down at Dino's  
The boys are back in town again
