I'm dumbing down the world  
Yes, I'm dumbing down the world  
And my head is held high  
And the glint in my eye  
And my arrogance rumbles before me  
  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my thoughts are banal  
Like a stagnant canal  
And my sycophants shamble behind me  
  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my hour is come around, is come around !  
Yes my hour is come around, it's come around...  
  
Look around !  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my works are designed  
To suck blood from your mind  
For your energy feeds and sustains me  
  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world and I love it !
