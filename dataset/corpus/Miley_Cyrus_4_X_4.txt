[Chorus:]  
Round and round and away we go  
Round and round and away we go  
Four by four and away we go  
High not low and away we go  
Round and round and away we go and away we go  
Four by four and away we go  
High not low and away we go  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm a female rebel can't you tell  
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped my nail  
Lean out the window that's when I yell  
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself  
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself  
Police want to get him and put him in jail  
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail  
Hooked on donuts and [?]  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I'm in that passenger seat riding high in the air  
And we're driving fast 'til we plum out of gas  
Let's go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'm a female rebel, can't you see  
Riding around your backyard who could it be  
Pull out on the scene  
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat  
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat  
He don't understand what he's doing to me  
Deep down inside like a pitbull in heat  
Someone's coming so we  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
It's 12 o'clock and I don't want to party  
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby  
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody  
Now I got dirt all over my body  
Might as well lie to L  
His big fog lights is bright as hell  
Calls it off, he starts to yell,  
He hits the gas so I grab the rail  
  
[Bridge: Nelly]  
Sure you want to ride with me  
If you scared don't lie to me  
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the midwest  
With a Mississippi flow and a  
Four by four with the ultra steps  
We doing donuts underneath the  
I need a chick on time don't mind being early  
A ride or die dollar six thirty  
A straight up chick like twelve o'clock  
I don't know where you at  
That's what you tell the cops  
Take a stand for a nigga  
Raise a hand for a nigga  
I solemnly swear he was with me all day  
Up to the judge, he know what I love  
Hell he could tell, she don't even budge  
Round and round we go  
Don't stop 'til I tell you so  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Outro:]  
I'm a female rebel can't you tell can't you tell  
I'm a female rebel can't you tell can't you tell
