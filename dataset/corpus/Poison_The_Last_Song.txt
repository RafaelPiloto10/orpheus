When I lost my way  
You were my light  
When the others wronged me  
You did me right  
  
When I look in your eyes  
Don't tell me lies  
You tell me the truth  
Your words, they get me through  
  
This is all I've got  
This is all I'd say  
If this were my last day  
  
This is my last song  
It's all I got  
If I bare my soul  
Don't you break my heart  
Won't you sing along  
This is my last song  
It's all I got  
So don't you break my heart  
  
Wrote down these words  
Put them in this song  
I play it for you  
Pray they don't come out wrong  
  
Cause all I've gots my word  
I give it to you  
Now it may not be much  
It's the best that I can do  
  
This is all I've got  
This is all I say  
So please don't walk away  
  
This is my last song  
It's all I got  
If I bare my soul  
Don't you break my heart  
Won't you sing along  
This is my last song  
It's all I got  
So don't you break my heart  
  
If this were my last breath  
Of my last day  
My last chance  
This is what I'd say  
  
I thank you for the laughter  
Sorry for the tears  
Time to say goodbye  
I say goodbye  
After all these years  
  
You shouldn't have broke my heart
