Lately I toss and turn at night  
I hold my pillow very tight  
Wake up to find the covers on the floor'  
I can't go on since you been gone  
Sometimes I don't know what I'm living for  
  
See I don't know what he told you 'bout the better life  
His better cars and how he can treat you better  
But none of that will keep you warm at night  
He'll give you more  
But who could have a better love  
  
Better love  
A better love  
A better, better love  
Who could love you better  
  
There is no reason  
Honey, you should ever worry what I'm doing  
While you're gone I'm being true to you  
My fire burns for your return  
And I'll just dream of you until you do  
  
See I never could replace your love with anyone's  
I do believe it's easier said than done  
No matter whose promises you dream of  
Go search the world  
You couldn't find a better love
