I recall when you once said, "There's truth in both of us  
And all that lies ahead", I take it your tongue  
It just got twisted or maybe it got tired  
Or maybe your memory waved goodbye  
When your so-called friends forget your name  
When your so-called friends, they ain't the same  
When your so-called friends, they've lost thier way  
And they ain't what they was just the other day, hey  
Shoulda listened to what my folks, they had to say  
Just like a dog that's turned on you  
Ain't it funny what the color green will make some people do?  
How I couldn't see through your thin disguise?  
Lord only knows and such a fool was I  
Happy-go-lucky that's what I was and what I hope to be  
But I feel that I've lost that side of me  
When your so-called friends forget your name  
When your so-called friends they ain't the same  
When your so-called friends they've lost thier way  
And they ain't what they was just the other day, hey  
Shoulda listened to what my folks, they had to say  
Just like a dog thats turned on you,  
Ain't it funny what the color green will make some people do?
