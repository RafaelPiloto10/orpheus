Oh this river, oh this river runs  
Can't take my heart away from you  
You are in my soul  
Can't tame this love I feel for you  
Can't escape what is meant to be  
It's endless as the heavens  
It's timeless and it's strong  
It's faithful as an angel  
It's right there right or wrong  
There's no end to this emotion  
It goes on and on  
  
[Chorus]  
This river runs, this river runs so true  
This river runs, this river runs to you  
This river's deep as the ocean  
Runs on blind emotion  
This river runs, oh yeah  
  
You're every beat within my heart  
You are in my blood  
Nothing could keep me from your arms  
Where you are is where I'll always be  
As long as there are mountains  
And stars still fill the sky  
As long as there's forever  
I'm right here by your side  
There's no end to this emotion  
Till the end of time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This river runs, oh so deep within my soul  
And it flows forever  
And for the rest of all time  
Always be there  
  
[Chorus]
