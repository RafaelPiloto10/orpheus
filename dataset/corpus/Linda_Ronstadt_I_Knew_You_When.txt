Yeah yeah ueah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah ye-ah  
I knew you when you were lonely  
I knew you when you were only  
  
A boy all alone without love  
I knew you when  
I knew you when  
You were sad and all alone  
  
You didn't have anyone  
That you could call your own  
I knew you when  
Your heart belonged to only me  
  
But that was many tears ago  
Now your love is just a memory  
Yeah yeah yeah ye-ah  
  
I knew you when you were lonely  
I knew you when you were only  
A boy all alone without love  
  
I knew you when  
I knew you when  
We used to have a lot of fun  
But someone came and offered more  
  
Now I'm the lonely one  
I knew you when  
I was just a scared little girl  
I used to be your only love  
  
Before you came up in the world  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah ye-ah  
  
I knew you when you were lonely  
I knew you when you were only  
A boy all alone without love
