Hm, yeah, yeah  
Hm, mm  
  
I've got trouble, trouble, trouble  
Always knocking at my door  
Yes, I'm a whole lot of trouble, baby  
Just like a kid in a candy store  
Well, I'm nothing but trouble, babe  
Not since the day that I was born  
Well, I'm as good as it gets  
Give you something you won't forget  
If you wanna spell trouble, babe  
Well, send out an S.O.S., yes  
  
'Cause baby's got something  
Something you just can't ignore  
And, yeah, it sure is likely, baby  
You'll keep coming back for more  
  
I've got a wicked taste for trouble  
And I'm never, never, satisfied  
Yeah, I'm a whole lot of trouble, baby  
And my evil ways kill life  
  
Oh, my, my  
  
Well, I've been itching for some trouble, baby  
Every single day that I'm alive  
  
Come on, baby, come on, darling  
Come on sugar, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Baby, whoa, whoa, yeah  
  
Now listen  
Can't you see the way I move?  
Can't you read it in my hips?  
There's a lot that's going on  
In my pocket full of tricks  
Got some secrets up my sleeve  
If you know just what I mean  
Got places you've never been  
Take you out of your skin  
  
Well, I'm trouble, trouble, trouble, baby  
Always knocking at my door  
Yes, I'm a whole lot of lot of trouble, baby  
Oh, since the day that I was born  
  
Yeah, oh yeah
