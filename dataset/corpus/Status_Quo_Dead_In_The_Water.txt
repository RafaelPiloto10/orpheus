She's got to run, she's got to hide  
She's got her head stuck in a sand dune  
She never thinks, she never tries  
She doesn't see that she's gonna pull through  
  
She used to laugh, she used to cry  
She used to play hot as the others  
She used to fool, she used to fight  
She loved a wind-up on a Saturday night  
  
Don't you break down, dead in the water  
Don't you leave town now, though you want to  
Don't you break down, dead in the water  
Dead in the water  
  
He is the one, he has the smile  
Keeping his cool across the dance floor  
He moves around, he moves away  
They move together the rest of the night  
  
He hits the spot, she fits the bill  
He tries it on, maybe she wants to  
He books a room, a takeaway  
Is this the answer to all of their problems?  
  
Don't you break down, dead in the water  
Don't you leave town now, though you want to  
Don't you break down, down in the water  
  
The longest day must end, but that's another time  
Perhaps another life, we may be here again  
The longest day must end, we take it as we find  
But if we never try we may be here again  
  
The longest day must end, we take it as we find  
But if we never try we may be here again  
  
She's waking up, she's in a dream  
The world is gone, left her to wonder  
Did it begin? When will it end?  
She can't believe that it didn't come true  
  
She needs to laugh, she needs to cry  
She needs to play hot as the others  
She used to fool, she used to fight  
She loved a wind-up on a Saturday night  
  
Don't you break down dead in the water  
Don't you leave town now though you want to  
Don't you break down  
Dead in the water  
Dead in the water
