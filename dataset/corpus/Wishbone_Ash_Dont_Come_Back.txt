You walk out your front door  
And say that you found love -  
That's how the best things start,  
That's for sure.  
You ought to know that ain't around anymore.  
That's where you're at,  
I'm at, baby,  
'cause that just doesn't pay.  
Now steal your stolen car - ride it on.  
Oh, you seem to think it's cool  
That they stay out all night -  
I only want to know where you've been,  
So let's get back today.  
So go down, child,  
To a rock'n'roll show, alright,  
You seem to think it's cool  
To stay out all night.
