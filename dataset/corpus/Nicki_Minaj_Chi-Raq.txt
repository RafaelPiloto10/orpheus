(Don't touch)  
  
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Ain't yelling cut when it's shooting time  
Sign up, it's recruiting time  
Big wigs with a suit and tie  
And them big things got two inside  
Fuck worn with these ho niggas  
Don't do coke I don't blow nigga  
I don't tell niggas I show niggas  
And it's never less than like 4 niggas  
4 wings and some french fries  
Hot sauce and ketchup nigga  
He telling and he hiding but real niggas will still catch a nigga  
I cop Raris, don't test drive em  
Home theaters, can't best buy em  
These niggas that I roll with don't let a single thing get by em  
King pins and them drug lords  
Chi-town no gun lords  
Broke bitches that talk shit, now them the bitches I stunt for  
Malcom X daughter came at me  
Looking niggas ain't happy  
Rolled out with some Latin Kings and some eses and them plain khakis  
Smack bitches, no smack cam  
Whole fist, no back hand  
Pop pussy on a hand stand, they sucking dick like a band camp  
Call Web and then call Nitty  
Queens niggas in it's all hoodies  
Kidnapping and then rob niggas  
Call D-rock for a biggie  
Pussy ass lil rap niggas  
I fucked with real trap niggas  
Pop star, icon but I send niggas come snatch niggas  
I'm with ebk, you on ebt  
Got a black nine, call it bet  
School niggas get a ged  
And I tease niggas make em B. E. G  
Got a money fetish, imma fly to Venice  
Got a big house I can play some tennis  
Lil herb, what's good  
I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good  
  
[Hook: Lil Herb]  
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide  
When it's drama time  
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin  
Leave his loved ones all traumatized  
One-fifty I'm really wit' it  
I'll drop his ass and then forget it  
I'm the man round my side of town  
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it  
  
[Verse 2: Lil Herb]  
I'm a young nigga I be getting money  
Take your bitch from you  
And these niggas get no respect  
I'mma stay 100 till I'm 6 under  
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150  
For every nigga that's gon come with me  
I'm on rock block with a new semi and a blue Bentley and do 160  
Smoke a lot a of weed  
Like fuck gimmicks, put a dutch in me  
Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any  
And if any nigga ever try to end me  
I'mma die shooting praying God forgive me  
You too busy hating you can't get no paper, why are ya'll so silly?  
Straight killers I can call so many  
I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki  
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food  
Shorties standing in the streets with tools  
Where I'm from we don't play no games  
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news  
Where I hang we don't say no names  
If you talk to cop I stay away from you  
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations  
You'll be out the station in a day or two  
Dedication and a little patience  
Leave the domination on my way to greatness  
Don't put yourself up in a situation  
Putting my relations in your conversations  
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation  
You get my position nigga better take it  
Know some young bulls from a while back tryna leave the game but they never
made it  
I got old shit, killing your shit  
On a couple tracks I just never played it  
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis  
Pussy nigga you don't want war I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis  
  
[Hook: Lil Herb]

I'll drop his ass and then forget it
