I guess you heard, I guess you know  
In time I'd have told you, but I guess I'm too slow.  
And it's overly romantic but I know that it's real  
I hope you don't you mind if I say what I feel.  
It's like I'm in somebody else's dream,  
This could not be happening to me.  
(Chorus)  
But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen.  
You woke me up from this long and endless sleep.  
I was alone.  
I opened my eyes and you were there.  
Don't be alarmed, no don't be concerned.  
I don't want to change things  
leave them just as they were.  
I mean nothing's really different  
It's me who feel strange.  
I'm always lost for words when someone mentions your name.  
I know I'll get over this for sure  
I'm not the type who dreams there could be more.  
(Chorus)  
But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen.  
You woke me up from this long and endless sleep.  
I was alone.  
I opened my eyes and you were there.  
Can I take your smile home with me,  
or the magic in your hair?  
The rain has stopped, the storm has passed  
Look at all the colors now the sun's here at last.  
I supposed that you'll be leaving but I want you to know  
Part of you stays with me even after you go.  
Like an actor playing someone else's scene  
This could not be happening to me.  
But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen.  
You woke me up from this long and empty sleep.  
I was alone.  
I opened my eyes and no, I'm not alone, I'm not alone.  
I opened my eyes and you were there.
