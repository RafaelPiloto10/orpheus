If I close my eyes,  
Take my time,  
I can almost feel your lips against mine.  
If I close my eyes,  
Drift away,  
I can almost see us back there smiling.  
  
But it's too late, it's too late.  
Baby, I can't reach you.  
It's too late, too late.  
We've drifted out too far.  
I don'e know where love goes  
Or how we might have saved it,  
I only know it's gone.  
It's time that we moved on.  
It's too late.  
  
No use going on.  
No more crying.  
Stand outside ourselves and watch love dying.  
  
'cause it's too late, it's too late.  
Baby, I can't hold you.  
It's too late, too late.  
Now time will take it's toll.  
I don't know where love goes  
Or how we might have saved it.  
I only know it's gone.  
It's time that we moved on.  
It's too late.  
  
In my dreams we turn it back around  
And the love we lost is found,  
And I hand it all to you.  
But I know I'm only dreamin'.  
It's too late. ahhhhh, it's too late.  
  
Should I stay, should I wait,  
Should I stand here by your door?  
I don't know what for.  
You don't live here anymore.  
And it's too late.  
My little baby.  
Yeah-ahhh, it's too late.  
It's too late.
