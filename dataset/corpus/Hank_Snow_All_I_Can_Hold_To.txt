Another cryin' night will soon be over now  
The morning light won't help, I'll still be blue  
'Cause everywhere I turn there's only loneliness  
Memories are all I can hold to  
  
Memories are the moments when we were as one  
Memories you would only hope to find  
Memories, in your loving arms, you'd whisper my name  
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine  
  
All these memories are locked within my heart  
My world was gone the moment I lost you  
If wants could talk, they'd tell you of the tears I've cried  
But memories are all I can hold to  
  
Memories are the moments when we were as one  
Memories you would only hope to find  
Memories, in your loving arms, you'd whisper my name  
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine  
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine
