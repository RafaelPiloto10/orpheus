Listen to me...  
I've got a warning for you  
You've got to learn to take more care  
'Cause if you swim in dirty water  
  
Be careful how you dry your hair  
In a room within a room  
In a hole within a hole  
You've got to learn to share your secrets  
Or you'll lose your soul  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
It's so hard to hold back  
When the fire is in your eyes  
A silver dollar in my pocket  
I don't like surprises  
  
I've got your souvenir  
Is that the price I've got to pay?  
It ain't been that long  
Since the last charade  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
I know you're guilty  
But I'm carrying the blame  
I took out much more than I put in  
And I felt the pain  
In a dirty little room  
With nowhere left to hide  
You told the truth with your eyes  
But you lied inside  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...
