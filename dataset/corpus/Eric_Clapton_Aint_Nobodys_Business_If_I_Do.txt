There ain't nothing I can do, or nothing I can say,  
Some folks will criticize me.  
So I'm gonna do just what I want to anyway,  
And don't care if you all despise me.  
  
If I should take a notion  
To jump into the ocean,  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
If I go to church on Sunday  
And I shimmy down on Monday,  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
And if my friend ain't got no money  
And I say, "All right, take all of mine honey,"  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
If I lend her my last nickel  
And it leaves me in a pickle,  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
I would rather my gal would hit me  
Than to haul right up and quit me.  
It ain't nobody's business if I do.  
  
I know that she won't call no copper  
If she gets beat up by her poppa.  
It ain't nobody's business if I do, Lord no.  
Well, it ain't nobody's business if I do.
