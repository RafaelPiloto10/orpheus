Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darling  
Darling that it won't be long before it's crying time  
  
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder  
And the tears are only rain to make love grow  
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger  
Baby, if I live to be a hundred years old  
  
Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darling  
Darling that it won't be long before it's crying time  
  
Now you say you've found someone you love better  
That's the way it's happened every time before  
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  
Crying time will start when you walk out the door  
  
Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darling  
Darling that it won't be long before it's crying time  
  
No, it won't be long before it's crying time...
