I'm movin' too fast, the pace of things has got to change  
I never have time to think of words I want to say  
I look around me, I don't know who really knows  
What does it matter anyway?  
  
Sometimes I feel like I've got a heart made out of stone  
And somedays I feel so alone  
When nobody sees what's going on anymore  
If I could just know that someone's there  
  
One from the heart that's all it takes  
One to hold you, one who knows you  
One to one together  
One from the heart, one for each day  
One to lean on, one to keep on  
  
Keep on getting stronger the more I see your face  
It's never too late to get to where I want to go  
It's never too late to get to love someone  
All that I need is to be more than yesterday  
  
And all I can give along the way  
One from the heart that's all it takes  
One to hold you, one who knows you  
One to one together  
One from the heart, one for each day  
One to lean on, one to keep on  
  
The words you will remember  
The words you'll hear me say  
It's all about love  
It's all about give and take
