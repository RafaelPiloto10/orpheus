I don't have to look any further  
Like I always used to do  
No searching for some other unknown mystic lover  
Now I've found the perfect friend in you  
There are those I've known for a lifetime  
Others, they're brand new  
They come through lucky chance,  
Some from brief romances  
They'd all love to have a friend like you  
But you took me by surprise  
I wasn't ready for you  
Something flashed before my eyes  
Suddenly I adored you, adored you  
I was never terminal lonely  
From my sheltered point of view  
My life was kind of simple, I hadn't built a temple  
Dedicated to a friend like you  
On the way from cradle to tombstone  
There may be a lucky few  
Who sail through life untroubled,  
Floating on the bubbles  
In the wake of special friends like you  
When you took me by surprise  
I couldn't help but allow  
One day vague, the next day wise  
To love you beyond tomorrow, tomorrow  
You took me by surprise  
I wasn't thinking of you  
Suddenly realized  
How much I really loved you, I love you  
Now I don't need to look any further  
Like I always used to do  
No searching for some unknown mystic lover  
Now I've found the perfect friend in you  
Now I've found the perfect friend in you  
Oh my perfect friend how I love you
