Pieces of a hole,  
Unrequited, not renowned.  
Never sought and never found.  
Through blood,  
Through soul.  
  
Now unfamiliar  
Feelings of good being,  
Are light that's not worth seeing.  
Through blood,  
Through soul.  
  
Restless and distorted  
Thoughts that underscore my night,  
Being wrong and seeing right.  
Through blood,  
Through soul.  
  
Heart beyond repair,  
All the edges worn and frayed  
Magnifying love betrayed.  
Through blood,  
Through soul.
