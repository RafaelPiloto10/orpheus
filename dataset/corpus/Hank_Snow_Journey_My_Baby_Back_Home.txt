Pale moon start on your journey I'm pleading to you.  
Somewhere you'll find a broken heart yearning too.  
  
Bright stars were shining but clouds drifted by  
Just to darken a true love affair,  
And I know I'm to blame for the showers that fell,  
They meant more than my old pal could bear.  
I can't see what happened why I went astray  
But I promise I'll never more roam.  
  
So pale moon I've made you promise,  
so Journey My Baby Back Home.  
  
Pale moon start on your journey I'm pleading to you.  
Somewhere you'll find a broken heart yearning too.  
  
They say that a new day is born when the sun  
Climbs the stairs to the heaven so blue.  
But to me only one day is born ev'ry year  
Since I've cheated and been so un true.  
I'm weary, I'm heart-sick, I've worried I've cried,  
Down your long silver trail starts to roam.  
  
So pale moon I've made you promise,  
so Journey My Baby Back Home.
