I want to be loved, I want to be loved  
I want to be loved, I need to be loved  
I want to be loved with inspiration  
I want to be loved starting tonight  
Instead of merely holding conversation  
Oh, hold me tight  
I want to be loved, I crave affection  
Those kisses of your's I gladly share  
I want your eyes to shine in my direction  
Oh, make me care  
I want a can't of romance  
That should be strong and equally as tender  
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning  
The word surrender, surrender, come on, surrender  
I want to be thrilled by only you, dear  
I want to be thrilled by your caress  
I want to find each dream of mine come true, dear  
I want to be loved  
I want the can't of romance  
That should be strong and equally as tender  
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning  
Come on, come on, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender  
I want to be thrilled by only you, dear  
I want to be thrilled by your caress  
I want to find each dream of mine come true, dear  
Oh, I want to be loved, oh, I want to be loved  
I want to be loved, oh, I want to be loved, I need to be loved
