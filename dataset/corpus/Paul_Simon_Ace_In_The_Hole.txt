Some people say Jesus that's the ace in the hole  
But I never met the man so I don't really know  
Maybe some Christmas if I'm sick and alone  
He will look up my number  
Call me on the phone and say  
Hey, boy, where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole  
  
Two hundred dollars, that's my ace in the hole  
When I'm down, dirty and desperate  
That's my emergency bank roll (I got)  
Two hundred dollars, that's the price on the street  
If you want to get some quality  
That's the price you got to meet (and the man says)  
Hey, Junior, where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole  
(Talk about ace in the hole)  
  
Once I was crazy and my ace in the hole  
Was that I knew that I was crazy  
So I never lost my self-control  
I just walk in the middle of the road and  
I sleep in the middle of the bed  
I stop in the middle of a sentence  
And the voice in the middle of my head said  
Hey, Junior, where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole (oh yeah)  
  
Ace in the hole  
Lean on me  
Don't you know me  
I'm your guarantee  
  
Riding on this rolling bus  
Beneath a stony sky  
With a slow moon rising  
And the smokestacks drifting by  
In the hour when the heart is weak  
And the memory is strong  
When time has stopped  
And the bus just rolls along  
Roll on, roll on  
Roll on, roll on  
Roll on, roll on  
  
Some people say music that's their ace in the hole  
Just your ordinary rhythm and blues  
Your basic rock and roll  
  
You can sit on the top of the beat  
You can lean on the side of the beat  
You can hang from the bottom of the beat  
But you got to admit that the music is sweet  
  
Where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole (oh yeah)  
  
Ace in the hole  
Lean on me  
Don't you know me  
I'm your guarantee
