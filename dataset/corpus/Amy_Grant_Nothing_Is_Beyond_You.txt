Where could I go, where could I run  
Even if I found the strength to fly  
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn  
And crashed through the corner of the sky  
If I sailed past the edge of the sea  
Even if I made my bed in Hell  
Still there You would find me  
'Cause nothing is beyond You  
You stand beyond the reach  
Of our vain imaginations  
Our misguided piety  
The heavens stretch to hold You  
And deep cries out to deep  
Singing that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
Time cannot contain You  
You fill eternity  
Sin can never stain You  
Death has lost its sting  
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me  
Except to say that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
If I should shrink back from the light  
So I can sink into the dark  
If I take cover and I close my eyes  
Even then You would see my heart  
And You'd cut through all my pain and rage  
The darkness is not dark to You  
And night's as bright as day  
Nothing is beyond You  
You stand beyond the reach  
Of our vain imaginations  
Our misguided piety  
The heavens stretch to hold You  
And deep cries out to deep  
Singing that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
And time cannot contain You  
You fill eternity  
Sin can never stain You  
And death has lost its sting  
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me  
Except to say that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You
