I'd be foolin' myself, thinkin' I've got it made  
I just can't assume true love won't fade  
I'll keep on listenin' to her, say I'm glad that I found her  
Keep on showin' her how my world turns around her  
'Cause  
  
On any given night  
She could walk away  
She won't be mine for the takin'  
And that's the price that I'd pay  
'Cause love's ever-changin'  
And in the blink of an eye  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night  
  
She's the sensitive kind, she needs a connection  
And cannot be so blind to lose my direction  
I'll keep on walkin' that mile, show her how far I'll go  
Keep on letting her hear all she needs to know  
  
On any given night  
She could walk away  
She won't be mine for the takin'  
And that's the price that I'd pay  
'Cause love's ever-changin'  
And in the blink of an eye  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night  
  
Teardrops could fall  
And I could lose it all  
On any given night
