Love, love, where can you be?  
Are you out there looking for me?  
Love, love, where can you be?  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeat's accelerating  
  
Will you come along the still?  
From the river, o'er the hill?  
Love, love, where can you be?  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
  
Will you come on a Saturday night?  
Maybe then the time will be right  
Love, love, where can you be?  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeat's accelerating  
  
When you steal into my room  
What earthly body will you assume?  
Love, love where can you be?  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeat's accelerating  
  
Will you come on a Saturday night?  
Maybe then the time will be right  
Love, love, where can you be?  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeat's accelerating  
  
Love, love, where can you be?  
Are you out there looking for me?  
Love, love, where can you be?  
Are you out there looking for me?  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeat's accelerating  
Love, I am waiting  
Heartbeat's accelerating
