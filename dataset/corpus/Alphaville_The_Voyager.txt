now, she's touched the earth - you feel her love  
pouring down like an endless rain  
of colours on your skin  
she descends out of the blue,  
a breathless victor of time  
after more than a million light-years preparing her comeback  
and she's rushing in  
from the outside  
on the crest of the seventh wave  
she's the crown of creation  
creating you  
the voyager!  
is here to stay  
the voyager!  
she's calling all stars  
the voyager!  
she's riding a rainbow  
the voyager!  
gives you the kiss of life  
watch out, you can't ignore what's going on  
when your visions are drying out  
like the oceans from the underworld  
don't you know!  
before you turn to stone  
you better head out for a royal trip  
to the ivory city-side  
and she's rushing in  
from the outside  
on the crest of the seventh wave  
she's the crown of creation  
creating you  
the voyager!  
is here to stay...
