Hey, this is the story of a young'n dreamin  
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin'  
Big city on his own sh-t  
But every now and then a n-gga get home sick  
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling em, be warned  
A lot of sh-t been changing the time you've been gone  
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner  
And went and got baby's the day they got a diploma  
Damn, there'll be some n-ggas missing when you fly back  
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq  
Old buddy that we hoop with, with a bad chick and a fly lac  
Anda gold chain, caught him on a merc, tryna buy crack  
Damn homie, sh-t, in high school you was the man homie  
F-ck happened to you,  
Used to beat n-ggas down at the buses after school  
Now you looking like a muthaf-cking fool  
  
[Chorus]  
Say I'll be home for the holidays  
So when you see me, better holla at me  
I gotta get up put this city 'fore it try to trap me  
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay  
But I'll be home for the holidays  
And to those that I used to know  
From way before, keep your head up  
Come lets get this bread up  
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay  
But I'm coming hme for the holidays  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
This is a story bout some puppy love  
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love  
Although now I'm on my grown sh-t  
She mad as hell, a n-gga still get home sick  
I was fresh up off a scholarship  
Dressed like a black man in college sh-t  
Got a little knowledge now I'm following the politics  
But I still gotta holla at my old chick  
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it's me  
She said "we aint homies no more"  
You go to college and you act like you don't know me no more  
Girl, we got history semester seem so long  
The last time I seen ya baby you aint have no clothes on  
So if history repeats itself  
When I get home, girl it's on, you aint gone need ya belt  
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind  
Just don't give it up in the meantime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 3]  
Man I reminisce on them school days  
I know you know them act a fool days  
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed  
That trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly  
But a n-gga had a shot you'd have thought that's where the bulls play  
Wished this freshman could used a little Kool-aid  
Crushing on them upper clansmen but it was tool late  
Buddy she was dating he had the freshest shoes  
But the n-gga was graduated but he never made two a's  
Hey if you're listening we got in to school  
But who will pay our tuition man  
These n-ggas crazy  
One year cost about the same as a Mercedes (benz)  
Four years cost white crib and a baby  
Ay maybe this aint for me  
If only I could be Lebron with the strength to leave  
The worst part about growing up man the shit just aint for free  
Maybe I can be someone people pay to see  
And maybe I should move up outta here to the place to be  
To get from a to z ay what you think I'm crazy  
If I told you one day that Imma sign with jay-z  
And will I make it I guess we gotta wait and see  
[Chorus]
