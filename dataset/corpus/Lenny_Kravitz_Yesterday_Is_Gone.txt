I'm sorry your situation  
Has let you down  
I know that things did not go as planned  
'cause in this time you're feeling alone and sad  
This is what you must understand  
  
There is a way  
Yesterday is gone  
It's a new day  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
My dear kay  
  
You can't get nowhere  
Staying at home and crying  
You can't go on living in the past  
The one thing constant is that there is always change  
  
There is a way  
Yesterday is gone  
It's a new day  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
My dear kay
