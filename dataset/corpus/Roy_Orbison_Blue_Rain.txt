Silently I hear the sound of the blue rain come down  
It's late tonight and I just saw you walking by  
Without one word of hello or goodbye  
Just one look at you with someone new and then I knew  
I'll see you around in the blue, blue rain  
I didn't know a moment ago it could rain this way  
You used to run straight to my arms, now you turn away  
Oh, I never knew such a feeling of blue  
Blue rain, blue rain, blue rain  
Why did you make me love you then break my heart in two  
Then leave me alone here in the rain to cry for you  
Tomorrow will be filled with the lonely  
Blue rain, blue rain  
I'll remember you all alone walking on  
And crying, losing you in the blue, blue rain
