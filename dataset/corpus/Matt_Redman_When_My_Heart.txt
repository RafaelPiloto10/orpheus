When my heart runs dry and there's no song to sing  
No holy melody, no words of love within  
I recall the height from which this fragile heart has slipped  
  
And I'll remember You, I will turn back and do  
The things I used to do for the love of You  
Lord, I'll remember You, I will turn back and do  
The things I used to do for the love of You  
  
You are my soul's desire, You are the hope within  
You bring my heart to life, You make my spirit sing  
I recall the height from which this fragile heart has slipped
