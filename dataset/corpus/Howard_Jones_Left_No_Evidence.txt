Out of time and no one noticed  
Rubbing up a different way  
Out of step but still in focus things to say  
Kicking out the social pressure  
Holding on to what you feel  
Being you was never easy  
Sliding off the the ferris wheel  
Small was beautiful to you  
Things are on a micro scale  
Turned your back on power and glory  
Yours was such a personal tale  
Dancing to a different step now  
Choose you're beats along the way  
Nothing arrives at you're house packaged  
No glittery wrap to throw away  
Cutting different shapes and sizes  
Bringing tomorrow into today  
No one noticed you as you snuck in the sideline and talked in a quiet way  
No bullshit no theatrics no pretence and left no evidence  
You left no evidence  
You left no evidence
