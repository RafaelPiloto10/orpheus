I heard my Saviour calling me  
He saved my soul, He set me free  
I know He'll never let me fall  
Praise out, I heard my Saviour call  
I was a sinner, traveling on a weary road  
So far from home  
But now sweet heaven is my all  
Praise out, I heard my Saviour call  
I heard my Saviour calling me  
He saved my soul, He set me free  
I know He'll never let me fall  
Praise out, I heard my Saviour call  
I'm on my way to better land  
And there I'll join that heavenly band  
All through the ages I will sing  
Hosanna is my heavenly King  
I heard my Saviour calling me  
He saved my soul, He set me free  
I know He'll never let me fall  
Praise out, I heard my Saviour call
