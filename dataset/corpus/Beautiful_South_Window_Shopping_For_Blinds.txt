One day I'm loaded, next day I'm broke  
Spent all my money on whisky and coke  
Riding high 'till the rock hit the spoke  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
Spent all my money on a sunbed tan  
Spoke the best that a young girl can  
Ended up with a blind drunk man  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
It's like the heartbreak hotel,  
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay  
The doors are shut on us,  
The neon light fading to grey  
  
They say I drink too much, to me, well that's just profound  
How do you know you can't swim, until you have drowned?  
  
Well there's always a drop in the bottle lady  
Always a sip of the wine  
The glass doesn't seem quite so empty  
When window shopping for blinds  
  
It's like gatecrashing a field, that's not true,  
They've a harvest they yield  
Save your tears for your evening meal,  
When you're window shopping for blinds  
  
One day you're sober, next day you're not  
One day remembered, the next day forgot  
Spent all my money on cocaine and pot  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
Covered in bruises from head to toe  
No-one to speak to, and nowhere to go  
A map of nowhere, and nowhere I know  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
It's like the heartbreak hotel,  
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay  
The doors are shut on us,  
The neon light fading to grey  
  
They say I drink too much, to me, well that's just profound  
How do you know you can't swim, until you have drowned?  
  
Well there's always a drop in the bottle lady  
Always a sip of the wine  
The glass doesn't seem quite so empty  
When window shopping for blinds  
  
But what if my husband should come?  
Well tell me what have you done?  
I've cherished my vodka, I've cherished my rum  
Don't mind us, we're just licking our wounds in the sun  
  
It's like writing 'I love you' in snow  
You know when you write it the message will go  
I want a message my lover will find  
Don't mind us, we're just window shopping for blinds
