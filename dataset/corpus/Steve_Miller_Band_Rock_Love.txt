Do do do do doot  
Do do do do doot  
Do do do do doot  
You got to have rock love  
To weather the storm  
It's got to be rock love  
To help you carry on  
When the winds of temptation move your soul  
Stay with me now, don't you let it go  
I told you so  
Rock love will weather the storm  
You got to have rock love to hear your song  
It's got to be rock love, yeah  
To make you strong  
When everybody puts you down  
The rock of love will be around  
It's solid ground  
Rock love will weather the storm  
Rock love, yeah, will help you carry on  
Sweet Jesus will see you through  
Your trials, tribulations too  
No matter how far you go  
Still I will love you so  
I told you so  
Rock love will weather the storm  
Yeah
