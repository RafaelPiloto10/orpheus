Tell me what to do, ooh, about you  
I already know,  
I can see it in your eyes when you's tellin' the truth  
'Cause it's been a long time comin'  
So where you runnin' to?  
Tell me what to do, oohh, about you  
  
You've got your way of speaking  
Even the air you're breathin'  
You could be anything  
But you don't know what to believe in  
You got the world before you  
If I could only show you  
That you don't know what to do  
  
Tell me what to do, ooh, about you  
Somethin' on your mind,  
Baby all of the time, you can ming on a room  
This day has been a long time comin'  
I say it's nothing new  
So tell me what to do, ooh, about you  
  
You've got your way of speaking  
Even the air you're breathin'  
You could be anything  
But you don't know what to believe in  
You got the world before you  
If I could only show you  
That you don't know what to do  
  
You think about it  
Can you ever change, finish what you've started  
Make me wanna stay, tied up conversation  
Show me something real, find out what your part is  
Play it how you feel  
  
Tell me what to do, ooh, about you  
Is there any way, anything I can say, won't break us in two  
'Cause it's been a long time comin'  
I can't stop lovin' you, yeah  
Tell me what to do, ooh, about you  
  
You've got your way of speaking  
Even the air you're breathin'  
You could be anything  
But you don't know what to believe in  
You got the world before you  
If I could only show you  
That you don't know what to do  
  
(You've got your way of speaking)  
(Even the air you're breathin')  
You could be anything  
But you don't know what to believe in  
(You got the world before you) World before you  
(If I could only show you) Show you  
That you don't know what to do
