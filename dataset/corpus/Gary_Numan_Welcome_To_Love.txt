I could talk of memories  
I could talk of miracles  
I can't talk of anything but you  
I remember everything  
Even how you laughed at me  
I remember every word you said  
'Love is a game  
Love is a game that we play  
Love is a game  
Love is a game and you lose  
Welcome to Love'  
Now you're waiting for someone  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
And I wonder who you're waiting for  
There is nothing I can say  
There are no good words for this  
There is nothing more that I can do  
'Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish in the dark  
Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish and blind  
Welcome to Love'
