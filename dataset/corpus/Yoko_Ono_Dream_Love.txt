Dream love, dream universe, dream come true.  
Dream power, dream energy, dream eternity.  
  
In dream you can fly forever  
And never miss a turn,  
In dream you can spread your wings  
And know where to turn.  
  
Dream sunrise, dream sunset, dream together.  
Dream you, dream me, dream each other.  
  
In dream the world is clear forever  
And there's no return.  
In dream you can love forever  
And there's no return.  
  
Dream power,  
Dream reality,  
Dream together. (there's no return)  
  
In dream you can fly forever  
And never miss a turn,  
In dream you can spread your wings  
And know where to turn.  
  
Dream, dream, dream.
