I was born a stubborn soul  
Ain't afraid of the great unknown  
Or a winding road that's all uphill  
This is just a stumbling block  
Intimidating wall of rock  
If you think this broken heart will break my will  
  
I'm gonna take that mountain  
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down  
There ain't no way around it  
Gonna leave it level with the ground  
I ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it  
I'm gonna take that mountain  
  
It's overwhelming looking up  
Knowing it's the challenge of  
Me against this heartache to survive  
I may slip and I may fall  
But even if I have to crawl  
I'll break through to the healing side  
  
I'm gonna take that mountain  
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down  
There ain't no way around it  
Gonna leave it level with the ground  
I ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it  
I'm gonna take that mountain
