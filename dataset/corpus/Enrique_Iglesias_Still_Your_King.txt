I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king  
  
Baby  
Yeah I might be a little faded  
And you might just think that I'm just hating  
But it seem to me that you downgraded  
I'm just saying  
  
Cause I still remember those craty nights  
Making love under laser lights  
Rolling that body all over mine  
Now I see you with him  
You must be joking right  
  
  
I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king  
  
Lately  
I been thinkin about how we got crazy  
I hate to be the one to say this  
But I think your boyfriends overrated  
I'm just saying  
  
Cause I still remember those craty nights  
Making love under laser lights  
Rolling that body all over mine  
Now I see you with him  
You must be joking right  
  
I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king  
  
I'm on one  
Been drinking  
Wanna show you what I been thinking  
Maybe we should get to leaving  
Cause that bed is still my kingdom  
And that body's my castle  
Hate to be the one top be the asshole  
But your boyfriend need to go home  
Cause the king's back  
Give me my throne  
  
Cause I still remember those craty nights  
Making love under laser lights  
Rolling that body all over mine  
Now I see you with him  
You must be joking right  
  
I wanna be that guy inside your wildest dreams  
So when you close your eyes your staring back at me  
And as the tears fall burning like gasoline  
I might be all out aces but baby  
I'm still your king
