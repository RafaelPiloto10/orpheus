What am I supposed to do with this heart  
How do I take it off, if the love ain't on, it's like a work of art  
In love we all will fall but, we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right, to be lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
How was I to know that my love was delusional  
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul  
In love we all will fall but, we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right, to be lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right  
All my fears are gone tonight  
I'm lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
Lost in paradise  
Yeah, lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise
