Hit 'em boys!  
Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again  
You get nothing for nothing: expect it when  
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel  
It's easy to go along with the crowd,  
And find later on that your say ain't allowed  
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing  
So I'm heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at all  
I'm gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
A chance before I fall!  
You can hang in a left or hang in a right  
The choice it is yours to do as you might  
The road is open wide to place your bidding  
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go  
If you get it wrong, at least you can know  
There's miles and miles to put it back together!  
And I'm heading out to the highway  
I got nothing to lose at all  
I'm gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
A chance before I fall!  
On the highway!  
On the highway!  
Making a curve or taking the strain  
On the decline, or out on the wain  
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later  
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend.  
Back on your feet to take the next bend!  
You weather every storm that's coming atcha!  
And I'm heading out to the highway  
I got nothin' to lose at all  
I'm gonna do it my way  
Take a chance before I fall  
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway,  
I got nothing to lose at all.I got nothing to lose at all!
