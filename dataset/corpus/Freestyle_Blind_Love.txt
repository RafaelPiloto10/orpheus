Baby give me a chance  
May I have this dance  
Don't make it the last  
Make it the first  
Pratically loved, always hated  
By jealous ones  
Just understand where I'm comin' from  
  
I was the one chosen  
I got my own destiny  
I need a route to find my life  
I just hope my life is 4 you  
I just need you next to me  
Or atleast for now 'til then listen  
  
Chorus: 2x  
When you look into my eyes  
Do you see my pain  
Our love is blind  
Still it can't see through anything  
  
I can't rap I can't think  
I'm a ghost in your mind  
I had a little 2 much 2 drink  
When I'm not with you  
I'm with another, what  
You thought I was goin' 2  
Be stuck on you  
I was but you let go  
Now we back together  
And It just isn't the same  
This love has changed  
  
Chorus: 2x  
When you look in my eyes  
Do you see my pain  
Our love is blind  
Still can't see through anything
