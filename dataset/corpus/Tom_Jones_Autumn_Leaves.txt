The falling leaves pass by my window  
The autumn leaves of red and gold  
I see your lips your summer kisses  
The sunburned hands I used to know  
Um since you went away  
The days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
Oh, but I'll miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall  
Oh I said I miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall
