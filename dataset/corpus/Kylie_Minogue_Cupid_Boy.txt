If only you knew  
I shimmer for you  
Oh, the very feel of it  
I'm hooked on your line  
Under your spell  
Your love is king  
  
You color me gold  
And now that you know  
Baby, you've got all of me  
I'm hooked on your line  
You're under my skin  
I need your touch  
  
So why don't you thrill me  
Like you did before?  
Why don't you give me  
A little bit more?  
Why don't you call me  
Start hittin' me up, hittin' me up, hittin' me up?  
  
Give me your love  
You've got it all sown up  
And your beat's so very  
I could never get enough  
You've got the good stuff, good stuff  
  
[Chorus]  
Cupid boy, when we touch  
I'm in heaven in your arms  
Fire--the way you love  
Feels like Heaven in your arms  
Sky rocket to Mars  
Straight through to your heart  
Every time we touch  
I'm shooting the stars  
Cupid boy, when we touch  
I'm in Heaven  
  
I'm losing my grip  
Letting it slip  
Baby, I want all of you  
You're reeling me in  
Every time I give in  
I'm addicted  
  
So why don't you thrill me  
Like you did before?  
Why don't you give me  
A little bit more?  
Why don't you call me  
Start hittin' me up, hittin' me up, hittin' me up?  
  
Give me your love  
You got it all sown up  
And your beats so very  
I could never get enough, baby  
You got the good stuff, good stuff  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
  
I could never get enough  
You've got the good stuff, good stuff  
  
[Chorus]
