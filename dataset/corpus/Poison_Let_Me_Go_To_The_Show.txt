Mama, please let me go to the show  
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll  
No way, son, you can't go out tonight  
So I got real upset, put up the biggest fight  
  
[Chorus]  
Mama, let me go to the show  
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll  
Mama, let me go out tonight  
Mama, please, before I lose my mind  
  
Out the window  
Shimmy down the tree  
I take a look around  
make sure no one's watching me  
I steal the keys and take  
my old man's Chevrolet  
I can hear my Mama scream  
from ten miles away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rock and roll rodeo  
Rock and roll rodeo  
  
[Chorus]
