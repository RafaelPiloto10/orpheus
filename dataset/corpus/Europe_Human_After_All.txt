Live, baby life is loud  
We'll make it through the filth and the glory  
Give, more of what you've got  
Funk it up and tell your story  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
We're human after all  
  
Time, there's no remedy  
Just hold our broken hearts together  
Your touch, all that chemistry  
Now I'm lost, unlikely defender  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
We're human after all  
  
It's alright, when the day is done  
It's alright, there's something better  
It's alright, when the morning comes  
It's alright, there's nothing better  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
We're human after all
