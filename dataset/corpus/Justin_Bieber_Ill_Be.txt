Verse 1:  
The strands in your eyes  
They color them wonderful  
Stop me was stealing my breath  
The emeralds from mountains  
The thrust toward the sky  
Never revealing their depth  
Tell me  
That we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartbreak  
That hang from above  
  
Chorus:  
And i'll be you're crying shoulder  
I'll be love suicide  
And i'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
(x2)  
  
Verse 2:  
I've dropped out  
I've bearned up  
I've fought my way back from the dead  
I've turned in  
I've turned on  
I've saw all of the things I've said  
  
Repeat Chorus
