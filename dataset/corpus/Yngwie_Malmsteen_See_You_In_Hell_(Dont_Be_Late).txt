Can't bow for a rule  
Cause I'm nobody's fool  
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win  
Sometimes I might be rude  
Acting in my mood  
I'm trying to be straight  
Cause I don't want to be late  
There's nothing you can say to make  
Me feel worse than I do (how are you)  
You can't buy my freedom  
Keep me locked in your cell  
Sad how we waste our energy  
When all our days are few (makes me blue)  
We're two of a kind me and you  
I guess that I'll see you in hell  
Who is my friend  
Who will remain  
Seems like I always stand alone in the end  
Nobody lasts until the end  
There's nothing you can say to make  
Me feel worse than I do (how are you)  
You can't buy my freedom  
Keep me locked in your cell  
Sad how we waste our energy  
When all our days are few (makes me blue)  
You can't buy my life and freedom  
It's more than just buy and sell  
You can't keep me locked in your cell  
I guess that I'll see you in hell  
See you in hell
