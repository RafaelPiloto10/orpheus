Did we miss the moon?  
I'd lie in your arms if I could  
Such a common pain  
Repeats itself again and again  
  
Flowers grow in the springtime and leaves fall from the trees  
I've been GONE for so long, you just threw away the keys  
I understand it, but I don't want it  
  
I know it so well, you tripped me and I laughed when you fell  
This isn't how it should be  
I've let you drift so far, from me  
  
But please hold onto the memories  
Before we really crash and burn  
We've got ourselves so wrapped up that we've forgotten how to learn  
I understand it, but I don't want it
