Lately you've been showin' all the signs  
Of a woman with someone else on her mind  
It's not your fault  
Some nights I've left you alone  
And if you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home  
  
Chorus:  
If you're thinking you want a stranger  
I'll soon be there  
You're gonna see a change in me  
This time I swear  
No more late nights  
Comin' in at daylight  
And no more doin' you wrong  
And if you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home  
  
Bought you a silk gown and perfume today  
Picked up some roses and champagne on the way  
Oh I called to ask you to put some soft music on  
Cause if you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home  
  
Chorus  
  
If you're thinking you want a stranger  
There's one coming home
