For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
I'd give you everything and more, and that's for sure  
For your love  
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door  
For your love  
  
To thrill you with delight  
I'll give you diamonds bright  
Double dates that will excite  
To make you dream of me at night  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
For your love, for your love  
I would give the stars above  
For your love, for your love  
I would give you all I could  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
I'd give the moon if it were mine to give  
For your love  
I'd give the stars and the sun 'fore I live  
For your love  
  
To thrill you with delight  
I'll give you diamonds bright  
Double dates that will excite  
To make you dream of me at night  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love
