Melinda was mine  
'Til the time  
That I found her  
Holding Jim  
Loving him  
  
Then Sue came along  
Loved me strong  
That's what I thought  
Me and Sue  
But that died too  
  
Don't know that I will  
But until I can find me  
A girl who'll stay  
And won't play games behind me  
I'll be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man  
  
I've had it to here  
Bein' where  
Love's a small world  
Part-time thing  
Paper ring  
  
I know it's been done  
Having' one  
Girl who'll love me  
Right or wrong  
Weak or strong  
  
Don't know that I will  
But until I can find me  
The girl who'll stay  
And won't play games behind me  
I'll be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man
