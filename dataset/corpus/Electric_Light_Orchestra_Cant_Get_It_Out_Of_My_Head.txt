Midnight, on the water  
I saw the ocean's daughter  
Walking on a wave she came  
Staring as she called my name  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
No, I can't get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
'Cause I can't get it out of my head  
  
Breakdown on the shoreline  
Can't move, it's an ebbtide  
Morning, don't get here tonight  
Searching for her silver light  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
No, I can't get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
'Cause I can't get it out of my head  
  
Bank job in the city  
Robin Hood and William Tell  
And Ivanhoe and Lancelot  
They don't envy me  
Sitting 'til the sun goes down  
In dreams the world keeps going 'round and 'round  
  
And I can't get it out of my head  
No, I can't get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
'Cause I can't get it out of my head
