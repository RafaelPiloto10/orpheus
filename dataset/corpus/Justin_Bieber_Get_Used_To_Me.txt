[Verse 1]  
Subjected to my system  
Reflecting on the days  
When we used to be just friends  
Protected both our interest  
Our trust was in a bank  
That's where our hearts were safe  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And then we got closer  
Separated from my ex  
Til we got closure  
Oh, in every visit  
Feelings got stronger  
Now this is out our hands  
Our love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I'm a April shower you  
Forever if I May  
'Til your flowers bloom in June  
Make sure that our fireworks  
Be your 4th of July  
For life  
As long as you stand right by my side  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Keep growing closer  
Throughout October  
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve  
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve  
Then we'll be celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Bridge]  
I ain't going nowhere  
I ain't going nowhere, oh no  
I ain't going nowhere  
I ain't going nowhere, oh no  
Put your faith in me  
I'll be all you need, I swear  
Yeah yeah  
I'm gonna be right here, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Vamp]  
I know you getting used to it  
I know you getting used to it  
(Get used to it)  
I know you getting used to it  
I know you getting used to it  
(Oh get used to it)
