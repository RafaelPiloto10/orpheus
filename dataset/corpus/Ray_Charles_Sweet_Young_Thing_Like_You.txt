Sweet (sweet) young thing  
Like you (like you, baby)  
You've gone and made me  
Lose my cool  
  
Sweet (sweet) young thing  
Like you (like you, baby)  
You're all I need  
To see me through  
  
I said I'd never love again  
I've always been on the losing end  
  
When you touched my hand  
I knew right there and then  
I loved you, I loved you, baby  
I love you

Sweet (sweet) young thing  
Like you (like you, baby)  
Yeah, babe, you're all I need  
To see me through  
  
My whole life was upside down  
Misery and heartbreak  
Followed me around  
  
Things that used to make me sad  
Have got a brand new sound  
I love you, I love you, baby  
I love you
