For ev'ry rose that withers and dies  
Another blooms in it's stead.  
A new love waits to open its eyes  
After the old love is dead.  
  
That sounds alright in a careless rhyme  
But there's seldom a second time  
  
Better luck next time  
That could never be  
Because there ain't gonna be no next time  
For me, no sirree  
  
Made up my mind  
To make another start  
I've made my mind up but I can't make up  
My heart  
  
I'd like a new lucky day  
That would be nice  
But this comes just once in a lifetime  
Not twice  
  
So don't say better luck next time  
That can never be  
Because there ain't gonna be no next time  
For me.
