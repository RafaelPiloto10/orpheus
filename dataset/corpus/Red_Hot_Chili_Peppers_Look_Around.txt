Stiff club, its my nature,  
Custom love is the nomenclature  
Turn down mass confusion  
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'  
Double my fun, double my vision  
Long hard look at my last decision  
Hustle here, hustle there  
Hustle me bitch and you best beware  
  
It's emotional and I told you so  
But you had to know so I told you  
Soft walk to horizon  
One big crash that no one dies in  
This for the folks in Pay-it-ville  
It'll come true if you say it will  
  
Look around, look around, look around  
All around, all around, all around  
Look around, look around, look around  
All around, all around, all around  
  
It's emotional and I told you so  
But you had to know so I told you  
Please don't look right through me  
Hurts my heart when you do that to me  
Street lights out my window  
City May breeze gonna stroke my skin though  
Dropped a lot of words on an old brick wall,  
Rob a lot of banks got a pedigree scrawl  
Put my peg into your square  
Run around like we just don't care  
  
Look around, look around, look around  
All around, all around, all around  
Look around, look around, look around  
All around, oh yeah  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna getcha  
Move it ah gotta get ya, gonna getcha  
  
Look around, look around, look around  
All around, all around, all around  
Look around, look around, look around  
All around, oh yeah  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
When I'm feeling small  
And I'm hitting a wall  
Gonna leave it all around
