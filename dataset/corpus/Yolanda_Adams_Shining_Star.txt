When you wish upon a star  
Your dreams will take you very far  
But when you wish upon a dream  
Life ain't always what it seems  
What'd you see on a night so clear  
In the sky so very dear  
  
You're a shining star  
No matter who you are  
Shining bright to see  
What you could truly be  
  
Shining star come in to view  
Shine its watchful light on you  
Give you strength to carry on  
Make your body big and strong  
Born a man child of the sun  
Saw your work had just begun  
  
Found I had to stand alone  
Bless it now I've got my own  
So, if you find yourself in need  
Why don't you listen to these words and heed  
Be you giant or grain of sand  
Words of wisdom are ?Yes I can?  
  
You're a shining star  
No matter who you are  
Shining bright to see  
What you could truly be  
  
You're a shining star  
No matter who you are  
Shining bright to see  
What you could truly be
