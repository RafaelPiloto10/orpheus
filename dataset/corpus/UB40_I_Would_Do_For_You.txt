I didn't mean to be so late  
It's just that I got talking  
I had a drink with a couple of mates  
Missed my bus and wound up walking  
  
I tried to call and let you know  
It was busy and I couldn't get through  
I didn't want to let you down  
I know how much it hurts you  
  
I don't know what came over me  
It must have slipped my mind  
I'll try and make it up to you  
Let's leave the past behind  
  
I promise that I'll do my best  
To mend my wicked ways  
And don't believe the things you hear  
Don't listen to what they say  
  
[Chorus]  
I would do for you  
All you'd have me do  
All you have to do  
Is ask me to  
All you have to do  
Is tell me when  
And I'll come running back again  
  
If there's something wrong then let me know  
Don't bottle things inside  
Your pretty eyes can melt my heart  
Your sadness they can't hide  
  
Please try and give me one more chance  
To set the record straight  
Meet me here tomorrow night  
And I promise I won't be late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I would do for you...
