When the heart of the hundred acre wood is beating  
And time is passing through  
There's a shadow looking like a rainbows halo  
And there I'm resembling you  
  
More than fame  
A name on a tree  
More than power or might  
Sweeter than the treats of a honey bee  
I'll be here through the night  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's comforting to know  
  
Silent as the moon at dawn  
Soothing as a bed filled with hay  
Strong as a hero in the land of old  
I'll be here through the day  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's comforting to know  
  
Greyer than gloom on a rainy afternoon  
Sadder than being sorry for me  
Finer than finding my tail again  
I'll be here for all of thee  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's comforting to know  
  
You only get a few good friends in this life  
Who are devoted and true  
And right here in this now and near  
It's clear that it's all of you  
  
I'll find you when you're hard to see  
I'll look for you everywhere  
You'll know just how I'm feeling when  
I show you that I care  
  
It's comforting to know  
It's so comforting to know
