Yeah, here I am sitting on this bar stool,  
Talking like a damn fool  
Got the twelve o'clock news blues  
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps  
And a bottle of cold brew  
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy  
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all  
  
Well I'm so tired of losing  
I've got nothing to do and all day to do it  
Well I'd go out cruising, but I've no place  
To go and all night to get there  
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal  
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail  
  
Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands  
It's ticking away with my sanity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
It's hard to believe such a calamity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me  
  
(Too much time on my hands)  
It's tick tick tick tick ticking away  
(Too much time on my hands)  
And I don't know what to do with myself  
(Too much time on my hands)  
  
(Too much time on my hands)  
(Too much time on my hands)  
(Too much time on my hands)  
  
Now I'm a jet fuel genius  
I can solve the world's problems  
Without even trying  
I've got dozens of friends, and the fun never ends  
That is as long as I'm buying  
Is it any wonder I'm not the President  
Is it any wonder I'm null and void  
  
Is it any wonder I've got too much  
Time on my hands  
It's ticking away with my sanity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
It's hard to believe such a calamity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me  
  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Ticky tick tick tick tick ticking away  
(Too much time on my hands)  
And I don't know what to do with myself  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Umm mmm  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Tick tick tick ticking away  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Umm mmm  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Too much time on my hands  
Too much time on my
