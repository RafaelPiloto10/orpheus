Though I can't put my hands on you I can feel you now  
In the bones and the blood flowing needles on the ground  
In the ether I sail to you floating on the fumes  
Run aground on the shore for you simple wreckage  
  
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow  
I only know I've made it home when I drown in your ghost light  
  
Though I can't put a name on you I will cry it out  
In my heart I will hold what my bloody hands have dropped  
Run aground on the floor for you simple wreckage  
  
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow  
I only know I've made it home when I drown in your ghost light  
In your ghost light  
  
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow  
I only know I've made it home when I drown in your ghost light  
  
In your ghost light  
  
Taree! Taree! Taree!
