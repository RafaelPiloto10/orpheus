It's the same old S.O.S.  
But with brand new  
Broken fortunes,  
And once again I turn  
To you  
Once again, I do  
I turn to you  
  
It's the same old S.O.S  
But with brand new  
Broken fortunes  
I'm the same  
Underneath  
But this, you  
You surely knew  
  
Life is a pigsty  
Life is a pigsty  
Life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
  
and if you don't know this  
Then what do you know?  
Every second of my life  
I only live for you  
And you can shoot me  
And you can throw me off a train  
I still maintain  
I still maintain  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life is a pigsty  
  
and I've been shifting gears all of my life  
But I'm still the same underneath  
And this you surely knew  
  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you anymore  
  
Can you please stop time?  
Can you stop the pain?  
I feel too cold  
And now I feel too warm again  
Can you stop this pain?  
Can you stop this pain?  
Even now in the final hour  
Of my life  
I'm falling in love again  
Again  
Again  
  
Even now in the final hour  
Of my life  
I'm falling in love again  
Again  
Again  
Again  
Again  
  
I'm falling in love again  
Again  
Again  
Again
