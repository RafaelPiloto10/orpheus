Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so  
  
Never been awake  
Never seen a day break  
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light  
Lazy day in bed  
Music in my head  
Crazy music playing in the morning light  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so  
  
I love my sunny day  
Dream of far away  
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning light  
Never been awake  
Never seen a day break  
Laying on my pillow in the morning light  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe it's not so  
It's magic, you know  
Never believe, it's not so
