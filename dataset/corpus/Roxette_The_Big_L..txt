She's the top, she's got the world on a string.  
She makes me boogie, makes me do anything  
yea yea. -  
Hey now, touch the sky,  
you've got a certain kind of look in your eyes.  
  
Well, she's a miracle, she's all that I need  
like the water and the air that I breathe  
yea yea. -  
Hey now, reach the sky,  
there's a certain kind of look in your smile.  
  
And I know what love can do.  
Yes I know what hearts can do  
  
The big love is taking the wheel,  
the big love goes head over heels,  
the big lust, bring it into the small world,  
the bigger, the better.  
Big love, waiting to catch the big one,  
head over heels, the big one,  
bring it into the small world.  
I'm building the big big love,  
I'm building the big big love  
  
It's kinda strange, a bit mysterious,  
I gotta take it oh so so serious. -  
Hey now, touch the sky,  
you've got a certain kind of look in your eyes.  
  
It used to be hard, so lonely at night,  
well, she's my baby and I'm feeling alright. -  
Hey now, move the sky,  
there's a certain kind of look in that smile.  
  
When I'm making love with her.  
When I'm making love to her yea.  
  
It has to be a big thing  
It's bringing me to my knees  
Has to be a big thing  
Big thing  
  
Ya know what I'm saying...
