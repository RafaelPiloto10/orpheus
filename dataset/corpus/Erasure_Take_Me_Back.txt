The way to your heart  
The way to your heart  
  
There are voices like water  
Inside your heart  
Echo  
  
Take me back to the place where I once belonged  
This could be any place  
A place where you and I could sing this song  
Take me back where I hear waterfalls flowing  
  
Let me dive into the lake where winter hides the snow  
Then comes the summertime  
Fields of scarlet poppies grow  
Take me back where I see butterflies to-ing, fro-ing  
  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna take it back again  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna get it back again  
  
We don't know anything  
Trapped in a world full of strangers  
Please don't tell me anything  
I'd rather fall into you  
  
Let me sleep a little while underneath the tree  
And dream of dragonflies  
Where the weary willow weeps for me  
Take me back where I see dandelions blowing  
  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna take it back again  
  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna get it back again  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna take it back again  
  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna get it back again  
And the river flows  
I am never gonna take it back again  
  
We don't know anything  
Trapped in a world full of strangers  
Please don't tell me anything  
I'd rather fall into you
