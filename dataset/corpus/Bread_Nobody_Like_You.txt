You know that lately people ask what I'm  
Doin' sittin' home alone all by myself  
They know I'm used to bein' out and about and they  
Don't know just what's become of myself  
They say the swinger can't swing it no more  
But they don't know what I'm hidin' behind my door  
Because you know I know I've never known nobody  
Nobody like you, nobody to do what you do  
And when you're leavin' poor me all alone  
You got me sittin' here sufferin' by my telephone  
I been left, I been right  
And when I'm wrong I know you're gonna make me  
See the light  
Because you know I know I've never known nobody  
Nobody like you, nobody like you.  
White other people dancin' romancin' and chancin'  
Their lives every saturday night  
Watchin' TV drinkin' tea her and me  
And maybe even have us a fight  
'Cause an argument can be outta sight  
When you love to argue and you know how to fight  
I don't care about soul  
I don't even care about no rock and roll  
You know I don't care about nothin'  
Nobody, nobody but you.
