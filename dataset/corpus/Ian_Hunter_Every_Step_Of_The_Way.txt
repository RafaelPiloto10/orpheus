I used to see you on the avenue  
You were the girl that let me follow you  
You used to hang out in the alleyway  
You sewed a button on my shirt one day  
  
I asked around til I found your name  
Then underneath the arches in the pourin' rain  
I said you (yeah you)  
I want you, every step of the way  
  
Do you want to, do you want to, do you want to dance  
Take a chance baby, take a chance  
I'll be with you every step of the way  
I'll even show you how to strut someday  
  
Ain't got a girl 'n' it's a cryin' shame  
I can't figure out who's to blame  
I want you (yeah you)  
I want you, every step of the way  
  
I know, things gettin' better  
I know, it's gonna be o.k.  
So don't go, I ain't gonna let ya  
I want to be with you, every step of the way  
  
So take a walk down the avenue  
Just you 'n' me baby, me 'n' you  
Remember that night in the alleyway  
You know something, you still look the same  
  
This world is a mean old world  
It don't mean nothin' without you girl  
I want you (yeah you)  
I want you, every step of the way
