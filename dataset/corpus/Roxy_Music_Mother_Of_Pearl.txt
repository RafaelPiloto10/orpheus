Turn the lights down  
Way down low  
Turn up the music  
Hi as fi can go  
All the gang's here  
Everyone you know  
It's a crazy scene  
Hey there just look over your shoulder  
Get the picture?  
  
No no no no (Yes)  
Walk a tightrope  
Your life-sign-line  
Such a bright hope  
Right place, right time  
What's your number?  
Never you mind  
Take a powder  
But hang on a minute what's coming round the corner?  
Have you a future?  
  
No no no no (Yes)  
Well I've been up all night again  
Party-time wasting is too much fun  
Then I step back thinking  
Of life's inner meaning  
And my latest fling  
It's the same old story  
All love and glory  
It's a pantomime  
  
If you're looking for love  
In a looking glass world  
It's pretty hard to find  
Oh mother of pearl  
I wouldn't trade you  
For another girl  
Divine intervention  
Always my intention  
So I take my time  
  
I've been looking for something  
I've always wanted  
But was never mine  
But now I've seen that something  
Just out of reach, glowing  
Very Holy grail  
Oh mother of pearl  
Lustrous lady  
Of a sacred world  
  
Thus: even Zarathustra  
Another-time-loser  
Could believe in you  
With every goddess a let down  
Every idol a bring down  
It gets you down  
But the search for perfection  
Your own predilection  
Goes on and on and on and on  
Canadian Club love  
A place in the Country  
Everyone's ideal  
  
But you are my favorita  
And a place in your heart dear  
Makes me feel more real  
Oh mother of pearl  
I wouldn't change you  
For the whole world  
You're highbrow, holy  
With lots of soul  
  
Melancholy shimmering  
Serpentine sleekness  
Was always my weakness  
Like a simple tune  
But no dilettante  
Filigree fancy  
  
Beats the plastic you  
Career girl cover  
Exposed and another  
Slips right into-view  
Oh looking for love  
In a looking glass world  
Is pretty hard for you  
Few throwaway kisses  
The boomerang misses  
Spin round and round  
Fall on featherbed quilted  
Faced with silk  
  
Softly stuffed eider down  
Take refuge in pleasure  
Just give me your future  
We'll forget your past  
Oh mother of pearl  
Submarine lover  
  
In a shrinking world  
Oh lonely dreamer  
Your choker provokes  
A picture cameo  
Oh mother of pearl  
So so semi-precious  
In your detached world  
Oh mother of pearl  
I wouldn't trade you  
For another girl
