It all began with an experiment that failed  
Meant for the enemy, unleashed on us  
Everything that was on course has been derailed  
We're all caught in the rush  
Holding the poison within  
This battle no one wins  
No  
  
Stand  
The Stand  
  
Plague came down on us like a ton of bricks  
Generals spilled their bag of tricks  
Like an avalanche roaring over you  
Now there is nothing left to do  
No one left to burn  
Captain Trips has taken all  
  
No  
Stand  
The Stand  
Try to understand  
The Stand  
  
Stand  
The Stand  
Try to understand  
The Stand
