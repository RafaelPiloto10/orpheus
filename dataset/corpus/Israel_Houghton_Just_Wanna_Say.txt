Said you'd never leave me  
Said you'd never leave me, leave me  
  
Said you won't forsake me  
Said you won't forsake me, 'sake me  
  
Even now I'm older  
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken  
  
Even what you told me  
You would always hold me  
Safe in the palm of your hand  
  
Even though I go through the valley of the shadow  
I'm not forgotten  
  
Never let a day go by  
My, my  
Gonna shout it from the mountain  
  
[Chorus]  
I just wanna say  
I'm not afraid  
I know that you are with me  
Always  
  
Even now I'm older  
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken  
  
Even what you told me  
You would always hold me  
Safe in the palm of your hand  
  
Even though I go through the valley of the shadow  
I'm not forgotten  
Never let a day go (and I never let a day go by)  
My, my  
Gonna shout it from the mountain  
  
[Chorus]  
I just wanna say  
I'm not afraid  
I know that you are with me (said I know that you are with me)  
Always (always)  
  
I give you praise  
For everyday  
I know you'll never leave me  
No way  
  
(said you'd never leave me)  
Said you'd never leave me  
Said you'd never leave me, leave me  
  
(said you won't forsake me)  
Said you won't forsake me  
Said you won't forsake me, 'sake me  
  
(never leave you lonely)
