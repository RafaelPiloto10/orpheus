There's a girl in my life  
The best little girl that I could ever find  
Her lips are warm when the nights are cold  
In the summertime she can make it snow  
She's alright, she's alright  
If you want to get a girl that's really fine  
You gotta get a girl, a girl like mine  
She's alright, she's alright.  
  
You take your girl to a show  
You got to stand in line but she says no  
You finally get your ticket and you walk in  
There she's standing with a silly grin  
But not mine, she'll stand in line  
If you want to get a girl that's truly fine  
You gotta get a girl, a girl like mine  
Cause she's alright, she's alright.  
  
You buy your girl a fancy dress  
That's the only way she'll look her best  
I give my girl bell-bottom slacks  
A big wide belt and she's a gas  
She's alright, she's alright  
If you want to get a girl that's really fine  
You gotta get a girl, a girl like mine  
Cause she's alright, she's alright
