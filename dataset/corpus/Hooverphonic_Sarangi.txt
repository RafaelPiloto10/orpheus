Suffocate your love  
In a barrel full of doubt  
Suffocate your love  
North east and south  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Hesitate, it's normal  
You can't erase mistakes  
Hesitate, it's normal  
I can't keep awake  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand  
  
Come closer  
It's you I want to embrace  
Come closer  
It's you I want to debase  
  
Here I stand  
In front of your imagination  
Here I stand
