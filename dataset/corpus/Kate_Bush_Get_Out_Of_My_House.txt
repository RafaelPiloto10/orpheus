When you left, the door was  
(slamming)  
You paused in the doorway  
(slamming)  
As though a thought stole you away  
(slamming)  
I watched the world pull you away  
(Lock it)  
  
So I run into the hall  
(Lock it)  
Into the corridor  
(Lock it)  
There's a door in the house  
(slamming)  
I hear the lift descending  
(slamming)  
I hear it hit the landing  
(slamming)  
See the hackles on the cat  
(standing)  
  
With my key I  
(lock it)  
With my key I  
(lock it up)  
With my key I  
(lock it)  
With my key I  
(lock it up)  
  
I am the concierge chez-moi, honey  
Won't let ya in for love, nor money  
("Let me in!")  
My home, my joy  
I'm barred and bolted and I  
(Won't let you in)  
(Get out of my house!)  
  
No stranger's feet  
Will enter me  
(Get out of my house!)  
I wash the panes  
(Get out of my house!)  
I clean the stains away  
(Get out of my house!)  
  
This house is as old as I am  
(Slamming)  
This house knows all I have done  
(Slamming)  
They come with their weather hanging 'round them  
(Slamming)  
But can't knock my door down  
(Slamming)  
  
With my key I  
(lock it)  
With my key I  
(lock it)  
  
This house is full of m-m-my mess  
(Slamming)  
This house is full of m-m-mistakes  
(Slamming)  
This house is full of m-m-madness  
(Slamming)  
This house is full of, full of, full of fight  
(Slam it)  
  
With my keeper I  
(clean up)  
With my keeper I  
(clean it all up)  
With my keeper I  
(clean up)  
With my keeper I  
(clean it all up)  
  
I am the concierge chez-moi, honey  
Won't letcha in for love, nor money  
("It's cold out here!")  
My home, my joy  
I'm barred and bolted and I  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Won't let you in)  
  
(Get out of my house!)  
No stranger's feet  
(Get out of my house!)  
Will enter me  
(Get out of my house!)  
I wash the panes  
(Get out of my house!)  
I clean the stains  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
Won't enter me  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
Yeah! Won't let you in  
(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
"Let me in!"  
  
"Woman let me in!  
Let me bring in the memories!  
Woman let me in!  
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams!"  
  
I will not let you in!  
Don't you bring back the reveries  
I turn into a bird  
Carry further than the word is heard  
  
"Woman let me in!  
I turn into the wind.  
I blow you a cold kiss,  
Stronger than the song's hit."  
  
I will not let you in  
I face towards the wind  
I change into the Mule  
"I change into the Mule."
