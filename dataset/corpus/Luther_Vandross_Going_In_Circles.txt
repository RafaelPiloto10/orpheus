I'm an ever rolling wheel  
Without a destination real  
And I'm an ever spinning top  
Whirling around 'till I drop  
  
[1] - Oh, but what am I to do  
My mind is in a whirlpool  
Give me a little hope  
One small thing to cling to  
  
[2] - You got me going in circles  
Oh, around and around I go  
Going in circles  
Oh, around and around I go  
I'm strung out over you  
  
I'm a faceless clock  
With timeless hopes that never stop  
When I feel that way  
You know my soul's at stake  
  
[Repeat 1]  
[Repeat 2]  
I'm strung out over you( I need you baby)  
Uuh, I need (I need you baby)  
Call me (I need you baby)  
I need baby, my baby, my baby  
My baby, my baby girl  
  
[Ad lib until fade]
