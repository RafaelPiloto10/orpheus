I take you out all over town  
But you always start sittin' down  
You never move, baby what's wrong with me?  
When we go dancin' , you're just there like a tree  
  
Baby come on and dance, you're holding me back  
I've gotta get out this feeling, before I go mad  
You gotta let me in, the music's getting me now  
You gotta come on and dance, stop hangin' around  
  
I don't care if you twist or jive, just as long as you're lookin' alive  
You'll make me glad, baby you'll make me rise,  
I want to see that twinkle in your eyes  
  
Baby come on and dance, you're holding me back  
I've gotta get out this feeling, before I go mad  
You gotta let me in, the music's getting me now  
You gotta come on and dance, stop hangin' around
