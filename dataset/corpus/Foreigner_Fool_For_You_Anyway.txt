Well I miss you, Honey  
A little more everyday  
And I know if I kissed you  
You'd be comin' back home to stay  
  
'Cause I know I was wrong  
But how long do I have to pay  
You know you belong here beside me  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
  
Well I cried for you so long  
The river of tears ran dry  
And I tried to be so strong  
But grew weaker as time went by  
  
You know your love left a mark on me  
I don't think it will fade away  
I sit here and wait 'til you come home  
'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
Fool for you anyway  
  
You know your love left a mark on me  
I don't think it will fade away  
I sit here and wait 'til you come home  
'Cause I'm a fool for you anyway  
Yes I'm a fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway  
  
Fool for you anyway  
Fool for you anyway  
Yes I'm a fool for you anyway  
A fool for you anyway  
A fool for you anyway  
I'm a fool for you anyway
