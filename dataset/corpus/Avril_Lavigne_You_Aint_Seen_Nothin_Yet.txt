First glance, you nearly made my jaw drop  
First dance, and you were looking so hot  
How tense, I moved in for a lip-lock  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby  
  
A first taste like honey, you were so yum  
Can't wait for a second 'cause it's so fun  
Third base, I'm headed for a homerun  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go, if you don't, we'll never know  
So if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
My place, you showed up with flowers  
Your face, could stare at it for hours  
Can't wait to see your superpowers  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby  
  
Your car, I'm sitting right beside you  
Rockstar at everything that you do  
My heart is ready for the next move  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go, if you don't, we'll never know  
So if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Yeah yeah, not yet  
Yeah yeah, not yet  
Yeah yeah, not yet  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go, if you don't, we'll never know  
So if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Yeah yeah, not yet
