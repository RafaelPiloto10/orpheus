The night is long until the dawn  
Dodge your number, I speak to the tune  
Stay on hold till lips turn cold  
Will you call me later?  
Will I catch you later?  
I was looking for you, but you're never home  
Hours and hours, stay by day  
You never sided, you never told  
What I feel, what I know, what I hear is over!  
  
Chorus:  
Your love's so cold  
You raised me up and let me fall  
You seek the truth,  
For some become invisible.  
  
Girl you know me, I know you  
I make mistakes, that it's true  
If you can't forgive me, let me go  
I'm the devil in the dark  
I do what I'm told, talk to talk  
Hope the demons walk the walk  
My hands are dirtier, hell not!  
What I feel, what I know, what I hear  
It's over!  
  
Chorus:  
Your love's so cold  
You raised me up and let me fall  
You seek the truth,  
For some become invisible.  
With all this loss  
You took my heart to'  
But that's your heart  
And that becomes invisible  
  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
It's the end,  
It is over!  
  
When life goes on, I'm without you  
You move to town and that's a rule  
Winter's cold and so are you!  
Close the door, say no more  
I was shocked, feel no loss  
Take it or leave it'  
Feel the rush now without you  
I was what we know is always over!
