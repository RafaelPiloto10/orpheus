To tell the truth it's really such a sad affair  
Standing here waiting in the cold night air  
But I've got to make this call  
Cause my heart is breaking.  
  
I hear the bips drop a coin in the slot  
Has it been that long  
I thought you'd forgotten me  
Well I know that it's getting late  
But I just couldn't wait  
  
Will I have the nerve to say  
I just wanna come back  
You shouldn't just go away  
I just wanna come back  
  
Ive been struck by such a bad luck  
I need a place a little happiness and some love  
I think I can see it now  
Now let me paint the picture  
  
Its twelve o'clock and the curtains are drawn  
They're counting sheep down in orchard road  
You're hanging on the telephone line tonight  
And I wish I could be in orchard road  
  
Not much been happening here  
I think Ive got a job  
They're gonna call me next week  
And I'll be working out of town  
But it sure beats hanging around  
  
What's that? Tomorrow at two  
You're kidding me, no  
Is it alright with you  
I don't know what to say  
It'll be like a holiday  
  
When you say you're all alone  
Makes me wanna come back  
And this house is not a home  
I just gotta go back  
  
Its twelve ten when I put down the phone  
The moons shining down on orchard road  
And I'm feeling like a schoolboy again and tonight  
Ill see you in my dreams of orchard road  
  
Its funny but I thought I'd never go back  
I think sometimes I might loose track  
But I remember you and the things we do  
And I want it back.  
  
In orchard road you've got my heart  
I left it in your doorway  
In orchard road a welcome back  
Is waiting there just for me  
In orchard road the sun will shine  
Again I know I know  
In orchard road you keep my love  
Just waiting there for me  
  
Its eight o'clock and the dawns arrived  
In orchard road it's breakfast time  
I climb in my car and I turn the key and I'm gone  
I am coming home  
To orchard road  
  
I'm coming home
