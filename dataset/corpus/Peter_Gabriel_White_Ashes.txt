Mamma's little boy has fallen down,  
Mamma's little boy has hit the ground.  
Now he's gone, Ian is gone,  
His time is done.  
The weight of a dream  
Can take you down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down.  
So well, pretend it's all well conceived,  
Build solid as steel, stuff we believe.  
Now he's gone. Ion is gone,  
His time is done.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down.  
Mamma's little boy, doing good.  
Mamma's little boy did all he could.  
Now he's gone, Ion is gone, time is done.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down  
White, white ashes, building crashes down
