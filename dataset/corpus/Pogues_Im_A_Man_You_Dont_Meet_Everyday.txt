Oh my name is Jock Stewart I'm a canny gun man  
And a roving young fellow I've been  
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me  
I'm a man you don't meet every day  
  
I have acres of land I have men at command  
I have always a shilling to spare  
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me  
I'm a man you don't meet every day  
  
Well I took out my dog and him I did shoot  
All down in the county Kildare  
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me  
I'm a man you don't meet every day  
  
So come fill up you glasses of brandy and wine  
Whatever it costs, I will pay  
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me  
I'm a man you don't meet every day
