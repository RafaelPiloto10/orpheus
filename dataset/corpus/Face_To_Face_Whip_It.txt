Crack that whip  
Give the past the slip  
Step on a crack  
Break your momma's back  
When a problem comes along  
  
You must whip it  
Before the cream sits out too long  
  
You must whip it  
When something's going wrong  
  
You must whip it  
Now whip it  
Into shape  
  
Shape it up  
Get straight  
Go forward  
Move ahead  
Try to detect it  
It's not too late  
  
To whip it  
Whip it good  
  
When a good time turns around  
You must whip it  
You will never live it down  
  
Unless you whip it  
No one gets their way  
Until they whip it  
  
I say whip it  
Whip it good
