Only one life to live in  
Trying our best to make it through  
Ooh we're trying our best to make it through  
There's no mistakes, just lessons  
It's all about what they mean to you  
Ohhh, oh yeah no matter what you've gone through (you can)  
Pick up the pieces, move on with your life  
Cause we have to accept the wrongs and try to make them right  
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth  
Baby you've got to realize it takes time to become you  
So just get to  
  
Movin' on  
We're movin' on  
We're movin 'on  
Living day by day, everything must change  
But in a way everything stays the same  
Movin' on, movin' on, movin' on, movin' on  
Movin' on  
  
Well take what you've been given  
Gotta take a chance while we can  
Ooh, ohh yeah  
To find our place in our world  
We gotta understand the plan (understand)  
Pick up the pieces, move on with your life  
Cause we have to accept the wrongs and try to make them right  
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth  
Oh realize it takes time to become you  
Oh, just get to  
  
Movin' on  
We're movin' on (you know we''ve got to keep on movin' on)  
We're movin 'on (nothing''s gonna stop us)  
Living day by day, everything must change  
But in a way everything stays the same  
Movin' on, movin' on, movin' on, movin' on  
Movin' on  
  
Moving on  
We're moving on (you know we've got to keep on moving on)  
We're moving on (nothing's gonna stop us)  
Living day by day, everything must change  
We know we've changed  
But we're still the same  
Getting closer to what we're supposed to be  
As life goes on uou'll have your time  
Cause everything's meant to be
