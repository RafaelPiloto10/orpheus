Have you ever made a sign  
Could you be a friend of mine?  
Could I place my trust in you  
Would you see my point of view?  
Take from me what you have to  
Take my steps to guide you through.  
There's no time to find a way  
Now I see the light of day.  
Let the flames burn high  
Got the fire inside.  
Love can turn me around  
Never ever let me down.  
Oh, I don't think it matters what I say,  
The time has come  
Now don't delay.  
Hesitation is bringing me down  
What I'm after can't be found.
