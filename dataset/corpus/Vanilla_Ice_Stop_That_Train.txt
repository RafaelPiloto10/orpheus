1,2,3,4  
It was an average night backstage at a show  
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!  
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet  
Her shape was so petite, and so unique  
Her eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed  
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest  
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream  
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team  
I was one of many that she'd choose  
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse  
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on  
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm  
This was far from a story you will find in a book  
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook  
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain  
And all I kept sayin' to myself was  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Oh my God, what have I got into?  
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue  
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire  
The situation I was in could've started a campfire  
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now  
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while  
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool  
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool  
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you  
You better watch your back 'cause a woman will slay you  
Not to mention the one who got me  
Yea, she got me, the I-see-E  
But, back to the story of a one night stand  
I thought I was strong but she was He-man  
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush  
And all 'n all it was for the lust  
I though, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff  
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs  
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death  
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck  
And out of all nights, where was my crew?  
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do  
D already told me that the girlie was strange  
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains  
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan  
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'  
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?  
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse  
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid  
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play  
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss  
Stop this train 'cause I want to get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Later on that night as it got worse  
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst  
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame  
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train  
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun  
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run  
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come  
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb  
So, now what have I done to get myself into this?  
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist  
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor  
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore  
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body  
Why did I ever tell her to "Pump it, Hottie?"  
What could I do to just ease the pain?  
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off
