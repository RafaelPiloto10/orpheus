[Verse 1]  
Right from the start you were a thief, you stole my heart,  
And I your willing victim.  
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty,  
And with every touch you fixed them.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh,  
Things you never say to me, oh, oh,  
Tell me that you've had enough  
Of our love, our love.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts,  
We're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
  
[Verse 2: Nate Ruess]  
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from.  
I thought that we were fine (oh, we had everything)  
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everythin',  
And it's all in your mind (yeah, but this is happenin')  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh,  
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh,  
There's nothing more than empty sheets,  
Between our love, our love.  
Oh, our love, our love!  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart,  
You're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again!  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, tear ducts and rust,  
I'll fix it for us.  
We're collecting dust,  
But our love's enough.  
You're holding it in,  
You're pouring a drink!  
No nothing is as bad as it seems.  
We'll come clean!  
  
[Bridge]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts,  
We're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts,  
That we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, we can learn to love again,  
Oh, we can learn to love again.  
Oh, oh, that we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.
