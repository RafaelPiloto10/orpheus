Frosty the snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before i melt away"  
  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, "catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down  
The streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard them holler, "stop!"  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying, "don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day"
