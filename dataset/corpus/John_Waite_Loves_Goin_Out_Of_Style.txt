I got nothin'  
But this early day  
Spent all my money  
Threw it all away  
  
Time to kill  
But she's on my mind  
Mister Real Bad Luck  
Missed a real good time  
  
So if you see me  
Don't say hello  
I never put that diamond on...  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I've got the keys to the highway  
Since she saw the light  
Now I got nothin' but my freedom  
And this beat up heart of mine  
I got no regrets, no nothin'  
She took me for a ride  
And I guess love's goin' out of style  
  
She was a dancer  
In a topless place  
She came home early  
And you shoulda seen her face  
  
Roll and rumble  
Feelin' like a crook  
Lean back and think about it  
Leafin' thru my little black book  
  
So if you see me  
Don't say hello  
I never put that diamond on  
  
'Cause I've got the keys to the highway  
Since she saw the light  
I got nothin' but my freedom  
And this beat up heart of mine  
  
I got no regrets, no nothin'  
She took me for a ride  
And I guess love's goin' out of style  
  
(Break)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause I've got the keys to the highway  
Since she saw the light  
I got nothin' but my freedom  
And this beat up heart of mine  
I got no regrets, no nothin'  
She took me for a ride  
And I guess love's goin' out of style...  
  
Yeah... Love's goin' out of style  
  
Yeah...  
  
Love's goin'...
