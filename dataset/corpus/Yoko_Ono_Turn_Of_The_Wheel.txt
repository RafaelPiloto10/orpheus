Our love could never take a middle road,  
Our love is always on a tightrope.  
Sometimes I'm glad just to see you there,  
But most times I'm afraid, yes, I'm afraid.  
  
I miss you but I don't wanna tell you,  
I need you but I don't want you to know.  
Sometimes I'm glad just to know you're here,  
But most times I'm afraid, yes, I'm afraid.  
  
Why didn't anybody tell me  
That there were more heartaches to learn?  
Why didn't anybody tell me  
There were more corners to turn?  
  
I dreamt of us, we were on a middle road,  
Holding hands and going all the way.  
Sometimes I'm afraid, I'm afraid that we are here,  
But most times I hold my dream, I hold my dream.  
  
Why didn't anybody tell me  
That there were more streetlights to leave?  
Why didn't anybody tell me  
The turn of the wheel was never to cease?  
  
Why didn't anybody tell me  
That there were more streetlights to leave?  
Why didn't anybody tell me  
The turn of the wheel was never to cease?  
The turn of the wheel was never to cease?
