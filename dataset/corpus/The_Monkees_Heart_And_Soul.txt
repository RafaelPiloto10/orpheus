Love in a vacuum, love in a space,  
Love without even the little hint of a trace,  
Love in confusion then love doesn't show on your face.  
  
Love is a stranger, love is a box,  
Love is the key that fits a million locks,  
Love is a mystery when love is the devil you call.  
  
Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine.  
  
Love at a distance, love at a walk,  
Love at the limit if only people could talk,  
Love for the moment it takes to its wings like a hawk.  
  
Love for tomorrow, love for today,  
Love for the hour it could be coming your way,  
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play.  
  
Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.  
  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,  
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.
