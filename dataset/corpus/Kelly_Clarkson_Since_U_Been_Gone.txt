Here's the thing  
We started out friends  
It was cool, but it was all pretend  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
You're dedicated, you took the time  
Wasn't long till I called you mine  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
And all you'd ever hear me say  
Is how I picture me with you  
That's all you'd ever hear me say  
  
But since you been gone  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you  
Now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
  
How can I put it? You put me on  
I even fell for that stupid love song  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
How come I've never heard you say  
I just want to be with you?  
Guess you never felt that way  
  
But since you been gone  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you  
Now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
  
You had your chance, you blew it  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it  
Again, and again, and again, and again  
  
Since you been gone (since you been gone)  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you (thanks to you)  
Now I get, I get what I want  
  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (I get)  
You should know (you should know)  
That I get  
I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone
