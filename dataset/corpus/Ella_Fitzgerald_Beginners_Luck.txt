At any gambling casino  
From monte carlo to reno  
They tell you that a beginner  
Comes out a winner  
  
Beginner fishing for flounder  
Will catch a 17 pounder  
That's what I always heard  
And thought absurd,  
But now, I believe every word  
  
For I've got beginner's luck  
The first time that I'm in love  
I'm in love with you  
Gosh, I'm lucky  
  
I've got beginner's luck  
There never was such a smile  
Or such eyes of blue  
Gosh, I'm fortunate  
  
The thing we've begun  
Is much more than a pastime  
For this time is the one  
Where the first time is the last time  
  
I've got beginner's luck  
Lucky, through and through  
Cause the first time that I'm in love  
I'm in love with you

The thing we've begun  
Is much more than a pastime  
For this time is the one  
Where the first time is the last time  
  
I've got beginner's luck  
Lucky, through and through  
Cause the first time that I'm in love  
Yes, the first time that I'm in love  
Oh, the first time that I'm in love  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you
