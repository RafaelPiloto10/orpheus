A voice that fly is broken just the same  
You spin this life around  
You bring me where some heart and soul remain  
From a cold cold place in time (and you sing)  
  
I just know how you make me feel  
You take it all the way  
You send me all the way  
Oh I just know where I want to be  
Forever wandering forever traveling  
  
A voice that cry but I'm smiling just the same  
You show me where to look  
Just skin and bones just circling the sun  
One glimpse was all it took (and you sang)  
  
I just know how you make me feel  
You take it all the way  
You send me all the way  
Oh I just know where I want to be  
Forever wandering forever traveling  
  
Somewhere in my mind I'm under the golden gate  
Somewhere in my heart I'm in the city by the bay  
Sometimes I can feel the wheel in the sky it's still turning
