Well I'm going out west where I belong  
Where the days are short and the nights are long  
  
And I'll walk a little walk I'll twist a little twist  
I'll shimmy a little shimmy I'll fly a little fly  
Yea we're out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Well, I'm going out west out on the coast  
Where the California girls are really the most  
  
Where they walk and I'll walk They fish and I'll fish  
They sin and I'll sin They fly and I'll fly  
Where they're out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Well, the girls are frisky in old 'Frisco  
A pretty little chick wherever you go  
  
And they walk and I'll walk They fish and I'll fish  
They sin and I'll sin They fly and I'll fly  
Where they're out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
We're out there having fun, yeah, in the warm California sun
