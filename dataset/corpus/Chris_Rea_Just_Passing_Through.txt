Soldiers of fortune lost in the wind  
No destinations and nothing to win  
Keep your head above the water, you get dirty and mean  
Scrubbing forever and you never come clean  
  
A life that is easy, a dream that comes true  
Flowers for someone but they sure ain't for me  
Your room's filled with soft light, safe and secure  
Mine is the dark night and nothing's for sure  
  
We're just passing trough  
  
A life that is easy, a dream to be free  
Flowers for someone but they sure ain't for you  
And they sure ain't for me  
  
We're just passing trough
