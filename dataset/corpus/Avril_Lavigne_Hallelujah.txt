We sat by the fire  
United in song  
Under the moonlight  
All night long  
  
We sang 'Hallelujah'  
For the joy of it all  
  
And out on the water  
A caroling loon  
Sings us a sweet  
Heavenly tune  
  
There's peace in God's forest  
The temple of life  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
And back in the city  
I'm losing control  
I need a place  
To ease my soul  
  
There's peace in God's temple  
The temple of life  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah  
  
Thank you Jesus  
We praise your name  
Thank you Lord  
Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
We looked to the sky  
Deep into heaven's eyes  
Hallelujah
