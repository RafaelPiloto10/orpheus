In love with myself  
In love with my own reflection  
With my own affection  
With the vision that i see  
  
There's nobody else  
I'm taking my own direction  
I can see perfection  
Doing all i can for me  
  
In love with myself...  
  
I can take you to hell  
I'm falling so deep inside it  
And i just can't hide it  
Feel it burning down on me  
  
I dance with myself  
As hundreds of eyes are waiting  
Can't strip completely  
And the lights are burning me  
  
In love with myself...  
  
Tonight I'm gonna meet somebody  
After all the lights have died  
I'm still living,  
But what am i giving?  
  
In love with myself  
In love with my own reflection  
With my own affection  
With the vision that i see  
  
There's nobody else  
I'm taking my own direction  
I can see perfection  
Doing all i can for me  
  
In love with myself...  
  
Everybody wants your body  
There's nobody who can  
Take you to heaven  
We'll make it forever  
  
Tonight I'm gonna meet somebody  
After all the lights have died  
I'm still living  
But what am i giving?
