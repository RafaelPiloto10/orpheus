(feat. Queen Latifah)  
  
(Herman Hupfield)  
  
This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, "I love you"  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
(Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?  
(Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah  
  
Oh, I'm singing it to you right now  
Cause we're talking about  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
As time goes by  
  
Time goes by
