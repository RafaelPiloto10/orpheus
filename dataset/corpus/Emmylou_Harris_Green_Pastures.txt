Troubles and trials  
Often betray us  
Tempting the wearing  
Body to stray  
But we shall all meet  
'Side the still waters  
With the Good Shepherd  
Leading the way  
  
Those who have strayed were  
Sought by the Master  
He who once gave His  
Life for the sheep  
Out on the mountain  
Now He is searching  
Bringing them in  
Forever to keep  
  
Going up home to  
Live in green pastures  
Where we shall live and  
Die nevermore  
Even the Lord will  
Be in that number  
When we shall reach that  
Heavenly Shore  
  
We will not heed the  
Voice of the stranger  
For he would lead us  
On to despair  
Following on with  
Jesus our Savior  
We shall all reach that  
Country so fair  
  
Going up home to  
Live in green pastures  
Where we shall live and  
Die nevermore  
Even the Lord will  
Be in that number  
When we shall reach that  
Heavenly Shore
