The lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you don't give,  
Then you don't get loving  
  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you  
  
We all making out  
Like we own this whole world  
While the leaders of nations  
They're acting like big girls  
With no thoughts for their god  
Who provides us with all  
But when death comes to claim them  
Who will stand,  
And who will fall?  
  
The lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you don't give,  
Then you don't get loving  
  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you  
  
We all move around,  
With objectives in mind,  
To become rich or famous,  
With our reputations signed,  
But the few that can reach,  
To this coveted slot,  
Don't escape old age creeping,  
Through their bodies,  
Like a rot  
  
While the lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you don't give,  
Then you don't get loving  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you
