I don't know what it is that makes me love you so.  
I only know I never want to let you go  
'Cause you started something, can't you see.  
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me.  
It happens to be true, I only want to be with you.  
  
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do.  
I want to spend each moment of the day with you.  
Look what has happened with just one kiss.  
I never knew that I could be in love like this.  
It's crazy but it's true, I only want to be with you.  
  
You stopped and smiled at me,  
I asked if you cared to dance,  
you fell into my open arms,  
I didn't stand a chance.  
  
Now, listen, honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere.  
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care  
'Cause you started something, can't you see.  
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me.  
No matter what you do, I only want to be with you.  
  
You stopped and smiled at me,  
I asked if you cared to dance?."  
you feel into my open arms,  
I didn't stand a chance.  
  
Now, listen, honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere.  
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care  
'Cause you started something, can't you see.  
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me.  
No matter what you do, I only want to be with you.  
No matter, no matter what you do, I only want to be with you.  
No matter, no matter what you do, I only want to be with you.
