Save This Dance For Me  
  
I'll never forget that look in your eyes  
The first time I held you and we realized  
Something so special was growing inside  
Feeling's so deep.... Not easy to hide  
We talked of forever and how we would wait  
But the band started playing  
Now am I too late... Won't you  
Save this dance for me and I will lead for you  
God has gave me one last chance before my life is through  
And in your arms when the music stops is where I want to be  
So tell him no and save this dance for me.  
  
No one's been able to hurt me before  
And I'll never love like this anymore  
Cause there's no one else like you in this world  
So much a woman but I call you "Girl."  
I don't mean to doubt you but still I could lose  
And I can't live without you so  
Please when you choose... Won't you  
  
Save this dance for me and I will lead for you  
God has gave me one last chance before my life is through  
And in your arms when the music stops is where I want to be  
So please be brave and save this dance for me  
I won't give up so save this dance for me.
