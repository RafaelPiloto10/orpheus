Engine's running hot  
But now it's burnin' down  
Everyone says that this is going well  
But I can hear every sound  
  
Four gray walls  
Make it all seem right  
But everything looks wrong  
In these cheap hotel lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Going up and down  
Down and out  
  
Cheap cologne and expensive perfume  
I've never seen so many lost souls in my life  
Air so thick, so busy and loud  
One crazy young man standing out in the crowd  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One of these days when the sun comes up and I'm tossin' and turnin' alone  
I'm gonna pull myself up outta this state  
I'm gonna make everything seem alright, alright  
Know how it feels with the sun in my eyes, still that heartbroken wind's at my
door  
One of these days I'm gonna wreck myself and this engine won't run no more, no
more  
  
[Chorus: x2]
