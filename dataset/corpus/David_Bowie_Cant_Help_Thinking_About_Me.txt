Question-time that says I brought dishonour  
My head's bowed in shame  
It seems that I've blackened the family name  
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking  
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah  
I'm guilty  
I wish that I was sorry this time  
I wish that I could pay for my crime  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
Remember when we used to go to church on sundays  
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on mondays  
Oh, but it's too late now  
I wish I was a child again  
I wish I felt secure again  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
As I pass a recreation ground  
I remember my friends, always been found and I can't  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
Now I leave them all in the never never land  
The station seems so cold the ticket's in my hand  
My girl calls my name hi dave  
Drop in, see around, come back  
If you're this way again"  
Oh, I'm on my own  
I've got a long way to go  
I hope I make it on my own  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me
