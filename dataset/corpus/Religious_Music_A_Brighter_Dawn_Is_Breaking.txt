A brighter dawn is breaking  
And earth with praise is waking  
For thou, O King most highest  
The power of death defiest.  
  
And thou hast come victorious  
With risen Body glorious  
Who now for ever livest  
And life abundant givest.  
  
O free the world from blindness  
And fill the world with kindness  
Give sinners resurrection  
Bring striving to perfection.  
  
In sickness give us healing  
In doubt thy clear revealing  
That praise to thee be give  
In earth as in thy heaven...
