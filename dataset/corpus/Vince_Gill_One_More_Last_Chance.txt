She was standing at the front door  
When I came home last night  
A good book in her left hand  
And a rollin' pin in the right  
She said you've come home for the last time  
With whiskey on your breath  
If you don't listen to my preachin' boy  
I'm goin' to have to beat you half to death  
  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through  
I know I drive you crazy baby  
It's the best that I can do  
We're just some good ol' boys, a makin' noise  
I ain't a runnin' 'round on you  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through  
  
First she hid my glasses  
'Cause she knows that I can't see  
She said you ain't goin' nowhere boy  
'Til you spend a little time with me  
Then the boys called from the honky tonk  
Said there's a party goin' on down here  
Well she might've took my car keys  
But she forgot about my old John Deere  
  
So give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through  
I know I drive you crazy baby  
It's the best that I can do  
We're just some good ol' boys, a makin' noise  
I ain't a runnin' 'round on you  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say we're through
