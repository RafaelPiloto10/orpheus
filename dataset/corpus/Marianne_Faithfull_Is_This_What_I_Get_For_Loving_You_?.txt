There's been a lot of talk around  
That you've been seen with a certain party  
And now I'm so afraid I'm losing you  
Oh, baby don't tell me you don't want my love  
I couldn't give it to just anybody  
Baby won't you say it isn't true  
  
Don't leave me baby  
Don't tell me it's over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said you'd always love me  
You said you'd never hurt me  
  
What will there be left for me  
It's such a cruel world to be alone in  
I always needed you to look out for me  
Oh baby, I'm gonna miss your lovin' arms  
They're the only arms I feel at home in  
Don't you know how lonely I'm gonna be  
  
Don't leave me baby  
Don't tell me it's over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said you'd always love me  
You said you'd never hurt me
