My world is filled with oceans  
Oceans of fantasy  
The never never land of emotions  
Come down and follow me  
You'll see the secret places  
Where all the rivers end  
And pirate ships of old  
Filled with diamonds and with gold  
Just waiting for a friend  
  
All you can hear is the music of stillness  
And pure harmony  
Magical mirrors reflecting the light  
That colors the sea  
You'll be surrounded by angel like creatures  
Who tend to your dreams  
Deeper and deeper you fall in a trance  
Much more real  
Much more real than it seems  
  
Come share with me the oceans  
Oceans of fantasy  
Where you can lose your soul forever  
Like in a melody  
  
Oceans of fantasy, oceans of fantasy  
Oceans of fantasy, oceans of fantasy  
  
My world is filled with oceans  
Oceans of fantasy  
The never never land of emotions  
Come down and follow me
