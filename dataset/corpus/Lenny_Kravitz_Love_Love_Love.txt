Don't need no television  
Don't need no movie stars  
Don't need custom private planes  
Don't need no politicians  
Don't need no stocks and bonds  
Don't need no cars or boats or trains  
Don't need no diamond jewelery  
Don't need no rare cigars  
Don't need no magnums of champagne  
Don't need no penthouse mansion  
Don't need no Paris fashion  
Don't need no shiny golden chain  
  
[Chorus]  
There ain't nothing you can give me I'm already there  
I got love  
I got love love  
I got love love love  
  
Don't need no plastic surgery  
Don't need no country clubs  
Don't need no butlers, cooks or maids  
Don't need no marijuana  
Don't need no ecstasy  
Don't need no blow or sleeping aids  
Don't need no personal trainer  
Don't need no fortune teller  
Don't need no job that gets me paid  
Don't need no more religion  
Don't need no air condition  
Don't need no one to get me laid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your ways are never ever static  
You're always keeping it erratic  
I want you to know I'm emphatic  
About your love that's enigmatic  
You, me and God makes three  
My eyes are open I see  
Oh baby don't you understand  
  
Don't need no private island  
Don't need no chandelier  
Don't need no million dollar view  
Don't need no helicopter  
Don't need no magazine  
Don't need nobody else but you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're all I need  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]
