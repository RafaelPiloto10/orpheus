Girl afraid  
Where do his intentions lay ?  
  
Or does he even have any ?  
  
She says :  
  
"He never really looks at me  
I give him every opportunity  
In the room downstairs  
He sat and stared  
In the room downstairs  
He sat and stared  
I'll never make that mistake again !"  
  
I'll never make that mistake again  
I'll never make that mistake again  
  
Boy afraid  
Prudence never pays  
  
And everything she wants costs money  
  
"But she doesn't even like me !  
And I know because she said so  
In the room downstairs  
She sat and stared  
In the room downstairs  
She sat and stared  
I'll never make that mistake again !"
