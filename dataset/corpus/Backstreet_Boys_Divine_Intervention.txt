Brothers fighting brothers  
Lovers fighting lovers  
People barely caring anymore  
Nations hating nations  
Love is lost in the equation  
Wondering why there is still so many wars  
  
It's like this whole world's caught in  
Some crazy storm  
  
We could use some divine intervention  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us  
Find a solution to all this confusion  
  
Lives in desperation  
A world of devestation  
No one knowing where it's gonna go  
We got too many too hungry  
It's time to stop this suffering  
And I don't think we can do it on our own  
  
And right now we need something  
To save our souls  
  
We could use some divine intervention  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us  
Find a solution to all this confusion (we sure could use some)  
  
Show us that our change is gonna come  
Help us to replace the hate with love  
Overflow our hearts with kindness  
Help us lift the clouds out of our way  
  
We could use some divine intervention  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us (yes, God are you listening)  
Find a solution to all this confusion  
  
Gotta find a way (X5)  
  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us?
