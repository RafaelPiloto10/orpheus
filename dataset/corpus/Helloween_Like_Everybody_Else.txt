Dreamer, why don't you think like everybody else?  
People, don't you care 'bout what they say?  
Deceivers, they break you down and make you pay  
Brothers, they don't understand any word you say  
  
All your life you are fighting  
They're trying to force you in  
  
When the time has come  
You'll not be alone  
Cause walls broke down  
They'll see they were wrong  
When the time has come  
There'll be more of you  
With all their strength  
You'll show them the truth  
  
Mistreaters, they don't care, but fear your will  
Sisters, they don't understand any word you say  
  
All your life you are fighting  
They're trying to force you in  
  
When the time has come  
You'll not be alone  
Cause walls broke down  
They'll see they were wrong  
When the time has come  
You ain't no fool  
Cause walls broke down  
They stop being cruel  
When the time has come  
There'll be more of you  
With all their strength  
You'll show them the truth  
  
Dreamer, why can't you be like everybody else?
