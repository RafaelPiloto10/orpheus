[Intro]  
Mmh... Uh...  
  
[Verse 1]  
We're born to fly  
So let's keep living till it all falls down  
Let's close our eyes  
And let the moment drown the whole world out  
  
[Chorus]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together!  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever!  
This one's for you!  
This one's for you... (yeah yeah, hey)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Waving colored flags  
We won't surrender, there's no standing down (no standing down)  
Love's a playing field (oh no)  
It's full of winners, we're breaking new ground  
  
[Chorus]  
We're in this together  
Hear our hearts beat together!  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever! (forever)  
This one's for you!  
This one's for you... (ooh yeah yeah, yeah!)  
  
[Bridge]  
In this together  
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa!  
Uh...  
  
[Chorus]  
We're in this together (we're in this together)  
Hear our hearts beat together!  
We stand strong together  
We're in this forever! (ooh, whoa, yeah)  
This one's for you
