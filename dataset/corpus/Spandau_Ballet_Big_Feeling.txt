Big feeling  
Come next September I'll be out upon the road again  
And there'll be times when I can hardly even say your name  
But now we're sticking to the sheets and I can't sleep tonight  
And like a dream love we're moving into light  
Oh, I feel like this is warning  
And oh I feel like ten feet tall  
And don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh it's getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
Oh come on, darling now day has turned it's time for home  
I won't forget that night we slept out on the beach alone  
Now the sun has come to take the moon and light the sky  
Wave over me flow over me  
Oh, I feel like this is warning  
And oh I feel like ten feet tall  
And don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh, it's getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
(Lighting here inside)  
Feeling inside  
Don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh, it's getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
Big feeling  
Oh come on darling, now day has turned it's time for home  
Big feeling  
I won't forget that night we slept out on the beach alone  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
Lighting here inside
