Why is nothing ever new for long  
And things go wrong in time  
How come love is never new for long  
We feel a change inside  
Things no longer feel the way they did  
People never care the way they did  
Lovers never love the way they did  
Were got to make it last  
Got to fan the spark  
  
People know that love is often cruel  
But still they fall in love  
I believe that only goes to prove  
That loves what we dream of  
  
Even if things can never be the way they were  
But if you just hold on your luck might take a turn  
We should put in practice  
What were learned  
That loves the only way  
We got to make it stay  
  
Life goes on  
Nothins ever new  
Maybe different than before  
You may not believe me  
But nothings ever  
Nothings ever, nothings ever new  
  
Don't know things will never be the same I've heard  
But if you just hold on your luck might take a turn  
We gotta put in practice  
Everything we've learned  
That loves the only way  
We got to make it stay  
  
Life goes on no matter what you do  
And though its crazy, nothings ever  
Nothings ever new  
You may not believe me, but its true  
But nothings ever new
