Breathing each other's lives  
Holding this in mind  
That if we fall, we all fall  
And we fall alone  
The cold insincerity of steel machines  
Have consumed our euphoria  
Transforming us into muted dreams  
Dreaming of the day that  
  
We attack  
Attack, attack your fetal servitude  
We attack  
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide  
We attack  
All the years of propaganda  
We shall attack  
  
Books illustrate what we already know  
Candles cry towards the sky  
Racing your flags along polluted coasts  
Dreaming of the day that  
  
We attack  
Attack, attack your fetal servitude  
We attack  
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide  
We attack  
All the years of propaganda  
We shall attack  
  
Attack  
Attack  
  
Breathing each other's lives  
Holding this in mind  
That if we fall, we all fall  
And we fall alone  
  
Breathing each other's lives  
Holding this in mind  
That if we fall, we all fall  
And we fall alone  
  
What's the philosophy of displaced mines The bombing of all homes and  
Villages Truth is the only sword bleeding minds Bleeding till the day that  
  
We attack  
Attack, attack your fetal servitude  
We attack  
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide  
We attack  
All the years of propaganda  
We shall attack  
  
Attack all the homes and villages  
Attack all the schools and hospitals  
You attack all the rapes and pillages  
We shall attack  
  
We shall attack
