Whenever my head starts to hurt  
Before it goes from bad to feeling worst  
I turn off my phone, I get down low  
And I put my hands in the dirt  
I try to stop the world from moving so fast  
Tryna get a grip on where I'm at  
To simplify this daisy life,  
And get my feet in the grass  
  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
  
The only explanation for our rise,  
Must be that everybody wants to get it high  
And move on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky  
Well, the higher we go, the taller we grow  
We lose sight of our land below  
When you can have your place up in outer space  
'Cause my home is where my food is grown  
  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
  
We are animals  
(We are animals)  
We are wild  
(We are wild)  
Starting with emotions at the bottom of the ocean  
Now we're swinging from the tops of the trees  
Oh, we are animals  
(We are animals)  
We are wild  
(We are wild)  
And we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back,  
To living with the land in harmony  
  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
Two more times around!  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
  
One more time around the World  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back!
