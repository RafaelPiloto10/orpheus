The Lord knows I've tried  
To do what's right  
For five whole long years I stayed home  
Both day and night  
And I smell trouble  
I smell trouble ahead of me  
Yes, worries and trouble  
No they just won't let me be  
People talk about me  
Both night and day  
I cried Lord, please forgive them  
And I go the other way  
I smell trouble  
Lord, I smell trouble ahead of me  
Yes, worries and trouble  
No they just won't let me be  
And from now on  
I will not run and hide  
I'm gonna face trouble with a smile  
And hope they pass me by  
I smell trouble  
Lord, I smell trouble way up there ahead of me  
Yes, worries and trouble  
Lord, they just won't, they just won't  
They just won't let me be, oh, no
