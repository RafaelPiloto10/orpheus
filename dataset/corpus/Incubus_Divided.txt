You are divided  
For now, For now  
  
You are divided  
For now, For now  
  
You are divided  
  
I have a wish, I want to learn  
I wish to see, and I want to affirm  
That what I see in reflection day to day  
Isn't all I am  
  
Say what you see  
When you close your eyes and glide  
The only shell who could  
Circumvent the tide  
Sheds of himself  
That tells us what he knows  
And a piece of him will stay  
When the rest of him  
Goes  
  
You are divided  
For now, For now  
  
You are divided  
  
You are divided  
For now, For now  
  
You are divided  
  
I have a wish, I want to learn  
I wish to see, and I want to affirm  
That what is here, broken record everyday  
Isn't all there is  
  
Say what you see, when you close your eyes and glide  
The only shell, to Circumvent the tide  
Shells out himself, And tells us what he knows  
A piece of him will stay  
A piece of him to stay, helps me grow  
  
The piece of you  
That makes you, you  
That part stays  
You are divided  
  
The piece of you  
That makes you, you  
That part stays  
You are divided  
Ahhhhh, ahhhh  
  
You're only divided  
  
The piece of you  
That makes you, you  
That piece stays  
You are divided  
  
The piece of you  
That makes you, you  
Don't be afraid
