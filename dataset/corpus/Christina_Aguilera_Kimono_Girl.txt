She comes from across the street  
Red lipstick on her lips  
She grabs all the attention  
People know that she's special  
  
She is...  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL!  
She comes this way!  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL!  
You love her, yes!  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
Say!  
  
One day she woke up  
She didn't care about her look  
She went outside  
People looking at her...  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
She's different, yes!  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL!  
Do you love her now?  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
  
Oooh...  
  
You see her like that...  
But inside her heart...  
Pain, fire - much desire...  
Nothing you see is true  
Everything you know is dull  
  
Ooooh, yeeeah, ha!  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
She's different, yes!  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL!  
Do you love her now?  
  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
K.I.M.O.N.O. GIRL...  
  
... do you love her?
