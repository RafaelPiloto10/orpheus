I've met a girl or two in my lifetime and I've loved a few but not the right
time  
  
I think I'm a wastin' my time lovin' anyone but you  
  
You got a hold on me I just can't seem to break free  
  
I walk a girl to town and start to fool around but honey you're the rock in my
shoe  
  
I stroll into the night spots thinkin' that I'm something real hot  
  
I got a pretty girl and she's got a lot but I know she ain't true  
  
It's just not the same I'm playin' a fool's game  
  
Oh when I start to dance and try to make romance honey you're the rock in my
shoe  
  
Now my heart has reached that decision cause my mind keeps havin' a vision  
  
No --- hers and his and and I guess I always knew  
  
You'd make the bells ring and pull my heart strings  
  
I'm walkin' down the aisle with the great big smile  
  
Cause there ain't no rocks in my shoe  
  
  
  
There's always a rock in my shoe when I walk with someone new  
  
I try to find love in another's arms but it seems I just dream of you  
  
Now my heart has reached...  
  
I'm walkin' down the aisle...
