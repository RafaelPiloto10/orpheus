Grab your ticket and your suitcase  
Thunder's rolling down the tracks  
You don't know where you're goin'  
But you know you won't be back  
Darlin' if you're weary  
Lay your head upon my chest  
We'll take what we can carry  
And we'll leave the rest  
  
Big wheels rolling through fields  
Where sunlight streams  
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams  
  
I will provide for you  
And I'll stand by your side  
You'll need a good companion for  
This part of the ride  
Leave behind your sorrows  
Let this day be the last  
Tomorrow there'll be sunshine  
And all this darkness past  
  
Big wheels roll through fields  
Where sunlight streams  
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams  
  
This train  
Carries saints and sinners  
This train  
Carries losers and winners  
This train  
Carries whores and gamblers  
This train  
Carries lost souls  
This train  
Dreams will not be thwarted  
This train  
Faith will be rewarded  
This train  
Hear the steel wheels singin'  
This train  
Bells of freedom ringin'  
This train  
Carries broken-hearted  
This train  
Thieves and sweet souls departed  
This train  
Carries fools and kings  
This train  
All aboard  
  
This train  
Dreams will not be thwarted  
This train  
Faith will be rewarded  
This train  
Hear the steel wheels singin'  
This train  
Bells of freedom ringin'
