When pale turns to pink  
With a soft unnerving ease  
And all you've built around  
May just tumble to the ground  
We stand or fall  
With your future in another's hands  
We stand or fall  
When your life is not your own  
When white turns to red  
In the not too distant days  
Will force and misery  
Be the life you have to lead?  
We stand or fall  
With your children in anothers world  
We stand or fall  
When your town is not your own  
Chorus:  
White China  
White China  
When crimson takes a hold  
When the lights go down on all you've ever known  
When all you'll ever do  
Is worked out for you  
We stand or fall  
When the thoughts you have are not your own  
We stand or fall  
When the freedom slips away  
(Repeat chorus 3 times)
