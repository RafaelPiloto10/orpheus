It's July but it's winter in your mind  
You've been down but never quite this way before  
  
It's a crime to watch the needle take another soul  
Look around see the poison killing people by the score  
  
You've got into something that's leading you nowhere, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
Getting deeper into something, that leaves you with nothing, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
  
Every time you escape into the wilderness  
You will find it's stolen just a little more of you  
  
You say you're fine, but it's only your imagination  
Such a shame, 'cause you've only got yourself to blame  
  
You've got into something that's leading you nowhere, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
Getting deeper into something, that leaves you with nothing, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
  
Such a shame, you've only got yourself to blame  
  
You've got into something that's leading you nowhere, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
Getting deeper into something, that leaves you with nothing, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out
