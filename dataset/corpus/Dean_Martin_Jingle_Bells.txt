Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bop tails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to  
Ride a sleighing song tonight  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Ba la la la bop  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bop tails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to  
Ride a sleighing song tonight  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle Bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh
