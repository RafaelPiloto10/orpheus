Before the tears I've cried  
Have even dried  
She'll be with him  
They'll look in each other's eyes  
And with her lips still warm with lies  
She'll kiss him  
  
And though she knows she's wrong  
She just keeps on  
Keepin' me hangin' on  
Tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
What's a man to do  
When the one he's promised to  
Finds somebody new  
Should I just stand by  
Watch the love I've lived for die  
Lord I wish I knew  
Tell me what's a man to do  
  
Maybe I'll make a stand  
Or should I just wash my hands  
Of her forever  
But I've never been alone  
Except for here at home  
When they're together  
  
And though I know it's wrong  
I let her go on  
Keepin' me hangin' on  
  
[Chorus]
