Like a fighter that lost his will to kill  
You knew it was time to go  
But as I lay in a state of surrender  
You chose me to say your last hello  
Like a fighter that lost his will to kill  
You knew it was time to go  
You came upon me  
  
As I lay in a state of surrender  
You say you're not afraid  
You know me well  
  
Because I felt you die  
Why did you say you would touch me?  
The wind blew sugar-sweet  
As you passed that silver life line
