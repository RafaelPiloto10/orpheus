So I said I'm on the roam, so I need a car  
And I know that I'm gettin' alive  
And I say I got faith and a season  
And I say that's where I'm goin' to  
  
I get a need and I'm wantin' to please it  
I got a face and I'm wantin' to feel it  
The more I feel is the more that I need it  
The more I need is the less I believe it  
  
So I've got a good love by my side  
Keep on gettin' out of love and my pride  
Oh, I know keep hurtin' my love, yeah  
But I swear it ain't killin'  
  
Get a need and I'm wantin' to please it  
Got a face and I'm wantin' to feel it  
I feel is the more that I need it  
All I need is the less I believe it  
  
So I said I'm on the roam, so I need a car  
And I know that I'm stayin' alive  
And I say I got faith and a season  
Well, I say that's where I live  
  
I get a need and I'm wantin' to please it  
I got a face and I'm wantin' to feel it  
The more I feel is the more that I need it  
The more I need is the less I believe it
