2008.. Watch it! Yeah  
Yo Mariah Carey along side Gong Marley Huh  
Natty.. Check it.. Pepper!  
(Y'all know what this is)  
  
[Mariah Carey]  
Can't get him outta my mind  
Can't explain it but it's somethin 'bout him  
Makin' me high  
Like a motor revin' over and over  
It don't stop  
He cruised beside me now  
I'm flyin', drivin'  
  
Through yellow lights  
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide  
Driver's Education 101  
Slipped out of my mind  
I need me a caddy  
With some cruise control  
No, no, no  
  
I've been told so many sagas  
He brings the drama, six baby mamas  
But uh ooh  
I can't resist 'em  
Just want to kiss 'em  
I need cruise control  
  
[Chorus]  
Might need to go slow, I don't know  
Why ease up on the break  
Every time I see his face  
I'm outta control, ah I don't know  
How to stay up in my lane  
Every day and night  
He's cruisin' through my brain  
  
Wherever I go he be cruisin'  
Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it  
Deep down inside don't want to lose him  
He already know I'm willin' to go  
Gotta get on cruise control  
  
C-R-U-I-S-E control  
C-R-U-I-S-E control  
C-R-U-I-S-E control  
C-R-U-I-S-E control  
  
Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'  
When he comes in to view  
Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin'  
On me avenue  
Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block  
They be hopin, to rob the clock me say no man  
Step up step up bottle broken  
Think I'm jokin'  
  
I've been told so many sagas  
He brings the drama, six baby mamas  
But uh ooh  
I can't resist 'em  
Just want to kiss 'em  
I need cruise control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wherever I go he be cruisin'  
Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it  
Deep down inside don't want to lose him  
He already know I'm willin' to go  
Gotta get on cruise control  
  
[Damian Marley]  
You put your hand in cruise control  
And you deny me if you want  
And you will starve yourself of love  
If you don't speed and break the law  
You can't get no speeding ticket  
On the highway to my heart  
And it might be a rocky road  
And you can exit if you want(Why you always..)  
Look at life just like a pessimist  
You already like a wife up in my premises  
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis  
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wherever I go he be cruisin'  
Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it  
Deep down inside don't want to lose him  
He already know I'm willin' to go  
Gotta get on cruise control
