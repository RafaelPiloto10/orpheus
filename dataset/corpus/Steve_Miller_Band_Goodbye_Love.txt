It's not the way that love is meant to be  
You took me by surprise but now I see  
You know this heartache-night is killing me  
(Baby bye-bye)  
Forget the past, honey  
Better try someone new (Baby don't cry)  
There's nothing left here  
For me or for you  
You know this heartache-night  
Will soon be through  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
What's done is done, darling  
This much is true  
It's all over now  
Don't be blue  
You know this heartache-night  
Will soon be through  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Baby bye-bye  
Goodbye love  
Baby bye-bye  
Goodbye love  
Baby bye-bye  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love  
Goodbye love
