Animal, grace in form and power  
Dignity, a conscious thought  
The judgement hour  
  
To live in honor  
Quoting freedom's name  
A noble stance  
Bearing a proudful mane  
Noble savage!  
  
Hope is born, a changeling dawn  
Bringing strange power  
Transform, change form  
Blend mind and matter  
  
A voice of reason crying in the dark  
A raging fire from a spark  
Breathe through me  
  
I'm a savage, I'm a king  
I fought deceivers  
I conquered evil  
  
Animal, grace in form and power  
Dignity,a conscious thought  
The judgement hour  
  
A voice of reason crying in the dark  
A divine vision from the heart  
Breathe through me  
  
I'm a savage, I'm a king  
I fought deceivers  
I conquered evil  
  
Innocent eyes, shine down on me  
Don't, don't, don't blind your eyes to me  
I'm here with you  
Always, again today  
Can you feel me?  
I'm with you  
Never, never surrender  
Oh, the power, the glory is yours  
My kingdom, on high, again  
Can you see?  
I'm with you now...
