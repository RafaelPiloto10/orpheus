There's a place you go after dark  
Where you sell your haunted heart  
In the shadows you look for the friend  
Who'll take you where the sidewalks ends  
And it's a sad affair  
You reach out but no one's there  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Take your hand and hold you tight  
Who'll be the one to make it right  
And promise you paradise  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Turn the darkness into light  
And wipe away the tears you cry  
Just another stranger  
Will be taking you home tonight  
You couldn't see that love was the price  
What happened to the light in your eyes  
Broken dreams fall at your feet  
You stand alone on a dead end street  
So who's gonna hear you prayer  
Look around there's no one there  
He'll tell you dreams come true  
And take you to some rented room  
But when the blinds are drawn  
Another angel will fall  
I guess it's in your blood  
One love just ain't enough  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Take your hand and hold you tight  
Who'll be the one to make it right  
And promise you paradise  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Turn the darkness into light  
And wipe away the tears you cry  
Just another stranger  
Will be taking you home tonight
