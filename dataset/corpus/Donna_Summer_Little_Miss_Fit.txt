There's a good there's a bad  
Some are gay, some are sad  
There's a right, there's a wrong  
Those who fit don't belong  
Well I'm the bad  
And I've got to admit  
That I'm sad  
I'm a little misfit  
I'm in the wrong  
And that's the truth of it  
I don't belong  
I'm a little misfit  
There's the sun there's the rain  
Those in love those in pain  
Some succeed while others fail  
Some will ease someone tells  
Well I'm in the rain  
And I've got to admit  
That I gonna pay  
I'm a little misfit  
Though I've failed  
That's the truth of it  
See me tell  
I'm a little misfit  
Life's so hard when you're far from everything  
Life's so cold when you know you have no friends  
Well I've lost  
And I've got to admit  
That I've paid the cost  
I'm a little misfit  
I still grow  
And that's the truth of it  
I'll always fall  
I'm a little misfit  
Well I'm bad  
And I've got to admit  
That I'm sad  
I'm a little misfit  
Well I'm bad  
And that's the truth of it  
That makes me sad  
I'm a little misfit  
Well I'm lost  
And I've got to admit  
That I've paid the cost  
I'm a little misfit  
I'm so poor
