Bright was the guiding star that led  
With mild, benignant ray  
The Gentiles to the lowly she'd  
Where the Redeemer lay.  
  
But lo! a brighter, clearer, light  
Now points to His abode  
It shines, through sin and sorrow's night  
To guide us to our God.  
  
Oh! haste to follow where it leads  
The gracious call obey  
Be rugged wilds, or flowery meads  
The Christian's destined way.  
  
Oh! gladly tread the narrow path  
While light and grace are given  
Who meekly follow Christ on earth  
Shall reign with Him in Heaven...
