Someone Stood Up For Stephen  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
They grabbed a hold  
Of the preacher boy  
And drug him  
To the edge of the town  
With hate in their eyes  
And rocks in their hands  
They couldn't wait  
To knock him down  
They said,  
He's just another believer  
Getting ready to take a fall  
There's no one here  
Who can save him  
There's nobody here he can call  
chorus:  
But someone stood up for Stephen  
He wasn't standing alone  
Someone stood up for Stephen  
At the Father's throne  
The sky opened up  
And the clouds rolled away  
Stephen saw Jesus and then  
Someone stood up for Stephen  
When Stephen stood up for Him  
Stephen kept right on preaching  
He just wouldn't back down  
He was living for Jesus  
No matter who was around  
Oh, they just couldn't stop him  
Now matter how they tried  
Stephen knew that to live is Christ  
And Christians never die  
chorus  
Don't you know  
You can trust the Lord?  
His Holy Word is true  
If you stand up for Him  
I know He'll stand up for you
