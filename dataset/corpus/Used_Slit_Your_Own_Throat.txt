I gotta take this moment  
Just to push you down  
Spin you around with the foot on the back of your neck  
Up on the curb with the pressure on your teeth  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
  
I watched the rain make a puddle to get you soaked  
The swollen words crack coming out of your throat  
A sticky time for the shallow believer  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
  
I swear your head is bigger than us all  
Getting bigger  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
You're more turned on than anyone could be by yourself  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
  
Just like a tick like an itch in the back of your throat  
You missed the beat while they're hanging on every note  
You're gonna choke cause you swallowed a problem  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
  
I see the flood see the terror that gets you soaked  
These kind of thoughts that you bleed I fuckin' already wrote  
Its tragic times for the shallow believer  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
  
I swear your head is bigger than us all  
Getting bigger  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
You're more turned on than anyone could be by yourself  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
  
I gotta take this moment  
Just to push you down  
Spin you around with my foot on the back of your neck  
Up on the curb with the pressure on your teeth  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
  
I watched the rain make a puddle to get you soaked  
The swollen words they crack coming out of your throat  
Sticky times for the shallow believer  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
  
I swear your head is bigger than us all  
Getting bigger  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
You're more turned on than anyone could be by yourself  
  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
Go slit your own throat!  
Slit your own throat!  
  
Your gonna take this!  
Your gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!  
Not gonna take this!
