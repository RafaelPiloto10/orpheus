A world as silent as the morning snow  
Lombard and Gabble on the lately show  
It's the time we both remember  
The things we love the best  
Winter nights before the fire  
You head up on my tears  
  
Sentimental lady, you're living in a world of days gone by  
Sentimental lady, you loved the movies that made you cry  
That's what makes me love you  
You see the world in a rozy glow  
You're my lady, my sentimental lady  
  
Old Brando and we loved James Dean  
The king was Elvis and Monroe was the queen  
Let's play those golden oldies  
The words of love so true  
Then we love the night away  
Like we used to do
