Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side  
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide  
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere  
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies round this rockin' chair  
  
My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be  
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see  
Old rockin' chair gets it, judgment day is here  
Chained to my rockin' chair  
  
Old rockin' chair's got me, son  
(Rocking chair got you, father)  
My cane by my side  
(Yes, your cane by your side)  
  
Now fetch me a little gin, son  
(Ain't got no gin, father)  
What? 'fore I tan your hide, now  
(You're gonna tan my hide)  
  
You know, I can't get from this old cabin  
(What cabin? Joking)  
I ain't goin' nowhere  
(Why ain't you goin' nowhere?)  
  
Just sittin' me here grabbin'  
(Grabbin')  
At the flies round this old rockin' chair  
(Rockin' chair)  
  
Now you remember dear old aunt Harriet  
(Aunt Harriet)  
How long in Heaven she be?  
(She's up in Heaven)  
  
Send me down, send me down sweet  
(Sweet chariot)  
Chariot  
End of this trouble I see  
(I see, Daddy)  
  
Old rockin' chair gets it, son  
(Rocking chair get it, father)  
Judgment day is here, too  
(Your judgment day is here)  
Chained to my rockin', old rockin' chair
