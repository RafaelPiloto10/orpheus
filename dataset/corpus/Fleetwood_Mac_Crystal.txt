Do you always trust your first initial feeling  
Special knowledge holds true, bear believing  
  
I turned around and the water was closing all around like a glove  
Like the love that finally found me.  
Then I knew in the crystaline knowledge of you  
Drove me through the mountains  
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain  
Drove me like a magnet  
To the sea  
To the sea  
  
How the faces of love have changed turning the pages  
And I have changed, oh, but you, you remain ageless  
  
I turned around and the water was closing all around like a glove  
Like the love that finally found me.  
Then I knew in the crystaline knowledge of you  
Drove me though the mountains  
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain  
Drove me like a magnet  
To the sea  
To the sea
