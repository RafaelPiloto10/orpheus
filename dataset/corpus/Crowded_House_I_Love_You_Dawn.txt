I love you Dawn  
You understand  
The strength of ten  
Men in your hands  
  
It was another time  
It was another place  
All is not lost  
And gone to waste  
  
Beneath the tall trees I believe  
There's nothing you and me  
Can't do together if we try  
The day is long and the nights are cold  
  
Just a song to warm your soul  
I don't want to see you cry  
I love you Dawn  
You understand  
  
The strength of ten  
Men in your hands  
It was another tear  
It was another time  
  
All is not lost  
And we will shine  
Beneath the billboards and the hordes  
Magazines and rock awards  
  
We can't afford to pay our bills  
The day is long and the nights are cold  
Just a song to warm your soul  
I don't want to see you cry  
  
I love you Dawn  
You understand  
The strength of ten  
Men in your hands  
  
It was another tear, another year  
Another time  
All is not lost  
And we will shine
