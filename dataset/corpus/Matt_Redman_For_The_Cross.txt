I will love you for the cross  
And I will love you for the cost  
Man of sufferings  
Bringer of my peace  
You came into a world of shame  
And paid the price we could not pay  
Death that brought me life  
Blood that brought me home  
Death that brought me life  
Blood that brought me home  
Chorus:  
And I love you for the cross  
I'm overwhelmed by the mystery  
I love you for the cost  
That Jesus you would do this for me  
When you were broken, you were beaten,  
You were punished, I go free  
You were wounded and rejected  
In your mercy - I am healed  
Jesus Christ the sinners friend  
Does this kindness know no bounds  
With your precious blood you have purchased me  
Oh the mystery of the cross  
You were punished you were crushed  
But that punishment has become my peace  
Yes that punishment has become my peace  
Chorus  
By your wounds I am healed  
For the cross, for the cross, for the cross I thank you  
Oh Lord, for the cross, for the cross  
Chorus
