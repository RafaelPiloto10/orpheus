I've come across the desert  
To greet you with a smile  
My camel looks so tired  
It's hardly worth my while  
To tell you of my travels  
Across the golden east  
I see your preparations  
Invite me first to the feast  
Take me I'm yours  
Because dreams are made of this  
Forever there'll be  
A heaven in your kiss  
  
Amusing belly dancers  
Distract me from my wine  
Across Tibetan mountains  
Are memories of mine  
I've stood some ghostly moments  
With natives in the hills  
Recorded here on paper  
My chills and thrills and spills  
Take me I'm yours  
Because dreams are made of this  
Forever there'll be  
A heaven in your kiss  
  
It's really been some welcome  
You never seem to change  
A grape to tempt your leisure  
Romantic gestures strange  
My eagle flies tomorrow  
It's a game I treasure dear  
To seek the helpless future  
My love at last I'm here  
Take me I'm yours  
Because dreams are made of this  
Forever there'll be  
A heaven in your kiss
