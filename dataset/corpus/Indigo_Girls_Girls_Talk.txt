There are some things you can't cover up  
With lipstick and powder  
I thought I heard you mention my name  
Can't you talk any louder  
Don't come any closer don't come any nearer  
My vision of you can't get any clearer  
Oh I wanna hear girls talk  
  
I got a loaded imagination  
Being fired by girls talk  
Oh but I can't say what you want to hear  
I suppose were gonna have to play it by ear  
Right here and now  
Girls talk and they want to know how  
Girls talk and they say its not allowed  
Girls talk if they say that its so  
Don't you think that I know by now  
  
That they word upon everyones lips  
That your dedicated  
Although you may be an old fashioned girl  
Your still gonna get dated  
Ah was it really murder  
Were you just pretending  
Lately I have heard you are the living end  
Girls talk and they want to know about her  
Girls talk they want to know if I care  
Girls talk and they want to know where  
I just want to hear girls talk  
  
I gotta loaded imagination  
Being fired by girls talk  
Oh but I can't say what you want to hear  
I suppose were gonna have to play it by ear  
Right here and now  
Girls talk and they want to know how  
Girls talk and they say its not allowed  
Girls talk  
Girls talk and they want to know about her  
You know they want to know where  
Wanna know if I care  
I said girls talk
