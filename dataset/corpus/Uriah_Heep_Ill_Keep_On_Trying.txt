You came to me  
With all of your lies  
And I was taken in so well  
It took me quite a time  
To see the disguise  
You made it very hard to tell  
Now here you are again  
But you're begging in vain  
'Cause I really don't want to know  
  
You came to me  
With a little bit of charm  
You had me down on my knees  
I didn't really think  
There was any harm  
But all you ever did was tease  
You took all the love  
That I ever had to give  
There was nothing left to show  
  
Well, I remember everything  
Everything around me  
The long dark of winter  
Till the breath of spring  
Came close enough to drown me  
  
So I'm gonna keep on trying  
Till I feel like dying  
And I lay down and pass away  
But that won't happen till tomorrow  
And by then I can  
Borrow another day  
So I'm gonna keep on trying
