Wake me if you're out there  
Through the glass in my bedroom window,  
In the bushes far below,  
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow,  
  
Among the ones I so clearly know.  
I've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged,  
With a note on the rocking chair,  
That says I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,  
  
So wake me if you're out there.  
Living close to the ground,  
It's seventh heaven because there are angels all around,  
Among my frivolous thoughts,  
  
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.  
So wake me if you're out there  
Wake me if you're out there  
In the dust on my cellar staircase,  
  
A pair of footprints followed me,  
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace,  
Blinked again, but there was nothing to see.  
I've been leaving all the windows unlocked,  
  
With a basket by the oak tree,  
'Cause I'll be picking up the acorns that fall off,  
If you'll be climbing up to meet me.  
Living close to the ground!  
  
It's seventh heaven because there are angels all around,  
Among my frivolous thoughts,  
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.  
So wake me if you're out there!  
  
I keep my knees black and blue 'cause they often hit the hardwood floor,  
(Wake me if you're out there),  
And I believe, so I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore,  
I've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged,  
  
With a note on the rocking chair that says I'm dreaming of the life I once
loved,  
So wake me if you're out there.  
Living close to the ground!  
It's seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around,  
  
Among my frivolous thoughts,  
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts  
The indications reveal,  
(Wake me if you're out there),  
  
That few of us realize life is quite so real,  
So if you're dying to see,  
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity  
So if you're dying to see,  
  
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
