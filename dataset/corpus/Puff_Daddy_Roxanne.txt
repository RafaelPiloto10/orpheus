[Puff]  
Yeah ye ye yeah yeah Sting Bad Boy remix come on  
  
[Pras]  
Yo yo yo  
Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto  
Pour out the bottle blow out the candle  
Too broke to hold too shallow to handle  
Get all today you never promised tomorrow  
Yeah her moves remind me of kung fu flicks  
Thick lips that contradicts rules of the game  
She plays the politics  
Red light special red light district  
Put on ya make up body all made up  
Platinum played up Pearl Jam cut up  
Roxanne Roxanne you don't really have to  
Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue  
She got the hots for the disco jocks  
Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops  
Never get cool like to call it Glock  
Twisted minded like Bob Zealot  
  
Roxanne  
(Roxanne Roxanne)  
  
You don't have to put on the red light (ye ye ye yeah yeah)  
Those days are over  
You don't have to sell your body to the night (c'mon)(Roxanne Roxanne)  
Roxanne Roxanne  
Roxanne  
You don't have to wear that dress tonight (remix)  
Walk the streets for money  
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right (ye ye yeah)  
  
Verse Two:  
  
Yo what's the haps girl, dancing for the green paperback  
Sitting at the bar drinking up Cognac  
She steps in the room, don't know how to act  
Sweet in emergence, similar to Similac  
It was the hat  
Cats wanna be around her shine  
She wants to party, have a good time  
She feels kind of hot me feelin' feelin' fine  
Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine  
Bro making the streets she's the pimper's paradise  
Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice  
She said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan  
Of the refugees down from the islands  
Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends  
Sippin' colada every day is a weekend  
Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn  
And fifteen million place with your total sound scan  
  
I loved you since I knew you (I like this part, Roxanne Roxanne)  
I wouldn't talk down to you  
I have you to tell just how I feel (Roxanne Roxanne)  
I won't share you with another boy (Ye ye ye yeah yeah)  
I know my mind is made up (Roxanne Roxanne)  
So put away your makeup (Roxanne Roxanne)  
Told you once I wont tell you again  
It's a bad way (Ye ye yeah, yeah)  
  
Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light x2  
  
Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man  
Put on the red light  
Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man  
Put on the red light  
Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man  
Put on the red light  
  
Repeat until end
