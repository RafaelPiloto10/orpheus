Youve got to get up every morning  
With a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart.  
Then people gonna treat you better.  
Youre gonna find, yes you will,  
That youre beautiful as you feel.  
  
Waiting at the station with the workday wind a blowin,  
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers by.  
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing,  
And they don't see it showing. Why do i?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I have often asked myself  
The reason for the sadness  
In a world where tears are just a lullaby.  
And if theres any answer,  
Maybe love can end the madness.  
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try.  
  
[chorus out]
