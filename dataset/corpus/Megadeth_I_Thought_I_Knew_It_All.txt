Somewhere there's a reason why things go like they do  
Somewhere there's a reason why some things just fall through  
We don't always see them for what they really are  
But I know there's a reason just can't see it from this far  
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice  
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice  
I thought I knew it all  
I thought I had it made  
How could it end this way?  
I thought I knew  
Somewhere there's a reason why things don't go my way  
Somewhere there's a reason that I cannot explain  
Just like the change of season, just may not be my turn  
But I know there's a reason, the lesson's mine to learn
