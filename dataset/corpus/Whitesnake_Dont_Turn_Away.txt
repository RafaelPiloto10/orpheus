You say your dreams are burned to ashes  
And your smiles have turned to tears,  
It seems to me you welcome sanest  
As you surrender to your fears  
  
So what's a man like me supposed to do  
When all I want is just to make love to you  
  
Don't turn away, before the night is over  
Don't turn away, before the night is gone  
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer  
So don't turn away, before the night,  
Before the night is gone  
  
You say your heart is lost forever  
And you're always gonna give your love in vain  
So you paint yourself a lonely portrait  
And hide your love away again  
  
You turn away from what you feel inside,  
You can't forget all your foolish pride  
  
Don't turn away, before the night is over  
Don't turn away, before the night is gone  
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer  
So don't turn away, before the night is gone  
  
So now I'm asking you this question  
Am I gonna give you all my love in vain  
Do you want to drown in your own sorrow  
Or are you gonna try to love again  
  
Don't turn away from what you feel inside,  
You should try to forget about all your foolish pride  
  
Don't turn away, before the night is over  
Don't turn away, before the night is gone  
Don't turn away, the night may hold the answer  
So don't turn away, before the night,  
Before the night,  
Before the night is gone  
  
Don't turn away from me baby,  
No, no, no, no.  
Don't put me away,  
Don't walk away from me darling  
I need your love,  
Oh baby,  
I need your love to rescue me,  
An' I'm coming for you, baby
