Well take me to my car now  
But the car won't go  
Try to get next to you baby  
Ain't got no place to go  
Taste better than a t-bone steak  
Excitement on the side  
If we don't find some place to get off  
Gonna lose it on the ride  
Well you and me baby, go hand in hand  
Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man  
Well you and me baby, go hand in hand  
Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man  
I wanna take you in my room  
Make them sleepers cry  
Got a feeling down inside  
You know it ain't no lie  
You and me just in my room  
When the circle comes around  
No misfortune in your life  
When your feet have left the ground  
Well you and me baby, go hand in hand  
Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man  
Well you and me baby, go hand in hand  
Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man  
Room shaking in the car now  
And the car won't go  
Try and get next to you baby  
Ain't got no place to go  
Taste better than a t-bone steak  
Excitement on the side  
If we don't find some place to get off  
Gonna lose it on the ride  
Well you and me baby, go hand in hand  
Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man  
Well you and me baby, go hand in hand  
Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man
