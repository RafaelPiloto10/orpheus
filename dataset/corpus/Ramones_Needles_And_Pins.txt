I saw her today, I saw her face  
It was the face of love, and I knew  
I had to run away  
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away  
And still it begins, needles and pins  
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide  
Oh I thought I was smart, I stole her heart  
I didn't think I'd do, but now I see  
She's worth to him than me, let her go ahead  
Take his love instead, and one day she will see  
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees  
Oh that's how it begins, she'll feel those needle and pins  
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her  
Why can't stop, and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong  
Why can't I stand up, and tell myself I'm strong  
Because, saw her today, I saw her face  
It was the face of love, and I knew  
I had to run away  
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away  
And still it begins, needles and pins  
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide  
Needle and pins, needle and pins, needle and pins
