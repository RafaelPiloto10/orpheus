Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He'll be making a list, checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good oh, for goodness sake  
  
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He got the little thin flute, little toy drums  
Rooty toot toot and a ronty tont tont  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Kids in girl and boy land, have a jubilee  
He's gonna build a toy land  
All around the Christmas tree, oh  
  
You better not pout, better not cry  
Better watch out, watch out I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming, now this is serious  
Santa Claus is coming, Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Oh, you better watch out
