Needles stabbed into the walls  
The executioners curtain call  
Fighting back he found his life drowning  
And there was no way up  
  
Cause Richard hung himself  
Richard hung himself  
It happened just the other day  
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf  
He thought he find a better way  
With slashing, and stabbing, and manning and ramming  
  
Death room with black curtains  
Where his clothes once laid  
The roof kicked out and the rope tied to the rafters  
A quick kick of the chair  
And it's all through  
If Richie only knew  
  
Cause Richard hung himself  
Richard hung himself  
It happened just the other day  
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf  
He thought he find a better way  
With needles, injecting and shooting himself contagiously  
  
His life suddenly flashed right before his eyes  
What a swinging guy  
Turning gray with mold  
This is when he died  
  
Give it up give up  
Throw it all away  
  
Burning acid bath  
Pulmonary wrath  
Feel the boiling surge  
It won't let you go  
  
Throw it all away [Repeat x2]  
Throw it all a [Repeat x2]  
Throw it all away  
  
Swinging in his room  
Richie won't come out to play  
That poor bastard hung himself the other day  
Oh how the years seem to fly by  
Is death the final high  
  
Cause Richard hung himself  
Richard hung himself  
It happened the other day  
Jesus caught and pushed him off the shelf  
He thought he find a better way  
With slashing and stabbing and ripping  
And stabbing and shredding and slashing  
And shredding and stabbing and ripping  
And tearing attacking and manning  
And taking the body god gave to you  
  
I gotta get out  
  
Cause Richard hung himself  
Cause Richard swung himself  
Cause Richard strung himself  
The needles stung himself  
It pulled him off the shelf  
Cause Richard hung himself
