I liked going to school,  
I didn't want to fool around with drugs  
Cause all of my friends were dropping out  
I had to get stuff done, I wasn't fun  
I didn't try pot 'til I was 21,  
but now I'm overcompensating  
  
I'd like to see what morning looks like  
Don't wanna drink pint after pint  
I wanna wake up without feeling sick  
But I can't cause I'm a drug-abusing alcoholic  
I can't cause I'm a drug-abusing alcoholic  
I can't cause I'm a drug-abusing alcoholic  
I can't cause I'm a drug-abusing alcoholic  
  
At 28 I realized  
hydrocodone was pretty great  
For hangovers and late night hangs  
I decided to spend my life having the best of times  
It's too bad most of them I'll probably forget  
  
And now I know what morning looks like  
But only when I greet it from the previous night  
My friends are telling me that I need to find a clinic  
But I won't cause I'm a drug-addicted alcoholic  
I won't cause I'm a drug-addicted alcoholic  
I won't cause I'm a drug-addicted alcoholic  
I won't cause I'm a drug-addicted alcoholic  
  
Can't stop taking drugs
