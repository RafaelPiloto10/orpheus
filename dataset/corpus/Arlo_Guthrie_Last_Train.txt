I want to hop on the last train in the station  
Won't need to get yourself prepared  
When you're on that last train for glory  
You'll know you're reasonably there  
  
Maybe you ain't walked on any highway  
You've just been flyin' in the air  
But if you're on that last train to glory  
You'll know you must have paid your fare  
  
Maybe you've been lying down in the jailhouse  
Maybe you are hungry and poor  
Maybe your ticket on the last train to glory  
Is the stranger who is sleeping on your floor  
  
I ain't a man of constant sorrow  
I ain't seen trouble all day long  
We are only passengers on the last train to glory  
That will soon be long, long gone  
  
I want to hop on the last train in the station  
Won't need to get yourself prepared  
When you're on the last train to glory  
You'll know you're reasonably there
