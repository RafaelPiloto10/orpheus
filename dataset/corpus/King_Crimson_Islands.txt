Earth, stream and tree encircled by sea  
Waves sweep the sand from my island.  
My sunsets fade.  
Field and glade wait only for rain  
Grain after grain love erodes my  
High weathered walls which fend off the tide  
Cradle the wind  
To my island.  
  
Gaunt granite climbs where gulls wheel and glide  
Mournfully glide o'er my island.  
My dawn bride's veil, damp and pale,  
Dissolves in the sun.  
Love's web is spun, cats prowl, mice run  
Wreathe snatch-hand briers where owls know my eyes  
Violet skies  
Touch my island,  
Touch me.  
  
Beneath the wind turned wave  
Infinite peace  
Islands join hands  
'Neathe heaven's sea.  
  
Dark harbor quays like fingers of stone  
Hungrily reach from my island.  
Clutch sailor's words, pearls and gourds  
Are strewn on my shore.  
Equal in love, bound in circles.  
Earth, stream and tree return to the sea  
Waves sweep sand from my island,  
From me.
