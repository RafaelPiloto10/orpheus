All This time  
I knew some day you'd need to find  
Something that you left behind  
Something I can't give you  
  
All these tears  
And like a night love disappears  
My heart's so good for souvenirs  
And memories are forever  
  
[Chorus]  
All This time  
All and all I've no regrets  
The sun still shines the sun still sets  
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets  
Oh what will I do now with all this time?  
  
One more kiss  
Even though it's come to this  
I'll close my eyes and make a wish  
Hoping you'll remember  
  
[Chorus]  
All This time  
All and all I've no regrets  
The sun still shines the sun still sets  
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets  
Oh what will I do now with all this time?  
  
Say Goodbye  
A bond will make another try  
Don't be sorry if you cry  
I'll be crying too  
  
All this day...  
  
[Chorus]  
All This time  
All and all I've no regrets  
The sun still shines the sun still sets  
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets  
Oh what will I do now with all this time?
