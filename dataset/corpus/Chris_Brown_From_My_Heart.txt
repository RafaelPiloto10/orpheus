Verse 1  
  
Love jus hear me out for a second  
Mind if I ask you a question  
Have you ever had a man that would make you cry.  
  
Baby jus look into my eyes  
Now doesn't it feels nice  
To express how I love you.  
  
Your my sweetheart from every sign above  
With passionate kinds of love  
I wanna give to you.  
  
Chorus:  
  
Baby girl I wanna give my all to you  
There's nothing in this world I would'nt do.  
And to give you my heart  
Means everything to me,  
And to give you my heart  
From the sky to the doves and the sea  
Baby from my heart  
That's how much you mean to me.
