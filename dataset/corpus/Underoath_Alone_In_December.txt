You always amazed me  
But that's the past  
I kept silent and it rained for days  
My inside were drenched  
But I guess that's the part of growing up  
I never wanted to learn  
And I grew into the man  
That you never knew  
But I wouldn't be this way  
If it wasn't for you  
A hundred thank you's  
It this is love  
Fairy tales never came true  
Judie's are black in full bloom  
And I died in the womb  
Take it back, all that's gone  
It's all still there like you left it  
December stayed the same  
Nothing ever changed but you  
Every dream civered in dents  
Love can't fly tonight  
Couples will rest, I'll be sleepless  
So cry yourself to sleep  
This is about broken hearts  
This is about me  
Bending again for nothing  
I'd run to you but pain awaits  
I'm coming home  
But I'll be late  
No deeper than imagination can be  
Sight with nothing to see  
What's faith if I can't believe  
It's everything  
A cure, but I make it a disease  
God take me because I hate me
