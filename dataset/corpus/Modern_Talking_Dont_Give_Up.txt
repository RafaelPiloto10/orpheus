Walk away don't say goodbye  
Turn around, don't let it die  
Love will find a way to you  
Feelings and emotions  
Are just like stormy oceans  
Can you stay the way you are  
Heaven knows you come so far  
Love will find a way to you  
So promise me forever  
There will never be a never  
  
Baby, don't, don't give up  
If your heart is broken  
Make a brand new start  
Baby, don't, don't give up  
Count to ten  
Start again  
  
Don't give up  
Hold on tight  
Find the way  
See the light  
Don't give up  
Hold on tight  
Let your love make it right  
Don't give up  
Hold on tight  
Don't let love out of sight  
Then you'll never be alone  
  
Need a friend  
So count on me  
All the things in life for free  
Love will find a way to you  
Baby, keep on trying  
Love will keep on flying  
Oh, you think you lost your way  
Tomorrow is another day  
Love will find a way to you  
Shadows will be falling  
Dreams keep on calling
