E per noi un piacere augurarvi insieme  
Ai are. E. M. Un buon cetriolo  
(It is a pleasure for us to wish you, together  
With are. E. M., a merry cucumber)  
I need a song to help along  
When it feels wrong it seems so long  
To get to the light  
We live in homes talk on phones  
Hear the tones can you hold  
Moving fast as light tv's on at night  
Does peace come out of fighting  
Can truths come out of lying  
I'm happy when I'm crying  
If reality is what I see newspapers mag-azines tv  
Tell's what's going on leading us along  
It's not absurd to all get heard  
Put our feelings into words  
You have to reach inside no feelings to hide  
Does peace from out of fighting  
Can truth come out of lying  
I'm happy when I'm crying  
Bring children into the world  
We couldn't have done it by ourselves  
Stop and wonder why  
There's more than meets the eye  
Somewhere inside I did believe  
I can't belong I was wrong  
I have gained insight  
I will see the light  
Truth isn't lying  
Peace isn't fighting  
Love isn't dying
