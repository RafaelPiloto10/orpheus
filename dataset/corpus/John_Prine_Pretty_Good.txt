I got a friend in Fremont  
He sells used cars, ya know  
Well, he calls me up twice a year  
Just ask me how'd it go  
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain  
Actually everything is just about the same  
I met a girl from Venus, and her insides were lined in gold  
Well, she did what she did said "How was it, kid?"  
She was politely told  
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain  
But actually everything is just about the same."  
Moonlight makes me dizzy  
Sunlight makes me clean  
Your light is the sweetest thing  
That this boy has ever seen  
Molly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog  
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods  
And got pinned up against a log  
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain  
Cause actually all them dogs is just about the same  
Moonlight makes me dizzy  
Sunlight makes me clean  
Your light is the sweetest thing  
That this boy has ever seen  
I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast  
And up the sky and Arabian rabbi  
Fed Quaker oats to a priest  
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain  
Cause actually all them gods is just about the same  
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain  
Cause actually everything is just about the same
