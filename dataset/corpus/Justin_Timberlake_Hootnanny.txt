I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny

Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport  
'n told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door  
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for[??]  
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more  
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug  
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love  
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was  
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother??  
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'  
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening  
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck[?] is all that's glistenin'  
Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined  
I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built  
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt  
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt  
Y'all matter less everytime this margarita tilt

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear  
Get some show money from ugly and buy a keg of beer  
And another pig to give my other pigs some company  
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary  
In due time, but there's business left to attend to  
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to  
And another? Before my great aunt Missy  
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy  
Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about  
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout  
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good  
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could  
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy  
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me  
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop  
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen???

I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery  
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be  
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally  
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be  
An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable  
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable  
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual  
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable  
Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now  
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found  
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown  
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds  
  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny
