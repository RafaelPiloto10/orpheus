Yea, yea, yea, yea  
This is the Carter motherfucker, yea  
And in my building I must keep it real  
  
And man I miss the times, we would shine, you would keep on your side  
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry  
Then we get on the line and go over our lines  
We were in the same position and that's when you change position, shit  
I never change and I miss ya, and its strange but I never forget ya  
Throw that at you and them bitches homie  
And I know that ain't you wit that dissing on me  
That's why I never replied and never will just let em live phony  
If ya ever died I swear to God I got yo kids homie  
What's mine is their I gotta give homie, and yea  
We still a army in this bitch homie  
Yea Cash Money still the shit homie, shit homie  
What's really real is you feeling me nigga  
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word the giggity nigga  
And I ain't got time to speak the history  
I miss you and I know you missing  
Gizzle but  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Man I miss my dogs(yea)  
Many nights club popping(yea)  
Many nights we were blowing trees(yea)  
Many nights we were hustling(yea)  
Man I miss my dogs(yea)  
Me and you through thick and thin(yea)  
Me and you through the very end(yea)  
For only you I was in the game(yea)  
  
And I remember when you came to the click  
I had already made my name in the click, but you got famous and shit  
I got my soldier rag and dangled my shit  
I was down to just to hang wit you shit  
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click  
And I ain't even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit  
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat  
At them shows while you performed and posed  
I was waiting for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to duck  
Cause you my brother chump  
Real Gs never buckle up  
But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real  
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down  
Even if you turned around motherfucker  
But history is history  
I miss you and I know you missing me  
Juve but  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You was my nigga, my nerd, my joy, my herb  
My main motherfucking man Turk  
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father  
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved  
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept  
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left  
Remember how we played to the left  
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self  
Member B and Slim leaving, hand the ki's over  
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia  
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas  
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunna  
Yea those were the times my brother  
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother  
Yea nigga sub mage my brother, the Sqad's my brother  
The nigga you left behind is my brothers  
  
[Chorus: x2]
