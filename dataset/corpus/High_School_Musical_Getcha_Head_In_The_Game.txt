Coach said to fake right and Break left  
Watch out for the pick  
And keep your eye on defense  
You gotta run the give and go  
And take the ball to the hole  
But don't be afraid  
To shoot the outside J  
  
Just keep yah head in the game  
Just keep yah head in the game  
And Don't be afraid to shoot the outside J  
Just keep yah head in the game  
  
You gotta get'cha get'cha head in the game  
We gotta get our get our get our get our head in the game (x4)  
  
Lets make sure that we get the rebound  
'Cause when we get it the crowd will go wild  
A second chance gotta grab it and go  
Maybe this time we'll hit the right notes  
  
Wait a minute  
It's not the time or place  
Wait a minute  
Get my head in the game  
Wait a minute  
Get my head in the game  
Wait a minute

I gotta  
Get my, get my head in the game  
You gotta  
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game  
(Repeat 4x)  
  
Why am I feeling so wrong  
My head's in the game  
But my heart's in the song  
She makes this feel so right  
  
(Spoken)  
Should I go for it  
Better shake this, yikes!  
  
I gotta  
Get my, get my head in the game  
You gotta  
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game  
(Repeat 4x)
