Considering  
So many folks, dissatisfied with everything,  
Who need someone to understand they're lonely, they're lonely,  
And they're not alone.  
  
And everywhere  
They shrug their shoulders, tell themselves that they don't care,  
And all the while they make believe they're happy, oh they're happy,  
But not really.  
  
And they're asked to hold the world together,  
Make it happen, give it children,  
Who in turn are turning on to going nowhere.  
And all the strength they'd ever need to help them  
Has been wasted, remains hidden,  
In the confusion of going nowhere.  
  
And who am I  
To criticize the world that I have grown up in.  
Most of you would tell me that I'm crazy, yes I'm crazy,  
I can't help it.  
  
I understand  
That where you are is where you've been so many years,  
And things that tend to change you, tend to hurt you, yes they hurt you,  
Very deeply.  
  
And still you try to hold the world together,  
Make it happen, give it children  
Who in turn are turning on to going nowhere.  
And all the strength they'd ever need to help them  
Has been wasted, remains hidden,  
In the confusion of going nowhere,  
Going nowhere,  
Going, going, going nowhere,  
Going nowhere.
