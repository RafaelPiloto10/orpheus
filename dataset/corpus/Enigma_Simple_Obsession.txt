Simple Obsession  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
  
What about us  
Let's think about tomorrow  
With you not in my life  
What about love  
As I try to make it every day  
I live even for the day  
Out of what you go  
For it's hard to say goodbye  
  
My simple obsession  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
I don't know what I'm gonna do without you  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
What about it  
(What about us)  
My simple obsession  
  
What about love  
Everyday I'm fighting from this pain  
I'm doin' everything to be alright  
What about love  
As my beating heart keeps tellin' me  
I don't want nobody in live but you  
I don't want to go  
For it's hard to say goodbye  
  
My simple obsession  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
I don't know what I'm gonna do without you  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
What about love  
(What about us)  
My simple obsession  
  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
My simple simple simple obsession  
My simple simple simple obsession  
My simple simple simple obsession  
My simple simple my simple obsession  
(What about us)  
What about love  
What about live  
I don't know what I'm gonna do without you  
(What about us)  
What about it  
What about it  
What about love  
What about live  
What about pain  
What about love  
(What about us)  
(What about us)  
Oh my simple obsession  
(What about us)
