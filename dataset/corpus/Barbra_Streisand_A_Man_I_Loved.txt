I'll tell you a story  
'bout a man that i loved  
He lives in the sky  
In the clouds above  
He knows every river  
Every mountain and stream  
He's a gentleman, i tell you,  
That lives in my dream  
If you don' t believe  
What i say is true  
Maybe someday he will happen to you  
It's like he's always watching over me  
I do believe in magic  
When it's plain to see  
If you don't believe  
What i say is true  
Maybe someday he will happen to you  
Softly he whispers into my ear  
The dream is over, but i don't want to hear  
No, no, no, no  
Softly he whispers into my ear  
The dream is over, but i don't want to hear  
So, take me, i' m lonely  
Take me in your dreams  
Please don't leave me waiting here  
As long as it seems  
If you don't believe  
What i say is true  
Maybe, baby, someday he will happen to you  
Softly he whispers into my ear  
The dream is over, but i don't want to hear  
But i don't want to hear...i don't want to hear  
I don't wanna...i don't want to hear...
