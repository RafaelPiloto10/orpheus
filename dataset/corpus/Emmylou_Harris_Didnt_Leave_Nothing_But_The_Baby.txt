Go to sleep you little baby  
  
Go to sleep you little baby  
  
Your momma's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay  
  
Don't leave nobody but the baby  
  
Go to sleep you little baby  
Go to sleep you little baby  
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn  
Didn't leave nobody but the baby  
  
Your sweet little baby  
  
Your sweet little baby  
  
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop  
  
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby  
  
Don't you weep pretty baby  
Don't you weep pretty baby  
She's long gone with her red shoes on  
Gonna need another loving baby  
  
Go to sleep little baby  
  
Go to sleep little baby  
  
You and me and the devil makes three  
  
Don't need no other loving baby  
  
Go to sleep you little baby  
Go to sleep you little baby  
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones  
  
And be my ever loving baby
