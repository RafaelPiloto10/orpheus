I burned my hand, I cut my face  
Heaven knows how long it's been  
Since I've felt so out of place  
I'm wonderin' if I'll fit in  
  
Debbie and Charley said they'd be here by nine  
And Deb said she might bring a friend  
Just my luck, they're right on time  
So here I go again  
  
I'm gonna smile my best smile  
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style  
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see  
That learning to live again is killing me  
  
Little cafe, table for four  
But there's just conversation for three  
I like the way she let me get the door  
I wonder what she thinks of me  
  
Debbie just whispered, "You're doin' fine"  
And I wish that I felt the same  
She's asked me to dance, now her hand's in mine  
Oh, my god, I've forgotten her name  
  
But I'm gonna smile my best smile  
And I'm gonna laugh like it's going out of style  
Look into her eyes and pray that she don't see  
That learning to live again is killing me  
  
Now here we are beneath her porch light  
And I say what a great time it's been  
A kiss on the cheek, a whisper goodnight  
And I say, "can I see you again"  
  
And she just smiles her best smile  
And she laughs like it's going out of style  
Looks into my eyes and says, "We'll see"  
Oh this learning to live again is killing me  
God this learning to live again is killing me
