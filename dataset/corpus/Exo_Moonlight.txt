Yeah, stop, stop. Those wings will get wet oh, stop, stop  
In the gap between a deepening day you come slowly  
The darkness skims by and wakes me up  
And across the open window receding away  
  
Have you, you, you lost your way again  
The night air is still cold, get up  
So, baby, hold on I'm worried of leaving you alone  
I leave the road and follow behind you  
  
You shower in the pouring moonlight  
I haven't seen that entrancing expression before  
I look at you who's stopped like a picture and at the end of that gaze  
  
A place where I can't touch you and can't even hold you  
What's shining under the surface is not that person  
Your sad story that can't come true  
The closer you go, the more you'll hurt, so  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Like this I'm anxiously calling you  
Don't go babe, those wings will get wet  
  
No matter how much I tell you, you don't listen  
You throw your whole body towards him again  
Why do you dream a dangerous dream  
(Now stop those tiring [actions]) So that your heart can rest a little  
My heart watching you feels as if it'll rip as well  
  
You shower in the pouring moonlight  
I haven't seen that entrancing expression before  
I look at you who's stopped like a picture and at the end of that gaze  
  
A place where I can't touch you and can't even hold you  
What's shining under the surface is not that person  
Your sad story that can't come true  
The closer you go, the more you'll hurt, so  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Like this I'm anxiously calling you  
Don't go babe, those wings will get wet  
  
Like nothing happened you try  
Even though you're smiling towards me  
Your slender and pale shoulders shake a little, I'm telling you  
It's okay if you let everything go and rest at my side for just a little while  
When the sun rises, follow the place where the moon gets dark, fly away then,
yeah  
  
A place where I can't touch you and we can't be together  
What's shining under the surface is not that person  
Your sad story that can't come true  
The closer you go, the more you'll hurt, so  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Just that love stop, stop, stop, stop, yeah  
Like this I'm anxiously calling you  
Don't go babe, those wings will get wet  
(Stop) those wings will get wet (stop) those wings will get wet
