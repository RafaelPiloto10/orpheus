Set out on the voyage of the conquering fools  
Looking for the gold and the modern day jewels  
It come to pass what was stuck in my head  
If I didn't quit on looking then I'm probably dead  
  
I hit the road and I rolled up north  
looking for the origin, the place of my birth  
I didn't notice when I ran a red sign  
Hoping that everything would really be fine  
  
Uh huh huh  
People come and people go  
But they never know what is going on  
So they gotta try to be what they want to be  
  
What the hell is happening to me  
I hit the road and I rolled up north  
Looking for the origin, the place of my birth  
I didn't notice when I ran a red sign  
  
Hoping that everything would really be fine  
I set out about an hour ago  
Looking for some gold, said hey oh  
Then I went down looking for the big  
  
The big brass show  
So I went and then he started to go  
Walking down the same old, same old road  
Thinking to myself, this is quite a struggle  
  
What can I gotta do tomorrow  
Gonna find that gold  
And conquer me some fools  
Hey hey, hey oh  
  
Conquering fools  
Conquering fools  
Conquer some fools  
Hey we're conquering fools
