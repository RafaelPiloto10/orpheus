Moment by moment, day after day  
Trying your best to forget  
It's all behind you, it's part of the past  
You've got no time for regrets  
Time to start over with somebody new  
You've got nothing more to lose  
Out for the evening, dressed for the kill  
Leaving your troubles behind  
Dangerous places, dangerous times  
Leave with the first one you find  
Live for the moment, who cares if it's right  
Who needs tomorrow, you've got tonight  
  
There in the dark, under covers of love  
Body language is taking you somewhere you shouldn't go  
First name the last thing that you need to know  
  
In the morning you're out on the street  
Now's not the time for regrets  
Some things are done for the thrill of it all  
Some things you'll never forget  
Live for the moment, who cares if it's right  
Who needs tomorrow when you've got tonight  
  
There in the dark, under covers of love  
Body language is taking you somewhere you shouldn't go  
First name the last thing that you need to know
