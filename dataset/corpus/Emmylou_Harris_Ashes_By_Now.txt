(Rodney Crowell)  
This morning is Monday where are you now  
Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low  
When I don't want to  
Well love is elusive this I know now  
It's making me crazy leaving me out  
In the open when I don't want to  
The moments of pleasures Never do last  
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past  
Long gone and in a hurry  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
The second street beggars alone in their life  
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night  
Like I am They're just like I am  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
Just like a wild fire You're running all over town  
As much as you burn me, baby I should be ashes by now  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I should be ashes by now
