I don't believe you when you say there's nothing wrong  
And you can't hide the tears in your eyes from me  
Don't you know we've been together much too long  
Please don't hide it,oh baby can't you see  
CHORUS  
That I care, Yes I care,And I swear I do, Oh I do, oh I do  
I really do love you, Oh I care, Yes I care, And I swear I do  
Oh I do, Yes I do, I really do want you  
Would it matter if I told you I was sorry  
For all the little things I didn't do for you  
And if you ever left me girl don't you know I'd worry  
You know all I ever wanted was you  
And I care, Yes I care, And I swear I do, And I do, oh I do  
I really do love you, Oh I care, Yes I care, And I swear I do  
Oh I do, Yes I do, I really do want you  
BRIDGE  
Oh I want you to want me too  
Just to love me just to love me  
CHORUS
