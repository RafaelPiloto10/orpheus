I am the man in the moon  
And I hope to shine upon you very soon  
Waiting in the night  
To bathe you all in moonlight  
I am the man  
I am the man in the moon  
  
Silently revolving  
Wandering through the heavens above  
On my own  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
I am a creature of the night  
And I hope to come and shed a little light  
Although the universe our teacher  
I remain the central feature  
I am the man  
I am the man in the moon  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Silently revolving  
Wandering through the heavens above  
On my own  
  
I am the man in the moon  
Round and round  
And I hope to shine upon you very soon  
Round and round  
Waiting in the night  
To bathe you all in moonlight  
I am the man  
I am the man in the moon  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
It's that old devil moon  
It's that old devil moon
