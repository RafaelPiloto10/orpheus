Mortal Eyes, Looking Through A Veil Of Dreams,  
Hypnotised, An Ever Living Soul With Wings.  
Think You're God, But You Never Had Control,  
Think You're Loved But There's No One There At All...  
Chorus:  
My Colours All Ran Dry, And Now I See The World In  
Black And White,  
It's Too Late Now, It's Time To Kiss The Rainbow  
Goodbye.  
Poison Tears Running From A Palsied Face,  
Satan Nears, Descending On The Human Race.  
Think You're God, Don't You Wish You Had Control,  
Think You're Loved But There's No One There At All...  
Chorus  
Listen To The Wind, Hear The Gospel Blow.  
Tell Me That You Don't Hear What I'm Hearing  
And I Will Let You Go.  
Look Up To The Sky, Put Your Trust In Me,  
Tell Me That You Ain't Feelin What I'm Feelin And I  
Will Set You Free.  
Look Into The Flame, See The Embers Glow,  
Tell Me That You Don't See What I'm Seein And I  
Will Let You Go  
Taste The Holy Blood, Running From My Veins  
Tell Me That You Ain't Feelin What I'm Feelin And  
I'll Take Away The Pain  
Yes I Will Now, Oh Yes I Will, It's Time To Kiss The  
Rainbow Goodbye.
