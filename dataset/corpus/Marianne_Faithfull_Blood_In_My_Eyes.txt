Woke up this morning, feeling blue  
Seen a good looking girl, can I make love with you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I went back home, put on my tie  
Gonna get that girl that money will buy  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
She looked at me, begin to smile  
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"  
No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait

Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I'll tell you something, tell you the facts  
You don't want to give my money back  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do
