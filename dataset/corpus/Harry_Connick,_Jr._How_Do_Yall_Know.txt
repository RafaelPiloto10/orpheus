Standin' on top of my hill  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
How can you tell me to make my bed  
When I sleep on the ground  
How can you say that you like my noise  
When I haven't made a sound  
I like peace time better than war  
Spendin' my money in the candy store  
I like makin' angels on the shore  
How do ya'll know  
  
Floatin' on my cloud  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
Yellin your sermon from the bottom of a glass  
'Cause you know how it's done  
Tellin' me the troubles of the promised land  
When I'm in it just for fun  
I like to eat my pie before my meal  
Make a snake with an orange peel  
Say my prayers before I kneel  
How do ya'll know  
  
When I was walkin' past your house  
I didn't see nobody home  
Ya'll musta been out buyin' gold  
When I was polishin' chrome  
Ridin' in my spaceship  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
What makes you think you can navigate  
When you don't know where I'm flyin  
Tellin' me the facts about what I say  
When you don't even know if I'm lyin'  
  
I like to wear white in the wintertime  
Pay my penance before the crime  
Have my reason without the rhyme  
But how do ya'll know
