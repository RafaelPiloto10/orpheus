When the morning comes  
I gaze on you with desire  
When the morning comes  
My look will be perfectly plain  
When the morning comes  
My beloved one  
When the morning comes  
You'll know that we both feel the same  
  
In the afternoon  
Misgivings will pale into nothing  
In the afternoon  
We'll know what it is to believe  
When it's afternoon  
And I covet you  
In the afternoon  
I'll give you no reason to leave  
  
[Chorus]  
Done with time and patience I moved with the crowd  
Lonely in my silence and being without  
Then all in one instant straight out of the blue  
Out of all its goodness the summer sent you  
  
Now it's evening time  
And I reach for you lying beside me  
Now it's evening time  
Your kiss will be tender and sure  
Now it's evening time  
Just like every time  
In the evening time  
I love you as much as before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All in one sweet instant straight out of the blue  
Out of all its goodness the summer sent you  
  
The summer sent you  
The summer sent you
