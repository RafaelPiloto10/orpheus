Black cat come visit me, I don't care what people say  
I saw your hazel eyes, sparkling in the moonlight  
  
Black cat one day things will change, I'm gonna wipe away your bad name  
My friend tells me you're no good, and I say hey I'm not afraid  
  
Black cat you're beautiful, why does everybody run away  
Has anybody told you, I care  
Has anybody told you, I love you  
  
Black cat come visit me, I don't care what people say  
I saw your hazel eyes, sparkling in the moonlight  
Black cat things will change, I'm gonna wipe away your bad name  
Black cat you're beautiful, black cat, black cat
