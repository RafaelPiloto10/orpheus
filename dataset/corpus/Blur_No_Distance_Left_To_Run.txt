It's over  
You don't need to tell me  
I hope you're with someone who makes you  
feel safe in your sleeping tonight  
I won't kill myself, trying to stay in your life  
I got no distance left to run  
  
When you see me  
Please turn your back and walk away  
I don't want to see you  
Cause I know the dreams that you keep is wearing me  
When your coming down, think of me here  
I got no distance left to run  
  
It's over, I knew it would end this way  
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel  
That this life is the night  
And it settles down, stays around  
Spends more time with you  
I got no distance left to run
