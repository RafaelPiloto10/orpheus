Its 3 a.m. I'm drunk again  
My head is standing underneath my puke  
So make it stop I'm getting off  
Make it stop I'm getting off  
Sedatives and dizzy smells  
And spillin' my guts out all day  
And make a piddle  
Make it stop I'm getting off  
Make it stop I"m getting off  
I slipped into a comma once again  
Where's my organ donor?  
Lend a hand  
So when you think you're all alone  
No one's left to come around  
Drop like flies and empathize  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate  
One night stands and cheap regrets  
I take another drag off of my cigarette  
So stop I'm getting off  
Make it stop I'm getting off  
One last stop for one-track, mind ya  
Just gimme shelter,gimme  
Gimme something  
Make it stop I'm getting off  
Make it stop I'm getting off  
I slipped into a comma once again  
Where's my organ?  
Don't know, lend a hand  
So when you think you're all alone  
No one's help to come around  
Drop like flies and improvise  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate  
So when you think you're all alone  
No one's help to come around  
Drop like flies and improvise  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
And I know now that I will someday  
And I know that I will suffocate  
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate
