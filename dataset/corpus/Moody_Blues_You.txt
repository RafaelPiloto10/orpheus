You don't even know my name  
Time was when you would  
Take the love you've given all away  
Take a part of me  
  
You don't even walk my road  
Can't find where you turned  
Looked away and you were gone  
Now we're on our own  
Old man is this why we're alone  
  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me  
  
You don't even know my world  
I've tried hard to see  
If I'd found the world you're looking for  
There'd be a change in me  
  
You don't even know my name  
Time was when you would  
Take the love you've given all away  
Take a part of me  
You've gone and changed the world I see  
  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me
