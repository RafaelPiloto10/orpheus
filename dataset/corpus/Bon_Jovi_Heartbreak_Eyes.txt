So now you want to change sides  
You say the lesson's been learned  
I can tell by your voice, baby just got burned  
I can see in your eyes, and read your lips so well  
You're a master at disguise but it ain't hard to tell  
  
Anyone that's been through it before knows that look  
I can read through your mind like a story book  
And there's no happy endings to this life  
  
Cause I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of those heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night  
Calling over and over again  
  
The voices came and took advantage, now you don't want to play  
When the word got around he gave your secrets away  
Now it's too late to cry you know the damage is done  
Dry your tears say goodbye and know he wasn't the one  
  
All your life you been in and out of love  
Now you've folded your cards when push came to shove  
You're just another number, just a victim of love's lies  
  
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of your heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night  
Calling over and over again  
  
Over and over again  
You hear the cries through the night  
Over and over...  
  
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of your heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night, calling over and over  
Those heartbreak eyes  
I can feel the pain you hide deep inside  
Deep inside of those heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night, calling over and over  
Those heartbreak eyes  
I can feel the hurt inside your heartbreak eyes  
I can hear the cries at night, over and over again
