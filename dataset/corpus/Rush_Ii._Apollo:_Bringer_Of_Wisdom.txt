"I bring truth and understanding,  
I bring wit and wisdom fair,  
Precious gifts beyond compare.  
We can build a world of wonder,  
I can make you all aware.  
I will find you food and shelter,  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storms.  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform. "  
  
The people were delighted  
Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise.  
But one day the streets fell silent,  
Yet they knew not what was wrong.  
The urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong.  
The wise men were consulted,  
And the Bridge of Death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus,  
To find out what they had lost.
