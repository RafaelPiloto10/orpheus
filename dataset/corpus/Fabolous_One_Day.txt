It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain  
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine  
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain  
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain  
  
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained  
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train  
Sometimes I ain't see no gain  
'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains  
  
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim  
Get shot or stuck up standin at them see-Lo games  
But now shit with these skios changed  
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange  
  
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain  
Be saying "That's nasty", wouldn't give me no brain  
Ya'll surprised F-A-be -O's sane  
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes  
I'm still here  
  
[Chorus]  
My momma used to tell me  
"Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen"  
Who knew I'd have what it takes,  
To be famous and one day I'd be rappin - no  
My papa used to ask me "Son, are you prepared?  
'Cause one day it could happen"  
I dreamed about this game,  
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no  
  
I just want some peace of mind  
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine  
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline  
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined  
  
But on a small island, too far for police to find  
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined  
I gotta make sure my niece is fine  
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time  
  
Some be like "At least you signed"  
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines  
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime  
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime  
  
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind  
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine  
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind  
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I wish I could go way back when  
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson  
Everything was OK back then  
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin  
  
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin  
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons  
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin  
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s  
  
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin  
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin  
These hoes may crack grins  
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions  
  
If I would've let this flow stay packed in  
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in  
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons till Clue and Duro brings those  
Gray plaques in  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day it'll happen  
That One day I'd be rappin  
No  
One day it could happen  
One day I'd be trapped in  
No
