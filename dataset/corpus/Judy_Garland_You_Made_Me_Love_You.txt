You made me love you  
I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it  
You made me love you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it.  
You made me happy sometimes, you made me glad  
But there were times, Dear, you made me feel so bad  
  
You made me sigh for, I didn't want to tell you  
I didn't want to tell you  
I want some love that's true, yes I do, deed I do, you know I do  
  
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for  
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for  
You know you made me love you
