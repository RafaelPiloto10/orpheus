Woo  
Sweet revelation got me  
Levitating over ground  
Life know it's vibration  
No I'm never coming down  
Oh you're my own superhero  
Keeps watching over me  
I like it when you sing  
My green eyes saw your constellation  
To some light house in the sea  
If your car stalls in the middle of the road in snow, I know  
I know you'll be here  
Lights out, in all of the city, black out no doubt  
I know you'll be here  
River flows through the streets, and my homes afloat  
I know you'll be here  
Stranded in the middle of China, they'll find ya  
I know you'll be here  
I'll be  
Waiting by the window  
With a view of the parking light  
No matter  
how long it takes ya  
Never fails to come through every night  
If your car stalls in the middle of the road in snow, I know  
I know you'll be here  
Lights out, in all of the city, black out no doubt  
I know you'll be here  
River flows through the streets, and my homes afloat  
I know you'll be here  
Stranded in the middle of China, they'll find ya  
I know you'll be here  
Here  
At the speed of lightning  
Here  
With the stars aligning  
Here  
Oh, Here
