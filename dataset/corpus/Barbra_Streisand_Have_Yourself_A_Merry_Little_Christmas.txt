Christmas' future is far away  
Christmas' past is passed  
Christmas' present is here today  
Bringing joy that will last  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your hearts be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule time gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yoke  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow  
(Hang a shining star)  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
(Have yourself a merry little Christmas now...)
