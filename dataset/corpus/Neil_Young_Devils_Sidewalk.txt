Well the red light shines  
On the streets of hate  
Where the devil dines  
Who knows what he ate  
  
"It's a simple thing  
Trying to stay afloat"  
The captain said  
Without his boat  
  
Some things are getting better  
Other things a little worse  
It's a situation  
Much like a curse  
  
"It's the devil's sidewalk  
It's the devil's door  
I've tried to avoid it"  
Said the captain of the shore  
  
There's a garden growing  
And a million weeds  
With no way of knowing  
Who's done which deed  
  
"That's an honest tale"  
Said the helmsman to the mate  
"About a woman delicious  
And a matter of fate"  
  
Big wheel keep rollin'  
Down on me  
"One thing I can tell you  
Is you got to be free"  
  
John Lennon said that  
And "I believe in love"  
But I believe in action  
When push comes to shove  
  
"Who cares what you believe,"  
Said the captain, amazed  
"If you stood in my shoes  
Your eyes would be glazed"  
  
So, my fair damsel  
Won't you take your leave  
Are you headed for the country?  
Where you wear the greensleeves  
  
And the children laugh  
And the old folks sing  
And the church bell tolls  
For a miraculous thing  
  
Where the big red furnace  
Just blooms and glows  
Where the big heart beats  
Where the big wheel rolls
