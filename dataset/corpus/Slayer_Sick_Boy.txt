Well I'm searching through my bed  
I got ankles in my head  
I'm in really bad  
It's the best time I ever had  
I'm a sick boy  
I'm a sick boy - there should be more  
Well I'm happy the way I am  
A sardine in a can  
People taking notes  
People in white coats  
I'm a sick boy  
I'm a sick boy - there should be more  
Well I'm happy the way I am  
And I'm sorry I shit on my hand  
People taking notes  
People in rubber coats  
I'm a sick boy  
Just a sick boy  
I'm a sick boy  
There's assholes everywhere  
Plus girls with big town hair  
But why must I suffer  
For being a fecal lover  
I'm a shit boy  
I'm a snit boy - there should be more
