[Intro]  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?  
Fucked up  
  
[Verse 1]  
The only laws I obey, the ones I'm makin' for myself  
So why you make me play on the road to something else?  
Self control is not something I'm working on  
We fuck, you turn me on, is all I can say about you  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
  
[Verse 2]  
Make sure made a hole and now it's open full of sweat  
Like a scorpionon fire, stinging myself to death  
I get extinguished, but it's instinctual  
You turn me on, is all I can say about you  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on
