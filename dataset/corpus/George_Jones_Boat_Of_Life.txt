My friend, is the going rough with troubled seas around  
To angry when you set your soul and dark clouds on you frown  
Have you ever looked for bread and only found a stone  
But it's because you're paddling your boat of life alone.  
  
Is the raft you once had charted now both blurred and marred  
Is you soul and body weary, the task of rowin' hard  
Have you ever looked for joy and disappointment known  
But it's because you're paddling your boat of life alone.  
  
My friend there is one who knows your every fault and sin  
And he knows your trouble and your whole dear life of sin  
So why not call on Jesus, He'll help you safely on  
Oh, my friend, it's foolish to paddle all alone
