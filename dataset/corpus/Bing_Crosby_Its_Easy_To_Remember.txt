Your sweet expression  
The smile you gave me  
The way you looked when we met  
It's easy to remember  
But so hard to forget  
  
I hear you whisper  
"I'll always love you"  
I know it's over, and yet  
It's easy to remember  
But so hard to forget  
  
So I must dream  
To have your hand caress me  
Fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream  
Than have that lonely feeling  
Stealing through the night  
  
Each little moment  
Is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember  
But so hard to forget
