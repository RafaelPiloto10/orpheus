Now you want to know the reason  
Why I cheated on you  
Well I had to be a hunter again  
This little man had to try  
  
To make love feel new again  
'Cause there's just a few things honey  
I'm not old enough to do for you  
You just never care to show me  
  
Showed him how to tango  
And when they tangoed it'd send their hearts a flutter  
Young and tender  
Seemed to surrender in so sweet surrender  
  
In sweet surrender  
Ahh sweet surrender to love  
But now you're gonna go out and get yourself  
A reputation  
  
But I'm gonna have to show you where to start  
And then you're gonna bring back your little reputation  
And prove to me what I could not prove to you
