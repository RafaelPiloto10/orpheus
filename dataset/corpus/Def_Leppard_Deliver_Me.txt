I'm tired of feeling hateful  
I'm tired and I can't breathe  
So tired that I would be grateful  
If you close the door when you leave  
  
That's me diggin' my heels in  
That's me with the Holy Ghost  
'Scuse me but I don't remember  
Where were you when I needed you most  
  
And I'm tied to the sky  
As you claw at my eyes  
And I wait for the flood  
I swim in blood  
As I crawl to my knees  
And I beg your disease  
Taste the ice on your breath  
As you catch your death  
  
I close my eyes  
Embrace me  
Deliver me  
  
Hey you, the voice of reason  
Hey you, are you listening to me  
It's you that I can't believe in  
I don't buy what I don't see  
Say goodbye 'cause I don't need  
  
I close my eyes  
Embrace the wave  
Abandon me  
  
Save the day  
That I won't see  
Deliver me
