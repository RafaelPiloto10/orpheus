Down down you bring me down  
I hear you knocking down my  
Door and I can't sleep at night  
Your face it has no place  
No room for you inside my  
House I need to be alone  
  
Don't waste your words I don't need  
Anything from you  
I don't care where you've been or  
What you plan to do  
  
Turn turn I wish you'd learn  
There's a time and place for everything  
I've got to get it through  
Cut loose 'cause you're no use  
I couldn't stand another  
Second in your company  
  
Don't waste your words I don't need  
Anything from you  
I don't care where you've been or  
What you plan to do  
  
Stone me why can't you see  
You're a no one nowhere washed up baby  
Who'd look better dead  
Your tongue is far too long  
I don't like the way it sucks and  
Slurs upon my every word  
  
Don't waste your words I don't need  
Anything from you  
I don't care where you've been or  
What you plan to do  
  
I am the resurrection and I am the life  
I couldn't ever bring myself  
To hate you as I'd  
Like  
  
I am the resurrection and I am the life  
I couldn't ever bring myself  
To hate you as I'd  
Like
