For those days we felt like a mistake,  
Those times when love's what you hate  
Somehow  
We keep marchin' on  
  
For those nights when I couldn't be there,  
I've made it harder to know that you know  
That somehow  
We'll keep movin' on  
  
There's so many wars we fought  
There's so many things we're not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
For all of the plans we made  
There isn't a flag I'd wave  
Don't care where we've been  
I'd sink us to swim  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
For those doubts that swirl all around us  
For those lives that tear at the seams  
We know  
We're not what we've seen  
  
Oh  
For this dance we move with each other  
There ain't no other step  
Than one foot  
Right in front of the other  
Oh  
  
There's so many wars we fought  
There's so many things we're not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
For all of the plans we made  
There isn't a flag I'd wave  
Don't care where we've been  
I'd sink us to swim  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, marchin' on  
  
We'll have the days we break  
And we'll have the scars to prove it  
We'll have the bombs that we saved  
But we'll have the heart  
Not to lose it  
  
For all of the times we've stopped  
For all of the things I'm not  
  
Oh!  
You put one foot in front of the other  
We've move like we ain't got no other  
We go where we go we're marchin' on  
Marchin' on  
  
There's so many wars we fought  
There's so many things we're not  
But with what we have  
I promise you that  
We're marchin' on  
We're marchin' on  
we're marchin' on  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right,  
Marchin' on  
Marchin' on  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right, left  
Right, right, right, right,  
Marchin' on  
Marchin' on
