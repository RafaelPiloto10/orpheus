The seven red flames of the cave  
Are lightning the horrible torture  
Constricted to see the regrets  
To have had the life from his god  
Airin sheds black tears supporting the terrible rape  
The fury of the sons of the thunder  
Is breaking the mystical chain  
  
Arwald falls so to his knees  
While Akron the black king is laughing  
The princess falls down on the stones  
With no breath of life anymore  
May your ambition lead you to the unholy name  
So my soul will fight you forever  
In one of the many new hells  
  
From the holy sea of golden flames  
Flies the last winged unicorn  
With it's magic breath of innocence  
Rising to the crystal throne  
  
Skies are spitting holy fire wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow  
Flow down to silent mystic shores  
Shores of the spirits thirst for vengeance waiting for their holy crystal gate  
Gate to the sunny holy lands  
  
"Lands of a timeless world...  
An enchanted timeless world like no other...  
There where magic flowers paint the cosmic landscape  
And noone knows the word... pain!"  
Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake  
Swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name!  
  
And now is the time to decide  
On a way to escape from the cavern  
The old silver chains on the wall  
Are now also trapping their souls  
Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain  
But I swear to you on my proud name...  
You'll open the mystical gate!  
  
From the holy sea of golden flames  
Flies the last winged unicorn  
With it's magic breath of innocence  
Rising to the crystal throne  
  
From the holy sea of golden flames  
Flies the last winged unicorn  
With it's magic breath of innocence  
Rising to the crystal throne
