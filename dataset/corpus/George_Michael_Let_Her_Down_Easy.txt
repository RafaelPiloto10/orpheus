You're top man on scene  
You don't think life comes in between  
But hey, she's just seventeen  
She feels like she's a worldly girl  
But man you've been around the world  
She is just some worried daddy's girl  
Even though there's nothing I can say  
To cheat you and nature any way  
  
Let her down easy  
Her heart is on a dime  
Let her down easy  
And she'll grow up in time  
  
In her strawberry eyes  
The way she sees you signifies  
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies  
But if you must lay her down  
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown  
Please do not lead her on when, oh when you leave town  
Even though there's nothing I can say  
To cheat you and nature any way  
  
Let her down easy  
Her heart is on the line  
Let her down easy  
And you'll grow up in time  
  
She's a woman now  
With a daughter to make her proud  
In her crayon world of paper clouds  
She still remembers you  
The first boy that she gave it to  
And she laughs at how little then she knew  
Even though there's nothing I can say  
To cheat you and nature any way  
  
Let her down easy  
Her heart is on a dime  
Let her down easy  
And she'll grow up in time  
Whoa in time
