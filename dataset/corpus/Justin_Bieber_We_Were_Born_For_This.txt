Look at all the choices  
The choices in this world  
World spreading no freedom  
Freedom for the boys and the girls  
  
But the boys and the girls  
They don't know  
What love is like  
Love is like appreciation  
Mixed in a double cup of sprite  
  
So can we go  
No left or right  
You go your way  
And I'll go mine  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay  
  
Look at all the places  
Places that I've been  
It doesn't come easy  
You gotta have strength  
And when it goes down  
And it's all said and done  
  
You gotta stand up to them  
There's no need to run  
And now that I've made it  
I won't look back no  
Sacrifice what meant the most to me  
The most to me  
Yes I did  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay  
  
Look at all the people standing outside  
So dedicated  
Your love doesn't go unrecognized  
Your love doesn't go unrecognized
