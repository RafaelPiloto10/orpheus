You know our love is driftin'  
We have fallen from its grace  
We've got to face the situation  
Put things in their place  
  
You're still the man  
You know just where you stand  
But the way you felt for me is gone  
There's no more truth to your song  
  
[Chorus]  
But I've got so much love for you  
It's too much love  
So much love for you  
It's too much love  
So much love for you  
It's too much love  
And I just don't want to throw it away  
  
I've got to sacrifice my feelings  
To make you find your own  
I think it's time to end it  
You might be better off alone  
  
Oh, you're still the man  
You know just where you stand  
But the way you felt for me is gone  
There's no more truth to your song  
  
(There's something you've got to know)  
When it's over, it's over  
If it's done, then, baby, it's done  
But there's nowhere to go  
If we leave it all behind  
  
Too much love  
Too much love  
Too much love
