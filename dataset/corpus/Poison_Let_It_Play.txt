Did you ever get up on the wrong side of bed  
With an achin' head and just fall apart?  
You're running late, the boss is bitchin',  
It's cold outside, and the car won't start  
  
Well I don't mean to bitch I swear  
Cause we all got our cross to bear  
  
[Chorus]  
But when I hear the music  
All my troubles just fade away  
When I hear the music  
Let it play, let it play  
When I hear the music  
Sure as darkness I can see the day  
When I hear the music  
Let it play  
Let it play  
  
Life's just rented space getting laid to waste  
When the lines on my face say I'm growing older  
Just a stitch in time gonna save my mind  
When the weight of the world lies on my shoulders  
  
Soon I won't have a place to fit  
But I'll cross that bridge when I come to it  
  
[Chorus]
