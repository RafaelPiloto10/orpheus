High vibration go on  
to the sun, oh let my heart dreaming  
past a mortal as me.  
Where can I be?  
  
Wish the sun to stand still.  
Reaching out to touch our own being  
Past a mortal as we  
Here we can be  
We can be here,  
be here now.  
Here we can be.  
  
AWAKEN SUNS HIGH STREAM through AWAKEN  
GENTLE STRONG DREAMS BEGIN HERE AWAKEN  
MASS .)(. MASS  
TOUCH STAR,SONG,AGE,LESS TOUCHING  
  
Workings of man  
set to ply out historical life.  
Reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree.  
All awakening, all restoring you.  
  
Workings of man, crying out from the fires set aflame.  
By his blindness to see that the warmth of his being  
is promised for his seeing, his reaching so clearly.  
  
Workings of man  
driven far from the path.  
Rereleased in inhibitions  
So that all is left for you  
all is left for you  
all is left for you  
all this left for you now.  
  
Master of things. Master of light.  
Songs cast alight on you. All pure chance.  
Hark through dark ties. As exists cross divided.  
That tunnel us out of sane existence. In all encircling mode.  
In challenge as direct. Oh closely guided plan.  
As eyes see young stars assemble. Awaken in our heart.  
  
Master of soul. Master of time.  
Set to touch. Setting sail.  
All impenetrable youth. Over all of our lands.  
Ask away. And as we look.  
That thought be contact. Forever closer.  
With all that's clear. Shall we now bid.  
Be honest with yourself. Farewell, farewell.  
there's no doubt, no doubt.  
  
High vibration go on  
to the sun, oh let my heart dreaming  
past a mortal as me.  
Where can I be?  
  
Wish the sun to stand still.  
Reaching out to touch our own being  
Past a mortal as we  
Here we can be  
We can be here.  
  
Like the time I ran away  
and turned around  
and you were standing close to me.  
  
Like the time I ran away  
and turned around  
and you were standing close to me.
