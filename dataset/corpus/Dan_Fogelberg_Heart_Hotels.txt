Well there's too many windows in this old hotel  
And rooms filled with reckless pride  
And the walls have grown sturdy  
And the halls have worn well  
But there is nobody living in inside  
Nobody living inside  
Gonna pull in the shutters on this heart of mine  
Roll up the carpets and pull in the blinds  
And retreat to the chambers that I left behind  
In hopes there still may be love left to find  
Still may be love left to find  
Seek inspiration in daily affairs  
Now your soul is in trouble and requires repairs  
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs  
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers  
Echoes of unanswered prayers  
Well there's too many windows in this old hotel  
And rooms filled with reckless pride  
And the walls have grown sturdy  
And the halls have worn well  
But there is nobody living in inside  
Nobody living inside
