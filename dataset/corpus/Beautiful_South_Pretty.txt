You're kind of pretty you can cover in make-up  
Cover in perfume too  
Moonlight, mud fight, any kinda sunlight  
Still comes shining through  
  
Stuff it with cakes, see if it breaks  
Put it in the oven, see how she bakes  
Your kind of pretty you can gas mark 11  
But you can't ever overdo  
  
Your kinda pretty, don't need advertising  
Your kinda pretty comes with own billboard  
Newly-weds nearly-deads  
Anyone with bed-stead  
Your kinda pretty  
You're all they can't afford  
Cover your eyes, see if it dies  
Move to the city, start dating guys  
You're kind of pretty you can try to deny  
But eventually you'll thank the lord  
  
You're kind of pretty don't need an umbrella  
It knows what weather can do  
Sandstorm, rainstorm, anything a cloud's warn  
Can't hide the prettiest view  
  
Cover with paints, see if it stains  
Take it to a window, press up against  
Your kinda pretty you can drag through a hedge  
But no-one would believe you'd been through  
  
Your kinda pretty, don't need advertising  
Your kinda pretty comes with own billboard  
Newly-weds nearly-deads  
Anyone with bed-stead  
Your kinda pretty  
You're all they can't afford  
Cover your eyes, see if it dies  
Move to the city, start dating guys  
You're kind of pretty you can try to deny  
But eventually you'll thank the lord
