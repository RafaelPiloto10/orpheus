Little man with his eyes on fire  
And his smile so bright.  
In his hands are the toys you gave  
To fill his heart with delight.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And in the ring stands a circus clown  
Holding up a knife.  
What you see and what you will hear  
Will last you for the rest of your life.  
  
And it's sad so sad  
There ain't no easy way round.  
And it's sad so sad  
All you friends gather round  
'Cause the circus left town.  
  
Little man with his heart so pure  
And his love so fine.  
Stick with me and I'll ride with you  
Till the end of the line.  
  
Hold my hand and I'll walk with you  
Through the darkest night.  
When I smile I'll be thinking of you  
And every little thing will be all right.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The circus left town, left town.  
The circus left town, left town
