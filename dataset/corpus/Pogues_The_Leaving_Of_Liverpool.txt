Farewell to you, my own true love,  
I am going far, far away  
I am bound for California,  
And I know that I'll return someday  
So fare thee well, my own true love,  
For when I return, united we will be  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
But my darling when I think of thee  
I have shipped on a Yankee sailing ship,  
Davy Crockett is her name,  
And her Captain's name was Burgess,  
And they say that she's a floating hell  
So fare thee well, my own true love,  
For when I return, united we will be  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
But my darling when I think of thee  
Oh the sun is on the harbour, love,  
And I wish that I could remain,  
For I know that it will be a long, long time,  
Before I see you again  
So fare thee well, my own true love,  
For when I return, united we will be  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me,  
But my darling when I think of thee
