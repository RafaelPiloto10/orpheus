Now's not the time to say goodbye  
And I'm not the kind to question why  
Well I don't feel very well, and it's getting cold as hell  
It won't be the same, can't you tell?  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm so afraid  
Why can't you stay?  
Just don't leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong?  
  
Doing the things I should have known  
Only to reap what I have sown  
Jesus, please  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm on my knees  
Forgive me please  
Just don't leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong?  
  
(keyboard solo)  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm so afraid  
Why can't you stay?  
Just don't leave, don't leave... Me alone  
How long will my song... Be... Wrong?
