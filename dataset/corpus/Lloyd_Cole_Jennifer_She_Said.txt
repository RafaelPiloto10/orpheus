Jennifer we can't go wrong lets put it in writing  
Jennifer we can't go wrong lets do it right now  
Maybe you're a little hasty  
But they say love is blind  
Now her name's on you  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Jennifer in blue  
Did you ever have a bad dream wake up and it not stop?  
Did you ever feel for a girl for a time and then stop?  
Well it's written there in blue  
With a heart and arrow through  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Jennifer in blue  
Oh forever you said that's forever you said yes forever  
And forever she said that's forever she said yes forever  
Still it's written there in blue  
With a heart and arrow through  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Jennifer in blue  
Oh forever you said that's forever you said that's forever  
And forever she said that's forever she said yes forever  
Bup ba da da da da, Bup ba da da da da  
Bup ba da da da da  
Bup ba da da da da, Bup ba da da da da  
Bup ba da da da da  
But you change with the weather  
You change with the weather  
With the weather  
This is the rain
