We rode hard,  
For the boat, as we could,  
Tears you said, understood, understood,  
I said alright.  
A crowd will be born ,  
Only born,I,  
I want to watch for a sign,  
In the night,  
I watch a bomb go off in a young girls life.  
  
Who were you  
The last recluse  
Who were you  
The last Canada girl  
  
Who were you?  
What is it with you?  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
  
When the wind comes up,  
Surfers up,  
What a scuzz  
Nothing up, with surprise  
Just ride you said,  
Ride and shut up.  
  
I jump on broad,turned around  
To wave goodbye,  
You were only on your bike,  
Riding with my bike by your side  
  
Who were you?  
The black canoe.  
Who were you?  
The last of the ?  
Who were you?  
You rode a lot ?  
As far as I know, it was you.  
  
You broke my heart, from the start  
Made me work, work so hard.  
To where I am,  
To where I'd let you do it all again.  
  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
What do I do,  
Without you?  
  
Who were you?  
The last recluse.  
Who were you?  
The last of the ?  
  
The last color  
The last Canada girls  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
Who were you?
