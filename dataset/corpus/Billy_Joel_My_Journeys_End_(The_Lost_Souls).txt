Well I climb the highest mountain, and I swim the deepest sea  
If I knew you were riding at my journey's end and waiting for me  
And I'll be there, I know that you'll love me  
I know whatever that you'll say, and I know any way  
If I knew you were waiting there at my journey's end  
  
Somehow it makes fine ways 'til the end of the earth  
But it really doesn't matter what I say, I'll come back someday  
  
Now I know someone who's telling and I said now that it makes  
If I knew you were there at my journey's end  
To be mine for the rest of my day but now it really doesn't matter  
Now I really if I may say 'cause I go anywhere  
If I knew you were waiting there at my journey's end  
Whoa oh oh, at my journey's end...Oh oh oh oh, at...my...jour-ney's...end...
