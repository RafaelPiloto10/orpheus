Denied the everlastin life - behold the son of man  
Nevermore the saviour - bound and damned  
Thou shalt not - be  
Thou shalt not - live  
One law for one  
Do what thou will - gods forsaken - lead me in to hell  
Vicious by nature - evil at heart  
Carnal indulgence - the finest art  
The lies of ages - love you to death  
Inhale your last breath - gods forsaken  
Welcome ye to hell  
Everlasting lies  
Richteous path lies  
False prophet lies  
Rejected from the minds - rejecting golden lies  
Suffer little children - suffer all mankind  
Thou shalt not - ask  
Thou shalt not - rule  
One law for on  
What thou will do - gods forsaken - lead me in to hell  
God's forsaken
