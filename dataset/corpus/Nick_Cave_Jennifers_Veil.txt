So you've come back for Jennifer  
You know, she hides her face behind a veil  
I'm warning you Frankie, leave on the next train  
Your Jennifer she just isn't the same  
Quit waving that thing about! Come back!  
Come back and give me a chance to explain  
Your baby will never cry again.  
  
So don't try to reach out  
And don't let the ship's flag down  
Point the figure-head at the storm  
And drive her hard upon  
Don't stop and don't stop  
And don't let the veil drop  
(Another ship ready to sail--the rigging is tight  
Tight like Jennifer's veil).  
  
She drew the curtain on her face  
Ever since they came and burnt the old place down  
Why is she searching through the ashes?  
Why, only Jennifer knows that now.  
And the officer, without a word,  
Left all his junk and just moved out.  
  
So don't try to reach out  
And don't let the ship's flag down  
Point the figure-head at the glass  
Smash! Smash! Into shards  
Don't stop and don't touch!  
And don't let the veil drop... Behind Jennifer's veil  
  
Oh God! Frankie! Is that really you!  
Get back! Don't reach out!  
Get back, and get that lantern out of my room!  
  
Don't try to reach out  
And don't let the ship's flag down  
Down, down over her, like a shroud  
  
And let her sail on the sea like a stone.  
Don't touch and don't touch  
And don't let the veil drop  
Another ship ready to dock... The rigging comes loose...
