Though we said goodbye and we drifted far apart  
I knew that we'd meet again  
Though you left my arms you never left my heart  
I knew that we'd meet again  
  
The lover's lane was not the same with someone new  
How could lover's lane be same without you  
Here we are together prayers were not in vain  
I knew that we'd meet again  
  
One word was spoken and now our two hearts they were broken  
Our love had all gone astray  
That old pride do a courtin' but honey you know I was certain  
That we'd meet again some sunny day  
  
True love may sever though it will ever live on in memory  
And though honey we were parted and so broken hearted  
I knew someday you'd come back to me  
The lover's lane was not the same....
