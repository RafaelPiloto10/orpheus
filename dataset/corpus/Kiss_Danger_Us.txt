[Verse]  
Heaven, please send me someone to love  
Angels know what I've been dreaming of  
Tell me about your fantasies  
You know what I need tonight  
Baby, you and me, we're like TNT  
Light the dynamite  
  
[Chorus]  
Too much trouble (too much trouble)  
Double that ... (double ...)  
Danger you  
Danger me  
Danger us  
  
[Verse]  
I know, people don't always know what they need  
Passion play can make a lonely heart bleed  
I don't want my candy sweet  
You don't want your lovin' nice  
Everytime we meet, we're like TNT  
Light the dynamite  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much trouble (too much trouble)  
Ready, steady, ... (ready, steady, ...)  
Danger you  
Danger me  
Danger us  
  
Well, alright!  
Danger us!  
Ooh, yeah-yeah!  
  
Yeah!  
  
[Guitar Solo]  
  
Tell me about your fantasies  
You know what I need tonight  
Baby, you and me, we're like TNT  
Light the dynamite  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much trouble (too much trouble)  
Ready, steady, ... (ready, steady, ...)  
Danger you  
Danger me  
Danger us  
  
Wow!  
  
Oh yeah...
