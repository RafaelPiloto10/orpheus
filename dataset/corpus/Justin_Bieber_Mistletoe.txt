It's the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop starin' at your face  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
  
Everyone's gatherin' around the fire  
Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July  
I should be chillin' with my folks I know, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
Word on the street Santa's comin' tonight  
Reindeer flyin' through the sky so high  
I should be makin' a list I know, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
  
Aye love, the Wisemen follow the star, the way I follow my heart  
And it lead me to a miracle, hey love  
Don't ya buy me nothin', 'cause I am feelin' one thing  
Your lips on my lips, that's a merry merry Christmas  
  
It's the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop starin' at your face  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe oh yeah  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, yeah under the mistletoe  
  
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe, show me baby that you love me so oh oh  
Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah  
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe, show me baby that you love me so oh oh  
Oh oh oh
