In the hulking halls of hatred where the Master makes his throne  
Within the "ass"-teroid belt where his body floats alone  
His mind begins to wander  
The worm begins to turn  
All life he must now squander  
The universe must burn  
He plans eternal war, as the eternal way  
But there is a force - which he must now obey  
Time and the events within, chronicles of hate and sin  
Everything, it has a start, but the end is always the best part  
Our quest - to find the broken bits  
Put them back and make them fit  
And once that we have read the end  
The tablet will blow up again (x4)  
And we'll kill everything (x3)  
Including ourselves  
Summoning the Master  
Call his form most vile  
Champing mass of questing flesh  
Protoplasmic pile  
Ancient hunger, never filled  
Until the universe is killed  
The endless host of merging soul  
Sucked into the feeding hole  
Guts and giblets cascade down  
Rectal midgets, flattened ground  
Please pay attention to the plot  
As I kick out this monster's snot  
Splitting skulls and raking ribs,  
Trephinated drainage sieve  
Protruding mass of reeking bile  
Which forms infected booger pile  
Assemble now the tablet  
Hope that it's not Braille  
Bring forth now the Master  
So we can end this tale  
And we'll kill everything (x3)  
Especially ourselves  
Transmogrify your plasmic swarm  
Evaporate before time's storm  
And dedicate your life to porn  
And dedicate your life to porn  
You think that life has a reason?  
You think your god has a soul?  
I bare my bum to the heavens  
I think a head is a hole.  
And we'll kill everything (x3)  
Including ourselves
