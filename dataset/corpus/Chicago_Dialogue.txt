Part I  
  
Are you optimistic 'bout the way things are going?  
No, I never ever think of it at all  
  
Don't you ever worry  
When you see what's going down?  
  
No, I try to mind my business, that is, no business at all  
  
When it's time to function as a feeling human being  
Will your Bachelor of Arts help you get by?  
  
I hope to study further, a few more years or so  
I also hope to keep a steady high  
  
Will you try to change things  
Use the power that you have, the power of a million new ideas?  
  
What is this power you speak of and this need for things to change?  
I always thought that everything was fine  
  
Don't you feel repression just closing in around?  
No, the campus here is very, very free  
  
Don't it make you angry the way war is dragging on?  
Well, I hope the President knows what he's into, I don't know  
  
Don't you ever see the starvation in the city where you live  
All the needless hunger all the needless pain?  
  
I haven't been there lately, the country is so fine  
But my neighbors don't seem hungry 'cause they haven't got the time  
  
Thank you for the talk, you know you really eased my mind  
I was troubled by the shapes of things to come  
  
Well, if you had my outlook your feelings would be numb  
You'd always think that everything was fine  
  
Part ii  
  
We can make it happen  
We can change the world now  
We can save the children  
We can make it better  
We can make it happen  
We can save the children  
We can make it happen
