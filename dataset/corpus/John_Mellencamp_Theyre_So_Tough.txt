They're so tough  
They like to make us feel little  
They like to make us feel small  
And keep us down  
Till we feel no good at all  
  
Then they tell us that we're stupid  
That we got no sense at all  
They'll keep away the spark  
Keep us in the dark  
Make us feel we have no vision at all  
  
[Chorus]  
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way  
No, I don't believe it has to be this way  
  
Then they tell us to be patient  
That our time will come  
But I've stood outside their doors  
And walked their floors  
And I ain't gonna do it again  
  
They'd like to make me their nigger  
I say to hell with them  
I'm not gettin' down on my knees  
And beggin', please  
Can you throw me a crumb now and then?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't really speak to you  
And I don't know about them  
They must be out of their minds  
Can't read between the lines  
They can stick it where the sun don't shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They're so tough  
They are so tough
