Don't believe the devil  
I don't believe his book  
But the truth is not the same  
Without the lies he made up  
  
Don't believe in excess  
Success is to give  
Don't believe in riches  
But you should see where I live  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in forced entry  
Don't believe in rape  
But every time she passes by  
Wild thoughts escape  
I don't believe in death row  
Skid row or the gangs  
Don't believe in the Uzi  
It just went off in my hand  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in cocaine  
Got a speed-ball in my head  
I could cut and crack you open  
Do you hear what I said  
Don't believe them when they tell me  
There ain't no cure  
The rich stay healthy  
While the sick stay poor  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in Goldman  
His type like a curse  
Instant karma's going to get him  
If I don't get him first  
Don't believe that rock 'n' roll  
Can really change the world  
As it spins in revolution  
It spirals and turns  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in the 60's  
The golden age of pop  
You glorify the past  
When the future dries up  
Heard a singer on the radio late last night  
He says he's gonna kick the darkness  
'til it bleeds daylight  
I...I believe in love  
  
I feel like I'm falling  
Like I'm spinning on a wheel  
It always stops beside of me  
With a presence I can feel  
I...I believe in love  
Stop!
