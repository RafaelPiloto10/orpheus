This will take some understanding  
I believe someone is sending love to us and everyone  
Who cares to take a gamble sometimes  
Think of me I've given all I can  
Stretched an arm and open hand to you  
  
So never say no  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
  
You I need, always needed, don't turn back for any reason  
First we talk and then we fall headfirst into each others thinking  
Please be where I'll always see you, life is short  
The twinkle of an eye is all we have until we say  
  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
  
Take me away, take me away  
Take me away  
Do you dream fantasy and believe what you see is weird  
I need a remedy or a book to get off this fear  
All I wanted to know is how do I get the truth from here.  
We play so small a part  
But we started from somewhere  
  
All the friends that I can think of  
Know what's going to happen to them  
If they don't think on today and plan ahead for their tomorrow  
Here we are just lucky children breaking out of the shell  
I'll take your hand today and love you till we reach  
  
The end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Take me away  
Take me away  
Take me away  
  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line
