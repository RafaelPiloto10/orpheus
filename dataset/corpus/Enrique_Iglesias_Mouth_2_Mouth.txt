We live...  
We love...  
We die...  
  
[Enrique Iglesias]  
She called me up late at night  
We called an innocent crime  
She's such a good waste of time  
But in the back of my mind  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
  
[Jennifer Lopez]  
Kills me to let it inside  
Feels like the wrong kind of guy  
He falls asleep by my side  
But in the back of my mind  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
You know you're all I'm thinking of  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
I say you make me feel alive  
I say you bring me back to life  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Lay me down, mouth to mouth  
  
[Break]  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Help me now, help me now  
Hurry up it's killing me the way I need your mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth  
I say you make me feel alive  
I say you bring me back to life  
I can't catch a single breath baby,  
Lay me down, mouth to mouth
