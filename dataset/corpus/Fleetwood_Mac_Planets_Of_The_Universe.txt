The bright light is lying down  
The earth and the sea and the sky  
Is at rest with the ocean  
And the days go by  
  
They go into the seas that have no shores...  
Haunted by that same closed door...  
Looking up at skies on fire...  
Leaving nothing left of us...  
To discover...  
  
And the planets of the universe Go their way  
Not astounded by the sun or the moon  
Or by the day  
You and I will simply disappear  
Out of sight  
Ooh, but I'm afraid soon there'll be  
No light  
  
No doubt, no pain  
Come ever again, well let there be light in this lifetime  
In the cool silent moments  
Of the nighttime.  
Of the nighttime  
  
And the planets of the universe  
Go their way  
Not astounded by the sun or the moon  
Or by the day  
We will never change again  
The way that we are changing  
Well you forget the chill of love, but not the strain  
  
Now I know  
Well, I was wrong to live for a dream  
If I had my life to live over  
I would never dream, no  
I still wish you gone  
And I will live alone  
Yes, I will live alone  
  
And the planets of the universe go their way  
I know you don't believe it  
Not astounded by the soon or moon or day  
I know you don't believe it  
You and I will simply disappear out of sight  
Well, but I'm afraid soon there'll be no light  
  
You will never love again the way you love me  
You will never rule again the way you've ruled me  
You will never change again the way you're changing  
You will never rule again the way you've ruled me
