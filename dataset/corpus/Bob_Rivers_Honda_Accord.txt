And now, I'm going to do a song with great social and political influence.  
It goes like this...  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
Mercedes insurance I cannot afford.  
If I drove a Porche, I'd still be ignored.  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me some silicone implants.  
The breasts that you gave me don't shake when I dance.  
Them doctors make mountains out of hills made for ants.  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me some silicone implants.  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a good looking male.  
My boyfriend is lazy, and big as a whale.  
Spends all of my money (when he's not in jail).  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a good looking male...  
Everybody...  
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
Mercedes insurance I cannot afford.  
My car's held together by a big bungee cord...  
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a Honda Accord.  
That's it
