Hello, I'm the aircrash bureau  
I bet you're so surprised to see me  
I could specialize in rumours  
I'll send shivers up your spine  
  
Pilot, back, I need my squadron  
I was flying before d-day  
Now I'm warning you of falling  
I'll tell you when you're going down  
  
Sometimes I get these questions  
It reminds me of the skin game  
We used to stand around on corners  
Saying 'well here we are again'  
  
So now she motions closer  
Now that's what I call romance  
Someone's calling me but vaguely  
You need the feeling not the man
