I can't imagine how you feel and this is how you feel  
You say your name like you're no longer convinced  
But now they're strapping you in and closing the lid  
And they're dropping you in what's done you did  
The bell is picking up speed there's water leaking in  
That ol' equilibrium just starts to spin and spin  
Do you like to be judged or liked  
Do you like it inside a barrel  
Plunging over the falls  
Curious and grim we wrestle at the rim  
We wonder all about him and the point of it all  
  
I'll be short and brief  
And to the point  
The fighting has resumed  
In that tone of voice  
The plague is exhumed  
He said "what I'm going through  
Is essentially all true  
Made no less amazing  
By the fact that it's see-through"  
You like to be judged or liked  
And you like it inside a barrel  
Plunging over the falls  
Strong and green and dim it wrestled him like nothin'  
Out out out  
And into the thrill of em all  
  
And the real wonder of the world is that we don't jump too
