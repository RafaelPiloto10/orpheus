The street light  
Through my window  
Makes me feel secure  
There's no one to distract me  
I'm locking the door  
You cannot barge into  
My own little world  
You can't take the joy  
From the soul of this girl  
  
Telling me your lies, lies, lies  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies  
  
My thoughts are all tangled  
I don't know what I feel  
You try to confuse me  
'Till I don't know what's real  
You say what's good (for me)  
You don't even know me  
You don't even want the truth  
That you need to feel  
The power that was taken from you  
  
Telling me your lies, lies, lies  
Don't tell me lies, lies, lies...  
  
So I'll pretend,  
And we'll all be happy  
But in the end  
There's no telling when  
You'll slip off the edge  
And you start up again  
But I'm not the same child  
Who just had no defense  
  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies...  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies...  
  
All that's left is this knocking  
Of a heart you left on the shelf  
You twisted your love  
'Cause you don't love yourself  
  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies  
Don't tell me lies, lies, lies...  
Don't tell me lies...
