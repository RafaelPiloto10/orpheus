I'm taking over my body  
Back in control, no more shotty  
I bet a lot of me was lost  
"T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted  
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot  
Like flesh is all I got  
Not any more, flesh out the door  
  
I must'a forgot, you can't trust me  
I'm moment-to-moment and close but don't show it  
Before you know it I'm lost at sea  
And now that I write and think about it  
And the story unfolds  
You should take my life  
You should take my soul  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my left-side brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
And I'll be holding on to you  
  
Remember the moment  
You know exactly where you're goin'  
'Cause the next moment before you know it  
Time is slowin' and it's rolling still  
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?  
You think twice about your life  
It probably happens at night, right?  
  
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it  
Tie a noose around your mind  
Loose enough to breath fine and tie it  
To a tree tell it,  
You belong to me, this ain't a noose  
This is a leash and I have news for you  
You must obey me!  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my left-side brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
Entertain my faith  
  
Lean with it, rock with it  
When we gonna stop with it?  
Lyrics that mean nothing  
We were gifted with thought  
  
Is it time to move our feet  
To an introspective beat  
It ain't the speakers that bump hard  
It's our hearts that make the beat  
  
And I'll be holding on to you
