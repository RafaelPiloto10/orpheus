You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you've got  
You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you've got  
  
'Cause if you think  
Nobody else wants it  
Just throw it away  
And you will see  
Somebody else will have it  
Before you can count 1-2-3  
  
You take love for granted  
And it's gone like a bandit  
And this loneliness cuts like a knife  
  
When you see what you've lost  
It's already cost  
The one you could love your whole life
