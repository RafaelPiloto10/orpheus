No I haven't slept a week at all  
Since you've been gone  
And my eyes are kinda tired  
From crying all night long  
No I've never been too good at cooking just for one  
It's so lonely here without you baby  
Come back home  
  
'Cause I'm half crazy  
Feelin' sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried you'd find someone else to love  
  
No life hasn't been much fun at all  
Since you've been gone  
And my eyes begin to fill  
Each time I hear our song  
I spent every minute asking myself  
What went wrong  
Can't we try to talk it over baby  
Come back home  
  
'Cause I'm half crazy  
Feelin' sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried you'd find someone else to love  
But baby there is no-one else  
Half crazy  
For everything you saying  
Half crazy  
No one else could love you like I do  
  
(Break)  
  
'Cause I'm half crazy  
Feelin' sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried you'd find someone else to love  
But baby there is no-one else  
Half crazy  
For everything you saying  
Half crazy  
No one else could ever love you  
No one else could ever be  
  
Half crazy  
Feeling sorry for myself  
And I'm worried you'll find someone else  
Feeling sorry for myself  
Half Crazy (faded)
