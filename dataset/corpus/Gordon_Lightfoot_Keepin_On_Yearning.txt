Keepin' on smoking, Lord I keep on joking  
Keepin' on moving a round  
Leaving everything behind until at last  
I find what no one's ever found  
  
Feeling kind of lonely on the telephone  
To day I must keep moving on  
Leaving everything I know I really need  
And so I guess I'll move a long  
  
It doesn't matter if the sun don't shine  
It doesn't matter if the rain don't fall  
I could think about you all the time  
Do you ever think of me at all  
  
Keepin' on yearnin', keepin' on learnin'  
Lord I keep turning it on  
Leaving everything I know I really love  
And so I guess I'll move along  
  
It doesn't matter if the sun don't shine  
It doesn't matter if the rain don't fall  
I know I could make you mine  
You know I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Keepin' on smokin', gotta keep on joking  
Gotta keep moving around  
Leaving everything behind until at last  
I find what no one's ever found  
  
It doesn't matter if the sun don't shine  
It doesn't matter if the rain don't fall  
I could think about you all the time  
Do you ever think of me at all  
  
Keepin' on yearnin', gotta keep on learnin'  
Gotta keep turning it on  
Leaving everything I know I really love  
And so I guess I'll move along  
  
It doesn't matter if the sun don't shine  
It doesn't matter if the rain don't fall  
I know I could make you mine  
You know I wouldn't mind at all
