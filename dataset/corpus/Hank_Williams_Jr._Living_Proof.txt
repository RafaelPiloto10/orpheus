I'm gonna quit singin' all these sad songs  
'Cause I can't stand the pain  
Oh, the life I sing about now  
And the one I live is the same  
When I sing them old songs of daddy's  
Seems like every one comes true  
Lord, please help me  
Do I have to be the living proof  
Why just the other night after the show  
An old drunk came up to me  
He says "You ain't as good as your daddy, boy  
And you never will be"  
Then a young girl in old blue jeans  
Says, "I'm your biggest fan"  
It's a good thing I was born Gemini  
'Cause I'm living for more than one man  
Remember Jimmie and Hank and Johnny  
They were in the summer of life  
When you called them away, Lord  
I don't wanna pay that price  
Don't let my son ever touch a guitar  
May he never sing the blues  
Let him be free  
Don't make him be more living proof  
I don't wanna be a legend  
I just wanna be a man  
But Lord, You know sometimes  
I've needed a helpin' hand  
And it ain't been so easy lately  
I've had to go it all alone  
But I've always had anything  
I ever wanted, except a home  
I'm gonna quit singin' all them sad songs  
'Cause I can't stand the pain  
Oh, the life I sang to you about  
And the one I live is the same  
Yes, I've sang those old songs of daddy's  
And now it seems they all come true  
Lord, please help me  
Do I have to be the living proof  
Lord, please help me  
I don't wanna be the living proof
