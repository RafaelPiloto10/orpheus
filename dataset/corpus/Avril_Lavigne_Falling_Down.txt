If fear's what makes us decide  
Our future journey  
Well I'm not along for the ride  
'Cause I'm still yearning  
  
To try and touch the sky  
My fingers burning  
Before you are old you're young  
Yeah I'm stilling learning  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
I'm standing out in the street  
The earth is moving  
I feel it under my feet  
And I'm still proving  
  
That I can stand my ground  
And my feet are there  
Having washed my hair  
To be lost before you are found  
Don't mean you're losing  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
Someday I'll live in a house  
Etc, etc, etc  
But you know that's not for now  
For now I'm falling down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Yea, yeah, yeah  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Falling right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
I am falling down (falling, falling, falling)  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
(oh you're falling)
