Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song, high above the trees with a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, do you know what I know  
In your palace warm, mighty king, do you know what I know  
A child, a child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Said the king to the people everywhere, listen to what I say  
Pray for peace, people everywhere, listen to what I say  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night, he will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light
