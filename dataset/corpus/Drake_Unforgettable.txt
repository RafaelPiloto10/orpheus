Let me know, let me know  
Ooh, let me know, let me know let me know  
  
Uh, yeah this is really one of my dumbest flows ever  
I haven't slept in days  
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways  
So I'm single thinking about what we had and missing you  
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too  
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out  
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out  
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out  
And all the girls that played me eat your motherfucking heart out, its Drizzy  
Always gone but never hard to find  
And since you can't escape me do I ever cross your mind  
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave  
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save  
But I'm good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle  
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now  
Never forgetting from where I came  
And no matter where I'm headed  
I promise to stay the same (yeah, look)  
  
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down  
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around  
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters  
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest  
  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I'm doin' my thing) 'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable  
  
This just might be my realest flow ever  
When I say fo' life, y'all say fo'ever (fo'ever)  
It's hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts  
The closest your gone get to this is a Pac T-shirt  
The names young, baby you know I live that thug life  
The good die young so I'm gone need a thug wife  
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms  
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm (yeah)  
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car  
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar  
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers  
Damn right, so fly I need feathers  
Sayin' shit in the streets so whats the dilly  
You done everything in the A but fuck Chilli (haha)  
So welcome to my life no two days the same  
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her names the game  
  
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down  
Ask your girl I'm the realest nigga she been around  
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters  
And when you get to talking 'bout the greatest  
  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I just really hope that) You'll think of me  
(I'm doin' my thing) 'Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable  
  
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night  
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life  
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife  
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife  
  
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil' bra  
Unforgettable, ya never forget this  
You understand me? Timeless homie, unforgettable (Let me know, let me know)
