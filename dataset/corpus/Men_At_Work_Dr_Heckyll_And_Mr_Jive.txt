Dr. Heckyll works late at the laboratory  
Where things are not as they seem  
Dr. Heckyll wishes nothing more desperately  
Than to fulfill all of his dreams  
Letting loose with a scream in the dead of night  
As he's breaking new ground  
  
Trying his best to unlock all the secrets  
But he's not sure what he's found  
Dr. Heckyll is his own little guinea pig  
'Cause they all think he's mad  
Sets his sights on the search of a lifetime  
And he's never, never sad  
  
Whoa oh, it's off to work he goes  
In the name of science and all its wonders  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
  
Not long now till the ultimate experiment  
He's breaking all the rules  
He wants to cure all matter of imbalance  
In this world of fools  
He locks the door, and he looks around nervously  
He knows there's no one there  
He drinks it down and waits for some reaction  
To all his work and care  
  
Hey, hey, he fumbles for what to say  
He loves the world except for all the people  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
  
Whoa oh, it's out at night he goes  
He slips easily into conversation  
Hey, hey, he's cool in every way  
Sometimes he loves to sing that old black magic  
  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive

Believes the underdog will eventually survive
