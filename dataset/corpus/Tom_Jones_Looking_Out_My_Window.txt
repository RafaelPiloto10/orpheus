Now people you know who I am,  
And you know what I can do,  
But I got a problem now and I'm gonna tell you about it,  
I'm looking for this woman, y'see,  
  
Listen, this is the way the story goes)  
Looking out my window  
Looking at the rain  
Nothing left but pain  
Why'd you go and leave me  
Sad alone and blue  
Looking out my window woman  
Tryin' to find you  
Why did you leave me?  
Why did you grieve me?  
Looking out my window  
What do I see?  
Nobody's crying  
Half as bad as me  
I don't think that they feel  
So alone and blue  
Looking out my window baby  
Trying to find you  
Why did you leave me?  
Why did you grieve me?  
I'd like to tell you about  
This little girl that left  
Me so alone and blue  
The trouble is if I paint the  
Picture too well you  
Might fall in love with her too  
She was about 5-6  
A little bag of tricks  
My mama told me to watch myself but I didn't listen  
Because for you baby I'd scratch out my eye  
Looking out my window  
Down the railroad track  
Waiting for that little brown eyed girl  
She's coming back  
I gotta hear that whistle blowing  
Down the line  
Come back girl  
She'll be mine, oh mine  
Why did you leave me?  
Why did you grieve me?  
Whoa  
Baby come on home  
I'm so alone  
Ya know I don't care what the world might say  
I'm gonna love you  
Oh baby  
I'm down on my knees  
And I'm beggin' you please  
Ah  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,  
I love you, I love you  
Come on home, come on home baby, come on home baby, come on home baby, to me.
