I know that you  
Don't know me very well  
We've barely met  
But I can surely tell  
No one will ever  
Love you like I do  
I like to feel  
The warm spot on your chair  
Sometimes I drool  
And usually I stare  
My precious one  
I saved that gum  
That you threw in the garbage  
You're the one I dream about  
But the only question with me now  
Is "Do I creep you out?"  
Everytime I shake your hand now  
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth  
Do I creep you out?  
Call you every night and hang up  
Gonna carve your name in my leg  
In my leg, oh-oh!  
Somethin' I should ask about  
Can I sniff the pit-stains on your blouse?  
And do I creep you,  
Do I creep you out?  
(Your restraining order's out)  
(Still the only question with me now)  
Oh the only question  
(Is "Do I creep you out?")  
Is "Do I creep you out?"  
Know exactly where you live now  
Follow you from work right to your house  
Well, do I creep you out?  
Do I creep you out?  
(cheering crowd)
