All good people your time will come  
Work forever and still not be done  
Close your tired eyes, no one knows you've gone  
It's not forever but today you've become  
The man who left himself  
  
Don't belong here, your heart beats too fast  
Feel the mis-beat, it starts and stops  
Don't be frightened, these things never last  
Maybe tomorrow your time will have passed  
It's the man who left himself
