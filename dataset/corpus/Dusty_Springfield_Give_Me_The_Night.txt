Simple dreams and crazy schemes  
All can't come true  
Hear what I'm saying  
My love is with you  
This fire between us  
If only you might  
Give me the night tonight  
  
Give me the night  
My heart's on ice  
Come to me, care for me  
Sing to me, share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
  
Oh, boulevards of broken dreams  
Now, don't be depressed, oh  
Now we're together  
And we're riding the crest  
I'm full of your passion  
And you know the rest  
So give me the night tonight  
  
Give me the night  
My heart's on ice  
Come to me, care for me  
Sing to me, share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
Ooh, night, yes night, is better  
Oh, having you than having night  
Oh, our life, our life together  
Oh, it fills me with joy that won't stop  
  
(Give me the night)  
My heart's on ice  
Come to me, care for me  
Sing to me, share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
  
Ooh, hoo, my heart's on ice  
  
Oh, come to me, care for me  
Sing to me, share with me  
Give me the night tonight  
Ooh, hoo, my heart's on ice  
Ah, come to me, care for me  
Ooh, ah, ha  
Give me the night tonight
