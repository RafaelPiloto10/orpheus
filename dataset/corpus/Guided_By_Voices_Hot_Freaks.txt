I met a non-dairy creamer  
Explicitly laid out like a fruitcake  
With a wet spot  
Bigger than a great lake  
Took me to the new church  
And baptized me with salt  
She told me, "liquor"  
I am a new man  
hot freaks  
this one is on the house  
This one is better than ever  
I walked into the house of miraculous recovery  
And stood before king everything  
And he asked me to join him in the red wing  
Took me to pie land  
Said, "I'm a thigh man"  
I will be eternally hateful  
hot freaks  
Hot freaks  
Hot freaks  
this one is on the house  
This one is better than ever  
And this one is on the house  
This one is better than ever  
This one is on the house  
This one is better than ever
