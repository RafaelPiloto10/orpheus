Who's that knocking on my door  
It's gotta be a quarter to four  
Is it you again coming 'round for more  
Well you can love me tonight if you want  
  
But in the morning make sure you're gone  
I'm talkin' to you  
  
Hot legs, wearing me out  
Hot legs, you can scream and shout  
Hot legs, are you still in school  
I love you honey  
  
Gotta most persuasive tongue  
You promise all kinds of fun  
But what you don't understand  
I'm a working man  
  
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E  
By the time you're finished with me  
I'm talking to you  
  
Hot legs, you're an alley cat  
Hot legs, you scratch my back  
Hot legs, bring your mother too  
I love you honey  
  
Imagine how my daddy felt  
In your jet black suspender belt  
Seventeen years old  
He's touching sixty four  
  
You got legs right up to your neck  
You're making me a physical wreck  
I'm talking to you  
  
Hot legs, in your satin shoes  
Hot legs, are you still in school  
Hot legs, you're making me a fool  
I love you honey  
  
Hot legs, making your mark  
Hot legs, keep my pencil sharp  
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself  
I love you honey  
  
Hot legs, you're wearing me out  
Hot legs, you can scream and shout  
Hot legs, you're still in school  
I love you honey
