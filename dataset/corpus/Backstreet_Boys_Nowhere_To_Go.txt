Looking for beauty in a certain  
Finding the strength inside a gray  
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown  
And maybe that's ok  
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life  
Maybe I need to get a grip  
Cause you're the only one  
That makes me feel like this  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
Save me I'm falling again  
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces  
In the end no matter what I do  
There's nowhere, nowhere to go  
  
Nowhere to go but you  
  
Tryin' to make nothing out of something  
Promise myself I wouldn't care  
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here  
You finally crackin' my resistance  
And find a way to wear me down  
  
Yea, I just look at you  
And there's no way out  
  
Every single road I take (it's you)  
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you)  
And it's too late for anyone to save me  
  
I'm falling again  
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Nowhere to go but you
