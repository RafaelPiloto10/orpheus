We waste our time with big illusions  
Talking to the walls  
But Jericho will never fall  
We sold our trumpets long ago  
  
Exchanging all the best we had  
Into atomic masterplans  
We read the books we had our chance  
We spend the world for just one dance  
  
So keep on dancing, all you fools  
The cups of fury have been filled  
So keep on dancing, all you clowns  
Lets have a sip before we're killed  
So keep on dancing  
  
These politicians make me sigh  
Democracy is just a lie  
As long as we are rich enough  
Each gouvernment will do for us  
  
We feed like vampires on the world  
We are the first, they are the third  
There ain't no hope, we had our chance  
We spent the world for one last dance  
  
So keep on dancing ...  
  
7 seals  
7 trumpets  
7 plagues  
7 cups  
  
7 angels  
The scarlet beast  
Mother of harlots  
Faithful and true
