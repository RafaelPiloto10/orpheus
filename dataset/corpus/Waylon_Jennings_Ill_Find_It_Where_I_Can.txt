Ah! It's just another wasted mornin'  
While I'm holdin' up the wall  
Too much tequila makes me wonder  
Why I'm headin' home at all  
Get that honky tonk feelin'  
  
Every time your arms grow cold  
I suppose that's the reason  
I need a home away from home  
So I'll say one more time  
And I hope you'll understand  
If I can't find it in your arms, babe  
  
I'm gonna find it where I can  
I can't refuse them lonely women  
Lord, I know just how they feel  
I suppose that's the reason  
What you been givin' me makes me feel  
Honey, I'm gettin' that honky tonk feelin'  
  
Every time your arms grow cold  
And I suppose that's the reason  
I need a home away from home  
So I'll say it one more time, one more time  
And I hope you'll understand  
If I can't find it in your arms, babe  
  
I'm gonna find it where I can  
If I can't find it in your arms, babe  
I'm gonna find it where I can
