I saw the man at J.F.K.  
He took your ticket yesterday  
In the humdrum  
  
I ride tandem with a random  
Things don't run the way I planned them  
In the humdrum  
  
Hey Valentina, do you want me to beg?  
You got me cooking I'm a hard boiled egg  
In the humdrum  
  
Empty my mind, I find it hard to cope  
Listen to my heart, don't need no stethoscope  
  
Seem to me that television  
She come to cut me a deep incision  
In the humdrum  
  
Empty my mind, I find it hard to cope  
Listen to my heart - don't need no stethoscope  
  
Out of woman come the man  
Spend the rest of his life gettin' back where he can  
As a bow, so a dove  
As below, so above  
From the black hole  
Come the tadpole  
With the dark soul  
In coal she burn, she burn  
  
As I drove into the sun  
Didn't dare look where I had begun  
Lost among echoes of things not there  
Watching the sound forming shapes in the air  
From the white star  
Came the bright scar  
Our amoeba  
My little liebe schoen
