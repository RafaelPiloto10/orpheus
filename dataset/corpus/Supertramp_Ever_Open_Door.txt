Sharing's good, sharing's fine  
But no one wants to share this world of mine  
Is dull, dark and grey  
And no one wants to find the way  
to my front door is always open to you  
  
Hey now life, give me a break  
For much more of this I cannot  
Take me to a far off place  
Where there's no rich or poor  
And every house has got an ever open door  
  
I want to find my direction  
I want my love and affection  
Yes I'm needing it more and more  
  
I want to find my own answers  
it's time I knew what my plans were  
I'm going to find out what I'm looking for  
  
I'm gonna take all my chances  
Gonna make my advances  
Gonna see what my life has in store  
  
I've got a feeling inside me  
I'll put the past way behind me  
Pick myself up from the floor  
  
I want my sun in the morning  
Want my friends to come calling  
I'll keep a welcome outside my door
