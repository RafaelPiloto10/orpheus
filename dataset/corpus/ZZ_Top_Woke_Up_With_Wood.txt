When I woke up this morning  
I was feeling mighty good.  
My baby understood had to do what she should  
Lying near a pile of wood.  
Laying it on some,  
Playing with it some  
When I, I woke up with wood.  
  
I was lying there thinking 'bout basketball  
Trying not to lose my mind  
My baby came to help and I let out a yell,  
She grabbed me from behind.  
Laying on it some,  
Playing with it some  
When I, I woke up with wood.  
  
Beauty queens fall in trances,  
Debutantes lose their furs.  
But it felt so good from where they stood,  
They were working on a pile of wood.  
Laying on it some,  
Playing with it some  
When I, I woke up with wood.
