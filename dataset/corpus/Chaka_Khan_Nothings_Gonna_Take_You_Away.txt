You, you carry your dreams in your eyes  
And if someone hurts you, you cry  
And you, you live on a cloud in the sky  
And wish on the stars shooting by  
Don't let the little woes of life harm me  
Let the joy in the life your lead  
Let it charm you  
Let it charm you  
CHORUS:  
Nothing's gonna take you away  
Nothing's gonna break your heart  
Nothing's gonna take you away  
Nothing's gonna break your heart  
You, you go barefootin' when there are showers  
You like to listen to coltrane for hours  
And you're gonna need smeone standing by  
And on me you can always rely
