[UK Bonus Track]  
  
When I was a little boy,  
I looked under the stairs,  
The King and the Pawns  
Were caught unawares,  
Standing in the shadows  
A whisperer to be,  
Just fishing in the darkness  
Of possibilities.  
  
Just look at you now  
Yeah  
Look at you now  
Yeah  
Oh  
Look at you now  
  
Among such style and grace  
Our highest hopes,  
None standing  
Still the running joke,  
Where goes the warm embrace  
It fades without return  
It lives to slip through fingertips and burn.  
  
Just look at you now  
Oh  
Look at you now  
Ohh  
look at you now  
Ohh  
Look at you now
