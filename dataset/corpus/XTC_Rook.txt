Rook, Rook Read from your book  
Who murders who and where is the treasure hid?  
Crow, Crow Spill all you know  
Is that my name on the bell?  
Rook, Rook Gaze in the brook  
If there's a secret can I be part of it?  
Crow, Crow Before I'll let go, say is that my name on the bell?  
Soar up high, see the semaphore from the washing lines  
Break the code of the whispering chimneys and traffic signs  
Where's the message that's written under the base of clouds?  
Plans eternal, I know you know, so don't blurt out loud  
Rook, Rook By hook or by crook  
I'll make you tell me what this whole thing's about!  
Crow, Crow Why can't you show  
If that's my name on the bell?  
On the wings of night, I fly too, above field and stream  
My head bursting with knowledge 'till I wake from the dream  
If I die and I find that I had a soul inside  
Promise me that you'll take it up on its final ride  
Rook, Rook Gaze in the brook  
If there's a secret can I be part of it?  
Crow, Crow Before I'll let go, say is that my name on the bell?  
Is that my name on the bell?
