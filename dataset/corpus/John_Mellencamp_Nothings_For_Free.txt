We started out  
With a sin and a lie  
And moved on to 'what's in it for me,'  
And when trouble washed up, hell, we just let it flow by  
And our kindness just washed out to sea.  
  
They say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy, he slaved  
For an uncaring boss,  
'Cause nothin' worth nothin's for free  
  
Now saviors, they work  
Lots of overtime,  
And sinners just try to get by  
And the losers, they play  
'Til they've spent their last dime  
With the comfort of knowing they tried  
  
Well, they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy, he worked  
For an uncaring boss  
'Cause nothin' worth nothin's for free.  
  
Well, I've lived a good life  
And I've lived a bad,  
And they both felt like sweet liberty,  
And I felt the storm coming,  
My redemption at hand  
And everything good comes for free.  
  
Well, they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me.  
And Daddy, he slaved  
For an uncaring boss,  
Nothin' worth nothin's for free.  
  
Well, they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
And nothin' worth nothin's for free.
