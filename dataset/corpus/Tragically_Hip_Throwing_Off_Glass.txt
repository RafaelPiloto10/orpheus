"Why is the world so creepy?", she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
I told her that, It isn't  
That, that it's exquisite  
But like love, it has it's barbarous threats  
Still in spite of the cads  
And the stoop-shouldered teens  
I know I'm losing you  
I know what that means, yeah  
I told her that it isn't  
That it's real exquisite  
But like love, it can have it's  
Stubbed-toe effects  
And juts like after she heard the word, 'Iridescent'  
And everything was iridescent for awhile  
It wasn't long before she exalted out of nowhere  
Isn't this exquisite?'  
Once you've said, 'mmm' in unison  
And, 'oh' in double surprise  
And shared relief with a mutual, 'phew'  
And a look in each others eyes  
I tell her that is isn't, insisted that it isn't  
Because like love it has too-cunning effects, yeah  
I told her that it isn't that it's just exquisite  
Because like love it has it's barbarous threats  
"Why is the world so creepy?", she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
Breaking glass, throwing off glass
