If dust could only talk  
What would we hear it say?  
Before it's brushed aside  
Just as it's swept away  
  
It's just the evidence  
It's of no consequence  
It's only flesh and bone  
Why don't you leave it alone?  
  
If dust could only gather into lines of chalk  
Around a silhouette detective fiction walks  
For it's the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
Why did they dam the land?  
How did they flood the plain?  
Did they erase the name?  
And wipe away the stain  
You kept your mouth well shut  
Appeared to turn your coat  
Now there's a name for you but it's stuck in my throat  
  
If dust could only mutter  
Or in laughter trill  
If it could warn and whisper from the windowsill  
For it's the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth?  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come The Poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
When they are made of money  
Here come the Lamb of God  
And the butcher's boy, Sonny  
  
If dust could only gather in a needle track  
Then it would skip a beat and it would jump right back  
If dust could only gather in a needle track  
Then it would skip a beat  
And all the sense I lack
