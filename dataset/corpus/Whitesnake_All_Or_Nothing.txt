Tonight's the night  
To come in out of the cold,  
I've waited such a long, long time  
I'm getting out of control  
All or nothing  
That's what I want from you,  
I'm gonna give you everything I got  
Now what are you gonna do  
  
Don't try running away,  
You know you get nothing that way  
'Cause it's too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause' it's too late for you now  
  
My heart is burning  
An' the fire is hot,  
My temperature is rising, rising, rising  
I'm ready to rock  
All or nothing  
I'm gonna make you see,  
I've made up my mind, for sure, this time  
You're gonna spend the night with me  
  
So don't try running away,  
You know you get nothing that way  
'Cause it's too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause it's too late for you now  
  
So don't try running away,  
You know you get nothing that way  
'Cause it's too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause it's too late for you now  
  
Too late,  
I'm gonna prove it to you  
Too late,  
I'll do what you want me to do  
Too late,  
You can't run anymore  
'Cause it's too late for you now
