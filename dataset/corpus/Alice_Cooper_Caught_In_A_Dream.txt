Well I'm runnin through the world  
With a gun in my back  
Tryin' to catch a ride in a Cadillac  
Thought that I was livin'  
But you can't really tell  
Been tryin' to get away  
From that success smell  
  
You know I need a houseboat and I need a plane  
I need a butler and a trip to Spain  
I need everything  
The world owes me  
I tell that to myself  
And I agree  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
So What!  
You don't know what I'm goin' through  
I'm right in between  
So I'll  
I'll just play along with you  
  
Well I'm runnin' through the world  
With a gun in my back  
Tryin' to catch a ride in that Cadillac  
Thought I was livin'  
But you can't never tell  
What I thought was heaven  
Turned out to be hell  
  
Whoa-o-oh  
When you see me with a smile on my face  
Whoa-o-oh  
Then you'll know I'm a mental case  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
So what!  
I don't know what I'm going through  
I'm right in between  
So I'll  
I'll just play along with you  
  
Whoa-o-oh Oh  
Whoa-o-oh Oh  
Whoa-o-oh
