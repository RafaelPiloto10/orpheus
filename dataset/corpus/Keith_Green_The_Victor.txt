Swallowed into earth's dark womb  
And death has triumphed  
That's what they say  
But tried to hold him in the tomb  
The son of life  
Rose on the third day  
Just look  
The gates of hell  
They're falling  
Crumbling from the inside out  
He's bursting through  
The walls with laughter (hah!)  
Listen to the angels shout  
It is finished  
He has done it  
Life conquered death  
Jesus christ  
Has won it  
His plan of battle  
You know it  
He fooled them all  
They led him off to prison to die  
But as he entered hades hall  
He broke those hellish chains with a cry  
Just listen to those demons screaming  
See him bruise the serpent's head  
The prisoners of hell  
He's redeeming (oh!)  
All the power of death is dead  
It is finished  
He has done it  
Life conquered death  
Jesus christ  
Has won it  
Just look  
The gates of hell they're falling  
Crumbling from the inside out  
He's bursting through the walls with laughter (hah!)  
Listen to the angels shout  
(listen, oh, listen)  
It is finished  
He has done it  
Life conquered death  
Jesus christ  
Has won it  
It is finished  
He has done it  
Life conquered death  
Jesus christ  
Has won it
