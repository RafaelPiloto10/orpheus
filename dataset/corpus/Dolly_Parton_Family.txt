When it's family, you forgive them  
For they know not what they do  
When it's family, you accept them  
'Cause you have no choice but to  
When it's family, they're a mirror  
Of the worst and best in you  
And they always put you to the test  
And you always try to do your best  
And just pray for God to do the rest  
When it's family  
  
Some are preachers, some are gay  
Some are addicts, drunks and strays  
But not a one is turned away  
When it's family  
Some are lucky, others ain't  
Some are fighters, others faint  
Winners, losers, sinners, saints  
It's all family  
  
And when it's family, you trust them  
And your heart's an open door  
When it's family, you tolerate  
What you'd kill others for  
When it's family, you love and hate  
And take then give some more  
Somehow you justify mistakes  
Try to find some better way  
To solve the problems day to day  
In the family  
  
You take the trouble as it comes  
And love 'em more than anyone  
Good or bad or indifferent  
It's still family  
You choose your lovers  
You pick your friends  
Not the family that you're in  
They'll be with you 'til the end  
'Cause it's family  
  
When it's family, you forgive them  
For they know not what they do  
When it's family, they're a mirror  
Of the worst and best in you  
When it's family, when it's family  
Let me be all that I should be  
To the family
