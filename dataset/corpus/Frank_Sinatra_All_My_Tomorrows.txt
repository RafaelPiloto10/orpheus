Today I may not have a thing at all  
Except for just a dream or two  
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow  
And all my tomorrows belong to you  
  
Right now it may not seem like spring at all  
We're drifting and the laughs are few  
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow  
And all my tomorrows belong to you  
  
No one knows better than I  
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate  
But with you there at my side  
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait  
  
As long as I've got arms that cling at all  
It's you that I'll be clinging to  
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow  
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true  
  
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you
