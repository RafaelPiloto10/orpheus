Rainy night, I'm all alone  
Sittin' here waitin' for your voice on the phone  
Fever turns to cold, cold sweat  
Thinkin' about things we ain't done yet  
  
Tell me now, I've got to know, do you feel the same?  
Do you just light up at the mention of my name?  
  
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new  
That's just love sneakin' up on you  
If your whole world's shakin' and you feel like I do  
That's just love sneakin' up on you  
  
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide  
Once love comes sneakin' upon your blindside  
And you might as well try to stop the rain  
Or stand in the tracks of a runaway train  
  
You just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be  
So come on let's finish what you started with me  
  
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new  
That's just love sneakin' up on you  
If your whole world's shakin' and you feel like I do  
That's just love sneakin' up on you
