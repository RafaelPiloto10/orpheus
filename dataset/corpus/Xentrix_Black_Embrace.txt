Chosen for this brutality  
You see no sign you're unaware  
This is the start of the atrocity  
That will send you far beyond repair  
Trapped inside yourself  
A dark, lonely place  
Because of what you are  
Eternal black embrace  
You're void of all self-respect  
Your dignity has gone  
Don't know what you expect  
You feel like you're the only one  
Trapped inside yourself  
A dark, lonely place  
Because of what you are  
Eternal black embrace  
This black cloud hangs over you  
Plague you right until your dying day  
Always something that you can do  
Speak out, don't fade away  
Trapped inside yourself  
A dark, lonely place  
Because of what you are  
Eternal black embrace
