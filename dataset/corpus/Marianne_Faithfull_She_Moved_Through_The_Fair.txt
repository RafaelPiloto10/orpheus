My young love said to me, "My brothers won't mind  
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind"  
Then she turned her head to me and this she did say  
"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day"  
  
She turned away from me and she moved through the fair  
And I watched her so swiftly move here and move there  
Then she turned away homeward with one star awake  
Like a swan in the evening moves over the lake  
  
Last night, I did dream that my dead love come in  
So softly she entered that her feet made no din  
And she turned her head to me and this she did say  
"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day"
