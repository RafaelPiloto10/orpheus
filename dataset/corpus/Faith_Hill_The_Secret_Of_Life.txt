Couple of guys sittin' around drinkin'  
Down at the Starlight Bar  
One of 'em says, "You know I've been thinking"  
Other one says, "That won't get you too far"  
  
He says, "This is your life, and welcome to it  
It's just workin' and drinkin' and dreams  
Ad on TV says ?Just Do It'  
Hell if I know what that means"  
  
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee  
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball  
The secret of life is a beautiful woman  
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall  
  
"You and me, we're just a couple of zeros  
Just a couple of down-and-outs  
But movie stars and football heroes  
What have they got to be unhappy about?"  
  
So they turn to the bartender, "Sam, what do you think?  
What's the key that unlocks that door?"  
Sam don't say nothin', just wipes off the bar  
And he pours them a couple more  
  
'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis  
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes  
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football  
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie  
  
Sam looks up from his Sunday paper  
Says, "Boys, you're on the wrong track  
The secret of life is there ain't no secret  
And you don't get your money back"  
Hey  
  
The secret of life is gettin' up early  
The secret of life is stayin' up late  
The secret of life is try not to hurry  
But don't wait  
Don't wait  
  
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee  
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball  
The secret of life is to find the right woman  
The secret of life is nothin' at all  
Oh, it's nothin' at all  
The secret of life
