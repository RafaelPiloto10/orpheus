Earth shares what Earth receives  
And now only blood brings life  
A tiller bring life, producer bring life  
Protector bring life, soiled hands bring life  
  
The tree of democracy shall be watered by the blood of revolution  
So go plant a seed, go plant a seed for harvest  
Go plant a seed for harvest producer  
  
Producer, producer, producer, producer  
Producer, producer, producer, producer  
Producer, producer, producer, producer  
Producer, producer, producer, producer  
Producer, producer, producer, producer  
Producer, producer  
  
And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall  
It all shall fall  
  
I first met you and the ideas you uphold while incarserated A victim of a
social experiment  
Eventually addicted to your eight hour injections of hypocracy and arrogance
and greed  
Forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners  
As they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my
submission  
I bacame an indentured servant in a factory  
Where I myself was the product  
Whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces  
Every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me  
  
So that every thought I express  
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks  
And set fire to their homes  
  
And every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me  
So that every thought I express  
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks  
And set fire to their homes  
  
And set fire to their homes  
And set fire to their homes  
And set fire to their homes  
And set fire to their homes  
  
And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and  
It all shall fall  
  
Fall  
Fall  
Fall  
Fall  
Fall  
Fall  
Fall  
Fall
