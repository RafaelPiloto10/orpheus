If I could make my living going fishing  
Then I would make my living with a line and pole  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money going fishing  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
If I could pay all these bills with my guitar  
Then I would pay these bills with some rock and roll  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money playing guitar Like I'm paid at the factory  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now if I could (if I could)  
Then I would (then I would)  
Make money doing something that I love  
I'd thank my lucky stars above  
  
If I could just get by loving you dear  
Then I would just get by making love to you  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could make my living going fishing  
Then I would make my living with a line and pole  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money going fishing  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could just get by loving you dear  
Then I would just get by making love to you  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory.
