Just another homesick child  
Tired of running wild  
Ready to stand trial and move on  
Though I'm guilty in your sight  
Have some mercy tonight  
I can't make it through the fight alone  
  
Oh but lord, no don't make it easy  
Keep me working till I work it on out  
Just please shine enought light on me  
Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt  
Keep me out of the Shadow of Doubt  
As I try to make some sense  
Of this world I'm up against  
Well I know my best defense is your love  
When the struggle gets insane  
And the lesson's full of pain  
Keep me calling out your name with Love  
  
Oh but lord, no don't make it easy  
Keep me workin' till I work it on out  
Just please won't you shine  
enough light on me  
Til I'm free from this shadow of Doubt  
  
Well I whisper in the dark  
From the bottom of my heart  
And I'm searchin for one star to shine  
I will shout from mountain high  
And I'll reach into the sky  
Til you open up my eyes so blind  
  
Oh but lord no, Don't make it easy  
Keep me workin' til I work it on out  
Just please, please shine enough light on me  
'Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt  
keep me out of the Shadow.....
