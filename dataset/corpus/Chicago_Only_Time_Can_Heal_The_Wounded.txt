You hear a sound as she's leaving  
You'll hear your heart pound so hard  
You'll miss her warm touch and the way things once were  
It's such a cold town when you miss her  
  
It's not the same place no more  
When it's hard to mend what's broken  
And you still can't let her go  
Beyond the storm there's an answer  
  
Beyond the nights you spend alone  
Beyond the headlights and the highways you go  
You'll take a long ride without her  
Until the tears dry away  
  
In every way you try to reason  
When there's no reason left to hold  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Any day now time will tell  
  
Only love can turn it all around again  
There's no heart that time can't heal  
Whatever pieces you're missing  
Whatever you leave behind  
  
However you look at things they do change  
It's not the same conversation  
It's not the way that it was  
There'll be one less tear tomorrow  
There'll be one less night alone  
  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
Any day now time will tell  
Only love can turn it all around again  
There's no heart that time can't heal  
Only time can heal the wounded of love  
There's no heart that time can't heal
