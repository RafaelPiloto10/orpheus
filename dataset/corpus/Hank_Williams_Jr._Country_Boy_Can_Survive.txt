The preacher man says it's the end of time  
And the Mississippi River she's a goin'dry  
  
The interest is up and the stock market's down  
And you only get mugged if you go down town  
  
I live back in the woods you see  
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me  
  
I've got a shotgun a rifle and a four wheel drive  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
I can plow a field all day long  
I can catch catfish from dusk til dawn, yeah  
  
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too  
Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do  
  
We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run  
Cause we'se them ole boys raised on shotguns  
We say grace and we say ma'am  
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn  
  
We come from West Virginia coal mines  
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies  
  
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
I had a good friend in New York City  
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly  
  
My Grandpa taught me how to live off the land  
And his taught him to be a business man  
  
He used to send me pictures of the broadway nights  
And I'd send him some homemade wine  
  
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife  
For forty three dollars, my friend lost his life  
  
I'd love to spit some beechnut in that dude's eyes  
And shoot him with my ole 45  
Cause a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run  
Cause we'se them ole boys raised on shotguns  
We say grace and we say ma'am  
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn  
  
We're from North California and South Alabam  
And little towns all around this land  
  
And we can skin a buck and run a trot line  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
Country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive
