Keep me steady  
Don't rock me all around  
Lord, I don't wanna fall down  
Understand me  
I wish this jet was off the ground  
Look around you  
And tell me what you see  
Are you afraid or is it me?  
I hope we make it  
I hope we don't fall in the sea  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight  
Make me happy  
Just let me see the light  
I hope the runaway path is near  
The look the captain gave  
Was it confidence or fear  
Oh, was it fear  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight  
And it's gonna be an endless flight  
Until we reach the ground tonight  
Yes it's gonna be an endless flight I know  
Like a flyin' bird in the night  
The wind is strong but I hope I'm right  
And this will be the end of this endless flight
