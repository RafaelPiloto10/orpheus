Mama likes to listen to the grand old gospel time  
Daddy is a cowboy drinkin' beer and wine  
Mama's in the kitchen standin' there all alone  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Daddy says come on down to Tootsie's and have yourself a beer  
Mama's in the kitchen standin' there in tears  
My mama love my daddy but it's breaking up our home  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Mama don't like drinkin' and she don't understand  
Daddy's had a hard life a deeply troubled man  
It's honky tonk and gospel that's breaking up our home  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Daddy says come on down...  
I came home one evening there was mama on her knees  
Big old tears of gospel joy running down her cheeks  
She says you don't have to worry son we are not alone  
  
I got Jesus on the radio and Jesus on the phone  
Daddy says come on down...
