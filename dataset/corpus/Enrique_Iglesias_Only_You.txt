Looking from a window above  
It's like a story of love  
Can you hear me.  
Came back only yesterday  
I'm Moving further away  
Want you near me.  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you  
  
Sometimes when I think of your name  
And it's only a game  
And I need you  
Listening to the words that you say  
Getting harder to stay  
When I see you  
  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you  
  
This is gonna take a long time  
And I wonder what's mine  
Can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand  
It's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
Repeat (2 times):  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
All I ever knew  
Only you
