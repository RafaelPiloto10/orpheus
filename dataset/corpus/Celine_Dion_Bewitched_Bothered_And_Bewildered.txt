She's a fool and don't I know it  
But a fool can have her charms  
I'm in love and don't I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
  
Love's the same old situation  
Lately I've not slept a wink  
Since this crazy situation  
Has me on the blink  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A whimpering, simpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I  
  
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep  
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I  
  
I lost my heart, but what of it  
She is cold I agree  
She might laugh, but I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
  
I'll sing to her, bring spring to her  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
