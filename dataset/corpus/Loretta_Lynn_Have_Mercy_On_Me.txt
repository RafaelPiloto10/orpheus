Have mercy on me, baby  
I'm down upon my knees  
Have mercy on me, baby  
I'll do just as you please  
Well, you know that I love you  
I'll put no one else above you  
Have mercy on me, baby, have mercy  
  
Have mercy on me, baby  
Please have a little heart  
Have mercy on me, baby  
You're tearing me apart  
The way that you do me  
You know you done got to me  
Have mercy on me, baby, have mercy  
  
She's got you hypnotized  
And your brain is paralyzed  
You know she's only playing with you  
Like a puppet on a string  
Remember just one thing  
She can't love you like I do, no  
  
Have mercy on me, baby  
Please give this heart a break  
Have mercy on me baby  
I'll do just what it takes  
You know you won't regret it  
So hey, there now I said it  
Have mercy on me, baby, have mercy  
  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
Have mercy on me, baby  
Have mercy on me  
Have mercy on me, baby  
Please have mercy on me  
Have mercy
