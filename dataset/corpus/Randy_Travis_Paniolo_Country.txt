Places I have been,  
Cities I have seen,  
With concrete caverns rising from the ground.  
Miles and miles of asphalt trail,  
Stretch across a land,  
Stampeding metal ponies leaving smoke along the way...  
I'm going back to paniolo county,  
Stars at night  
No city lights.  
Paniolo country, my home on the range.  
I made up my mind, won't waste any time  
I'm going back to where the clouds ride high.  
Take my word its pretty, not like the great big city  
The winds still bring cool clear mountian air.  
I'm going back to paniolo country  
Rain drops fall, the grass grows tall  
Paniolo county, my home on the range.
