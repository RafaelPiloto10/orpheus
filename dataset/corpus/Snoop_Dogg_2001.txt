[Repeat: x2]  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all  
  
It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge  
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college  
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene  
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends  
I hope things get better for you  
Cause I'ma make things get better for me  
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB  
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea  
We ride at high tide, the East is my side  
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable  
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible  
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence  
Wit persistence I perceive  
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed  
Better go around and when it come to you  
Don't bite off more than you can chew  
Respect the game and the game will respect you back  
Game is life, life is struggle  
Without the coastal juggle  
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal  
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)  
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces  
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather  
As for me I'm trying to keep it real Dogg  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Just keep it real Dogg  
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all  
  
"Teatlet", hold em, shake em, roll  
Fly G boys and all you hood-rat girls  
Pound puts it down all around the world  
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga  
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark  
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?  
On the microphone I bury the bone  
Always, strays try to follow me home  
To get the pooper scooper, why? They dropping doo-doo  
I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe  
See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash  
When I mob, make marks across the street  
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail  
For the bow-wow LBC style  
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper  
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever  
I want em close enough so I can lock on em  
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em  
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em  
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten,  
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?  
Major trick we're hitting licks like a doberman gang  
Why'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy  
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs  
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke  
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver  
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out  
Oh, did you not know  
Snoop wit the .44 knocking at'cha door  
We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses  
Knocking niggas like cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin  
It's like in a action  
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting  
Busting, no need for discussion  
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust  
Close enough to touch then rush  
Clean and radical and get clutch  
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone  
For the D-O-double G (with the solid gold rhyme)  
  
[Chorus: x3]
