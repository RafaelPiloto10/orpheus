(We want information, information, information)  
(Who are you?)  
(The new number two)  
(Who is number one?)  
(You are number six)  
(I am not a number, I am a free man)  
  
I'm on the run kill to eat  
You're starving now you're dead on your feet  
Going all the way nature's beast  
Do what I want as I please  
  
Run, fight, to breathe it's tough  
Now you see me now you don't  
Break the walls I'm coming out  
  
Not a prisoner I'm a free man  
And my blood is my own now  
Don't care where the past was  
I know where I'm going, out  
  
If you kill me it's self defense  
If I kill you then I call it vengeance  
Spit in your eye I will defy  
You'll be afraid when I call out your name  
  
Run, fight, to breathe it's tough  
Now you see me now you don't  
Break the walls I'm coming out  
  
Not a prisoner I'm a free man  
And my blood is my own now  
Don't care where the past was  
I know where I'm going, out  
  
I'm not a number I'm a free man  
I'll live my life how I want to  
You'd better scratch me from your black book  
'Cause I'll run rings round you  
  
Not a prisoner I'm a free man  
And my blood is my own now  
Don't care where the past was  
I know where I'm going, out  
  
I'm not a number I'm a free man  
I'll live my life how I want to  
You'd better scratch me from your black book  
'Cause I'll run rings round you  
  
Not a prisoner I'm a free man  
And my blood is my own now  
Don't care where the past was  
I know where I'm going, out
