[Chorus]  
Wrap me in a bolt of lightning  
Send me on my way still smiling  
Maybe that's the way I should go,  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought I'd be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way  
[Verse]  
Eminem:  
  
I got a letter from a girl  
Let me read it to you, goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
I'm writing to you 'cuz I'm hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz' I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home?  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents don't care that I do this shit  
No one loves me it's like  
I'm a piece of trash  
I don't get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you don't reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way  
  
Eminem:  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason don't you forget that  
Pulled what's the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge?  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
It's just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all it's doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead what's the point in all this!  
  
I finally put it all together,  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine,  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase,  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe that's the way it should be,  
You know I've led my life like a gypsy  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way
