Many days have faded away and the time has passed,  
Those were memories that have been by so fast,  
I can't see you  
I can't hear you  
But I feel you  
  
I would find you,  
I would find you,  
Well, I would find you,  
I would find you  
I would find you  
  
Now that we know that we've been there and the time is running out,  
That message was from the Lord without a doubt,  
I can't see you  
I can't hear you  
But I feel you  
  
Could it be that I feel so all alone  
It's you that's driving me mad  
You won't leave me alone  
  
You have touched my soul  
You have touched my soul  
Now hear me  
  
Could it be that you feel so all alone?  
If it's me that's driving you mad,  
Oh, I would leave you alone  
Oh yes I would.
