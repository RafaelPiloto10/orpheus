There you are, cryin' again  
But your loveliness won't cover your shame  
There you are, you're takin' true love  
And while you're takin' true love, you given the blame  
  
(How could I) Could I be so wrong  
To think that we could get along?  
Days I wasted with you, child  
If I count there'll be a million or two  
Now I stand alone through the memories  
That haunts me, that haunt  
Yeah, and I walk alone through the rhapsodies  
That taunts me, that taunts me, me  
  
There you are, cryin' again  
But your loveliness won't cover your shame  
There you are, you're takin' true love  
And while you're takin' true love, given the blame  
  
(How could I) How could I be so wrong  
To think that we could get along?  
Days I wasted with you, child  
If I count there'll be a million or two  
Now I stand alone through the memories  
That haunts me, that haunts (me)  
And I walk alone through the rhapsodies  
That taunts me, that taunts me  
  
Now, there you are, cryin' again  
But your loveline-ness won't cover your sham-ame, hey  
There you are, you're takin' true lo-love  
While you're takin' true lo-love, given the blame  
  
(How could I) How could I
