You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here  
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir  
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game  
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her  
  
And I can't wait another minute  
I can't take the look she's giving  
You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Got me so high and then she dropped me  
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad  
Took me inside and then she rocked me  
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky  
And I don't wanna go down, go down  
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize  
She'll make me want her right now, right now  
  
And I can't wait another minute  
I can't take the look she's giving  
You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Got me so high and then she dropped me  
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad  
Took me inside and then she rocked me  
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
Hey, you're taking all my pain away  
You're shaking like an earthquake  
Hey, you're taking all my pain away  
You're shaking like an earthquake  
  
Got me so high and then she dropped me  
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad  
Took me inside and then she rocked me  
She keep up all night, this is what it sounds like  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) My lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike  
  
My lucky strike, my lucky strike  
(Oh) You're body rocking, keep me up all night  
(Oh) One in a million
