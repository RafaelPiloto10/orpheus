Everybody's asking me lately where I'm from  
They wanna know what I've been through and what dirt I've done  
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you probably run
off  
If your scared of the truth so instead in secret lined in chalk  
See I've been lost ever since I could walk  
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mamma's boyfriends who would talk  
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke  
Leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho  
But I learned quick that my daddy wasn't ever gonna come around  
And I didn't give a shit 'cause me and my momma we held it down  
No new kicks first day of school I'm goodwill bound  
But when you come from the trench that's how you learn to walk around  
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey  
I just wanted you to know I didn't need a dollar from you I got 'em myself  
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking
yourself lonely  
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf
turn the page  
  
[Chorus]  
Daddy can you see me? I'm putting on a show  
In the magazines, hear me on the radio  
So what do you think huh?  
(Well I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  
I'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow  
Now I'm always on the road no time to say hello  
Bye (and I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  
  
Yeah mamma you look great, perfect  
Be safe on your first date, for certain  
If he brings you home too late, I'll hurt him  
Don't worry bout me I'm safe I'll close the curtains  
And I feel like I'm raising you but what do I know baby blue  
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you  
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go  
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl  
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed  
Vandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me  
But everything I did I had to see  
Feel the pain, had to grieve  
To become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be  
What I've learned cannot be taught  
What I've earned cannot be bought  
Justified deserve it all  
So don't be concerned it's not your fault  
I never counted sheep I count my blessings  
So if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my
message just tell him  
  
[Chorus]
