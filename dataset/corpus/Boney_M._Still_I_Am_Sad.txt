See the stars come joining down from the sky  
Gently passing they kiss your tears when you cry  
See the wind the summer blow your hair upon your head  
See the rain, the falling rain, it's great  
Still I'm sad  
  
All my sounds my tears just fall into days  
They are driving the night will find they are lost  
Now I found the wind is blowing time into my heart  
When the wind blows hard we are apart  
Still I'm sad  
  
See the stars come joining down from the sky  
Gently passing they kiss your tears when you cry  
See the wind the summer blow your hair upon your head  
See the rain, the falling rain, it's great  
Still I'm sad  
  
Still I'm sad  
Oh heart, I'm sad  
Still I'm sad  
Oh heart, I'm sad
