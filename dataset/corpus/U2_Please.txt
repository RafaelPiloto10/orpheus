So you never knew love  
Until you crossed the line of grace  
And you never felt wanted  
Till you had someone slap your face  
So you never felt alive  
Until you almost wasted away  
You had to win  
You couldn't just pass  
The smartest ass  
At the top of the class  
Your flying colors  
Your family tree  
And all your lessons in history  
  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Get up off your knees  
Please  
Please  
Please  
  
So you never know  
How low you'd stoop to make that call  
And you never knew  
What was on the ground till they mad you crawl  
And you never knew that  
The heaven you keep you stole  
  
Your catholic blues  
Your convent shoes  
Your stick on tattoos  
Now they're making the news  
Your holy war  
Your northern star  
Your sermon on the mount  
From the booth of your car  
  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Get up off your knees  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Leave me out of this  
  
So love is hard and love is tough  
But love is not what you're thinking of  
  
September  
Streets capsizing  
Spilling over  
Down the drain  
Shards of glass splinters like rain  
But you could only feel  
Your own pain  
October  
Talking getting nowhere  
November  
December  
Remember  
Are we just starting again  
  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Get up off your knees  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
  
So love is big bigger than us  
But love is not what your thinking of  
It's what lovers deal  
It's what lovers steal  
You know I've found it hard to receive  
'Cause you my love I could never believe
