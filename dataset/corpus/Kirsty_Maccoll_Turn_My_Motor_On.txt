When we make love you know it feels so fine  
Any way you want it baby I don't mind  
Anything you do you know I can't complain  
Come and kiss me honey, here I go again  
I get a kind of power, don't know where it's from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
I get a kind of power, don't know where it's from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
When we have fun you it feels alright  
Wanna see you morning, afternoon and night  
I don't care where, you know I don't mind when  
Just arouse my interest, here I go again  
I get a kind of power, don't know where it's from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
I get a kind of power, don't know where it's from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
We're all alone now now baby please don't hide  
Come on over here, I'm gonna swallow your pride  
Don't act cool now baby, try romance  
It ain't every day that you get a chance like this baby  
You don't have to catch me, I ain't on the run  
Who wants your brain, your body's too much fun  
Just keep on smiling, you ain't in no pain  
Move a little closer, here I go again  
I get a kind of power, don't know where it's from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
I get a kind of power, don't know where it's from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
Oohoo you turn my motor on  
Oohoohoo you turn my motor on
