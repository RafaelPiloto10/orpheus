It takes cheerful resignation  
Heart and humility  
That's all it takes  
A cheerful person told me  
Nobody's harder on me than me  
How could they be  
And, nobody's harder on you than you  
  
Betsy's blue  
She says "Tell me something good!"  
You know I'd help her out if I only could  
Oh, but sometimes the light  
Can be so hard to find  
At least the moon at the window  
The thieves left that behind  
  
People don't know how to love  
They taste it and toss it  
Turn it off and on  
Like a bathtub faucet  
Oh sometimes the light  
Can be so hard to find  
At least the moon at the window  
The thieves left that behind  
  
I wish her heart  
I know these battles  
Deep in the dark  
When the spooks of memories rattle  
Ghosts of the future  
Phantoms of the past  
Rattle, rattle, rattle  
In the spoon and the glass  
  
Is it possible to learn  
How to care and yet not care  
Since love has two faces  
Hope and despair  
And pleasure always turns to fear  
I find  
At least the moon at the window  
The thieves left that behind  
At least they left the moon  
Behind the blind  
Moon at the window
