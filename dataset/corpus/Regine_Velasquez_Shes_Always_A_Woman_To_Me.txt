She can kill with a smile  
She can wound in her eyes  
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies  
And she only reveals what she wants you to see  
She hides like a child  
But she's always a woman to me  
  
She can lead you to love  
She can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth  
But she'll never believe  
And she'll take what you've give her, as long as it's free  
Yeah, she steals like a thief  
But she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh-- she takes care of herself  
She can wait if she wants  
She's ahead of her time  
Oh-- and she never gives out  
And she never gives in  
She just changes her mind  
  
And she'll promise you more  
Than just garden of eden  
Then she'll carelessly cut you  
And laugh while you're bleeding  
But she'll bring out the best  
And the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself  
Cause she's always a woman to me  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
She is frequently kind  
And then suddenly cruel  
She can do as she pleases  
She's nobody's fool  
And she can't be convicted  
She earned her degree  
And the most she will do  
Is throw shadows at you  
But she's always a woman to me...
