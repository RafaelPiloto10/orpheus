Oh, look out kids it's that time of year  
When ole Santa's on his way  
Don't look now but the top is down  
On his candy apple sleigh  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in his hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California, wo-oh  
  
The boulevard, lights of red and green  
As the snow birds make the scene  
Hollywood doesn't miss a beat  
It's another childhood dream  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time for sure  
In California  
  
People say it can't be true  
That the spirit lives here, too  
But you'll find Christmas everywhere  
Under palm trees, sun and moon - ah  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
In California  
In California, wo-oh
