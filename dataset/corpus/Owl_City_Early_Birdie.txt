Good evening shuttle bus  
Tell me where you're gonna take us  
Someplace that I have never been  
It's chic transportation to  
New destination where  
I leave my reflection on the glass  
I'd ask but we don't know  
How far these interstates go  
Or how deep the city routes go down  
In chilly subdepth railways  
The weathered concrete stairways  
Provide me with the means of getting home  
If I ever leave  
  
(On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand while soothing words)  
  
So many sights to see  
So wake up like an early birdie  
And we'll get a head start on the day  
Oh, stained glass skyways  
And crowded six lane highways  
If I look back when I begin to leave  
Will they remember me?  
  
Circuit flights bend the light when I am spent  
And tour guides make happy brides through heaven soon  
  
Good evening shuttle bus  
Tell me where you're gonna take us  
  
(On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand  
While soothing words)  
  
On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand  
While soothing words hover like humming birds  
  
Good, good evening shuttle bus  
Tell me where you're gonna take us
