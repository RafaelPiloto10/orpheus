Words and music by bob seger  
  
I was a rolling stone  
But now I've come back home  
I've given up that trail  
I feel no need to fail  
So take your midnight runs  
I'm hangin' up the guns  
I can't save you angelene  
  
This endless party scene  
This weekend warriors dream  
It's gotten stale for me  
It doesn't set me free  
You want a kindred soul  
Someone to say let's go  
I can't save you angelene  
  
You may find yourself out somewhere babe  
Talkin' loud tellin' ties  
Temptation's gonna get you girl  
No surprise no surprise  
  
I wanna get from here  
I wanna get myself clear  
I want the warm sun over me  
Enter a guilty plea  
Ah babe just walk away from me  
I can't save you angelene
