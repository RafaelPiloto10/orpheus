Once, there was this kid who  
Took a trip to Singapore and brought along his spray paint  
And when he finally came back  
He had cane marks all over his bottom  
He said that it was from when  
The warden whacked it so hard  
  
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm, ah  
  
Once there was this girl who  
Swore that one day she would be a figure skating champion  
And when she finally made it  
She saw some other girl who was better  
And so she hired some guy to  
Club her in the kneecap  
  
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
Ah, mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
  
They got paid for their sound bites  
And sold their TV movie rights  
  
And then, there was this guy who  
Made his wife so mad one night that she cut off his wiener  
And when he finally came to  
He found that Mr. Happy was missing  
He couldn't quite explain it  
It'd always just been there  
  
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
  
(There were, there is)  
(There were, there is)
