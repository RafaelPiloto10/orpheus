I'm sitting on top of this great big wonderful world  
'Cause this is my lucky day, lucky day  
  
Oh boy, I'm lucky  
I'll say I'm lucky  
This is my lucky day  
  
I'm all in clover  
I'm glad all over  
I want to shout "hooray"  
  
I find a horseshoe  
Couldn't go wrong  
And then of course  
You happened along  
  
Oh boy, I'm lucky  
I'll say I'm lucky  
This is my lucky day  
  
Oh boy, I'm lucky  
I'll say I'm lucky  
This is my lucky day
