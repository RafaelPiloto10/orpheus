Oh, you've got green eyes  
Oh, you've got blue eyes  
Oh, you've got grey eyes  
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before  
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before  
  
Heaven, a gateway, a hope  
Just like a feeling I need, it's no joke  
And though it hurts me to see you this way  
Betrayed by words, I'd never heard, too hard to say  
Up, down, turn around  
Please don't let me hit the ground  
Tonight I think I'll walk alone  
I'll find my soul as I go home  
  
Each way I turn, I know I'll always try  
To break this circle that's been placed around me  
From time to time, I find I've lost some need  
That was urgent to myself, I do believe  
Oh, you've got green eyes  
Oh, you've got blue eyes  
Oh, you've got grey eyes  
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before  
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before  
Bolts from above hurt the people down below  
People in this world, we have no place to go  
Oh, it's the last time  
Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before  
Oh no, I've never met anyone quite like you before
