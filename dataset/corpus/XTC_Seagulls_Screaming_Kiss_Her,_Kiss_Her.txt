It's raining on the beach  
She inches close but out of reach  
The waves look painted on  
Seagulls screaming  
  
The sea is warship grey  
It whispers 'Fool!' then slides away  
Black coastline slumbers on  
Seagulls screaming kiss her, kiss her  
  
And all the flags that flap on the pier  
Spell why on earth do you want  
The fog hides much but one thing is clear  
She's nearer  
  
Dead deck chairs under shrouds  
And life belts gape like minstrel mouths  
Her hair still smells of salt  
Seagulls screaming kiss her, kiss her  
Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her, kiss her  
He who hesitates is lost  
  
If you want her, you should tell her  
Take her by the hand If you hesitate  
If you wait, November wins her November will win her  
She returns to sand So get ahold of the girl  
  
I say I like your coat  
Her thank-you tugs my heart afloat  
I nearly didn't hear for  
Seagulls screaming kiss her, kiss her  
  
He who hesitates is lost
