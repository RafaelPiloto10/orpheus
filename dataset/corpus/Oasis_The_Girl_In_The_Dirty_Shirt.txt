If I may be so bold that I could say something  
Come and make me my day  
The clouds around your soul don't gather there for nothing  
I can chase them all away  
Why do you need a reason for to feel happy  
Or shining for the rest of the world  
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy  
Get your shit together girl  
You got a feeling lost inside  
It just won't let you go  
Life is sneaking up behind  
It just won't let you go  
No it just won't let you go  
Is what I'm trying to say  
Is would you maybe, come dancing with me  
'Cause to me it doesn't matter  
If your hopes and dreams are shattered  
'Cause when you say something you make me believe  
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt  
She knows exactly what she's worth  
Knows exactly what she's worth to me!  
That I can see, I can see  
If you ever find yourself inside a bubble  
You've gotta make your own way home  
You can call me anytime you're seeing double  
Now you know you're not alone
