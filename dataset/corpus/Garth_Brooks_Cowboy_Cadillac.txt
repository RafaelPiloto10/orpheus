I've never known one better  
She's a real go getter  
If you met her you'd be good as gone  
She's a real red liner  
Likes it all behind her  
She's the kind that keeps you hangin' on  
  
She's a cowboy's buddy  
Even when she gets muddy  
Lord she's lovely from her front to back  
So either comin' or goin'  
Know her best side's showin'  
She's my cowboy Cadillac  
  
She's the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine  
She's a hard work lover  
A real tough mother  
She's the cover of a magazine  
And I'm happy knowin'  
That what keeps me goin'  
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back  
She's my honkin' tonkin'  
Everything I'm wantin'  
Cowboy Cadillac  
  
She loves to haul them cattle  
All my ropes and saddle  
And it doesn't matter work or play  
If it's a mountain she can crawl it  
If it's hay then she can haul it  
She's the last one to call it a day  
  
She's the perfect picture  
Of the perfect mixture  
Tween a woman and a fine machine  
She's a hard work lover  
A real tough mother  
She's the cover of a magazine  
And I'm happy knowin'  
That what keeps me goin'  
Is what's gonna keep me comin' back  
She's my honkin' tonkin'  
Everything I'm wantin'  
Cowboy Cadillac
