Oh look at the sun, it's all a-glow  
Slow burning star, sinking low  
Heaven knows where you go  
Out of sight, out of minds eye, no  
Aw such a shame, you must leave  
All day long you were a friend to me  
Still, the moon's company  
  
Until morning when larks will sing  
Horizon's appointment you'll keep  
For sun swept flamingos must sleep  
Scenes like these from my dreams  
Cover cutting-room floors all over  
  
Warm heart we spin slowly from view  
Why are you sad, do you disapprove?  
How we've wasted our time  
Sunset, end of my day, my decline  
Postscript you trace colors the sky  
Red-letter light fades, is filed away  
Sunburst fingers you raise  
One last sigh of farewell, goodbye
