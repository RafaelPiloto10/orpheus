I AM A SONG  
  
I'm a song and I've waited so long  
For someone to come and sing me  
I got a rhyme that I've had for some time  
Nobody wants to sing me  
  
Let me show, the world, that I'm, not through  
Let me touch, your heart, the way I used to do  
  
Sing me, sing me, now I got a song to be sung  
Sing me, sing me, roll me around on your tongue  
  
I got sunshine, I got a message to shout  
Sing me, sing me, won't someone please let me out  
  
Could I make you smile if I came back in style?  
Tell me would you want to sing me?  
Don't say I'm gone, never more to live on  
Somebody's got to sing me  
  
Let me fill , the air, with my, old song  
If I let, you down, tell me where did I go wrong  
  
Sing me, sing me, I got a song to be sung (yes I do)  
Sing me, sing me, roll me around on your tongue  
  
I got sunshine, I got a message to shout  
Sing me, sing me, won't someone please let me out  
  
I got music, I will share  
I got music, now somebody cares, cares
