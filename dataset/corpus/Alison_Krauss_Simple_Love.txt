Little yellow house sittin' on a hill  
That is where he lived  
That is where he died  
Every Sunday morning  
Hear the weeping willows cry  
  
Two children born  
A beautiful wife  
Four walls and livin's all he needed in life  
Always giving, never asking back  
I wish I had a simple love like that  
  
[Chorus]  
I want a simple love like that  
Always giving, never askin' back  
For when I'm in my final hour lookin' back  
I hope I had a simple love like that  
  
My mama was his only little girl  
If he'd had the money, he'd have given her the world  
Sittin' on the front porch, together they would sing  
Oh, how I long to hear that harmony  
  
[Chorus x 2]
