Tired as hell and I can't catch my breath  
Been fighting so long I just aint got nothing left, Are we done?  
Cause I can't take it anymore, I just can't take it  
Been so long since I was close enough to smell your smell  
You're telling me the love is still good, if it is girl I can't tell, Are we
done?  
Cause I can't take it anymore, said I just can't take it  
  
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
We both know this love has died  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
Cause I just can't take it anymore  
  
You say in trippin when I tell you that we've changed  
But your friends, my friends and everybody saying the same thing, Are we done?  
Cause I can't take it anymore, I just can't take it  
I've been noticing the way you get dressed up to go to the store  
And it's right around the corner but you'll be gone for an hour sometimes more  
I ain't the one, and I can't take it anymore, said I just can't take it
anymore  
  
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
We both know this love has died  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
Cause I just can't take it anymore... just can't take it anymore  
  
We can be honest, we have no reason to lie  
Baby we don't have to deny  
Whatever happens we can't say we didn't try  
Nothing for us to do now but say goodbye  
  
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
We both know this love has died  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
Cause I just can't take it anymore... Cause I just can't take it anymore  
(Repeat 2X)
