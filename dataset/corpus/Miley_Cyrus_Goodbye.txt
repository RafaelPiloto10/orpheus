I can honestly say you've been on my mind  
Since I woke up today, up today  
I look at your photograph all the time  
These memories come back to life  
And I don't mind  
  
I remember when we kissed  
I still feel it in my lips  
The time that you danced with me  
With no music playing  
I remember the simple things  
I remember til I cry  
But the one thing I wish I'd forget  
The memory I wanna forget  
Is goodbye  
  
I woke up this morning  
And played our song  
And through my tears, I sang along  
I picked up the phone and then put it down  
Cause I know I'm wasting my time  
And I don't mind  
  
I remember when we kissed  
I still feel it on my lips  
The time that you danced with me  
With no music playing  
I remember those simple things  
I remember til I cry  
But the one thing I wish I'd forget  
The memory I wanna forget  
  
Suddenly my cell phone's blowing up  
With your ring tone  
I hesitate but answer it anyway  
You sound so alone  
And I'm surprised to hear you say  
  
You remember when we kissed  
You still feel it on your lips  
The time that you danced with me  
With no music playing  
You remember those simple things  
We talked til we cried  
You said that your biggest regret  
The one thing you wish I'd forget  
Is saying goodbye  
Saying goodbye oh, goodbye
