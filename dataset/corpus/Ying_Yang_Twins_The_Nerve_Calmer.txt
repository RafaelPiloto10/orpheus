I'm kinda antsy in my mothafuckin pants  
The average bro might not understand, bitch I'm a man (Man!)  
And I mean it from the heart  
I just hate it when you make your lips part  
All you do is [nag, nag, nag]  
Make a nigga [mad, mad, mad]  
Gotta smoke me a [bag, bag, bag]  
To keep from kickin yo' [ass, ass, ass]  
(Hook)  
I need mo' weed  
Just to smoke, so I can calm my nerves  
Say I need, mo' weed  
Just to smoke, so I can calm my nerves  
Yaeey!
