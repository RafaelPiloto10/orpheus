Roaring against the dying light  
The lion stands alone  
Caught in the spell of winter dreams  
He'll not give up his throne  
Chain the earth and chain the sun  
Break the hourglass  
Make the stars fall into line  
Suspend the end of time  
No, not tonight  
I'll not give in without a fight  
And I'll rage against this wind  
For even a moment more of the day  
I will...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run proud, run free  
Never set the sun on me  
Race hard play mean  
Anger's the symphony of screams  
A thousand roses on the hill  
A thousand lips to taste  
The darkness breathes a hateful sigh  
Goes forth to murder dreams  
Voices crying cold and dark  
My name is in the sky  
Shadows lenghten, sun sinks low  
The trees are frozen gold  
I won't give in!!!
