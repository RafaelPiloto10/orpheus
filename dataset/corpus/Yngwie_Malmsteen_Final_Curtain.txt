What's left for me to see  
In my ship I sailed so far  
What can the answer be  
Don't know what the questions are.  
And after all I've done  
Still I cannot feel the sun  
Tell me save me  
In the end our lost souls must repent.  
I must know it is for certain  
Can it be the final curtain  
As long as the wind will blow  
I'll be searching high and low.  
Who knows what's really true  
They say the end is so near  
Why are we all so cruel  
We just fill ourselves with fear.  
And heaven and hell will turn  
All that we love shall burn  
Hear me trust me  
Inthe end our lost sould must repent.  
I must know it is for certain  
Can it be the final curtain  
As long as the wind will blow  
I'll be searching high and low  
Final curtain  
Final curtain
