I don't mind  
If you steal my last dime  
Just leave me anytime  
And I'll get, get along fine  
I don't really know why  
But I know I'll get by  
If I don't I'll die tryin'  
  
If it rains again  
I'm gonna fly to the sun  
'Cause nothing gets done  
Just sitting, sitting around  
Look at the way it's been  
Just waitin' and wonderin'  
I've just got to keep trying  
  
Looking for gold in the sky  
Gets kinda rough  
Maybe I'm to blame  
'Cause I didin't look hard enough  
But I still get the feeling  
That it shouldn't be so tough  
  
So I won't mind, I, I won't mind  
I won't mind, I, I won't mind  
  
So I won't mind  
I, No, I won't mind  
I won't mind, I, said I won't mind
