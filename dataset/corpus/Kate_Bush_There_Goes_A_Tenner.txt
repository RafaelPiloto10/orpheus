Okay, remember  
Okay, remember  
That we have just allowed  
Half an hour  
To get in, do it, and get out  
  
The sense of adventure  
Is changing to danger  
The signal has been given  
I go in  
The crime begins  
My excitement  
Turns into fright  
  
All my words fade  
What am I gonna say?  
Mustn't give the game away  
  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
  
We got the job sussed  
This shop's shut for business  
The lookout has parked the car  
But kept the engine running  
Three beeps means trouble's coming  
  
I hope you remember  
To treat the gelignite tenderly for me  
I'm having dreams about things  
Not going right  
Let's leave in plenty of time tonight  
  
Both my partners  
Act like actors  
You are Bogart  
He is George Raft  
That leaves Cagney and me  
(What about Edward G.?)  
  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
  
You blow the safe up  
Then all I know is I wake up  
Covered in rubble  
One of the rabble needs mummy  
(What's all this then?)  
The government will never find the money  
(What's all this then?)  
  
I've been here all day  
A star in strange ways  
Apart from a photograph  
They'll get nothing from me  
Not until they let me see my solicitor  
  
Oh, I remember  
That rich, windy weather  
When you would carry me  
Pockets floating  
In the breeze  
  
Oh, there goes a tenner  
Hey look! There's a fiver  
There's a ten-shilling note  
Remember them?  
That's when we used to vote for him
