Beautiful day  
Shined when I needed that most  
Shined on the church yard  
Tin cans full of gold  
Come on home  
It's not too late  
We can fall apart together  
  
Beautiful girl smiles  
When I need it the most  
Smile on my heavy eyelids again  
  
Come on home  
It's not too late  
You can fall apart together  
Come on home  
It's not too late  
We can fall apart together  
Fall apart together  
  
Fall apart together  
Fall apart together  
  
Ooh, don't wait till  
  
Come on home  
It's not too late  
We can fall apart together  
Come on home  
It's not too late  
We can fall apart together  
Fall apart together
