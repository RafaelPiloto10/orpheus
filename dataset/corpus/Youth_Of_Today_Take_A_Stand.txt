I see you hide  
Do you have pride  
Afraid to share what's inside  
You've been walked right by  
A real nice guy  
Overlooked and shoved aside  
Can't hear your voice back in the crowd  
Move up fornt and shout out loud !  
Take a stand !  
Take a stand, say what you feel  
Be who you want, but be for real!  
Voice your opinion,  
Don't just sit still  
Speak your mind at your free will  
Take a stand !  
Stand your ground  
Don't let the world push you around  
Take a stand !  
Stand your ground  
Don't let the world push you around !
