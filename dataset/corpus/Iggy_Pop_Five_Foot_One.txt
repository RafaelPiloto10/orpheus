Yeah, I like it  
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!  
  
I'm only five foot one  
I got a pain in my neck  
I'm looking up in the city  
What the hell what the heck  
  
I stare at the concrete  
The girders eye high  
The steel's above me  
There's love in my eyes  
  
And I'm doing the things  
A five foot one man can do  
  
I'm only five foot one  
I got a pain in my heart  
All the night I'm working  
In the amusement park  
  
With a bottle of aspirin  
A sack full of jokes  
I wish I could go home  
With all the big folks  
  
And I wish life could be  
Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
Anything  
  
I'm only five foot one  
Unless the time has come  
I won't grow anymore  
Anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
'Till I'm losing my head  
I'm checkin' it twice  
I'm gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
  
And I'm doing the things a five foot one man can do  
  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines [Repeat: x3]  
I wish life could be  
Yeah, I wish life could be  
Oh  
I wish life could be  
  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
  
I won't grow anymore [Repeat: x3]  
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
I'm only five foot one [Repeat: x3]  
I'm five foot one
