See the picture in the hall  
Framed in magic on the wall  
Ain't it funny how it glows  
What's on the inside  
No one knows  
What makes this picture  
So inviting  
To those who stand outside it  
  
Maybe it's the dancers  
Or maybe it's the dance  
The dancer dances  
  
Thousands fill the gallery  
They pay their price to see a dream  
They can make believe for free  
Two hours' worth of fantasy  
Maybe they pretend  
The picture's them  
Or maybe they just love  
To sit and blend  
  
Tonight the picture has no frame  
Colours unleash and float away  
To each and everyone of you  
Tonight the spirit brings the news  
You become a part of it all  
Thousands turn to one in the hall  
  
You become the dancer  
And we become the dance  
The dancer dances  
  
The dancer dances  
The dancer dances  
And we become the dancer  
And you become the dance
