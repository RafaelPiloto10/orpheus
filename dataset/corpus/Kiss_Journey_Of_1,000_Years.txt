I know just where you come from  
Where all your yesterday's are gone  
And now you're done  
But you've only just begun  
It's time you opened up the door  
  
And now it's all very clear  
This journey of a thousand years  
  
Can you feel it coming  
Can you feel it now  
Can you feel it coming  
Or is it the roar of the crowd  
Can you feel it coming  
Can you hear it  
Or is it the roar of the crowd  
  
Did you sleep without dreams  
Did you fly without wings  
Did you touch without feel  
Where nothing is real  
Did you feel it coming  
Did you hear it  
Or was it the roar of the crowd
