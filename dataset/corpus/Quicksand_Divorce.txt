I know just what your thinking,  
You want someone to blame.  
I know you well 'cause,  
I always feel the same.  
  
We always look behind.  
We always look behind,  
day in, day out.  
The world is my witness.  
Sick from my culture's sickness.  
Wish it would all go away.  
You feel the same.  
We always look behind.  
We always look behind.  
I want to slow my mind, down.  
  
Something tells me,  
it's my cross to bear.  
You can't reach me,  
you were never there.  
It's like water,  
under a bridge now.  
I've looked a thousand times.  
We always look behind.  
We always look behind,  
day in, day out.
