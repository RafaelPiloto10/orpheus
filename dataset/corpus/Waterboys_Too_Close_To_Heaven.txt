All your trouble will be over, so will your pain  
you are gonna see those blue skies bursting right through the rain  
The higher you climb, the lower you fall  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Now in the morning you can cry all you want to  
We'll spend the whole day weeping  
Right now I want you to lay down your weary head  
and let me see you sleeping  
You've been walking around baby, inflamed and ashamed  
feeling like you're one inch tall  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
You're way too hard on yourself baby  
You got some pretty basic things wrong  
You wouldn't believe me if I told you why I wrote you into this song  
You're looking at your heart baby, and you're calling it black  
But like Icarus and like Saul  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Now I know this hurt you're feeling  
I've felt these same things too  
I've got spaces way down deep inside of me that are just the same as you  
You want to wrap your arms around your head, turn out the lights  
And roll yourself into a ball  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Are you blinded by the brilliance?  
Are you dazzled by the Light?  
Why is it I see nothing but emptiness in your tired beaten eyes  
That once were bright  
I know you just can't help but run when you hear that sweet voice call  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
I walked a mile for you baby  
So won't you smile for me baby?
