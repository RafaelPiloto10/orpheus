They told me all the hymns were born  
Out of the saxophone,  
And I went down to test them all  
Beneath the Tijuana moon,  
I saw violence in the moon  
Two broken lovers strong and strewn,  
I drank myself into a dream:  
  
Tijuana moon,  
My daddy Tijuana moon,  
Oh my darlin',  
Tijuana moon Lord my daddy  
Tijuana moon  
  
You can keep the Texas blues,  
Tequila and the burning stone,  
But my amigo  
Nothin's good against the Tijuana moon  
  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon  
Talk about lovin' Tijuana moon  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon
