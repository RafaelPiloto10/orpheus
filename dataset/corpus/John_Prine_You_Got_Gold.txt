Is there ever enough space between us  
To keep us both honest and true?  
Why is it so hard just to sit in the yard  
And stare at the sky so blue?  
I've got a new way of walking and a new way of talking  
Honey when I'm around you,  
But it gives me the blues when I've got some good news  
And you're not there to bring it to.  
  
Life is a blessing, it's a delicatessen  
Of all the little favors you do.  
All wrapped up together no matter the weather,  
Baby you always come through.  
It's a measure of treasure that gives me the pleasure  
Of loving you the way I do  
And you know I would gladly say I need your love badly  
And bring these little things to you.  
  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
You got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Well I got some  
Gold inside me too  
  
Well I'm thinking I'm knowing that I gotta be going  
You know I hate to say so long.  
It gives me an ocean of mixed up emotion  
I'll have to work it out in a song.  
Well I'm leaving a lot for the little I got  
But you know a lot a little will do  
And if you give me your love  
I'll let it shine up above  
And light my way back home to you.  
  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Well I got some  
Gold inside me too  
  
You got wheels  
Turning inside of you  
You got wheels  
Turning inside of you  
Well I got wheels  
Turning inside me too
