Standing on my own  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I thought I had it all  
I didn't see the mystery  
I stood the test of time  
I took the step to find  
Love's great adventure  
  
I spoke a million words  
They didn't mean that much to me  
They rang around my head  
Like empty tuneless harmonies  
Love's great adventure mine  
  
Lying side by side  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I started to enjoy  
The poetry and symphonies  
I took it in my stride  
I hailed the Day i tried  
Love's great adventure  
  
A fool who couldn't see  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I couldn't understand  
That's how the game is meant to be  
Love's great adventure mine  
  
Standing on my own  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I thought I had it all  
I didn't see the mystery  
I stood the test of time  
I took the step to find  
Love's great adventure
