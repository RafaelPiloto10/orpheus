Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama won't you treat me right  
I need you tender woman won't you hold me tight  
Surf ridin' sister I want to taste your love  
Le's make it in the garden beneath the stars above  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama have you got the cure  
My heart's all broken and I feel unsure  
Surf ridin' sister I got to fly away  
I'll be back in September that's the price I pay  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Can't you feel the trade winds blowin'  
There's a look in your eyes you're goin'  
Don't leave me now I'm a hurtin'  
If you'd look in my eyes you'd see hunger arise  
Can't you feel all these years I've been cryin' these years  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay  
  
Aloha mama don't make me cry  
Aloha mama you know I'll die  
  
Aloha mama don't go away  
Aloha mama I want you to stay
