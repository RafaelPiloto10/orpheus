Billy left on Friday night with twenty dollars cash  
Had a thousand more and a diamond on his hand  
When he got back  
I don't know just where Billy got that dough  
  
Saturday he spent in style  
Drinks were on the house  
Lincoln here, and a Jackson there  
Suspicions were aroused  
  
A dime was dropped and a name was named  
A body soon was found  
A travelin' Bible salesman on his monthly trip to town  
Three bullet holes  
  
A .38 done took his soul  
What do you know  
No diamond ring no money roll  
A quick investigation  
  
They dragged Billy to the station  
And broke him down with the third degree  
His alibi unraveled  
Judge Riley banged his gavel  
  
A 12-man jury all agreed  
So he must be guilty  
I knew Billy spent that night  
Winning big at cards  
  
And the salesman was a married man  
Who broke my sisters heart  
Billy sits in Levenworth  
Waiting for the gas  
  
And I know lots of other things  
But no one ever asked  
So they'll never know  
Swear to God they'll never know  
Case is closed, that's how the story will be told
