When I heard the sound of thunder  
On the day that I was born,  
I was blinded by the lighting  
An' baptised in the storm  
My father started crying  
When he saw what he had done,  
But, my mother started praying  
Have mercy on my son,  
He is a child of Babylon  
  
I am a child of Babylon,  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
  
When I've fooled around so many times  
When I've known it ain't been right,  
But, I paint it all in colours  
When it really should be black and white  
I sail my ship through muddy waters,  
Try to open every door,  
When I saw the seven wonders  
It left me wanting more  
  
I am a child of Babylon,  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide, got no place to run  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
  
On my day of judgment  
I know how it will be,  
I'm prepared to meet my maker  
With no hope for charity  
I'll stand alone and pay the price  
For everything I've done,  
'Cause there ain't guardian angel  
For a child of Babylon  
  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
I am a child of Babylon,  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide, got no place to run  
I am a child,  
A child of Babylon  
  
Child of Babylon
