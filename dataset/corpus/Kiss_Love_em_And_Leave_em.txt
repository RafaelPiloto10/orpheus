My limousine is a-waitin'  
And I see you comin' my way, hey, hey, hey  
I'm sittin' by the window  
And you ask me which hotel I stay in  
Well, make a reservation  
Between the hours of ten and two, how do you do  
You've got the time to remember  
I've gotta slick proposition you  
There's nothing else I'd rather do  
So you lift your dress  
You wanna impress  
There's one thing I've got to confess  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Mmm, so I give you my number  
You say you will see me tonight  
You just have to remember  
Check with me if it's alright  
You wanna sit in my driver's seat  
If you do it's alright with me  
I've got to hand it to you, baby  
You know what a girl's gotta do  
There's nothing else I'd rather do  
With you, but I, but I  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em  
Love 'em, leave 'em  
  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em, yeah  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em, yeah  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em, yeah  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em  
Love 'em, leave 'em, love 'em, leave 'em, yeah  
Love 'em, leave 'em
