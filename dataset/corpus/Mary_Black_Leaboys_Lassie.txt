First when I came to the town  
They called me young and bonny  
Now they've changed my name  
Called me the leaboy's honey.  
  
I'll dye my petticoats red  
And I'll face them with a yellow  
I'll tell the dyester lads  
That the leaboys I've to follow.  
  
It's over hills and dales  
And over dykes and ditches  
Say will I like the lad  
Who wears the moleskin breeches  
  
The black horse draws the cart  
And he's as proud as any  
Say will I like the lad  
That drives them on so canny  
  
Feather beds are fine  
And painted rooms are bonny  
But I would leave them all  
To jog away with johnny  
  
Oh, for saturday night  
It's I that'll see my dearie  
He'll come whistlin' in  
When I am tired and weary.  
  
First when I came to the town  
They called me proud and saucy  
Now they've changed my name  
Called me the leaboy's lassie.
