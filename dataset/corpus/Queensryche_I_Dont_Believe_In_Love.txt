I awoke on impact  
Under surveillance from the camera eye  
Searching high and low  
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime  
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it  
She said she loved me  
I guess I never knew  
But do we ever, ever really know?  
She said she'd meet me on the other side  
But I knew right then, I'd never find her  
  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
It's never worth the pain that you feel  
  
No more nightmares, I've seen them all  
From the day I was born,  
They've haunted my every move  
Every open hand's there to push and shove  
No time for love it doesn't matter  
She made a difference  
I guess she had a way  
Of making every night seem bright as day  
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light  
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye  
  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
I'll just pretend she never was real  
I don't believe in love  
I need to forget her face, I see it still  
I don't believe in love  
It's never worth the pain that you feel  
  
No chance for contact  
There's no raison d'etre  
My only hope is one day I'll forget  
The pain of knowing what can never be  
With or without love it's all the same to me  
  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
I'll just pretend she never was real  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
It's never worth the pain that you feel
