My lullaby,hung out to dry  
What's up with that  
It's over  
Where are you dad  
Mum's lookin' sad  
What's up with that  
It's dark in here  
Why bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is believing  
I used to  
My mouth is dry  
Forgot how to cry  
What's up with that  
You're hurting me  
I'm running fast  
Can't hide the past  
What's up with that  
You're pushing me  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is believing  
I used to  
I used to  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is breathing  
I saw you crawling on the floor  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is breathing  
I saw you crawling to the door  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is breathing  
I saw you falling on the floor
