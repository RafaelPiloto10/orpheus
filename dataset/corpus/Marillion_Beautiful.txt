Everybody knows that we live in a world  
Where they give bad names to beautiful things  
Everybody knows that we live in a world  
Where we don't give beautiful things a second glance  
  
Heaven only knows that we live in a world  
Where what we call beautiful is just something on sale  
People laughing behind their hands  
While the fragile and the sensitive are given no chance  
  
And the leaves turn from red to brown  
To be trodden down  
To be trodden down  
  
And the leaves turn from red to brown  
Fall to the ground  
Fall to the ground  
  
We don't have to live in a world  
Where we give bad names to beautiful things  
We should live in a beautiful world  
We should give beautiful a second chence  
  
And the leaves fall from red to brown  
To be trodden down  
To be trodden down  
And the leaves turn green to red to brown  
Fall to the ground  
And get kicked around  
  
You strong enough to be..  
Have you the faith to be..  
Have you the courage to be..  
Honest enough to say..  
  
Don't have to be the same..  
Don't have to be this way  
Come on and sign your name  
You wild enough to remain beautiful?  
Beautiful  
  
All the leaves turn from red to brown  
To be trodden down  
Trodden down  
And all we fall green to red to brown  
Fall to the ground  
To be kicked around  
  
You strong enough to be..  
Why don't you stand up and say  
Give yourself a break  
They laugh at you anyway  
So why don't you stand up and be  
Beautiful.
