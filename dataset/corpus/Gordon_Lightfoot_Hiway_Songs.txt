When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I have played on my guitar  
In coffeehouses, hall and bars  
Everyone that I call friend  
Knows they will not be forgot  
Trains and planes and rented cars  
Singers, saints and other starts  
I suspect them every one  
They'll never change, it's too much fun  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I stand on my own sod  
It feels so good to be home, by God  
The winter wind has turned my head  
But I always came up warm somehow  
Bottles, beads and cigarettes  
And lovers that I ain't found yet  
Pickin' with a friend till dawn  
And singing all of those hi'way songs  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I would travel all my life  
If loneliness was not the price  
While headin' north across that line's  
The only time I'm flyin'
