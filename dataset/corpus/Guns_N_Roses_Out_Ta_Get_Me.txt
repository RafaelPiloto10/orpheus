Been hidin' out  
And layin' low  
It's nothing new ta me  
Well you can always find a place to go  
If you can keep your sanity  
They break down the doors  
And they rape my rights but  
They won't touch me  
They scream and yell  
And fight all night  
You can't tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They won't touch me  
'Cause I got somethin'  
I been buildin' up inside  
For so fuckin' long  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm fucking innocent  
They won't break me  
  
Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'  
Sometimes it's harder to leave  
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'  
That's when your troubles exceed  
They push me in a corner  
Jest to get me to fight but  
They won't touch me  
They preach and yell  
And fight all night  
You can't tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They won't touch me  
'Cause I got somethin'  
I been buildin' up inside  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
They won't break me  
  
Some people got a chip on their shoulder  
And some would say it was me  
But I didn't bey that fifth of whiskey  
That you gave me  
So I'd be quick to disagree  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
They won't break me  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
So you can  
Suck me  
Take that one to heart
