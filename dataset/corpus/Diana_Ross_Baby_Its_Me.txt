You got the shakin, I got the shimmy  
You got the takin, I got the gimme  
And I don't want to go but baby you send me  
You want it all and I want to give it  
You are the dream and I want to live it  
And I don't want to go but baby you send me  
  
Baby it's me, I'm the same as you  
A dreamer who dreams that's a dream come true  
And all my life all I've wanted to meet someone just like you  
Someone just like you who wants to love me, too  
Someone just like you  
  
we've got the spark, we've got the desire  
The longer we burn the higher the fire  
And baby take my heart, I want you to have it  
Our love's a storm, it goes on forever  
The more that it rains the better the weather  
And baby take my heart, I want you to have it  
  
Baby it's me, I'm the same as you  
A dreamer who dreams that's a dream come true  
And all my life all I've wanted to meet someone just like you  
Someone just like you who wants to love me, too  
Someone just like you  
  
You got the shakin, I got the shimmy  
You got the takin, I got the gimme  
And I don't want to go but baby you send me  
You want it all and I want to live it  
You got a dream and I want to live it  
And I don't want to go but baby you send me  
  
Baby it's me, I'm the same as you  
A dreamer who dreams that's a dream come true  
And all my life all I've wanted to meet someone just like you  
Someone just like you who wants to love me, too  
Someone just like you  
  
Oh yeah  
Yeah
