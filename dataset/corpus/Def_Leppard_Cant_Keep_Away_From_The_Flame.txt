Lonely, lonely, lonely child, crystalline and lace  
Won't you walk me awhile, put a smile upon my face  
I don't want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again  
Beauty leads the full grown child, a rose among the thorns  
Like a ray of sunshine, she comes, heaven in my arms  
I don't want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again  
  
When i see you smilin'  
It takes away my pain  
Oh, there's no denyin'  
Can't keep away from the flame  
  
A thousand indian summers, die in desert sands  
The moon and lover's shadows, they go slippin' through our hands  
I don't want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again  
  
I don't want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again
