Standing here in Your presence  
Thinking of the good things You have done  
Waiting here patiently  
Just to hear Your still small voice I hear  
  
Calling, righteous, faithful till the end  
Savior, healer, redeemer and friend  
  
I will worship You for who You are  
I will worship You for who You are  
I will worship You for who You are  
Jesus
