You walk in, half past nine  
Lookin like a queen  
Serving me with papers  
Calling me obscene  
Woman I've tried so hard  
Just to do my best  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
And youll take all the rest  
  
Up all day, down all night  
Working on the job  
Everything I do is wrong  
I always end up [..]  
Woman I try so hard  
Done all I can do.  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
Keep all the best for you.  
  
Ooh, in the poor house  
Ooh, in the poor house  
  
If a drove a pulpwood truck  
Would you love me more?  
Will you bring me diamonds  
And hang around my door  
Woman, I've done my best  
Theyre aint much left for me  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
And throw away the key (in the poor house)  
  
Ooh, in the poor house  
  
You walked in, half past nine  
Lookin like a queen  
Serving me with papers  
Calling me obscene  
Woman I've tried so hard  
Just to do my best  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
And youll take all the rest  
  
In the poor house  
Ooh, in the poor house  
In the poor house  
Ooh, in the poor house
