What if all you understand,  
Could fit into the center of our hand,  
Then you found it wasn't you,  
Who held the sum of everything you knew,  
  
We're insane but not alone,  
You hold on,  
And their gone  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again,  
Like the sun we will live to rise, (Oh yeah)  
What if the one thing that I missed,  
Was everything I need to pass the test,  
And if I fail what happens then,  
Can I still count on you as a friend  
  
We're insane but not alone,  
You hold on,  
And their gone  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again,  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again,  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
