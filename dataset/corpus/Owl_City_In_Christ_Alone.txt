[Verse 1]  
In Christ alone, my hope is found  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This cornerstone, this solid ground  
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm  
[Chorus]  
What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, and when strivings cease  
My comforter, my all-in-all  
Here in the love of Christ I stand  
[Verse 2]  
There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious day  
Up from the grave He rose again  
[Chorus]  
And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ  
[Verse 3]  
No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny  
[Chorus]  
No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
[Outro]  
Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
