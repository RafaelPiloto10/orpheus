[Intro]  
Na na na na na, na na na na na.  
Na na na na na, na na na na na.  
  
[Verse 1]  
I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went.  
So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope).  
I've got a brand new attitude, and I'm gonna wear it tonight.  
I'm gonna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Na na na na na,  
I wanna start a fight.  
Na na na na na,  
I wanna start a fight!  
  
[Chorus]  
So, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't need you!  
And guess what?  
I'm havin more fun, and now that were done,  
I'm gonna show you tonight!  
I'm alright, I'm just fine,  
And you're a tool so, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!  
  
Unh Check my flow Uohhh  
  
[Verse 2]  
The waiter just took my table and gave it to Jessica Simps (shit!)  
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy, at least he'll know how to hit (oops)  
What if this song's on the radio, then somebody's gonna die! (haha)  
I'm going to get in trouble, my ex will start a fight.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Na na na na,  
He's gonna to start a fight.  
Na na na na,  
We're all gonna get in a fight!  
  
[Chorus]  
So, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't need you!  
And guess what?  
I'm havin more fun, and now that were done,  
I'm gonna show you tonight!  
I'm alright, I'm just fine,  
And you're a tool so, so what?  
I am a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!  
  
[Bridge]  
You weren't there, you never were,  
You want it all but that's not fair.  
I gave you life, I gave my all,  
You weren't there, you let me fall!  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves (my rock moves),  
And I don't need you (and I don't need you)!  
And guess what (and guess what)?  
I'm havin more fun, and now that were done (were done),  
I'm gonna show you tonight!  
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine (I'm just fine),  
And you're a tool so, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!  
  
[Outro]  
No, no,  
No no, I don't want you tonight!  
You weren't there...  
I'm gonna show you tonight!  
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine  
And you're a tool so, so what?  
I am a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!
