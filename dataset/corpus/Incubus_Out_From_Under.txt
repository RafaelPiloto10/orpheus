To resist is to piss in the wind  
Anyone who does will end up smelling  
  
Knowing this, why do I defy?  
Because my inner voice is yelling  
  
There is a fist pressing against  
Anyone who thinks something compelling  
  
Our intuit we're taught to deny  
And our soul we're told is for selling  
  
Get out from under them  
Resist and multiply  
Get out from under precipice  
And see the sky  
  
Get out from under them  
Resist, unlearn, defy  
Get out from under the precipice and see the sky
