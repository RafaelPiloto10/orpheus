Fly  
When I was young  
I never had no rules  
I could do anything  
As long as I believed  
It's been a long time  
I made it through the rain  
You brought back everything  
And I have found my wings  
I can fly again  
I found my heart  
Waiting with you  
A love that's true  
I feel so alive  
I can fly again  
No letting go  
It's where I belong  
A love that's strong  
For all of my life  
Remember the times  
I looked for brighter days  
Hoping that things would change  
And turn it all around  
Now that you're here  
I can see everything  
Ride on the joy you bring  
And lift me off the ground  
I can fly again  
I found my heart  
Waiting with you  
A love that's true  
I feel so alive  
I can fly again  
No letting go  
It's where I belong  
A love that's strong  
For all of my life  
Repeat chorus (2x)
