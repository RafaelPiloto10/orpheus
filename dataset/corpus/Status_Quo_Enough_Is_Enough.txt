I don't care what you say to me  
I'm gonna try and kick you outta my door  
Ain't no use entertaining me  
Or paint your pretty little face for me  
You don't like rock, you don't like roll  
You don't like rock and roll no more  
I've had enough, I can't anymore  
Enough is enough, I can't stand no more  
Enough is enough  
  
I don't care what you say to me  
I never get the message through when I call  
What you do is a shame to see  
Making plans of your own for me  
You don't know where, you don't know when  
You don't know where, or where or when  
Oh I don't care what you say to me  
I'm gonna kick you outta my door  
Enough is enough, and I have had it  
I've had enough, I can't anymore  
Enough is enough, I can't stand no more  
Enough is enough, I can't anymore  
Enough is enough  
  
Oh I don't care what you say to me  
You're gonna be back banging round at my door  
What you say is all the same to me  
Making plans of your own for me  
You don't know where, you don't know when  
You don't know where, or where or when  
I've had enough, I can't anymore  
Enough is enough, I can't stand no more  
Enough is enough, I can't anymore  
Enough is enough, I can't stand no more  
Enough is enough, I can't anymore  
Enough is enough
