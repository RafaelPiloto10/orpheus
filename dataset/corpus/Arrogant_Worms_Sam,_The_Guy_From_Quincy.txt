Who's the guy with all the tests? He's  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
A white lab jacket, a hypodermic  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
He doesn't care if you're alive or dead  
He'll perform an analysis of your head  
Find out if you've bleached your hair  
Try and fool him if you dare, he's  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Oh yeah!  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
  
Was that dead guy poisoned or stabbed, just ask  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Was his scar caused by a fork, just ask  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
He knows all of the spectrographic analyser  
Blood count, sperm count, hemoglobin level  
He knows how many hairs are on your head  
He knows when the coffee's ready, he's  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Oh yeah!  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
  
Where would television be without him?  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
There's nobody else who's earned our trust except for  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Although he deserves, he never gets top-billed  
Only gets the girl if she's been killed  
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride  
Poor Sam's only along for the ride, he's  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Oh yeah!  
Sam, the guy from "Quincy"!  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
Bop-shoo-wop, bop-bop-shoo-wop  
  
He's Sam!
