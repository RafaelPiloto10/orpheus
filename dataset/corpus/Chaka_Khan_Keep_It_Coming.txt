How high the sky goes  
Nobody wants to know  
That's how your love seemed to grow  
Like the winter gives birth to spring  
You've become my everything  
And in my life it must show  
  
Chorus:  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Comin' comin' straight to me  
  
I find with no one else  
I could express myself  
You took the time and looked in my mind  
  
Like mysteries untold, I'm starting to unfold  
You reached the limits of my soul  
  
Chorus:  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Comin' comin' straight to me  
  
How high the sky goes  
Nobody wants to know  
That's how your love seemed to grow  
Just like the world keeps going round and round  
And we never fall off the ground  
Like gravity your love is pullin' me  
  
Chorus:  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Keep it comin', keep it comin'  
Comin' comin' straight to me
