It's a hard life  
Never let yourself get down  
You may never get back  
You may never ever turn it round  
You may say it took you by surprise  
Never ending  
Never changing  
I didn't see through your disguise  
It took my breath away  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Under my feet  
The earth just fell away  
Under my feet  
Gave way  
  
Did you ever want to take a chance  
Never thought the time would come round  
Quite so fast  
Would you walk right thro' that wall  
And keep on walking till you  
Couldn't stand on your feet no more  
But you came and took me by surprise  
When you stole up on me  
I didn't see thro' your disguise  
It took my breath away  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Under my feet  
The earth just fell away  
Under my feet - gave way  
  
Where were you  
When I needed you  
Where were you  
When I needed you  
Where were you  
Where were you - I'm holding on  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Under my feet  
The earth just fell away  
Under my feet - gave way  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Right under my feet  
Gave way
