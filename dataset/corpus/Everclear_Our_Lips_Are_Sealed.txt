Can you hear them  
They talk about us  
They're telling lies  
Well, that's no surprise  
Can you see them  
See right through them  
Yeah that happens to you  
Nothing gets through for you  
Doesn't matter what they say  
In the jealous games people play  
Yes, our lips are sealed  
  
When we walk by  
Then we must chose  
In our defense  
Silence  
When you look at them  
Look right through them  
That's when they'll disappear  
That's when we'll be feared  
Doesn't matter what they say  
In the jealous games people play  
Yes, our lips are sealed  
  
Pay no mind to what they say  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Hey hey hey  
Our lips are sealed  
  
Hush my darling, don't you cry  
Quiet, angel, forget their lies  
  
Can you hear them  
They talk about us  
Telling lies, telling lies  
That's no surprise  
Can you see them  
See right through them  
Yeah that happens to you  
Nothing gets through for you  
Doesn't matter what they say  
In the jealous games people play  
Yes, our lips are sealed  
Pay no mind to what they say  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Hey hey hey  
Yes, our lips are sealed
