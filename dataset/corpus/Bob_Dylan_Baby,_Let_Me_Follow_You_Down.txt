Spoken intro:  
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge.  
Ric is a blues guitar player.  
I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.  
  
Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down  
Well I'll do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down.  
  
Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you?  
Yes I'll do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me come home with you.  
  
Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down  
Well I'll do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down.  
  
Yes I'll do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down.
