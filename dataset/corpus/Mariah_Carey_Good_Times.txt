Good Times  
Any time you meet a payment  
Good Times  
Any time you meet a friend  
Good Times  
Any time you're out from under  
Not getting hassled  
Not getting hustled  
Keeping your head above water  
Making a wave when you can  
Temporary lay offs  
Good Times  
Easy credit rip offs  
Good Times  
Scratching and surviving  
Good Times  
Hanging in a jury  
Good Times  
Ain't we lucky we got them  
Good Times  
(Yeah)  
  
Work  
You better work  
(Work the runway)  
Work it girls  
(Work it out)  
Work it girls  
(Sashay)  
  
The divas!  
Okay, okay.
