In a little cottage, in the country side  
Lives a man called harry, and he is losing his mind  
Listen.......... hear the spider's lullabye  
It's really sad for harry, he finds a spider scary  
Even the smallest species, will make him feel uneasy  
Oh, they live in every corner  
Oh, and here comes the summer  
There's another spider on his wall..... gotta kill it!  
Soon to be another creamy spot  
As he woke up this morning, there was a spider crawling  
He felt the big surprise, before it caught his eyes  
Oh, in between his face  
Oh, and his pillow case  
There's another spider on his wall..... gotta kill it!  
Soon to be another creamy spot  
Here comes another one..... ha...ha...ha...ha...ha  
He's got to find a doctor, a very special doctor  
Someone who can cure his mind  
Someone who knows harry's kind  
Listen.......... hear the spider's lullabye  
Those creepy crawly creatures  
With all their hairy features  
Hoping to catch a fly  
Singing itss deadly lullabye  
Oh..... oh, no..........  
There's another spider on his wall........ gotta kill it!!!!
