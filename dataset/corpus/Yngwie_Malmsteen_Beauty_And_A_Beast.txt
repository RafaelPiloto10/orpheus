She takes my breath away.  
My lady in red.  
And I know the game she plays.  
Always lining the red.  
She's got curves.  
To make a grown man cry.  
She blows my mind.  
I will make her mine.  
I will never cease.  
She's a beauty and a beast.  
Oh lord she looks so fine.  
My one and only queen.  
And I love the way she shines.  
My mean machine.  
Wind in my hair.  
We'll fly without a care.  
It's liquid speed.  
This royal steed will never cease.  
She's a beauty and a beast.  
She's got curves.  
To make a grown man cry.  
She blows my mind.  
I will make her mine.  
I will never cease.  
She's a beauty and a beast.  
[guitar solo]  
c'mon.  
And now she is unleashed.  
This metal horse.  
We're burning down the street.  
A true tour de force.  
She's got curves.  
To make a grown man cry.  
She blows my mind.  
I will make her mine.  
I will never cease.  
She's a beauty and a beast
