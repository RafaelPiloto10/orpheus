Hey lonely lady with the big brown eyes,  
I'm making you're sadder than you realize  
I could make you smile and feel a little more related.  
We really click, would it be so wrong if we just dated?  
Let us goooo... Jump on my skateboard, eat some cake, along  
The lake  
I'll do all your favorite stuff right off the cuff cause we're  
Spontaneous.  
Let's hop a bus to shop, we'll check out Filene's, and  
Get chunky jewelry at Chico's.  
I'll buy you a panini, and some Spanks to make you teeny  
... You're the lady with the big brown eyes
