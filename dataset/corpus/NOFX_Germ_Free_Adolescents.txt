I know she's antiseptic her deodorant smells nice I'd like to get to know you
But you're deep frozen like the ice She's a germ free adolescent Cleanliness
is her obsession She cleans her teeth ten times a day Scrub away scrub away
scrub away The S.R. way... You may get to know her If your gloves are
sterilised Rinse your mouth with listerine Blow disinfectant in her eyes Her
phobia is infection She needs one to survive It's her built-in protection
Without fear she'd give up and die.
