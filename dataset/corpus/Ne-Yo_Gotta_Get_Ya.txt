[Intro]Uh (uh uh uh)

[Verse 1]Ain't that a damn shame?  
Your last thing may change, change  
I gotta get to your virgo  
Just say your off the chain  
Off the room, I know you wanted fame  
Houston, we got a problem, man  
I can fix this like we're in plan  
I still sip crystal, I follow no trends,  
Beyond words, that's beyond thoughts  
I just say it huh, it's my fault, my bad I needa ask microsoft  
Computer love, ya brought and she rockin that - pause  
Smell like livin at least I'm not a jinx  
Cause I gotta good feeling  
Gotta get you girl cause she might got willing  
My dream Gurl!  
  
[Chorus]So, I gotta get ya!  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me

[Verse 2]Oh, Oh Canada, Oh Canada!  
I notice my cookies don't crumble  
What's up, it's got me on from Toronto  
My favourite bond on the stereo  
You know it, is fallin  
Pop broad, our first day in New York  
Pardon, Gees how we shoulda may cause  
Sad look like shoulda play sports  
Deserve double lubba tons I bought  
I prayed, ever meet again, to the lord  
But then I ran out, just wanna respect  
Not a hand down, not one for the jealousy  
I'm a man now, eleven seven seven six, that's what I'm talkin bout,  
So random, hit the athem  
Don't let it be as spread like cancer,  
Reminiscing red carpet for the cameras  
So famous!  
  
[Chorus]So I Gotta get ya!  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, sing it to me now  
  
Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
  
[Verse 3]Girl, your body keeps calling me  
I'm feelin you energy  
Na na na na na na  
I know, I won't forgive myself  
If you end up with someone else, yea  
Na na na na na na  
I just wanna let you know,  
I'm not gonna let you go (let you go, let you gooo)  
  
[Chorus 2]Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, sing it to me now
