You and me we're together, loving  
Eyes can always stray  
Loving hearts will always find  
The way  
Don't pass through my life like a  
Season  
Don't hurry by like a highway sign  
Hear with your heart while I tell you  
What's on my mind  
  
Do believe I fell in love  
Do believe I fell in love  
Ooh yeah  
  
If I make mistakes please forgive me  
Oh Charlie B don't you run away  
Forget your pride I'll tell you that  
I'm going to stay  
'cause love knows no pain, knows  
No worry  
Love is the same for all times  
Hear with your heart while I tell you  
What's on my mind  
  
Do believe I fell in love  
Do believe I fell in love  
Ooh yeah  
  
Ooh let me love you  
Ooh let me kiss you  
Baby I'm fallin', your love is a callin'  
The night is wasting away  
It used to be you, and I knew at  
The dawning  
Our love would last more than a day  
And every single little word is true  
I still love you  
  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love  
  
I'm going to love you like nobody's  
Loved you  
Come rain or shine  
I'm going to need you like nobody's  
Needed you before  
  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love
