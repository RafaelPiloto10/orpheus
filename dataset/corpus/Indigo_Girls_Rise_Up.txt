Dog at the window still looks all day never gets her fill  
Cause a glance means a chance to break the birds out congregating  
I have seen a look like that you licked your chops from where you sat  
Make your kill for a thrill and you don't mind waiting  
Rise up your dead, there's life in the old girl yet  
Rise up your dead  
  
When it bums you out, all the hunters sprung to pounce  
And at best it's a mess like a nest infested  
You remember there's more than this  
There always was and always is  
  
Tend the artist in your charges, you are full invested  
And if you need to, read your mindless mag  
Call me up for tickets, we'll go see Sugarland  
And it gets better even when it's been a drag  
Just move to the music, move your body to the band and  
Rise up
