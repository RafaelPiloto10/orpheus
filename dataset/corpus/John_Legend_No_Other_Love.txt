No other love  
No other touch  
Gimme gimme oh so much  
Turn me on, turn me on  
  
Won't you please get out of my head  
Get back into my bed now, come kiss me, come with me  
Cause I can't hardly sleep without you, can't stop thinking bout you girl  
I want you, I need you  
  
And I'm ready for love, I'm ready for us to lose control  
Oh you know and I know that  
  
[Chorus]  
No other love  
No other touch  
Gimme gimme oh so much  
Turn me on, turn me on  
No other kiss  
No one like this  
Feeling that I can't resist  
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on  
  
I had my share of lovers  
But there is no other girl, your special, now let's go  
Cause love I want you more than ever, want to do whatever now  
To keep you, I need you  
  
And I'm ready for love, I'm ready for us to lose control  
Oh you know and I know that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Estelle]  
I say your turning me on now, say your turning me oh, oh, oh, on  
Say your turning me on with your smile, to your lips, to the words of this
song ah know  
I used to say I was too young, now I'm grown up  
But I put you where you need that strong, real goodie good loving  
Stevie wonder said it's been so long  
And I'ma a give it if you need it are you ready to receive it  
Boy I, I, I, I, I (wanna give you some love), I wanna give you some love and
affection, you got my attention  
  
See I'm ready for love, I'm ready for us to loose control  
Oh you know, and I know that  
  
[Chorus]
