White bolt of lightning  
Came out of nowhere  
Blinded the darkness  
Creating the storm  
War in the heavens  
Vengeance ignited  
Torment and tempest  
Attacks like a swarm  
  
Forged out of Flame  
From chaos to destiny  
Bringer of pain  
Forever undying  
  
Judas is Rising  
  
Eternal betrayer  
Ice cold and evil  
Taking no prisoners  
Dark prince of the world  
Humanity trembles  
Enslaving you sinners  
You can't beg for mercy  
For none will be saved  
The burden of sin  
Echoes the prophecy  
Ascending from hell  
Forever despising  
  
Judas is Rising  
  
Their faith is revealed  
Deceivers are crying  
By crucified steel  
Evangelising  
  
Judas is Rising  
Judas is Rising
