I'm melting in the sun  
And this is what they call the life  
I suppose too much sun  
Makes a desert Arab say  
I really love this country  
And there's a lot I want to see  
  
Great expectations  
Of all we seem to be  
And the winner  
And the winner, and the winner  
  
Do you want to make a story up  
There's enough it always seems  
If it happened all this morning  
Tonight we'll see it on TV  
  
Great expectations  
Of all we seem to be  
Great expectations  
(Take a look around you)  
Of all we seem to be  
(Take a look around you)  
And the winner  
And the winner, and the winner  
  
She was twelve and knew the world  
Her boyfriend knew a dance to this  
Everybody's got advice  
Take a snake take a ladder  
And this is what they call the life  
I'm melting in the sun  
  
Great expectations  
Of all we seem to be  
Great expectations  
(Take a look around you)  
Of all we seem to be  
(Take a look around you)  
And the winner  
And the winner, and the winner
