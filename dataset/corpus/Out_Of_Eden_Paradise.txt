I tuned in to the tv once again today  
Watch the news to educate my mind  
The destruction and the chaos that confronted me  
It's our world caught in it's own demise  
(As I sat there I began to cry)  
The situation worsens every day that goes by  
(And I thought how can this be, Lord why)  
So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me  
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before  
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone  
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat  
(I know God hears us crying out)  
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away  
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)  
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do  
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through  
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you  
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true  
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts  
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart  
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give  
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes
