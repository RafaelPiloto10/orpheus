Every night I say a little prayer  
I lie in bed beside you and I thank go that you're there  
Remembering how lonely life can be  
Till heaven smiled and sent you down to me  
  
I was born the moment that we met  
It's been years and still the magic hasn't left me yet  
Day by day the thrill goes on and on  
The sparkle in your eyes has never gone  
  
Chorus  
Love keeps getting stronger every day  
And it grows more beautiful in each and every way  
And I swear I love you more  
Than I did the day before  
Love keeps getting stronger every day  
And the things I'm feeling are impossible to say  
Honey you'll just have to take my word  
For all the lovely things you've never heard  
  
Music  
  
Love keeps getting stronger every day  
All I really wanna do is spend my whole life loving you  
Darling please believe me when I say  
Love keeps getting stronger  
Yeah it keeps on getting stronger  
Love keeps getting stronger  
Yeah it keeps on gettting stronger  
Love keeps getting stronger  
Every daaaaaay
