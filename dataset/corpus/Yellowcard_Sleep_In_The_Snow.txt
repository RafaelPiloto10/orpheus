I took a flight, headed north  
I wasn't waiting anymore  
And there I was, hoping high  
If I could only make you mine  
  
I was safe in my fortress alone  
Then you came and tore it all down  
  
I wanted to show you the depth of this dream  
The one where I see you and fall finally  
But you're like the winters that you've always known  
Warm on the inside while I sleep in the snow  
  
I took a flight, headed home  
And maybe now we'll never know  
But I would lose everything  
If it would bring you back to me  
  
I was safe in my fortress alone  
Then you came and tore it all down  
  
I wanted to show you the depth of this dream  
The one where I see you and fall finally  
But you're like the winters that you've always known  
Warm on the inside while I sleep in the snow  
  
I've always run right through the moments that count  
But somehow with you I slowed down  
And whatever happened that drove you away  
I know now I can't make you stay  
  
I wanted to show you the depth of this dream  
The one where I see you and fall finally  
But you're like the winters that you've always known  
Warm on the inside while I  
  
Wanted to show you all of my dreams  
Things that I buried and no one could see  
But you're like the winters that you've always known  
Warm on the inside while I sleep in the snow
