I was walking down the street today  
Just as somebody blew the doors off of the be of A  
Just then I head them call my name  
As I was thrown against the car  
I was being framed  
  
All units we've got our man  
We've got the bank robber man  
We don't need no reason  
You're going in the can  
You look like the bank robber man  
I think you misunderstand  
Do you think that I am the one that did it  
Just because I'm tan?  
Just then the officer at hand said  
I don't give a damn that you are in a rock and roll band  
  
All units we've got our man  
We've got the bank robber man  
We don't need no reason  
You're going in the can  
You look like the bank robber man  
  
Just tell me what's going on ?  
Can you tell me what I did wrong ?  
Does busting me make you feel strong ?  
Make you feel strong  
  
All units we've got our man  
We've got the bank robber man  
We don't need no reason  
You're going in the can  
You look like the bank robber man
