I can tell just by the look in your eyes  
That the love is gone that I once took  
  
So much has changed in the way you live  
I bet there's nothing left that you could ever give  
  
The words of a madman have spoken  
I guess I'm not the only one  
The heart of a sad man is broken  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
You can fool anyone without disguise  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
Oh yeah, you look as cold as ice  
  
It's in your blood  
It floats in your veins  
I've sacrificed myself  
But all I feel is pain  
You've done me wrong  
You've been so bad  
It's the last time a battle is lost  
When I'm the one who's sad  
  
The words of a madman have spoken  
I guess I'm not the only one  
The heart of a sad man is broken  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
You can fool anyone without disguise  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
Oh yeah, you look as cold as ice  
  
I wish you'd die  
I wish you'd break down and cry  
I wish you'd move  
And then I know I'll be satisfied  
  
Can't you see, I'm on the edge  
I can't look down  
It is me who's lost and never found
