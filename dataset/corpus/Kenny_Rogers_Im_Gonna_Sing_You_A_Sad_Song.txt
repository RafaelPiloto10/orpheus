I'm gonna sing you a sad song, Susie  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, girl  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, Susie  
I'm gonna sing a love song  
All about you and me, girl  
  
Oh girl, you know you lied to me  
You said you love me more than anything  
And all the time I was just a fool  
Another fool in your care  
  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, Susie  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, girl  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, Susie  
I'm wanna sing a love song  
All about me and you, girl  
  
Oh girl, you still don't know what love's all about  
To you it's just another game too  
I may be hurting now but in the end  
Oh, in the end, girl, you knew  
  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, Susie  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, girl  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, Susie  
I'm gonna sing you a sad song, girl  
Sing you a sad song, Susie, I'm gonna sing you
