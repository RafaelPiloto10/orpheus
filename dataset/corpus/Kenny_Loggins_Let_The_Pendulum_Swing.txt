Let the pendulum swing.  
Let the old guard surrender  
It is a new day, a new world,  
A new language I wish to speak  
The language of love  
May I have the words I need to speak my truth,  
To translate my heart and my vision  
To my beloved and his children  
To all who come to sit at our table  
Or walk with us through the market place  
Or pray with us by the water  
  
May I have the plain poetry to tell them how I feel  
Or why there is pain,  
If the answers are mine to know.  
And if they are, I ask the Spirit to let me share them  
With a light heart, with laughter,  
Wth no expectation, with humility  
But for the grace of Thee, go I.  
May I know my innocence  
Every moment of every day  
May I be a child forever  
Intoxicated by hot sand, cool winds, by love  
By my own communication to the Spirit.  
May my aliveness always be as loud  
When I make love, as when I cry  
May I see my own reflection in the mirror  
And smile  
  
My love,  
You are my teacher  
And I surrender to your heart  
The purest heart I've ever seen  
Today I give you everything that is mine to give  
My truth  
All my innocence  
and all my heart  
I am yours  
Let the dance begin.
