[Shane:]  
I've had many times I can tell you  
Times when innocence I'd trade for company  
And children saw me crying  
I thought I'd had my share of that  
But these miss you nights are the longest  
  
[Bryan:]  
Midnight diamonds stud my heaven  
Southward burning like the jewels that are your face  
And the warm winds that embrace me  
Just as surely kissed your face  
Yet these miss you nights they're the longest  
  
[(Mark) Shane:]  
  
(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender  
It's only me who's killing time  
(Lay down) Lay down all dreams and feelings once remembered  
It's just the same this miss you game  
  
[Mark:]  
Thinking of my going  
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind  
Looking windward for my comfort  
I take each day as it arrives  
But these miss you nights are the longest  
  
[Shane:]  
But these miss you nights are the longest
