There's this girl I don't know  
Comes by every year or so  
And if I get the mail before my mom  
Then I will stay out of trouble  
  
She'll change every year  
Even pretty without beer  
She doesn't care about my hair  
My car, my tiny pee-pee  
In the mirror  
  
Who, yeah  
She's finally here  
Who, yeah  
Comes one time a year  
Who, yeah  
She's finally here  
Who, yeah  
My Playmate of the Year  
  
[Chorus]  
She moves me  
She makes me grow  
I'm so happy and boy does it show  
Now she's going to my head  
Going to my head (to my head)  
I'm going to make this milky clear  
(You're my) Playmate of the Year  
  
Hello, how are you?  
It's great to see you, too  
Let's grab a sock  
It's time to rock  
And afterwords  
You never want to talk  
  
We always agree  
Who's in charge here is me  
We never fight  
You know I'm right  
It's always straight between you and me  
  
Let me go down on this girl for a day  
We can play spin the bottle  
Everyone can hear her say  
That I was the best that she's ever had  
She could be my Playmate  
And she could call me Dad  
  
Who, yeah  
She's finally here  
Who, yeah  
She comes one time a year  
Who, yeah  
She's finally here  
Who, yeah  
My Playmate of the Year  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who, yeah  
She's finally here  
Who, yeah  
My Playmate of the Year  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She moves me  
She makes me grow  
I'm so happy and boy does it show  
Now she's going to my head  
Going to my head (to my head)  
I'm going to make this milky clear  
(You're my) Playmate of the Year  
Playmate of the Year  
Playmate of the Year
