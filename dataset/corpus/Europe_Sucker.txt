She's worked hard to enjoy the weekend  
All glammed up to describe the feeling  
Making her way through the crowd  
Something is driving her wild  
  
She's turning up the stereo she wants everybody to know  
She's fixing to see the show  
She's a suh suh suh sucker for a guitar hero  
  
Her obsession is legendary  
And all her boyfriends temporary  
Her idea of a perfect man  
Plays a custom through a marshall amp  
  
She's turning up the stereo she wants everybody to know  
She's fixing to see the show  
She's a suh suh suh sucker for a guitar hero  
  
God knows she can't control her weakness  
Sometimes she settles for the local talent  
And everyone knows it's a phase  
Just happy to kill some time  
'Cause she'll be back in her rightful place  
When those trucks roll into town  
  
And now she won't need a stereo  
Yeah cause everybody will know  
That she's right there watching the show  
She'll be throwing all her love around  
Now the boys are back in town  
Until she just can't take it no more  
She's a suh suh suh sucker for a guitar hero
