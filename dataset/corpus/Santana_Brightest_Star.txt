When you walked out the door, baby  
Thought I would die, I didn't realize  
Oh, you were the brightest star up in the sky, yeah  
Now that you're gone, oh how I miss you so  
Please come back to me, I need your love, baby  
Ever so more, yeah, yeah  
Come back, girl  
Bring your sweet love back to me  
I can't do without it, no, no, no  
If you want, I'll show you what I have  
You can take, take what you want of me  
Just don't take the things, that we know are bad  
Oh baby, oh baby, hey, I need your love, yeah  
Girl oh yeah, oh  
Come back, won't you come back  
Please, oh, please, please, please, please  
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, please  
I need your love, oh, baby, yeah
