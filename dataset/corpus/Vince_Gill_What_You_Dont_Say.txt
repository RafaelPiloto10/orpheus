Sometimes this old world gets to me  
And I sure can be a jerk  
But you always see the best in me  
God knows you've seen the worst  
  
You know when to let me be  
Pull yourself real close to me  
And how to take my breath away  
  
You don't care who's right or wrong  
I know whose side you're on  
It's more than the love that we make  
It's what you don't say  
  
Man, I should have been the death of me  
I sure can run it in the ground  
When you come lie here next to me  
Girl, you bring me back around  
  
You know when to let me be  
Pull yourself real close to me  
And how to take my breath away  
  
You don't care who's right or wrong  
I know whose side you're on  
It's more than the love that we make  
It's what you don't say  
  
You know when to let me be  
Pull yourself real close to me  
And how to take my breath away  
  
You don't care who's right or wrong  
I know whose side you're on  
It's more than the love that we make  
It's what you don't say  
It's what you don't say  
It's what you don't say
