People get ready  
There's a train a comin'  
You don't need no baggage you just get on board  
All you need is faith  
To hear the diesel comin'  
Don't need no ticket you just thank the Lord  
People get ready  
Train to Jordan  
Picking up passengers from coast to coast  
Faith is key  
Open the doors and board them  
  
There's hope for all among the love the most  
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner  
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own soul  
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner  
There ain't no hiding place from the Kingdom's throne
