I knew where I was going when you left the room  
You're the kinda guy that makes me want to  
Follow through to you  
I've been trying to leave you for the longest time  
The second that I saw you I just knew I found my right guy  
  
I like it [Repeat: x6]  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna crash  
I wanna fall  
I wanna be somewhere in the middle.  
Somewhere in the middle  
Something  
It's better than nothing  
I just need a little  
I just need a little cause I  
Don't wanna be nowhere  
But somethings makin' me go there  
Somewhere in the middle with you  
  
I like it [Repeat: x6]  
  
Losing my direction,  
That's the way it should be  
Feeling a connection  
When you're standing next to me  
I wanna be rolling  
I just wanna be rolling with you.  
  
All of the things you say  
I like it  
Taking me far away  
I like it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby you take me  
You wanna take me from this crazy place  
Baby  
Cause I just need a little  
I just need a little  
Somewhere in the middle with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Crash  
Fall  
I like it I like it  
Somewhere in the middle with you
