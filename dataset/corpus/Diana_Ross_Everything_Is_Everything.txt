Love of my life  
Love of my life  
And everything is right  
And everything is groovy  
The boy moves me  
Sets my soul on fire  
  
Sweet love of mine  
Sweet love of mine  
Sweet love of mine  
  
And everything is fine  
And everything is groovy  
The boy moves me  
Keeps me satisfied  
  
Don't you know that this love  
You've given me is still in me  
It's one thing i couldn't sacrifice  
You're my joy, you're my pleasure  
But most of all darling  
You're my treasure  
  
Everything is everything  
Everything is everything  
'Cause you're mine  
Love of my life  
Love of my life  
  
Love of my life  
And everything is right  
This love i feel has got to be real  
I'm as happy as can be  
  
Don't you know everything is groovy  
Everything is so fine  
And everything is everything  
'Cause you're mine  
You're mine  
You're mine  
  
Everything is groovy  
Everything is so fine  
And everything is everything  
'Cause you're mine  
You're mine  
You're mine  
  
And everything is everything  
Everything is groovy  
And everything is so fine  
And everything is everything  
'Cause you're mine  
You're mine  
You're mine
