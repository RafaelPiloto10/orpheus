About what's real and true  
What can not be proven  
What can be assumed  
Once when I was younger  
In the bloom of youth  
I received an honest answer  
When a lie would do  
  
[Chorus:]  
And now all I do is sit  
In my darkened room  
And on occasion break my silence  
To howl at the moon  
To curse every nerve  
And neuron in my brain  
That won't stop the pain I'm feeling  
And let me stop thinking  
  
I used to think  
Galileo would agree  
That the world was round  
And you'd come round to me  
But I have looked for you  
And you're nowhere in sight  
The world must be flat  
The Babylonians were right  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I used to think  
Consider gravity  
If I placed you on a pedestal  
You'd slip and fall for me  
But you floated on the air  
Far away at light speed  
I guess some objects do defy  
The laws that we conceive  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I used to think  
It took all my time  
Analyzing you  
Your mind on my mind  
Your name my mantra  
Repeated on my lips  
That once tried to kiss you  
A memory unrepressed  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Stop thinking of you  
Stop thinking of you  
Stop thinking of you
