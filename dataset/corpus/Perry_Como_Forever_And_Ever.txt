[Chorus]  
Forever and ever,  
My heart will be true!  
Sweetheart, forever,  
I'll wait for you!  
  
We both made a promise,  
That we'd never part,  
Let's seal it with a kiss,  
Forever my sweetheart!  
  
Let bygones be bygones forever,  
We'll fall in love once again  
So, let's tell the world of our new love divine,  
Forever and ever you'll be mine!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We both made a promise,  
That we'd never part,  
Let's seal it with a kiss,  
Forever my sweetheart!  
  
Let bygones be bygones forever,  
We'll fall in love once again  
So, let's tell the world of our new love divine,  
Forever and ever you'll be mine!  
  
We both made a promise,  
That we'd never part,  
Let's seal it with a kiss,  
Forever my sweetheart!  
  
Bygones be bygones forever
