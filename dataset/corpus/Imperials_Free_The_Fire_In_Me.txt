Chorus:  
Free the fire in me  
Let it be  
Ignited in power  
Let me be  
Ablaze in this hour  
Like a torch that's passed for eternity  
So free the fire in me  
Let it show  
Like glowing devotion  
Let it go  
Like flames hot in motion  
For the world set is my burning desire  
So free the fire in me  
  
A man's true temperature is tested by his wealth  
Love only flickers if it's just to warm himself  
My treasure lies in you and fans the zeal of all I do  
It's rising and growing  
It can't be shared with just a few  
Everybody needs the light  
In my heart it's always burning bright  
So let the heat climb ever higher  
And free the fire in me  
  
Chorus  
  
All by myself I don't know where I could begin  
I'm just a spark the quenches like a candle kindles in the wind  
Not by my ability  
But only by his spirit can it be  
I'll do all that you require  
And free the fire in me  
  
Chorus
