My heart is low, my heart is so low  
As only a woman's heart can be  
As only a woman's, as only a woman's  
As only a woman's heart can know  
The tears that drip from my bewildered eyes  
Taste of bittersweet romance  
You're still in my hopes, you're still on my mind  
And even though I manage on my own  
My heart is low, my heart is so low  
As only a woman's heart can be  
As only a woman's, as only a woman's  
As only a woman's heart can know  
When restless eyes reveal my troubled soul  
And memories flood my weary heart  
I mourn for my dreams, I mourn for my wasted love  
And while I know that I'll survive all alone  
My heart is low, my heart is so low  
As only a woman's heart can be  
As only a woman's, as only a woman's  
As only a woman's heart can know  
My heart is low, yes, my heart is so low  
As only a woman's heart can be  
As only a woman's, as only a woman's  
As only a woman's heart can know  
My heart is low, my heart is so low  
As only a woman's heart can be  
As only a woman's, as only a woman's  
As only a woman's heart can know
