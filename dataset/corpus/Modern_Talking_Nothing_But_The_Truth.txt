Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
  
Like an angel, you came in my life  
I'm walking on on cloud number 9  
This may not be the start of the world  
Is your heart really mind?  
When will I see you again?  
When will this sad moment end?  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing changes this love - oh it's forever  
I will never tear apart  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing takes the place of you, my love  
  
Like a stranger, you're sometimes to me  
But whatever will be, will be  
One step from heaven, I don't stop this love  
I know you're my destiny  
When will I see you again?  
When will this sad moment end?  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing changes this love - oh it's forever  
I will never tear apart  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing takes the place of you, my love  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing changs this love - oh it's forever  
I will never tear apart  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing takes the place of you, my love  
  
Nothing but the trunt
