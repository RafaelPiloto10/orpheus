Just a baby  
On a doorstep  
It's how they found me  
Cold and hungry  
Raised on hatred  
Fed by strangers  
As a young girl  
I often wondered  
  
[Chorus]  
Am I born to die  
Never having lived  
Am I born to die  
Without love  
In my life  
  
People push me  
Knock me down  
My foster parents  
Kicked me around  
They brought me up on  
Loneliness  
I never had me  
A single friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Must be someone  
In this world  
Who can save me  
From myself  
  
Or am I born to die  
Never having lived  
Am I born to die  
Without love  
In my life  
  
[Chorus]
