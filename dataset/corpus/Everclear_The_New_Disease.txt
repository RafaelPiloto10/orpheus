I heard the news today  
All about your new disease  
This is what you said you wanted  
When you walked away from me  
I heard the news today  
Yeah I know what your friends all say  
That I'm gonna go to hell, they're all probably right  
I just wanna go to hell my way  
I just wanna do it my way  
I heard the news today  
All about your new romance  
There is always gonna be someone better than me  
I guess I never had a chance  
Yes I heard the news today  
You were livin' by the sound of the bell  
I still believe that life gets better when you tell the world to go to hell  
Oh I don't wanna play your game  
I don't wanna live that way  
I don't wanna do what you tell me to do  
I don't fit inside the box you've made  
No I don't wanna play your game  
No I will never live that way  
I don't wanna do what you tell me to do  
I just want to do it my way  
Yes I heard the news today  
You've got scars on your hands and knees  
You never would have been so ovbious when I was a new disease  
Yes I heard the news today  
You were livin' by the sound of a bell  
I still believe that life gets better when you tell the world to go to hell  
Oh I don't wanna play your game  
I don't wanna live that way  
I don't wanna do what you tell me to do  
I don't fit inside the box you've made  
No I will never play your game  
No I will never live that way  
No I don't wanna live like you want me to live  
I just want to live my way
