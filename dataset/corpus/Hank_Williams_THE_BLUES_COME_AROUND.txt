Once I was happy as I could be  
But I let a girl make a fool of me  
And ever since she let me down  
The blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
As long as the sun is in the sky  
These doggone blues never make me cry  
But ever since she left this town  
The blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
I built my castles very high  
And then she went and said goodbye  
And ever since she tore 'em down  
The blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
Once she called me all her own  
But now she's gone and I'm alone  
And ever evenin' I'm sorrow bound  
'Cause the blues come around when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Oh, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down  
Oh, the blues come around  
Yeah, the blues come around  
Lord, the blues come around  
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down
