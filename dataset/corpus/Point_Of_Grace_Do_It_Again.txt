Just when I think it couldn't be  
Any harder down here  
Another blow comes out of nowhere  
And knocks me out again  
And when I think I'm all alone  
The phone starts to ring  
It's just the voice I needed to hear  
On the other end  
  
[Chorus]  
You do it again, You do it again  
You speak to me just like a friend  
You always seem to show up right on time  
You do it again, I guess you know when  
My heart needs to hear your voice  
I'm so forgetful, that's why I'm thankful  
You do it again  
I could be driving in my car  
I turn the radio on  
Trying to figure out my thoughts  
Then I hear the perfect song  
I can open up Your word  
And not be sure where to turn  
But I start to read and it's like you know  
Just what I need  
  
[Chorus]  
You use all these things to speak to me  
Could it be you're using me  
In someone else's life  
Well I wouldn't be surprised  
  
[Chorus]
