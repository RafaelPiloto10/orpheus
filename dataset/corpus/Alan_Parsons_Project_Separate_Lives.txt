It's been a long road  
We've walked the last mile  
We reach the same conclusion  
And we stop for a while  
Together we know  
The way we must go  
We're leaving an illusion  
That's for us to share  
Only for us to share  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  
We share the same thoughts  
We read the same lines  
We meet on sad occasions  
And in happier times  
A spoken goodbye  
And both of us try  
To walk away in silence  
That's for us to share  
Only for us to share  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  
And always goodbye  
But heaven knows why  
I can't erase the memory  
That's for us to share  
Only for us to share  
Only for us to share  
Only for us to share  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place
