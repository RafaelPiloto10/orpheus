She's got everything a man could ever ask for.  
She is lovely, brighter than a morning star.  
She is so beautiful, portrait of a sunset.  
She got everything, including my old car.  
  
[Chorus]  
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her.  
Next time you see her, tell her that I care.  
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her.  
Next time I see you, boy you'd better beware.  
  
I'm just trying to warn you that you're bound to get hurt.  
I couldn't be her last love, so how could you be her first?  
I want to tell you, buddy, things are bound to get rough.  
I know that she's only flirting, but I think that I've had enough.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you.  
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you.  
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you.  
  
[Chorus]
