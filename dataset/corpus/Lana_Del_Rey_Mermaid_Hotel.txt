Maybe we could go to Coney Island  
Maybe I could sing the national anthem  
I, a white sweater, for the last white day  
Of the summer  
  
By my purple wig  
For my mermaid video  
Walk back to where we live  
In a motel  
Never knew  
  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
  
Heavy metal hour on T.V.  
Diamond Dave and Ray late  
And you salute me, Miss America  
Because I am, I am  
  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
  
Maybe we could go to Coney Island  
Maybe I could sing you to sleep  
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean  
God bless you and god bless me  
God bless you and god bless me  
  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off
