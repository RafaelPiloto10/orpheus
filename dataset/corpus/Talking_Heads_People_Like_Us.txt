In 1950 when I was born  
Papa couldn't afford to buy us much  
He said be proud of what you are  
There's something special 'bout people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who will answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing as big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
  
We don't want freedom  
We don't want justice  
We just want someone to love.  
Someone to love.u  
I was called upon in the third grade class  
I gave my answer and it caused a fuss  
I'm not the same as ev'ryone else  
And times were hard for people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who will answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing as big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
  
What good is freedom?  
God laughs at people like us  
I see it coming  
Like coming down from above  
  
The clouds roll by and the moon comes up  
How long must we live in the heat of the sun  
Millions of people are waitin' on love  
And this is a song about people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
We don't want freedom  
We don't want justice  
We just want someone to love.  
  
Someone to love.  
Someone to love.  
Someone to love.
