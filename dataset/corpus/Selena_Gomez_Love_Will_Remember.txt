Now's all we got and time can't be bought.  
I know it inside my heart forever will forever be ours.  
Even if we try to forget, love will remember.  
  
You said you love me, I said I loved you back  
What happened to that, what happened to that  
All your promises, and all them plans we had,  
What happened to that, what happened to that  
Boom gone, yeah we move on, even if we try to forget,  
  
Love will remember you, love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart,  
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember  
  
The trips we dreamed of taking the tacks left on the map,  
What happened to that, what happened to that  
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh  
What happened to that, what happened, what happened to that  
Boom gone, yeah we move on, even if we try to forget  
  
Love will remember you, love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart,  
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember  
  
Break down the walls let heaven in, somewhere and forever we'll dance again,  
We used to be inseparable, I used to think that I was irreplaceable  
We lit the whole world up, before we blew it up,  
I still don't know just how we screwed it up  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Love will remember you, love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart,  
Forever will forever be ours, even if we try to forget,  
Love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember  
Love will remember, love will remember, love will remember, love'll remember
