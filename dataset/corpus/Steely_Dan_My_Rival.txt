The wind was driving in my face  
The smell of prickly pear  
[My rival - show me my rival]  
The milk truck eased into my space  
Somebody screamed somewhere  
I struck a match against the door  
Of Anthony's Bar and Grill  
I was the whining stranger  
A fool in love  
With time to kill  
  
I've got detectives on his case  
They filmed the whole charade  
[My rival - show me my rival]  
He's got a scar across his face  
He wears a hearing aid  
  
Sure he's a jolly roger  
Until he answers for his crime  
Yes I'll match him whim for whim now  
  
I still recall when I first held  
Your tiny hand in mine  
[My rival, show me my rival]  
I loved you more than I can tell  
But now it's stomping time  
  
Sure he's a jolly roger  
Until he answers for his crime  
Yes I'll match him whim for whim now
