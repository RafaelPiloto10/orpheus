I'm taking all you down with me  
Explosives duct taped to my spine  
Nothing's gonna change my mind  
I won't listen to anyone's last words  
There's nothing left for you to say  
Soon you'll be dead anyway  
  
Well, no one is getting out alive  
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care  
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye  
And think about the time you spent and what they've ment  
To me it's nothing  
  
I'm losing all my happiness  
The happiness you pinned on me  
Loneliness still comforts me  
My anger dwells inside of me  
I'm taking it all out on you  
And all the shit you put me through  
  
Do you ever think back to another time  
Did it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?  
Do you ever want to lead a long ways of destruction  
And mow down any bullshit that comforts you  
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head  
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
