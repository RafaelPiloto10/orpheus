There's something in the air  
A feeling of danger  
There's something wrong with you  
I know I see it in your eyes  
Believe me when I say  
It's gonna be okay  
  
I told you from the start  
I won't be demanding  
If you have a change of heart  
I'll be understanding  
I only know just where I stand  
Or where I lie  
  
Believe me when I say  
We'll work it out some way  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else  
That your looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
I can tell by the way you lay your head  
In my shoulder  
Your hand is cold as ice, your hearts even  
Colder.  
  
It's tearing me up inside to think  
No matter how hard I try  
You may still walk away  
  
No matter what I do or say  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else  
That your looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye
