Let me sit on your porch, let me drink a beer  
Let me scratch that hound dog's ear  
Let me rock in your rocking chair  
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace.  
Show me your garden, I love to hoe  
Let me walk in a fertile row  
I got some seeds that I'd like to sow  
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace.  
And when that evening sun goes down  
Drive me into your hometown  
Let me buy your friends a round  
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace.  
Let me drink water from your well  
Tell me a story that you'd like to tell  
I think you'll find that I'll listen well  
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace.  
When you've had all of me that you can take  
Say so long with a strong handshake  
Don't get to drinkin' and ask me to stay  
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace.  
And when that evening sun goes down  
Drive me into your hometown  
I'll catch that next truck outward-bound  
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace.  
You can find out what time that bus leaves for Cincinnati.
