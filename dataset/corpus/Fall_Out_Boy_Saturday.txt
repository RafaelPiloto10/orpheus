I'm good to go and I'm going nowhere fast  
It could be worse, I could be taking you there with me  
I'm good to go, but it looks like I'm still on my own  
  
I'm good to go for something golden  
Though the motions I've been going through have failed  
I'm coasting on potential towards a wall at a hundred miles an hour  
  
When I say  
  
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door  
I can't sleep in the wake of Saturday  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
Pete and I attacked the Lost Astoria  
With promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence  
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived more than an hour  
  
When I say  
  
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door  
I can't sleep in the wake of Saturday  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived  
I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived  
  
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door  
Me and Pete in the wake of Saturday  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
Saturday, when these open doors were open ended  
  
Saturday  
Saturday
