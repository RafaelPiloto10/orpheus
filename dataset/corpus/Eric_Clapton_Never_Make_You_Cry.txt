It's so easy loving you  
With everything I feel inside,  
And holding me the way you do,  
It's here I'm staying all of my life.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'll never ever make you cry.  
I'll never ever say goodbye.  
Can't you see it in my eyes?  
I'm yours until the day I die.  
  
I'll watch you fall asleep at night,  
I'll smile and kiss you, hold you tight,  
I'll hold your hand and close my eyes,  
It's here I'm staying all of my life.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
