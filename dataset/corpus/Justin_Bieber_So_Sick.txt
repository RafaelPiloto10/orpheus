Mmmm mmm yeah  
Do do do do do do do-do  
Ohh Yeah  
  
Gotta change my answering machine  
Now that I'm alone  
Cuz right now it says that we  
Can't come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense  
Cuz you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
It's ridiculous  
It's been months  
And for some reason I just  
Can't get over us  
And I'm stronger than this  
Enough is enough  
No more walkin round  
With my head down  
I'm so over being blue  
Cryin over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calender I have  
That's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you  
There's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you  
And your memory  
And how every song reminds me  
Of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Don't make me think about her smile  
I'm letting go  
Turning off the radio  
  
Cuz I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishin' you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?
