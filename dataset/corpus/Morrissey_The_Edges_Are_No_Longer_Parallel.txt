The edges are no, no longer parallel  
The edges are no, no longer parallel  
And there is no law of averages here  
If you feel down  
Then you're bound to stay down  
All of the things you said  
So meaningful  
They are all so suddenly meaningless  
And the looks you gave  
So meaningful  
They are all so suddenly meaningless  
Oh...  
And there is no law of averages here  
If you feel down  
Then you're bound to stay down  
  
My only mistake is I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
My only mistake is I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
My only mistake is I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
My one mistake is I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
My only mistake is...  
My only mistake is I keep hoping  
My only mistake is I keep hoping  
My only mistake is I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
My only mistake is I'm hoping  
I'm hoping  
I'm hoping
