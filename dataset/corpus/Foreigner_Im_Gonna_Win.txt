Another dark night, in the city  
And my prospects lookin' thin  
The survival, of the fittest  
Is the law, in the world that I live in  
  
I was not born, to be a fighter  
But now's the time I have to learn  
To keep my head, above the water  
Gotta play with fire, but not get burned  
  
I gotta stand up, I gotta face it  
Don't want to lose it  
I want to taste it while it's hot  
Don't want to waste it, I need it so bad  
  
I'm gonna win, yeah  
I'm gonna win  
You see it's a matter of pride  
Deep down inside  
I'm gonna win, yeah  
I'm gonna win  
  
I got no time, to sit and wonder  
I got myself, to reckon with  
Yeah and life won't drag me under  
Even if it takes, all I have to give  
I'll give it all  
  
I gotta stand up, I gotta face it  
Don't want to lose it  
Ooh I want to taste it while it's hot  
Don't want to waste it, my mind's made up  
  
I'm gonna win  
I'm gonna win  
I tell you, see when it comes down to the crunch  
I've gotta beat life to the punch  
I'm gonna win  
Somehow I know I'm gonna win  
You know  
I've got to fight to stay alive  
Kick it in to overdrive  
I'm gonna win, ooh, ooh, ooh  
I'm gonna win  
  
I'm gonna win  
I'm gonna win  
You see it's a matter of pride  
Deep down inside  
I'm gonna win  
Gonna win, gonna win  
Ooh, I'll pay the price  
Gonna win  
No more Mr. Nice  
Gonna win  
Hey, just watch me roll the dice  
I'm gonna win, win, win  
I'm gonna win, win, gonna win  
I'm gonna win  
I know I'm gonna win
