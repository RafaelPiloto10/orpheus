Fuck it, I get the feeling tonight that it's going down  
I get the feeling she might hit the fan  
I get the feeling 'cause she left without a reason  
But I don't care, she's a fucking nightmare  
  
Like a fool, back in school, run around on the weekend  
Took a bit of time but now I see it like a bee can  
When I'm not around you're with another dude streaking  
Like bount, chica, bount bount, chica, bount bount  
  
I, I spy, girls gone wild weekend  
I, I spy, you're hittin' up my best friend  
I, I spy, you're going down in the deep end  
6 6 6, my Antichrist girlfriend  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
Bust it, I get the feeling she might sleep with other guys  
I get the feeling tonight she's not alone  
I get the feeling 'cause he picked her up this evening  
But I don't care, she's a fucking nightmare  
  
Smokin' Kools by the pool, saw your tail when I was peeking  
Went to grab a beer and heard the box spring squeakin'  
Walked into the room and there you were freakin'  
Like bount, chica, bount bount, chica, bount bount  
  
I, I spy, girls gone wild weekend  
I, I spy, you're hittin' up my best friend  
I, I spy, you're going down in the deep end  
6 6 6, my Antichrist girlfriend  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
Good riddance and goodbye, take your promise turned to lies  
Take your lows and your highs like a roller coaster ride  
Like a polar that's a white lie, woo  
That's a sigh of relief, so listen, I'm gonna tell you why  
  
You're gonna get what you deserve  
What goes around comes around, haven't you heard?  
Like a boomerang bound to round the curve  
You're gonna get what you deserve  
  
I take back the life that I gave you  
I take back all my fucking money too  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I'm taking back all the flowers that I gave you  
I'm taking back all the dinners that I bought you  
I'm taking back the time you stole my heart, my soul  
Are you even listenin'?  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through  
  
I take back all the shit I gave you  
I take back every word I said to you  
I take back everything except the part  
Where I said we were through
