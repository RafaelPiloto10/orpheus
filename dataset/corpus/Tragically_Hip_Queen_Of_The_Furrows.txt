Win Toronto, yelled the Queen of the Furrows  
This is how we farm, hens cluck and roosters crow  
You are my heart, staring down from the bureau  
To be apart, is that why you have to go  
  
To Conversation City, everybody's talking  
You must have something to say  
Conversation City, making conversation  
Working at it night and day  
  
Watch yourself, I say to my Toasted Western  
This is how I feel and it's when I learn the most  
You are my heart, you're my Queen of the Furrows  
This is how I feel, hens cluck and roosters crow  
  
I'm in the night fields  
Everything dark yellow  
I'm making my way by feel  
By my neighbor's glow  
  
You are my heart, oh my Queen of the Furrows  
This is how I farm, eyes up and ears down low  
You are my heart, you're my Queen of the Furrows  
This how I feel, hens cluck and roosters crow  
  
This is how I feel  
  
But in Conversation City, everybody's talking  
You must have something to say  
Conversation City, making conversation  
Working at it night and day  
  
You are my heart, oh my Queen of the Furrows  
This is how I farm, eyes up and ears down low  
You are my heart, you're my Queen of the Furrows  
This how I feel, hens cluck and roosters crow  
  
You are my heart, this is how I feel  
This is how I feel
