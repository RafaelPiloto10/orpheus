I'm a clone  
I know it and I'm fine  
I'm one and more are on the way  
I'm two, doctor  
Three's on the line  
He'll take incubation another day  
CHORUS: I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroying time  
No more problems on the way  
  
REFRAIN: I'm through doctor  
We don't need your kind  
The other ones  
Ugly ones  
Stupid boys  
Wrong ones  
CHORUS  
Six is having problems  
Adjusting to his clone status  
Have to put him on a shelf  
(Please don't put me on the shelf)  
All day long we hear him crying so loud  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
Be myself  
Be myself  
  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroyed time  
No more problems on the way  
REFRAIN  
CHORUS  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all
