When I was a boy down in South Illinois  
I heard a man playing blues what a wonderful noise.  
He had an old guitar but not a dollar to his name.  
Making music so sad but he was happy just the same.  
He gave me a wink and said son let me share the news.  
If you want a happy life you've got to learn to sing the blues.  
I asked my daddy for a guitar I begged and I plead.  
I said I wanted to play the blues and he just nodded his head.  
Daddy said when he was my age boogy-woogy was the thing.  
Just take the blues a round trip and add a little swing.  
Music has the power that without it he'd have sworn that he'd have never had
met my mom and I wouldn't have been born.  
So what's this?  
This is psychedelia  
It's where the guitar solo came from  
No I mean what with all the colors  
I have no idea  
  
I kept learning all the powers my guitar had  
I made it go walka-walka till it was so good it was bad.  
Just make a face and stop that face you can make that rhythm pump.  
So this is the blues just in a way that makes you want to shake your rump.  
I can make you clap your hands. I can make you do a dance.  
If you want to shake your booty my friend you've got to give the funk a
chance.  
  
Metal!  
Pound your fist in the air!  
Metal!  
Wave your head full of hair!  
It's crunchy and it's nasty full of bad attitude.  
Your parents will think you're crazy!  
Your neighbors will think you're rude!  
Believe it or not it's all the blues again!  
You just add a little fuss and turn your amp up to ten!  
Music has the power to change your life forever!
