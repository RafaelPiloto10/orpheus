If necessity is the mother of invention  
Then I'd like to kill the guy who invented this  
The numbers come together in some kind of a third dimension  
A regular algebraic bliss.  
  
Let's start with something simple, like one and one ain't three  
Any two plus two will never get you five.  
There are fractions in my subtraction and x don't equal y  
But my homework is bound to multiply.  
  
Math suks math suks  
I'd like to burn this textbook, I hate this stuff so much.  
Math suks math suks  
Sometimes I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.  
  
I got so bored with my homework, I turned on the TV.  
The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth.  
Then they asked the new Miss America  
Hey babe can you add up all those bucks?  
She looked puzzled, then just said  
"Math Suks".  
  
Math suks math suks  
You don't even have to spell it,  
All you have to do is yell it  
Math suks math suks  
Sometime times I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.  
  
Geometry, trigonometry and if that don't tax your brain  
There are numbers to big to be named  
Numerical precision is a science with a mission  
And I think it's gonna drive me insane.  
  
Parents fighting with their children, and the Congress can't agree  
Teachers and their students are all jousting constantly.  
Management and labor keep rattling old sabers  
Quacking like those Peabody ducks.  
  
Math suks math suks  
You don't even have to spell it,  
All you have to do is yell it  
Math suks math suks  
Sometime times I think that I don't know that much  
But math suks.
