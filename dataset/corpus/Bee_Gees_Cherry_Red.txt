CHERRY RED  
Bee Gess  
  
Where are you  
Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb  
Sweeter still when we're alone  
Cherry red, my cherry red  
  
Turquoise green , greener than the deeper sea  
Greener still when she's with me  
Cherry red , my cherry red  
  
I wonder why (wonder why)  
The stars that night shine big and bright for me  
I wonder why (wonder why)  
She's true to me the way that she will always be
