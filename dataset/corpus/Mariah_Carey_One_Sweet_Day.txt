Sorry I never told you  
All I wanted to say  
Now it's too late to hold you  
Cause you've flown away  
So far away  
  
Never had I imagined  
Living without your smile  
Feeling and knowing you hear me  
It keeps me alive  
Alive  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven  
Like so many friends we lost along the way  
And I know eventually we'll be together  
One sweet day  
  
Darling I never showed you  
Assumed you'd always be there  
Took your presence for granted  
But I always cared  
And I miss the love we shared  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Although the sun will never shine the same  
I'll always look to a brighter day  
  
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep  
You will always listen as I pray  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Sorry I never told you  
Together  
All I wanted to say
