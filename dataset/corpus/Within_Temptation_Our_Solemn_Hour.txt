("I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the
life of our country, of our empire, of our allies, and, above all, of the
cause of Freedom.")  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus!  
  
In my darkest hours I could not foresee  
That the tide could turn so fast to this degree  
Can't believe my eyes  
How can you be so blind?  
Is the heart of stone, no empathy inside?  
Time keeps on slipping away and we haven't learned  
So in the end now what have we gained?  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?  
  
Are they themselves to blame, the misery, the pain?  
Didn't we let go, allowed it, let it grow?  
If we can't restrain the beast which dwells inside  
It will find it's way somehow, somewhere in time  
Will we remember all of the suffering  
Cause if we fail it will be in vain  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony  
  
("A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders. The Germans, by a
remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks, have broken
through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line, and strong columns of
their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country, which for the first day
or two was without defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and
confusion in their track.")  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony!  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour (Solem hour!)  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us (All around us!)  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony
