You sure know what you're doing holding me this way.  
And I'll go where you lead me  
Anywhere you say.  
You've got me where you want me.  
So darling please be kind.  
Before you take it all, and I  
make that final fall.  
  
You've got to keep in mind I'm  
a new fool at an old game.  
A kid out of school, trying to find my way.  
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play.  
I'm just a new fool at an old game.  
  
Maybe I'm a dreamer, or maybe I'm naive.  
But when you say you love me I start to believe  
That coal can turn to diamonds.  
And this night will never end.  
But if it isn't so, and I cry when you go.  
  
You've got to understand that  
I'm a new fool at an old game.  
A kid out of school, trying to find my way.  
But I don't know the rules, teach me how to play.  
I'm just a new fool at an old game
