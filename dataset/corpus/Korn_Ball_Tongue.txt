There you are alone  
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of  
Something earned without begging  
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me  
Who do you think you are? What more do you want from me?!  
Ball Tongue!  
  
Why are you at home buried in your self pity?  
Why do you insist on living the lifeling out of me?  
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took down me  
Does it give you the right to expect your life from balls around me?!  
Ball Tongue!  
  
You were my bride, when does our friendship end?  
I'm not gonna give in  
You were my bride, when does our friendship end?  
I'm not gonna give in  
How can you fuck'n doubt me, but not again  
  
Ball Tongue!  
You're a psycho-fuck!  
Ball Tongue!
