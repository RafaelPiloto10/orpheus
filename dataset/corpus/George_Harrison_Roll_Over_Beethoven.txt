Gonna write a little letter, mail it to my local dj  
It's a rockin' little record I want my jockey to play  
Roll over beethoven, I hear it again today  
You know my temperature's rising and the juke-box blows a fuse  
My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul is a-singing the blues  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
I got a rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues  
I think I got it off the writer sittin' down at the rhythm review  
Roll over beethoven, we're rockin' by two by two  
Well, if you feel you like it  
Well get your lover and reel and rock it  
Roll it over and move on up just  
A little bit further and reel and rock it, roll it over  
Roll over beethoven, and dig these rhythm and blues  
Early in the morning I'm a-givin' you the warnin'  
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Hey little little gonna play my fiddle, ain't got nothin' to lose  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
You know she winks like a glow worm and dance like a spinnin' top  
She's got a crazy partner, oughta see 'em reel and rock  
Long as she's got a dime, the music will never stop  
Roll over beethoven, roll over beethoven  
Roll over beethoven, roll over beethoven  
Roll over beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues  
(thany you, domo arigato  
Thank you, thank you for coming to see the show  
And I'd like to thank the band and eric for  
Making me come here to japan, it's been very  
Nice and I love you. thank you)
