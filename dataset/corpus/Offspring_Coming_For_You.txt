[Verse 1]  
Time to go and get our kicks  
Dropping out and getting in the mix now  
Here in the backroom, nothing to do  
We're not bored, we're just sick of you, yeah  
Yeah, sick of you  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Break down, take down  
Now it's on  
Sold out, blow out  
Don't get caught  
Well no, hell no  
What you gonna do?  
When they keep coming for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
See the shadows marching on  
Yesterday's dreams are dead and gone  
Dead and gone  
Hear 'em cheering up above  
Down below is push and shove  
Yeah, push and shove  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Break down, take down  
Now it's on  
Sold out, blow out  
Don't get caught  
Well no, hell no  
What you gonna do?  
When they keep coming for you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Bet some, get some  
Knock you down  
Alone now, showdown  
Kiss the ground  
Well no, hell no  
What you gonna do?  
Lights out, put 'em in two  
They'll be coming for you  
  
[Bridge]  
What's up?  
Fuck you up  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Break down, take down  
Now it's on  
Sold out, blow out  
Don't get caught  
Well no, hell no  
What you gonna do?  
When they keep coming for you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Bet some, get some  
Knock you down  
Alone now, showdown  
Kiss the ground  
Well no, hell no  
What you gonna do?  
Lights out, put 'em in two  
They'll be coming for you  
  
[Outro]  
They'll be coming for you  
They'll be coming for you
