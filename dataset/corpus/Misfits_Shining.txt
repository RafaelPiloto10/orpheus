Oh  
Control the urge to spit up vile worms soul  
Monsters seduced by her attention  
Try draining the infection  
Whoa-go  
Go, oh  
  
Locked in a world of vomit-soaked skin, heaven  
Monsters seduced by her attention  
She's draining the infection  
  
"Carol Anne," the beast is calling  
"Carol Anne, Carol Anne," she can hear souls sing  
"Carol Anne," the beast it needs you  
Here it comes, here it comes  
Reaching out somewhere from inside your TV  
Whoa-go  
Go, oh  
  
Control the urge to spit up vile worms soul  
Monsters seduced by her attention  
Try draining the infection  
Whoa-oh  
  
"Carol Anne," the beast is calling  
"Carol Anne, Carol Anne," she can hear souls sing  
"Carol Anne," the beast it needs you  
Here it comes, here it comes  
Reaching out somewhere from inside your TV  
  
"Carol Anne," the beast is calling  
"Carol Anne, Carol Anne," she can hear souls sing  
"Carol Anne," the beast it needs you  
Here it comes, here it comes  
Reaching out somewhere from inside your TV
