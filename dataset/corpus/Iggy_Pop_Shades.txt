You gave me a present  
The paper was blue and green  
I unwrapped it with pleasure  
These are the best shades I've ever seen  
You can be my girlfriend  
Forever and a day  
I never thought I was worth much  
Or that anyone would treat me this way  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not  
The kind of guy  
Who dresses like a king  
And a really fine pair of shades  
Means everything  
And the light that blinds my eyes  
Shines from you  
It makes me come in the night  
It makes me swim with delight  
I like this pain  
I like this mirror  
I like these shades  
  
I could have had a problem  
I might have never followed through  
The other guys are in trouble  
They wouldn't listen to a girl like you  
These shades say something  
I'll bet they cost a lot  
I hope I don't break 'em  
I hope we don't break up  
  
[Chorus]
