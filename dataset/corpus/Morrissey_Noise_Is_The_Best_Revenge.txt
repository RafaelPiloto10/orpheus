Hey kid, take my hand  
If only for awhile  
And tell me all over again  
You say noise, it's the best revenge  
Noise, noise, noise  
All you can say is noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming  
Noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming too  
Hey kid, let me cry  
And don't think any less of me  
I've been hawking this song for too long  
You say noise, it's the best revenge  
There's a right way, there's a wrong way  
And there's even a Victorian legal system  
But noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming  
Noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming too, too  
Hey kid, let me die  
A short walk into the dark sky  
A final adventure if only I wasn't so tired  
You say I know why you're dreaming  
I know why you're dreaming  
You say I know why you're dreaming  
I know why you're dreaming  
'Cause it's the only escape  
I know why you're dreaming  
'Cause it's the only escape to, to
