Neptunes  
And we won't stop  
(I like that) 'Cause we can't stop  
Yeah  
Let me tell you something  
  
[Verse I]  
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick  
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich  
Chillin' with these chick  
Named Tondalea  
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her  
She wasn't fond of players  
Only wanted ballers  
To spoil her  
Six figures and camcorders  
So what you trying to tell me dear  
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere  
I just want to blow your mind  
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind  
My repratoir is Menage Trois  
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars  
And it ain't no stopping this  
I can't help it I'm an optomist  
And Ima make ya head bop to this  
And at the end you gon rock to this  
Now say my name  
  
[Hook-Neptunes]  
Its the D the I the D the D the Y  
The D the I the D  
It's Diddy, (Hold Up) It's Diddy (That's crazy)  
It's the D the I the D the D the Y  
The D the I the D  
Its Diddy, (Hold Up), It's Diddy (Say What!)  
  
[Verse ii]  
Ay yo, I came in the door  
I said it before  
I never the ladiez hyptonize me no more  
But, back to the manuscript  
'Cause I don't think you can handle this  
From New York to Los Angles  
I think the whole world scandalous  
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit  
Make the party people dance to this  
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this  
Cause I came too far  
For me to be bouswar  
It's a Bently to you, to me it's a blue car  
So Branson pass me a jar  
Cause these cats done went too far  
One phone call send two cars  
And still get searched by security guards  
I guess that's what I have to do  
Take the game international  
Now what you call me  
  
[Hook Repeat]  
  
(La La La La La La La La La La La La)  
C'mon work it out girl  
I'm trying to see you work it out girl  
(La La La La La La La La La La La La)  
C'mon work it out girl  
I wanna see you work it out girl  
  
[Verse iii]  
Now hold up, stop, wait a minute  
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit  
My aim is winning  
Got asian women  
That'll change my linen  
After I done blazed and hit em  
But I just wanna rock wit you  
And take it straight to the top with you  
And do what I gots to do  
If it's possible  
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo  
I got an agenda  
Got on a ninja  
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya  
That's when I met this chick named Brenda  
Tender, her whole body bend like fender  
So let me see you shake it girl  
I just wanna see you shake it girl  
For the return of the don  
The world in my palm  
My mom calls me Sean  
But y'all call me  
  
[Hook Repeat]  
(La La La La La La La La La La La)  
C'mon work it out girl  
(La La La La La La La La La La La)  
I wanna see you work it out girl
