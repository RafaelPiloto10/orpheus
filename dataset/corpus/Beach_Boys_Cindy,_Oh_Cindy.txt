Cindy, oh Cindy  
Cindy don't let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
I joined the Navy to see the world  
But nowhere could I find  
A girl as sweet as Cindy  
The girl I left behind  
I've searched the wide world over  
Can't get her out of my mind  
  
Cindy, oh Cindy  
Cindy don't let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
I see her face in every wave  
Her lips kiss every breeze  
Her loving arms reach out to me  
Through calm and stormy sea  
At night I face the lonely day  
Caressed by memories  
  
Cindy, oh Cindy  
Cindy don't let me down  
Write me a letter soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
I know my Cindy's waiting for me  
As I walk the decks alone  
Her loving arms reach out to me  
Soon I'll be heading home  
Then my sailing days will be over  
No more will I roam  
  
Cindy, oh Cindy  
Girl, oh don't you let me down  
Write me a letter, soon  
And I'll be homeward bound  
  
Oh, homeward bound,  
Well, just to see my Cindy, oh Cindy, Cindy, oh Cindy (fade)
