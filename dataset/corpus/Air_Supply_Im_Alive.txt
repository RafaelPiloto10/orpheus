I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky  
I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high  
Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)  
But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
Suddenly came the dawn (from the night), suddenly I was born (into light)  
How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
