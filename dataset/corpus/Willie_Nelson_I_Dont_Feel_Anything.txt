I don't feel anything what was I worried for  
I don't feel love or hate or anything that I felt before  
Why was I so afraid of seeing you again  
Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything  
How I must have loved you once upon a time  
And I can't seem to feel emotion now of any kind  
Why was I so afraid of seeing you again  
'Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything  
  
You look the same as always time's been good to you  
But I must confess that time has done a few things for me too  
Why was I so afraid  
But it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything
