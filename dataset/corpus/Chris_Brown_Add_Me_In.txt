[Verse:]  
Your body's an isosceles  
And I'm just tryna try angles  
Your love is trigonometry  
Just tryna solve the whole equation  
  
[Pre-Hook:]  
What's it about you (about you)  
I wanna love you  
Picking you up, picking you up  
So I can touch you  
Should we do that? Can I do that? (baby)  
Anwsers are usually in the bed  
  
[Hook:]  
Substitution, add me in  
Multiply my love  
Is that too much?  
Substitution  
What's the problem, girl?  
Add me in  
  
[Bridge 1]  
Baby just add me, baby just add me in  
Baby just add me, baby just add me in  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'll calculate her home invasion  
Divide your legs and count to 3 (3, 2, 1, come on)  
He's just not the answer baby  
And that's just my hypothesis  
  
[Pre-Hook:]  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Bridge 2]  
Girl if I said I loved you, I need you  
Would you care?  
So many things that I could learn  
Baby if we do the math, it will equal up to me!  
  
[Hook:] [x2]  
  
[Bridge 1] [x2]
