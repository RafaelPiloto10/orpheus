Tell me now, how do you survive  
In your lonely, lonely life?  
Together we just can do it right  
Together side by side  
The more you give, the more you get  
It is not a dream  
You're getting more than it seems  
  
Oh baby: we, we are the children of the world  
Can't you see, every boy and every girl  
We can do, we can do, we can do it again  
If we have a helping hand  
Baby we, we are the children of the world  
  
Tell me now, there's a chance for love  
Are you sure you have enough?  
Together we just can do it right  
If god is on your side  
Cause we have passion, we have pain  
It is not a dream  
Together we will win
