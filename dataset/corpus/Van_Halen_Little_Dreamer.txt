They may talk about you cold when you were  
Headed for the skies  
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that  
Change with a wink of your eye  
Now no one's talkin' 'bout those  
Crazy days gone by  
No one talks about the  
Times you cried  
(Oooh) Little dreamer  
(Oooh) Uh, little dreamer  
And then they voted you  
Least likely to succeed  
I hadda tell them baby, you were armed with  
All you'd need  
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout those  
Crazy days gone past  
Weren't they amazed when you were  
Really last  
(Oooh) You are the little dreamer  
(Oooh) You were the little dreamer, yeah, yeah  
Yeah they talk about you cold when you were  
Headed for the skies  
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that  
Change with a wink of your eye  
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout the  
Crazy days gone past  
Eren't they amazed when you were  
Really last  
(Oooh) You are the little dreamer  
  
(Oooh) Little dreamer, oh yeah, oh  
(Oooh) Little dreamer  
(Oooh) Little dreamer
