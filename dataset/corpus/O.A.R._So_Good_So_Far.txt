Wake up, dreaming  
Crooked days left behind  
These closed eyes  
  
The places that we've been  
Footsteps and handprints  
The more we've yet to see the more I find  
  
It's all we have  
So good so far  
  
It's not over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til we've won  
  
Well I was thoughtless and careless  
The day I lost my innocence  
Chasing you into the sun  
  
It's okay when I'm afraid  
It's okay when I'm a fool  
Who only plays the cards he's got  
  
It's all we have  
So good so far  
  
It's not over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til we've won  
  
So here's to tomorrow  
The next one that follows  
All and anything that comes  
  
We'll let the summer kiss the day  
Watch the rains come in  
And wash away the crazy thing we've done  
  
It's all we have  
So good so far  
All we have  
So good so far  
  
It's so good so far  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til we've won  
  
It's not over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til I've won  
  
This ain't over 'til we're done  
And we've only just begun  
I'm in the middle of the longest fight  
I've ever had in all my life  
And it ain't over 'til we've won
