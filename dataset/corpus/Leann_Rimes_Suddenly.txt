It's Independence Day I'm free  
And it's a strange place to be  
I'm gonna break these chains  
Unleash the changes in me  
  
I see an endless road  
I feel the restless wind  
I've lost the fear inside  
Cause I've got no choice  
But to live or die  
  
[Chorus]  
Suddenly you're in this fight  
Alone  
Steppin' out into the great  
Unknown  
And the night's the hardest  
Time  
When the doubts run through  
Your mind  
Cause suddenly you find your  
Self alone  
Suddenly you find yourself  
  
In an empty room  
With a suitcase on the floor  
It'll be daylight soon  
I'm gonna wage my private  
War  
  
Who's watchin' over me  
Must be a guardian angel  
I just need time to breathe  
And give my life  
The best of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly you're in this fight  
Steppin' out and then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly you're in this fight  
Alone  
Steppin' out into the great  
Unknown  
And the night's the hardest  
Time  
When the doubts run through  
Your mind  
Cause suddenly you find your  
Self alone  
Suddenly I found myself
