I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
I leave from softball practice every night.  
It's getting dark but the golden arches light up the way.  
I turn the corner at the traffic light.  
I count my money and I rehearse what I'm gonna say:  
I'd like an order of fries,  
And Quarter-Pounder with Cheese,  
I love the light in your eyes,  
Will you go out with me please?  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
She doesn't try to impress anyone.  
She doesn't try to be tough  
Like all the girls that I know.  
She doesn't treat me like a simpleton.  
I wanna say how I feel,  
If I could just let go.  
And when my hamburgers cold,  
I get up ready to go,  
She's only 16 years old,  
And I'm in love with her so.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
There she stands behind the register.  
Taking orders from the  
Provo City Little League.  
If they knew how much I wanted her,  
Their home room teacher would have  
To send them home for a week.  
And when I head for the door, the  
Moonlight catches her eyes.  
My heart begins to soar, she smiles  
And waves goodbye. Goodbye  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She has a smile of innocence.  
So tender and warm.  
I am in love with a McDonald's girl.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform. What a babe.  
She is an angel in a polyester uniform.  
I am in love with a McDonald's Girl.
