Between the drizzle and the drop  
Between the drizzle and the drop  
  
Come on put your faith in beauty  
Try to do love's duty, won't you help us carry on?  
Offer every honor, and just honor every offer  
Help us carry on  
  
Darling, don't you know that everywhere you go  
You make the sourest rain as sweet as sunshine?  
Darling, don't you see by just standing here by me  
You make it so much easier to find?  
  
The hole in the rain, hole in the rain  
The hole in the rain, hole in the rain  
  
Put your heart and mind together  
Manipulate this weather  
Help us, carry on  
With the love of one another  
We can still be nature's mother  
We can help her carry on  
  
Darling, don't you know that everywhere you go  
You make that sourest rain sweet as sunshine?  
Darling, don't you see with your standing here by me  
You make it so much easier to find?  
  
The hole in the rain, hole in the rain  
The hole in this rain, we got hole in the rain  
  
The hole in the rain, hole in the rain  
Hole in the rain, the hole in this rain  
  
I know, there's a hole in the rain  
There's a hole in that pouring rain  
I can see it pouring down, there's a hole  
There's a hole, there's a hole  
There's a hole, there's a hole in the rain  
  
There 's a hole, there's a hole outside  
I can see it falling down  
And I can see that little hole in the rain  
Darling, with the help of my friends
