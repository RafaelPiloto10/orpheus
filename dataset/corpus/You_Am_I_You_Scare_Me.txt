You couldn't have took it any harder  
You couldn't have put it anymore sweet  
But every bone of yours for picking  
Is every bone they picked of meat  
Now you're loaded, lonely and on her mind  
Now you're loaded, bloated, but it's only 'til next time  
When every cut on the wall becomes a curse  
Cut yourself real deep before they get in first.  
Take each good word like a crucifx  
You gave up the dte for a mouth of dirt.  
Now you're loaded, lonely and on her mind  
Now you're loaded, bloated, but it's only 'til next time  
You scare me blind  
Can't help but take each day as another call  
To arms in the hero victim's cause  
And every bone you left out for picking  
Is gonna stick in the throat of everyone that you never called.  
It's only, loaded on her mind  
It's only, loaded but it's only 'til next time  
You scare me blind
