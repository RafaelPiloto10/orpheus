(Angel baby you're mine forever)  
(Angel baby, you angel baby you)  
Who is the dream who starts me dreaming  
Angel baby  
Then keeps me worrying and schemeing  
You, angel baby, you  
  
Who starts me walking 'round in clover  
Angel baby  
Then flips my crazy heart right over  
You, angel baby, you  
  
Who is the chick I would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for me to kiss  
Who is the girl who can curl me around her finger when we kiss again  
Who can imagine what I'd give for Angel baby  
Just for the chance to love and live for  
You, angel baby, you  
  
(Angel baby) you're mine forever  
(Angel baby) you, angel baby, you  
(Who is the chick he would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for him to
kiss)  
(Who is the girl who can twirl him around her little finger when they kiss
again)  
  
Who can imagine what I'd give for Angel baby  
Just for the chance to love and live for  
You, angel baby, you  
(Angel baby) you're mine forever  
(Angel baby) you, angel baby, you
