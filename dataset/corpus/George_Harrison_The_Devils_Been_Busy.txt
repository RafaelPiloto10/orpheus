While youre strolling down the fairway  
Showing no remorse  
Glowing from the poisons  
Theyve sprayed on your golf course  
While youre busy sinking birdies  
And keeping your scorecard  
The devils been busy in your back yard  
  
Steaming down the highway  
With your trucks of toxic waste  
Where you gonna hide it  
In the outer space?  
You don't know what youre doing  
Or what you have to guard  
The devils been busy in your back yard  
  
Sometimes you think youre crazy  
But you know youre only mad  
Sometimes youre better off not knowing  
How much youve been had  
  
You see your second cousin  
Wasted in a fight  
You say he had it coming  
You couldn't do it right  
Youre in a western movie, playing the part  
The devils been busy in your back yard  
  
Sometimes they say youre wicked  
But you know that can't be bad  
Sometimes youre better off not knowing  
Itll only make you sad  
  
Theyre coming down picadilly  
Dripping at the dash  
Wasting sticky willy  
Covering him with their cash  
They just might not have noticed, theyve been beating him so hard  
And the devils been busy in your back yard  
Devils been busy in your back yard  
Devils been busy in your back yard
