I had not planned on seeing you  
I was afraid of what I'd do  
But pride is strong, here am I  
And I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
Please have no fear, you're in no harm  
As long as you're here in my arms  
But you can't leave so please don't try  
But I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
What force behind your evil mind  
Can let your lips speak so unkind  
To one who loves as much as I  
I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
The flesh around your throat is pale  
Intended by my fingernails  
Please don't scream and please don't cry  
Cause I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
Your voice is still, it speaks no more  
You'll never hurt me anymore  
Death is a friend to love and I  
Cause now you'll never say goodbye
