Step inside the dream machine  
You're on a power drive  
Feel the passion of the beast  
Watch her come alive.  
  
Oh-- you're almost there, ride on silver air  
You better hold on tight-- she's fire in the night.  
  
Chorus:  
Faster than the speed of light  
Hugging all the curves  
Hang on to your life  
Faster than the speed of light  
Supercharged and flying low  
She's liquid dynamite.  
  
Got your hands upon the wheel  
The pedal to the floor  
Now it's time for nerves of steel  
Hear the engine roar.  
  
Oh-- you shoot the thrill-- heading for the kill  
No control tonight-- she's liquid dynamite.  
  
Repeat Chorus twice
