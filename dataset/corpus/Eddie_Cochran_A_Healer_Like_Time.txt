My heart was a playground where you played about  
When you got through playin' you just walked out  
I thought when you left me, that I'd lose my mind  
But now I've forgotten with a healer like time  
They said I'd forget you, I thought they were wrong  
I thought for a lifetime, my love would be strong  
But now I've forgotten and you're out of my mind  
Oh I'm so thankful for a healer like time  
  
I used to remember the dreams that we knew  
When your life was my life, your thoughts were mine too  
But since we have parted, I've forgotten by far  
Oh I'm so thankful for a healer like time
