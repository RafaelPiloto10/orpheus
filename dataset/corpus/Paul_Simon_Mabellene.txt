Chorus:  
(Oh) Maybellene, why can't you be true, whoah Maybellene, why can't you be
true  
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do  
  
As I was motivatin over the hill, I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville,  
A cadillac a-rollin on the open road, yeah, but nothin out race my V8 Ford,  
The Cadillac doin' 'bout 95, she's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side.  
  
Chorus  
  
He cooled down, the motor cooled down  
That's when I'd heard that highway sound  
I kept back sittin' like a ton of lead  
Got a hundred and ten a half mile ahead  
Cadillac lookin' like it's standin' still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill  
  
Chorus  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Chorus  
  
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do  
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do
