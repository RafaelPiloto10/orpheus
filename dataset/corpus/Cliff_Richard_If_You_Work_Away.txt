If you walked away from me today  
I am sure that who you were going to  
Would feel the way as I do  
Baby it's you who fills up my life  
  
And if you walked away from me today  
It wouldn't change a thing  
I'd still be singin' celebration of you  
Baby, you do, you fill up my life  
  
You my life'til now  
No one's been able to show me how  
To fill my life like you  
You are the woman who taught me to  
And if you walked away from me today  
Never to retur Until the journey that you made had ended  
I know you planned it just to fill up my life  
You my life,now I know what it feels like to overflow  
Until my life is through  
A'll I'm here for,is here for you,just for you  
Only for you
