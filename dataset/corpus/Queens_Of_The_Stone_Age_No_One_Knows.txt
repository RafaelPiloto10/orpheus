We get some rules to follow  
That and this  
These and those  
No one knows  
  
We get these pills to swallow  
How they stick  
In your throat  
Tastes like gold  
  
Oh, what you do to me  
No one knows  
  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
Ah  
  
I journey through the desert  
Of the mind  
With no hope  
I found low  
  
I drift along the ocean  
Dead lifeboats in the sun  
And come undone  
  
Pleasantly caving in  
I come undone  
  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool am I  
And I realize you're mine  
Indeed a fool I  
Ah  
  
Heaven smiles above me  
What a gift her below  
But no one knows  
  
A gift that you give to me  
No one knows
