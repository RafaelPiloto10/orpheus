You keep watching the rain come down (yeah)  
Pretty princess, broken crown (yeah)  
And your dreams have all burned out  
But don't you know that they brought you  
Here somehow, all you need to know is  
  
You're home, where secrets are told  
See a new world unfolding  
Where hearts are one, the pain's undone  
And your finally belonging, yeah  
And you need to know, you need to know  
You're home, yeah  
You need to know, you need to know  
You're home  
So take your coat off and stay awhile (yeah)  
What made you cry can make you smile again  
You can hold your head up high  
Cause don't you know that you  
Oh, girl you were born to fly  
When you realize  
You're home, where secrets are told  
See a new world unfolding  
Where hearts are one, the pain's undone  
And your finally belonging, yeah  
And you need to know, you need to know  
You're home, yeah  
You need to know  
All you really need to know is you're home  
Welcome home  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Cause you're home  
Feel the sun, your day has come  
You're not alone  
You're home
