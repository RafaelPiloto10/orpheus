"The story you're about to see, occurred along the main  
Trading route, on the border between the North and South  
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village."  
  
What the fuck y'all niggas thought, huh? What you thinkin' bitch?  
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid  
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu bitch  
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch  
Get the fuck back, 'fore we break a f, listen  
Tryin' to tell y'all niggas, give you a fair warnin'  
Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids  
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig  
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it  
So now you got to feel it!  
  
Yo what the, yo  
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck  
Y'know how we do it in the hood  
Yo, yeah, turn the mic up, yeah, yo  
  
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies  
Take money snatch jewelry, in the hood  
You find the best woman lookin' good  
Diamond she need polishin'  
In my hood, all the gunshot legal  
At the same time we gotta stop killin' our people  
Keep it in the hood, niggas walk with they gun  
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from  
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta  
I know a few murderer, drug dealer  
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build  
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real  
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood, 80 proof  
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects  
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark  
Movin' with the Wesson  
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson  
Pussy hole testin', in the hood  
Got the word from the hood rat, shorty on the wood  
  
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah  
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah  
Murder, nine millimeter me say  
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi  
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di  
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying  
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying  
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder  
  
Hey yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods  
It ain't all good, pass the goods  
Deep in the project halls waitin' to shine  
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs  
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties  
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie  
And keep dough on the flip, a hoe on the strip  
And roll dick throw on the flip  
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun  
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?  
Far from ya Hollywood  
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood  
From project chicks with hips and slim waists  
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths  
O.G, I spit G to the young ones  
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from  
  
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah  
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah  
Murder, nine millimeter me say  
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi  
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di  
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying  
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying  
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder  
  
This is the place where thugs is born, in the hood  
Blink to long ya life is gone, in the hood  
Convicts still live with they mom  
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm, in the hood  
Crack fiend'd furnish a 'Llac, in the hood  
African's be drivin cabs, in the hood  
In the streets the ghetto is hot  
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops, in the hood  
The ones you love'll fill you with slugs, in the hood  
Babies born addicted to drugs, in the hood  
We make life or death decisions  
And the school system is like a minimal prison  
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin  
In the hood, it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah  
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah  
Murder, nine millimeter me say  
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi  
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di  
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying  
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying  
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder
