(Jimmy Cliff)  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Waiting for the tide turn.  
Yeah, now, sitting here in Limbo,  
So many things I've got to learn.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Waiting for the dice to roll.  
Yeah, now, sitting here in Limbo,  
Still got some time to search my soul.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
  
I don't know where life will take me,  
But I know where I have been.  
I don't know what life will show me,  
But I know what I have seen.  
Tried my hand at love and friendship,  
That is past and gone.  
And now it's time to move along.  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Like a bird ain't got a song.  
Yeah, I'm sitting here in Limbo  
And I know it won't be long  
'Til I make my getaway, now.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
  
I don't know where life will take me,  
But I know where I have been.  
I don't know what life will show me,  
But I know what I have seen.  
Tried my hand at love and friendship,  
That is past and gone.  
And now it's time to move along.  
  
Gonna lead me on now.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.  
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.  
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.
