I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I had to put her, six feet under, and I can still hear her complain  
  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I knew I'd miss her, so I had to keep her  
She's buried right in my back yard  
  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her  
She bitched so much. She drove me nuts, and now I'm happier this way  
I used to love her, but I had to kill her, and I can still hear her complain
