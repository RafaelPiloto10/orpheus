As I walk down the street  
Seems everyone I meet  
Gives me a friendly hello.  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
The birds in every tree  
Are all so neighborly.  
They sing wherever I go.  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
If you should ask me the amount  
In my bank account  
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'  
But that don't worry me, confidentially  
  
I've got a dream that's a pippin'  
And when the day is through  
Each night I hurry to  
A home where love waits, I know.  
  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
And when the day is through  
Each night I hurry to  
A home where love waits, I know.  
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so  
  
I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so
