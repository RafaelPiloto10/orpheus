I got to know right now  
It's got to be this time  
I wanna show you how  
Gonna make you change your mind  
There's an empty chair at my table  
There's an empty look in your eyes  
Ooh, that's right  
  
I just happen to be a man  
And you happen to be a woman  
And we happen to be together  
Try to stop this thing comin'  
  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take a little love and shake it all around, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground  
Down to the ground, baby come on  
Stand up, stand up for love  
  
I'm gonna play your game  
I wanna play with fire  
I want to breathe your air  
Baby, gonna take you there  
If you lay your cards on the table  
I'll lay my love on the line  
Till you're mine  
  
I just happen to be a man  
And you happen to be a woman  
And we happen to be together  
Try to stop this thing comin'  
  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take a little love and shake it all around, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground  
Down to the ground, baby come on  
Stand up, stand up for love  
  
You couldn't get it much better  
You never had it so good  
Stand up together  
And when you're ready to  
You're gonna get what you should  
  
Little by little  
Like a fine wine  
My love is like a motor  
Runnin' all the time  
Step by step  
Easy and slow  
On the stairway to heaven  
What a way to go  
  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take a little love and shake it all around, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and show me what you found, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
My love is like a motor runnin' all the time, stand up  
Stand up, yeah, kick love into motion  
I said step by step  
Go easy, go slow, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Yeah, on a stairway to heaven  
What a way to go, stand up
