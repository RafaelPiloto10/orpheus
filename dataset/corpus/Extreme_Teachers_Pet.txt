My formal education  
Never bothered  
With my ABC's  
Teacher student relation  
Taught me all about  
The birds and bees  
  
School boy fantasy  
Lose control  
Of all my faculties  
  
You know that one thing  
That got through to me  
Was her body chemistry  
  
Subject to body language  
Ain't so bad to read  
Between the lines  
I scored above average  
Oral examination  
Is where I shine  
  
School boy fantasy  
Lose control  
Of all my faculties  
Student body graduated  
At the highest degree  
  
You know that one thing  
That got through to me  
Was her body chemistry  
Purely scientifically  
Studied her anatomy  
  
Teacher's pet, Teacher's pet  
God only knows what you do to me
