Let me rock you, let me roll you  
Take my hand  
I will take you to a new start  
Calling the promised land  
Let me love you, let me hold you  
With all my heart  
Trust me baby, like I trust you  
I did it from the start  
And each and every day  
I'm gonna always say  
  
Let's talk about love, love, love, love  
That's all I'm dreaming of  
Let's talk about love  
It's up to you  
To make your dreams come true  
Look in my eyes, there's a way  
Don't throw your dreams away  
You'll never lose  
Keep love alive  
Babe, then our love survive  
  
Let me rock you, let me roll you  
I'll be close to you  
We can have a one way trip to paradise for two  
There's so much  
I can give you  
I'll give all my heart  
We can always be together  
And never break apart  
And each and every day I'm gonna always say
