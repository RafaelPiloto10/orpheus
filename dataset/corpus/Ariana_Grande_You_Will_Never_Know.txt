[Verse 1]  
Now you're finally tell me how you feel  
This to us just came a little too late  
All the drama, boy, it's over kill  
Don't be mad at me cause you've been replaced, know your place  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But if you would have manned up  
Put your hand up, stand up, tell me how you really felt  
Then maybe it'd be different  
If it was me that would have listened  
But now I'm with somebody else  
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up  
But it sucks to be all in your head  
Wondering where this thing could go  
  
But, you will never know  
  
[Chorus]  
What we could have been (uhhuh)  
If you would have shown (uhhuh)  
Me way back thenboy you'll never know, (yep)  
Boy you should have known, (yep)  
But you need to know so  
Now you'll never know  
You'll never know  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was probably hard for you to hear  
But there's nothing left for you to say  
Had my heart all in your hands  
Boy what you don't understand  
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But if you would have manned up  
Put your hand up, stand up, tell me how you really felt  
Then maybe it'd be different  
If it was me that would have listened  
But now I'm with somebody else  
And he loves me, too much for me to mess this up  
But it sucks to be all in your head  
Wondering where this thing could go  
But, you will never know  
  
[Chorus]  
What we could have been (uhhuh)  
If you would have shown (uhhuh)  
Me way back then  
Boy you'll never know, (yep)  
Boy you should have known, (yep)  
But you need to know so  
Now you'll never know  
You'll never know  
  
[Hook]  
You'll never know  
Boy you should have told me, told me  
You'll never know  
Boy you should have let me knowyou'll never know  
Boy you could have been there for me  
But now you'l never know  
You'll never know  
  
[Bridge]  
It's not my fault  
You're a little bit too late  
You're the only one to blame  
Wipe that look off your face  
You can wish a thousand times  
But none of that will change my mind, boy  
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, nothing  
  
[Chorus]  
You will never know  
What we could have been (uhhuh)  
If you would have shown (uhhuh)  
Me way back then  
Boy you'll never know, (yep)  
Boy you should have known, (yep)  
But you need to know so  
Now you'll never know  
You'll never know
