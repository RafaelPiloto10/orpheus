Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo, woohoo  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo, woohoo  
  
I'm alone it's just me, and  
I'm watchin' TV  
And I'm always oh so bored at home  
I get up, I get out,  
Drive my car, go out town  
Keep on calling but you're never around  
See my friends out tonight  
Other pieces of life  
At the club  
Till someone starts a fight  
Then we get in the car  
So know where you are  
I'm so pissed off  
Always hanging around  
I'm so tired  
Your fired!  
  
Your fire is so jealous  
Restless  
Relentless  
That's just me.  
I'm so crazy lately c'mon let it be  
Don't make me beg for the things I need  
You know they say  
Where there's a will, there's a way  
Lies are free  
Talk is cheap  
  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo, woohoo  
  
Now were out in the street  
And were sweatin' the heat  
And we move with the traffic and the beat  
I don't care if you choke  
When you light up your smoke  
It's the one thing I can call my own  
It's so tragic  
I'm so mad and  
  
I'm so jealous  
Restless  
Relentless  
That's just me.  
I'm so crazy lately c'mon let it be  
Don't make me beg for the things I need  
You know they say  
Where there's a will, there's a way  
Lies are free  
Talk is cheap  
  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo, woohoo  
  
I'm so tired  
  
Your fire is so jealous  
Restless  
Relentless  
That's just me.  
I'm so crazy lately c'mon let it be  
Don't make me beg for the things I need  
You know they say  
Where there's a will, there's a way  
Lies are free  
Talk is cheap  
  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo, woohoo  
  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo  
  
Talk is cheap  
  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Woohoo, woohoo  
  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
  
Yeah, lies a free, and  
Talk is cheap
