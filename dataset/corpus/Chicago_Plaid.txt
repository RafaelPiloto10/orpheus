Some will say it's too late,  
So don't change the story.  
There's too much at stake to grow.  
Yesterday was so great,  
Just bask in the glory.  
Don't let your feelings show.  
  
And I say,  
"Oh Yeah" like a man with condition  
I wait for my heart to stop.  
Stay down,  
Got a plan hold that position.  
You can't afford a flop.  
  
Pack my suitcase  
With my game face,  
Take the same place,  
And put away the dreams I had.  
Let my hair grow,  
Find some old clothes,  
Let the world know  
That my glory days were plaid.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not asking for permission,  
Are you ready for me to be me.  
Just pass the ammunition,  
This prisoner's about to bust free from chains.  
  
For so long you told me to keep it familiar,  
Just play what they all would find,  
I can wear this blindfold, stick to your story,  
But I gotta ask myself why.  
And I play those songs!  
For so many seasons,  
Till I'm sure I'm losing my mind.  
And I say, Oh no,  
Gotta have a much better reason  
To leave all my dreams behind.  
  
Strangers,  
Rearrange us,  
Stay the same fate,  
And become your favorite fad.  
With the see-through,  
I gotta be true,  
I can't be you.  
While Yes still comes in plaid.  
  
[Chorus].  
  
I'm more than just excited,  
Like a hundred pounds of monkey on my back.  
Now everybody's divided,  
We're riding this train till we run clear out of track.  
Clean of track.  
  
[Chorus]
