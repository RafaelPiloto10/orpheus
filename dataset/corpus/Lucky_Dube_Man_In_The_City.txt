Standing alone, in the middle of the city  
Man looks around him  
He hardly recognizes what he sees  
Cause he' s a man from the past  
Two thousand years ago  
This was his home  
Rivers used to run here  
Birds used to fly around here  
But now it is a different jungle  
A concrete jungle  
  
[Chorus:]  
He' s a lonely man  
In the middle of the city  
Missing home so badly  
  
Man' s own creation  
Has become his worst enemy  
Weapons of destruction  
Have brought about  
Human extinction...wo...ho  
Two thousand years ago  
This was his home  
But now it is  
A different jungle  
A concrete jungle  
  
[Chorus:]  
He' s a lonely man  
In the middle of the city  
Missing home so badly
