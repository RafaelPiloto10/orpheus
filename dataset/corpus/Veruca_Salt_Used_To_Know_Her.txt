I used to know her  
I used to talk about her  
Waiting for the day that she would listen  
I used to know her  
I used to stick up for her  
Something in her smile was so bitchin'  
I used to sing, I used to sing  
I used to know her  
Used to know all about her  
I used to need her  
There was something about her  
I used to torch her  
It's the best way around her  
I used to know her  
Now it just doesn't matter, oh yeah  
Oh yeah...  
I used to fuck him  
I used to simplify him  
Something in his walk was like jim morrison  
I used to touch him  
I used to justify him  
Lying to my face with my permission.  
I used to sing, I used to sing  
I used to fuck him  
Used to fucking love him  
I used to need him  
Now I read all about him  
I used to touch him  
Now I could never kiss him  
I used to love him  
Now I don't even miss him, oh yeah.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...  
I used to know her.....  
I used to terrify her, I used to terrify her, I used to terrify her  
I used to terrify her, I used to terrify her  
I used to sing, we used to sing!  
I used to know her  
I used to know all about her  
I used to need her  
There was something about her  
I'm used to tortue  
It's the best way around her  
I used to know her  
Now she just doesn't matter, oh yeah  
She just doesn't matter..oh yeah  
She just doesn't matter..oh yeah  
She just doesn't matter..oh yeah  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
