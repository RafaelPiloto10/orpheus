My first lesson  
In losin' love was you  
Learnin' to live with your memory  
Was lesson number two  
And I can't lie  
Baby I still cry sometimes  
But I've come a long way  
Towards gettin' you out of my mind  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
Sometimes your memory  
Still gets the best of me  
But that lonely ache in my heart  
Ain't as bad as it used to be  
And sometimes the way that I'm feelin'  
Inside doesn't show  
But I know  
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm
