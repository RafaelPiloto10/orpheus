Take her to heart  
And she'll always love you  
And nobody can make her do wrong  
But take her for granted  
Leavin' your love unshown  
Makes will power weak  
And temptation strong  
A woman's only human  
This you should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
And if you want  
A do right all day's woman  
You gotta be  
A do right all night's man  
  
A woman's only human  
This you should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
And if you want  
A do right all day's woman  
You gotta be  
A do right all night's man
