I'm falling in this pit of sorrow  
I really don't care anyway  
Happiness I'm looking to borrow  
Even four last seconds okay  
I'm starting to feel so so hollow  
Fill me up then go on your way  
I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow  
So I'll just do my best anyway.  
  
Hold me now  
I've been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasn't born today.  
  
I'm starting to break my devotion  
What does that mean anyway?  
Running into signs interwoven  
So much that it gets in my way  
I'm starting to feel so so hollow  
Fill me up then go on your way  
I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow  
So I'll just do my best anyway.  
  
Hold me now  
I've been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasn't born today  
  
Hold me now  
I've been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame.  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasn't born today.
