Twice in a lifetime if you're really really lucky  
You may discover why you were brought here  
Tutta la vita you try to find your destination  
You search for the truth, you try to make communication  
All of your life  
Tutta la vita asking "Where is the party?"  
It's not a mansion in Malibu or a face lift at forty  
No you won't find it there  
Love is everywhere  
If you'll only dare to try  
It's not on a map so we all have to muddle through  
You can't get there in a car--not even your BMW  
Twice in a lifetime you'll know the answer  
Once when you find love  
Once when you give love to another  
Yes--you will find it there  
Love is everywhere  
If you'll only dare to fly
