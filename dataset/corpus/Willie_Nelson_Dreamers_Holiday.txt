Climb aboard a butterfly,  
An' take off on the breeze,  
Let your worries flutter by,  
An' do the things you please,  
In a land where dollar bills,  
Are fallin' off the trees,  
On a dreamer's holiday!  
  
Every day for breakfast,  
There's a dish of scrambled stars,  
An' for lunchin' you'll be munchin'  
Rainbow candy bars,  
You'll be livin' a la mode,  
On Jupiter and Mars,  
On a dreamer's holiday!  
  
Make it a long vacation,  
Time, there is plenty of,  
You need no reservation,  
Just bring along the one you love!  
  
Help yourself to happiness,  
An' sprinkle it with mirth,  
Close your eyes an' concentrate,  
An' dream for all you're worth,  
You will feel terrific,  
When you get back down to earth,  
From a dreamer's holiday!
