"And now, the sever beating of a high school janitor."  
  
[Mopping sounds]  
Mop, mop, mop  
All day long  
Mop, mop, mop  
While I sing this song  
  
[Sound of someone walking towards him]  
Gonna wax the floor  
Gonna make it shine  
Gonna take of the spray paint  
With turpentine  
  
"Hey! Don't walk there! I just mopped!"  
[Person walking quickly towards him]  
[Beating sounds]  
"Hey!"  
[Beating sounds]  
"Get offa me!"  
[Beating sounds]  
"That's my bucket!"  
[Beating sounds]  
"Let go of my side burns!"  
[Beating sounds]  
[Sound of falling down into glass]
