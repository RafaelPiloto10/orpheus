You don't call me anymore  
But don't you think that I don't care  
I check the numbers every night  
Just to see if you are there  
Was it just another love affair?  
Was it just another love affair? Ooh  
My clock goes ticking through the night  
Counting the seconds I don't sleep  
I wish that I could turn back time  
But some things were never meant to keep  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, another love affair)  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
Without you  
(Oh)  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, never be the same  
And remember how we once were  
When you held me so closely  
We were breathing in the dark light  
There was no more pain  
One love, one heart, one soul together, ooh  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, another love affair, oh)
