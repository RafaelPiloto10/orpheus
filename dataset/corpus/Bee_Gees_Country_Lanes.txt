So warm is my morning sun, red is my rainbow  
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face  
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding  
Like a light in the storm  
  
Whenever I cry my friend  
You're always away and so I pretend  
If I could live the dreams that I see  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love for you  
  
My life has meaning now, I am a window  
And all things seem clear to me now  
Like a light in the storm  
  
Whenever I cry my friend  
You're always away and so I pretend  
If I could live the dreams that I see  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love for you
