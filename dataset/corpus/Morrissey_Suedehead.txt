Why do you come here?  
And why do you hang around?  
I'm so sorry  
I'm so sorry  
  
Why do you come here  
When you know it makes things hard for me?  
When you know, oh  
Why do you come?  
Why do you telephone? (Hmm...)  
And why send me silly notes?  
I'm so sorry  
I'm so sorry  
  
Why do you come here  
When you know it makes things hard for me?  
When you know, oh  
Why do you come?  
You had to sneak into my room  
Just to read my diary  
"It was just to see, just to see"  
(All the things you knew I'd written about you...)  
Oh, so many illustrations  
Oh, but  
I'm so very sickened  
Oh, I am so sickened now  
  
Oh, it was a good lay, good lay  
It was a good lay, good lay  
It was a good lay, good lay  
Oh  
It was a good lay, good lay  
It was a good lay, good lay  
Oh, it was a good lay, good lay  
Oh  
Oh, it was a good lay  
It was a good lay  
Oh, a good lay  
Oh, it was a good lay  
Good lay, good lay  
Oh  
It was a good lay  
It was a good lay
