STILL GOT YOUR PICTURE UP ON THE WALL  
I CAN'T TAKE' EM DOWN  
I KEEP EXPECTING YOU TO CALL  
BUT YOU DON'T MAKE A SOUND  
TIME AIN'T SUPPOSED TO PASS THIS SLOW  
I SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN YOU LONG AGO  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  
  
I'M TIRED OF PUTTING IT OFF TILL TOMORROW  
SHOULD'VE DONE IT YESTERDAY  
NO GAIN IN DROWNING IN MY SORROW  
AND JUST WASTING AWAY  
JUST WHEN I THINK I GOT IT MADE  
YOU NEVER FAIL TO GET IN THE WAY  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU  
  
BRIDGE:  
IF I COULD JUST CONVINCE MYSELF  
TO OPEN MY EYES AND SEE  
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE FOR ME  
THEN I COULD START ALL OVER  
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE  
AND BE FREE FROM YOUR MEMORY  
I COULD BE FREE  
  
(YOU SEE) YOU'RE STILL HERE AFTER ALL THIS TIME  
AND I CAN'T ERASE YOU FROM MY MIND  
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND  
NEVER GET AROUND, BABY  
NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU
