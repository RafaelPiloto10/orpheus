You're no longer part of my life  
I must remind myself again  
Too much has happened to us to cause eachother pain  
It's over now, there's too much guilt to share  
Once there would have been a time for talking and learning  
  
There must be some other way  
To get where we have to go  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
Once it would have been so easy, to do what we have to do  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
  
Are we no more than parts in a play  
Letting other people, strangers say our lines?  
To think it should come to this, after all these years  
What was mine and what should stay behind  
Once there would have been a time of sharing, of caring  
  
There must be some other way  
To get where we have to go  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do  
(there must be some other way)  
There must be some other way  
Please show me, show me another way  
  
There's nothing much left to say  
We have said it once and said it all again  
This time we have gone too far, it could never be the same  
It's time to carry on create new lives  
Once we promised we would stay together forever  
  
There must be some other way  
To get where we have to go (there must be some other way)  
There must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
Once it would have been so easy to do what we have to do (what we have to do)  
You know there must be some other way  
Please show me another way  
You know there must be another way  
Please show me, show me another way (there must be some other way)  
You know there must be some other way
