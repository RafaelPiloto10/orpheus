One of us slipped last night  
And said "Darling"  
There in the middle of the night  
Between dream and sleep  
Did you say it or did I  
I don't know  
But it interrupted the war  
That's the way  
These cold wars are  
I love you we said  
Or one of us did  
And the other agreed  
From the heart  
  
One of us slipped last night  
And said "Sorry"  
There in the middle of the madness  
Between the dark and the light  
Who cares if all the doors had been closed  
And no love had entered for days  
Cold wars like these go up in a blaze  
I love you we said  
Or one of us did  
And the other agreed  
From the heart  
through the haze of the dream  
The truth could come through  
You can see that I'm still  
Open to you  
I love you  
I love you we said from the heart
