You got lines guaranteed to please  
You got stories you got boyfriends to tease  
Money to burn  
You got everythin' you need  
Clever girl, never girl  
  
Talkin' 'bout love  
  
Rio de Janeiro on your daddy's card  
Party invitations you don't find it hard  
Lovers to burn  
Matches in your book  
Cruiser girl, user girl  
  
Talkin' 'bout love, talkin' 'bout love  
Talkin' 'bout you and me  
Talkin' 'bout love, talkin' 'bout love  
  
That's what you get  
When your heart's on fire for me  
That's what you get  
When your love's for hire  
  
Penthouse suite  
Dance and never stop  
What's the matter  
Don't 'cha want to be on top  
Nothin' to learn  
Everythin' to lose  
Lover girl, cover girl.
