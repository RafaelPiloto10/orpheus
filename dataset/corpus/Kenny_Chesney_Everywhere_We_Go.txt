I just found this old picture in my wallet  
Of you and me, down in Mexico  
Just look at us there on that beach, on that blanket  
That look on our face says all that you need to know  
  
Seems like everywhere we go baby, love goes  
Everywhere, every time our hearts meet, love is all around us  
Every road we take, darlin' love takes  
Every turn, livin' right inside us  
I believe love goes  
Everywhere we go  
  
Sometimes I dream, we're alone on an island  
Nowhere to go, we don't want to leave  
All we have is a world full of time  
We spend it all on you and me  
It's all we need  
  
Seems like everywhere we go baby, love goes  
Everywhere, every time our hearts meet, love is all around us  
Every road we take, darlin' love takes  
Every turn, livin' right inside us  
I believe love goes  
Everywhere we go  
  
I'm so alive when I'm near you  
This fire in my heart lights my world when I'm with you  
  
Every road we take, darlin' love takes  
Every turn, livin' right inside us  
I believe love goes  
Everywhere we go  
  
I believe love goes, everywhere we go  
Everywhere we go
