It's really plain and easy to see  
The family grows like a fungus on a tree  
The fungus keeps growing wide and tall  
We're happy while we flourish  
And sad when we fall  
  
We're just a bunch of monkeys  
That gather around  
And you can not draw the line of  
Family ground  
Smile for the camera  
Wait for the flash  
There's always room for more  
In this family bash  
  
Would you like to be  
Would you like to be  
Would you like to be in my family picture?  
  
It's getting hard to tell who we love and hate  
I think it's time we set the record straight  
There are no papers that we ask you to sign  
You don't need to stand in a waiting line  
  
The lens is in focus  
We're ready to go  
The joint'll be jumpin' come rain or snow  
So hold onto your honey  
And drink up your booze  
Just hop into the picture  
You've got nothing to lose
