Well sometimes the sun shines on  
Other people's houses and not mine.  
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray  
And it takes away my summertime.  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,  
While I struggle to get mine.  
If there's a light in everybody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine.  
  
I want to walk the same roads as everybody else, Through the trees and past
the gates.  
Getting high on heavenly breezes,  
Making new friends along the way.  
I won't ask much of nobody,  
I'm just here to sing along.  
And make my mistakes looks gracious,  
And learn some lessons from my wrongs.  
  
Well sometimes the sun shines on  
Other people's houses and not mine.  
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray  
And it takes away my summertime.  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,  
While I struggle to get mine.  
A little light never hurt nobody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine.  
  
Oh, if this little light of mine  
Combined with yours today,  
How many watts could we luminate?  
How many villages could we save?  
  
And my umbrella's tired of the weather,  
Wearing me down.  
Well, look at me now.  
  
You should look as good as your outlook,  
Would you mind if I took some time,  
to soak up your light, your beautiful light?  
You've got a paradise inside.  
I get hungry for love and thirsty for life,  
And much too full on the pain,  
When I look to the sky to help me  
And sometimes it looks like rain.  
  
As the sun shines on other people's houses  
And not mine,  
And the sky paints those clouds in a way  
That it takes away the summertime,  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,  
while I kindly stand by.  
If theres a light in everybody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine  
  
You're undeniably warm, you're cerulean,  
You're perfect in desire.  
Won't you hang around  
so the sun, it can shine on me,  
And the clouds they can roll away,  
And the sky can become a possibility?  
If there's a light in everybody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine
