Frosty the pervert  
In a trench coat he did go  
To a the school yard to expose his dick and balls made of snow  
  
Frosty the pervert  
All the kids he liked to watch  
His dick did grow when he packed snow  
On his cold and icy crotch  
  
There must have must have been some magic  
When he stroked his frozen meat  
Cause frosty started moaning loud  
And it began to sleet cum and white trash pussy  
  
Frosty the pervert  
Was as glad as he could get  
He threw away his corn cob pipe  
And lit a cigarette  
  
Frosty the pervert  
Didn't want to go to jail  
He began to run  
While dripping cum  
And the cops picked up his trail  
  
Down to the village  
His dick melting in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Yelling "catch me if you can."  
  
They chased him down the streets of town  
Right to a Vice Squad cop  
Who shoved a night stick right up his ass  
And frosty screamed "don't stop OOOO!"  
  
Frosty the pervert  
Was locked up that very day  
But he did not cry  
As he waved good bye knowing he'd be back someday  
  
Beating his meat  
All over the streets  
Look at frosty go  
  
Sliding his hands  
All over his glands  
His cum, as white as snow
