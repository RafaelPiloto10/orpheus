My friend and I was partyin' at the edge of town  
I saw a pretty little girl that looked up and down  
I said girl how'd ya do, I'd like to know  
Oh how'd ya do, oh how'd ya do  
Well my friend he told me I didn't have a chance  
But I knew this chick was a-ready to romance  
I said well how'd ya do, come dance with me  
Oh how'd ya do, come dance with me  
  
Well we got acquainted and we went outside  
We got in my car and we went for a ride  
I said well how'd ya do with a big embrace  
A big embrace, she slapped my face  
  
Well my friend was waitin' at the dance for me  
I turned my face so he couldn't see  
He said well how'd ya do, you're back alone  
Oh how'd ya do, I took her home  
And you were right, we had a fight  
That's all right, I did what's right  
That's all tonight
