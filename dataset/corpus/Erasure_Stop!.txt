We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again  
I've been connected to the right line  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
We'll be together again
