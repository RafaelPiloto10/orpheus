Youre standing in the blood quantum line  
With a pitcher in your hand  
Poured from your heart into your veins  
You said I am  
I am  
I am  
  
Now measure me  
Measure me  
Tell me where I stand  
Allocate my very soul  
Like you have my land  
  
Genocide  
Genocide  
  
Colonize you  
Christianize you  
Patronize you  
Advertise you  
We loved you genocide  
  
Regulate you  
Assimilate you  
Appropriate you  
We love to hate you  
  
Genocide  
(you are a man without a face)  
(youre just a number on a page)  
Genocide  
(there you are a woman without a face)  
(well just erase you)  
  
There you are a man without a face  
Youre just a number  
(youre just a number on a page)  
There you are a woman without a face  
Well just erase you  
  
Conscripted children  
Torn from truth  
To the boarding school station  
Force fed the foreign tongue of fire  
And a prison education  
Broken knowledge  
Pencil scarred  
Spit faced  
The scattered sage  
Wisdom deep within the rock  
(the wisdom deep within the rock)  
Outlives  
(outlives the pretty lies upon the page)  
  
Genocide  
(how white the snowy graves)  
How red the blood terrain  
Genocide  
(still pulsing with your dreams)  
Above that stubborn stain  
  
There you are a man without a face  
(how white the snowy graves)  
(how red the blood terrain)  
Red the blood terrain  
(still pulsing with your dreams)  
There you are a woman without a face  
(above that stubborn stain)  
Above that stubborn stain  
  
Genocide  
Genocide  
Genocide
