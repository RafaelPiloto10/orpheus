Sing a song of love to me  
As the shadows start to grow  
And I won't be sad and lonely  
Anymore  
  
'Cause if you sing a song of love to me  
I will always find a smile  
That will warm my cold cold heart  
Just for a while  
  
Songs of love  
I know so well  
I've seen some days  
And had some times  
Lucky boy I can hear you say  
You think my sun does nothing but shine  
  
Sing a song of love to me  
One more time before I go  
And I won't be sad and lonely  
No I won't be sad and lonely  
Anymore
