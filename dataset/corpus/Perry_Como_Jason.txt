This ain't for the quarterback  
Who lives upstairs in our house  
And this ain't for the princess  
Who's sleepin' down the hall  
  
This ain't for the other one  
Who looks just like her mama  
And this ain't for the baby  
Who's the cutest one of all  
  
Jason, this is my love for you  
Written down a thousand times  
Jason, like the teacher makes you do  
When you're bad and outta line  
  
I'm so glad you're mine  
  
It hurts me when they tease you  
'Cause your mind's a little slower  
I'd like to take the sadness  
And turn them into joy  
  
I watch you so hard to do  
What usually comes easy  
After all to me  
You're such a special little boy  
  
Jason, this is my love for you  
Written, written down a thousand times  
Jason, like the teacher makes you do  
When you're bad and outta line  
  
I'm so glad you're mine  
  
Jason, Jason
