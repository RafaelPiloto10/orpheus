Love is my religion, Love is my religion, Love is my religion  
I'll take you to the temple tonight  
  
All my days I've been searching, to find out what this life is worth  
Through the books and bibles of time I've made up my mind  
I don't condemn, I don't convert, this is a calling have you heard  
Bring all the lovers to the fold, cause no one is gonna lose their soul  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is my religion, Love is my religion, Love is my religion  
Hey you can take it or leave it, and you don't have to believe it  
  
I don't want to fight, hey let's go fly a kite  
There's nothing that we can't cure, and I'll keep you in my arms for sure  
So don't let nobody stop us, free spirits have to soar  
With you I share the gift, the gift that we now know oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I'm done searching now, I found out what this life is worth  
Not in the books that I find, but by searching my mind  
I don't condemn, I don't convert  
This is the calling have you heard, bring all the lovers to the fold  
No one is gonna lose their soul  
  
[Chorus]
