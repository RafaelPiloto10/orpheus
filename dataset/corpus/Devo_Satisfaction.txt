I can't get no, satisfaction  
I can't get me no, satisfaction  
And I try, and I try, and I try try-try-try-try-try try  
I can't get no, I can't get me no  
When I'm riding in my car  
And a man comes on the radio  
He's tellin' me more and more  
About some useless information  
Supposed to fire my imagination  
I can't get no, uh no no no  
Hey hey hey, that's what I say  
  
I can't get no, satisfaction  
I can't get me no, girly action  
  
And I try, and I try, and I try, try, try, try try, I can't get no, I can't
get me no  
  
When I'm watchin' my tv  
And a man comes on to tell me  
How white my shirts could me  
But he can't be a man 'cause he does not smoke  
The same cigarettes as me  
I can't get no, no, no no  
Hey, hey hey, that's what I say  
  
And when I'm flying around the world  
And I'm doin' this and I'm tryin' that  
And I'm trying to make some girl  
Tells me baby, baby, baby, baby, byby, baby, baby, better come back later next
week  
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak  
  
I can't get no
