I know I'm no angel  
Baby you're in trouble  
Since your curiosity got you head over heels over me  
Honey do you think that I'm outa my mind  
The one who's in love till she's deaf dumb and blind ain't me  
  
Want romance, think you stand a chance,  
Tell ya where to find it  
You're never gonna find it in me  
I was born to be bad  
Take the stars above, shower me with love  
Make it all too easy  
Don't have to be too easy with me  
I was born to be bad  
  
Oh get yourself together my love no need to make a scene here  
It's a beautiful habit being able to laugh at it all  
Better get away if you wanna stay  
Keep yourself from falling  
Ain't no use in falling for me  
I was born to be bad  
  
Music  
  
Want romance, think you stand a chance,  
Tell ya where to find it  
You're never gonna find it in me  
I was born to be bad  
Take the stars above, shower me with love  
Make it all too easy  
Don't have to be too easy with me  
I was born to be bad  
  
Oh get yourself together my love no need to make a scene here  
It's a beautiful habit being able to laugh at it all  
Better get away if you wanna stay  
Keep yourself from falling  
Ain't no use in falling for me  
I was born to be bad  
  
I was born to be bad  
  
I was born to be bad  
  
I was born to be...................... Bad
