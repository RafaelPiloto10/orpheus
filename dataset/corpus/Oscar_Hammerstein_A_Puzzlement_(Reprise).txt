(Prince)  
There are times I almost think  
They are not sure of what they absolutely know  
  
(Louis)  
I believe they are confused  
About conclusions they concluded long ago  
  
(Prince)  
If my father and your mother are not sure of what they absolutely know,  
Can you tell me why they fight?  
  
(Louis)  
They fight to prove that what they do not know is so!  
  
(Prince)  
Oh-hhhhh!  
Sometimes I think that people going mad  
  
(Louis)  
Ah-h-h-h-h-h!  
Sometimes I think that people [speaks]-not so bad.  
  
(Prince)  
But not matter what I think  
I must go on living life.  
And someday as a leader I must go forth,  
Be father to my children and husband to each wife  
Excetera, excetera, and so forth.  
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way,  
Everyday I try to live another day.  
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way,  
Everyday I do my best for one-more day!  
But-  
  
(Louis)
