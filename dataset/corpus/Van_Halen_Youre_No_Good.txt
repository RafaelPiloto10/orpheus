Well, I'm feelin' better now that we're through.  
Feelin' better, baby, I'm over you.  
I learned my lesson, baby.  
And it left a scar.  
But now I see how you really are.  
You're no good, no good.  
Baby, you're no good.  
No good, no good, no good.  
Baby, you're no good.  
I broke a heart, simple and true.  
Broke a heart for someone like you.  
We'll be coming back. Don't come running to me.  
I want to love you, maybe set you free.  
You're no good, no good, no good.  
Baby, you're no good.  
You're no good, no good, no good.  
Baby, you're no good.  
(Used to be, I couldn't sleep at night, baby  
Now, you go on. Do what you want to.)
