Well, I had just got out from the county prison  
Doin' ninety days for non-support  
Tried to find me an executive position  
But no matter how smooth I talked  
  
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was a genius  
The man say, "We got all that we can use."  
Now I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Working at the car wash blues  
  
Well, I should be sittin' in an air conditioned office in a swivel chair  
Talkin' some trash to the secretaries  
Sayin', "Here, now mama, come on over here."  
Instead, I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag  
  
And walkin' home in soggy old shoes  
With them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues  
You know a man of my ability  
  
He should be smokin' on a big cigar  
But till I get myself straight I guess I'll just have to wait  
In my rubber suit a-rubbin' these cars  
Well, all I can do is a shake my head  
  
You might not believe that it's true  
For workin' at this end of Niagara Falls  
Is an undiscovered Howard Hughes  
So baby, don't expect to see me  
  
With no double martini in any high-brow society news  
Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues  
So baby, don't expect to see me  
  
With no double martini in any high-brow society news  
'Cause I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues  
Yeah I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'  
Workin' at the car wash blues
