Come close to me.  
Come cross the bridge.  
I need to know what you have to say to me.  
(We've been waiting all night long.)  
What have you got to say to me?  
(We've been waiting all night long.)  
Tell me all about it.  
(We've been waiting.)  
Tell me please.  
(We've been waiting.)  
Oh, I know.  
  
I know it works for me.  
As we cross the bridge - the burning bridge  
With flames behind us,  
We front the line.  
It's you and me, baby, against the world.  
  
(We've been waiting.)  
I've got to know what you have to say.  
(We've been waiting.)  
What have you got to say?  
(We've been waiting.)  
Ooh-oh-oh,  
(We've been waiting.)  
Tell me all about it,  
(We've been...)  
All night long,  
(We've been...)  
All night long.  
(We've been...)  
  
It works for me.  
It's you and me, babe, against the world.  
All night long  
It works for me.  
Let's cross the bridge.  
Oh, I know,  
(We've been waiting.)  
I know, I know.  
(We've been...)  
It's you and me, babe.  
When you stand next to me, babe, it's all right.  
It's you and me, babe, against the world.
