Are you?  
Are you people get around?  
  
Listen  
Listen to the summer sound  
You're fine  
  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
  
Let me  
Let me take you by the hand  
To the  
To the promised wonder land  
  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want  
What you need is what you want
