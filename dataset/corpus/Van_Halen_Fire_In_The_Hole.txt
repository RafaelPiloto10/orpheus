In a word to the wisdom tooth  
To tell, or not the truth (yeah)  
So open up and say ahh-men  
Rinse cup, and spit again  
Forked tongue in double speak  
Pretty soon you just might  
Spring a leak  
Inhale before you begin  
Your iron lung's a bag of wind  
  
There's a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole  
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
Fire  
  
Sweet 'n' sour, filiblister  
Faucet pouring, fresh 'n' bitter  
Come on smile and say cheese  
On a count of three  
Ya got a mindful of decavities  
Hey!  
  
Chew your words, lest you choke  
You better watch your mouth  
Wash it out with soap. Yeah!  
Tongue tied in a tangled web  
Your bile inside better left unsaid  
  
There's a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
Fire!  
Ah, shoot it!  
  
Hey-hey-yeah!  
Huh!  
Yeah!  
Hey-hey-yeah!  
  
(hey hey hey hey hey)  
There's a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
  
There's a fire, fire, fire  
A fire!  
  
Rudder of ship, which sets the course  
Does not the bit, bridle the horse  
Great is the forest, set by a small flame  
Like a tongue on fire, no one can tame
