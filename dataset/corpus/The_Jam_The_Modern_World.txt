This is a modern world, this is the modern world  
What kind of a fool do you think I am?  
You think I know nothing of the modern world  
All my life has been the same  
I've learned to live by hate and pain  
It's my inspiration drive  
I've learned more than you'll ever know  
Even at school I felt quite sure  
That one day I would be on top  
And I'd look down upon the map  
  
The teachers who said I'd be nothing  
This is the modern world that I've learnt about  
This is the modern world, we don't need no one  
To tell us what's right or wrong  
Say what you like 'cause I don't care  
I know where I am and going too  
It's somewhere I won't preview  
Don't have to explain myself to you  
I don't give two fucks about your review
