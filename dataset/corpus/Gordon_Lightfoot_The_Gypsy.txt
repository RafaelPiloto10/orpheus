Step inside my tent, said she, "I'd like to read you palm"  
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long  
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind  
I'll tell you, if you should quit now or if you should go on  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake  
She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date  
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise  
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot  
You were told when you should speak and when you should not  
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night  
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake  
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said  
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get  
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read  
Then I said, "Now what do ya see?"  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
Where'll I go, what'll I be  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, "Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee"
