With Rita Coolidge  
  
I see you every day  
Walking down the avenue  
I'd like to get to know you  
But all I do is smile at you  
  
Oh, baby  
When it comes to talking  
My tongue gets so tight  
This sidewalk love affair  
Has got me high as a kite  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Well, I'm a slow walker  
But, girl, I'd race a mile for you  
Just to get there in time  
For my peek-a-boo rendezvous  
  
Well, maybe it's the way you  
Wear you're blue jeans so tight  
I can't put my finger on  
What you're doing right  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Well, I'm standing on a corner  
Smiling by a telephone  
I'd just love to check you over  
Get to know you like  
A fine tooth comb  
  
Oh, now when I go home  
I turn out the light  
And you come strolling through  
My dreams every night  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like
