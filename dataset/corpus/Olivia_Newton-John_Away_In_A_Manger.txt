Away in a manger, no cry for a bed  
The little load jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky, look down where he lay  
The little load jesus, asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes  
But little load jesaus, no crying he makes  
I love thee load jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my side until morning is nigh  
  
Be near me, load jesus, I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care  
And take us to heaven, to live with thee there  
  
And takes us to heaven, to live with thee there
