Brother don't lose that fire-stick no way  
The night is coming thin  
Might tire to light that stick  
Brother don't lose that stick no way  
  
Don't lose that heating fork no way  
Dark (? ? ? )'s coming down  
Need someone to eat off the ground  
Need something to eat (? ? ? ) today  
  
Brother don't lose your bares no way  
Don't know which side we're on  
Blue then it's green then it's brown  
Mine's hard and it's red and it's coming my way  
  
We all be together  
And we all turn the same land  
And if the man can't be the child  
Then the devil will take the man  
  
Get you behind me quick  
Hey brother don't lose that stick  
Need something to light my way today  
  
Brother don't start no slowing down today  
Come here with your big ideas  
Shooting inbetween your ears  
Come here with your big ideas today
