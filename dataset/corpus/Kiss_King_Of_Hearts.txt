She was just 19, but in here eyes she was old enough to know  
We were caught between two city streets, like a bad dream  
We could barely survive in the world outside, where the writin's on the wall  
Still she lets me know, we just can't let go, and she takes my heart away  
  
When she tells me I want it, I go crazy, I need it  
When she touches I feel it, right there in her eyes  
I'm the King of Hearts, livin' in a fantasy  
The King of Hearts, when she's layin' next to me  
Shinin' like a jewel tonight, love is gonna rule tonight  
Yeah I'm gonna be the only one, to be King of Hearts  
  
Like a neon light, the shadows flash across my empty room  
We could leave tonight and save ourselves from a bad scene  
When we walk on by with our heads up high, all the faces turn our way  
Yeah it's in their eyes, and they realize, we can make our getaway  
  
When she tells me I want it, I go crazy, I need it  
When she touches I feel it, right there in her eyes  
I'm the King of Hearts, livin' in a fantasy  
The King of Hearts, when she's layin' next to me  
Shinin' like a jewel tonight, love is gonna rule tonight  
Yeah I'm gonna be the only one, to be King of Hearts
