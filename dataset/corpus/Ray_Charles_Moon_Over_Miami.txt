Moon over Miami,  
Shine on my love and me,  
So we can stroll beside the roll,  
Of the rolling sea.  
  
Moon over miami,  
Shine on as we begin,  
A dream or two that may come true,  
When the tide comes in.  
  
Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours,  
Hark to the throbbing guitars,  
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause,  
After each song to the stars.  
  
Moon over Miami,  
You know we're waiting for,  
A little love,  
A little kiss  
  
On Miami shore.
