As I look out tonight, up at your silver light  
You are the one I'm counting on...  
Christmas star, so warm and wise there,  
Can you please tell me,  
Where she's gone.  
  
She was my stare this eve,  
A very breath of me.  
How could I let her walk away  
Christmas star, tell her I'm sorry,  
Hope to guide her journey home this day.  
  
(Christmas star)  
If she could just hear me now,  
If I could just tell her I care  
And hold her again in my arms.  
(Christmas star)  
Can you see from your sky above  
If she's falling in love or dreaming her dream,  
Felling lonesome like me.  
  
I should be strong, I know.  
Should try and let her go  
But I'd give my life if I could just believe  
You'll be sending my love back home, this Christmas  
Eve.  
  
(Christmas star)  
If she could just hear me now  
If I could just tell her I care  
And hold her again in my arms.  
(Christmas star)  
I would kiss away all these lies  
She would know from my eyes just how precious we were,  
  
If only I could reach her.  
  
And so old friend up there  
If you can hear my prayer  
Won't you try and help this lonely man believe,  
You'll be sending my love back home, this Christmas  
Eve.  
  
(Christmas star...)  
(Christmas star...)  
So warm and wise there  
(Christmas star...)  
If I could just tell her I'm sorry  
(Christmas star...)  
Then maybe she'll run to my side  
  
(Christmas star...)  
Hoh... Oh...  
If she could just hear me now  
Oh... How could I ever let her walk away  
Where is she gone?  
Where is she tonight?  
I need her home to stay  
Yeah...  
  
I'd give her the love she needs, the dreams...  
All to grab her in my arms again,  
I'd give my life, my soul,  
My heart is breaking, please send her home  
Send her home to me, this day.  
  
It ain't christmas without her.  
And without her,  
It could never be christmas again...
