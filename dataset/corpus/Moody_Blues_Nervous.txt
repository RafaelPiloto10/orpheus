Just in a simple conversation  
You can hear the feeling change  
Down to the sea  
And if you need an explanation  
I defy you to explain  
Why I am so nervous  
Please explain to me  
Why I can't sleep  
I close my eyes to shelter  
In the dark I try to hide  
If you leave me on my own  
I'm worried I could lose my way  
In my mind confusion  
I see you everywhere  
But we don't speak  
I try so hard to touch you  
But you're always out of reach  
If you walked right by  
Would I see in it your eye  
Would you turn away  
Seems to me  
I've been a long time  
On this road  
Has there been a sign  
Another way  
And I've passed it by  
I don't know what it is that drives me on  
Gotta keep movin'  
Gotta keep movin' on  
Bring it on home  
Let's bring it on home - your love  
Bring it on home  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Down parallel lines  
Don't question faith  
Don't answer lies  
Tell me why I'm nervous  
Please explain to me  
Why I can't sleep  
Please explain to me  
Why you're always out of reach  
If the water ran dry  
Would I see it in your eye  
Would you walk away  
It seems to me I've been a long time on this road  
And I wonder why  
Has there been a sign that points another way  
And I've passed it by  
I don't know what it is that drives me on  
Gotta keep movin'  
Gotta keep movin' on  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Down parallel lines  
Don't question faith  
Don't answer lies  
You know you gotta keep movin'  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love
