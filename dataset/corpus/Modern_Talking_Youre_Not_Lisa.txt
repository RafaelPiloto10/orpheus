You remind me can't you see  
Of a girl just memories,  
A flickering of your eyes tonight  
I see her in the light  
  
Something happened on the way  
To heaven, but I just can't say,  
Oh why she had to go away,  
Baby come what may  
  
You're not Lisa, oh I know  
She's in heaven, had to go  
You're not Lisa, that's no lie  
I will see her, in paradise  
  
If there's a god somewhere  
Oh do you think it's really fair, oh she was only 23  
Give her back to me  
How could I forget the time  
  
We were together, she was mine  
Oh anytime and anywhere,  
I wish she could be there
