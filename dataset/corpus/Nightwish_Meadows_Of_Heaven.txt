I close my eyes, the lantern dies  
The scent of awakening, wild honey and dew  
Childhood games, woods and lakes  
Streams of silver, toys of olden days  
  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
  
Lands of wonder and of hidden treasures  
In the meadow of life, my acre of Heaven  
A five-year-old winter heart in a place called home  
Sailing the waves of past  
  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
  
Rocking chair without a dreamer  
A wood and a spring without laughter?  
Sandbox without toy soldiers  
Yuletide without the flight  
Dream down for her  
  
Flowers wither, treasures stay hidden  
Until I see the first star-fall  
I fall asleep and see it all  
Mother care and colour of the kites  
  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven  
Meadows of Heaven
