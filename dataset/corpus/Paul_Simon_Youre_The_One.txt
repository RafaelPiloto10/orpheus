May twelve angels guard you  
While you sleep  
Maybe that's a waste of angels I don't know  
I'd do anything to keep you safe  
From the danger that surrounds us  
  
Little by little  
Bit by bit  
Little bit by little bit  
Now you got it that's it  
What're you thinking  
Things'll go sour?  
Check its temperature every hour  
Nervous when you own it  
Nervous when it's gone  
What do you think has been going on  
For so long?  
  
You are the air  
Inside my chest  
  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
You're the one  
  
But when I hear it from the other side  
It's a completely different song  
I'm the one who made you cry  
And I'm the one who's wrong  
In my dream you spoke to me  
And you said  
  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
You're the one  
  
Nature gives us shapeless shapes  
Clouds and waves and flame  
But human expectation  
Is that love remains the same  
And when it doesn't  
We point our fingers  
And blame blame blame  
  
You're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
And I'm the one  
I broke your heart  
I made you cry  
And you're the one  
You broke my heart  
You made me cry  
We're the ones
