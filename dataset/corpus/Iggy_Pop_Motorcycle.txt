I saw her in a dream but it wasn't true  
Through the smoke and fire  
Of the exhaust fumes  
She just laughed and loved me 'till I was no use  
And I'll never fall in love again  
She's a motorcycle that I can't ride  
She's a precious jewel that I can't buy  
She's a scene I'm playin' in which I die  
And I'll never fall in love again  
"I never play to win"  
Is what she said  
And poured a little cocaine in my head  
She's a fuckin' Picasso in bed  
And I'll never fall in love again  
  
Now your voice  
So Spanish and clear  
Rings like a church bell in my ear  
But I don't believe in a word I hear  
And I'll never fall in love again  
My mind calls you in the night  
My mind calls you and I want to take flight  
To some other garden of sweet delight  
And I'll never fall in love again
