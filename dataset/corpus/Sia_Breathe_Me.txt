Help, I have done it again  
I have been here many times before  
Hurt myself again today  
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Be my friend, hold me  
Wrap me up, unfold me  
I am small, and needy  
Warm me up, and breathe me  
  
Ouch, I have lost myself again  
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found,  
Yeah I think that I might break  
Lost myself again, and I feel unsafe  
  
[Chorus: x2]
