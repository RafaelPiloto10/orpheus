[Verse 1]  
On the first day of Christmas  
When you gave me all them kisses  
Boy, you showed me things  
Come hold me please, and never let me go  
On the second day of Christmas  
Said you felt like something's missing  
So you promised me  
That promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
On the third day of Christmas  
We got all in our feelings, said I love you and meant it, oh  
On the fourth we committed  
Any time, he could get it, he's the real one, I know it  
  
[Chorus]  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love, my true love  
You are my true love  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love, my true love  
You are my true love  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh, ah, ah)  
You are my true love  
  
[Verse 2]  
On the fifth day of Christmas  
You asked me what's on my wishlist  
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo  
After six days in your arms  
I got that tattoo on my heart  
Cause I'm your moonlight  
You're my star and nothing's shining more than you boy  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
You completed the vision  
Now I feel like I'm living, you're so one in a million, oh  
I'm so glad we committed  
Any time, he could get it, he's the real one, I know it  
  
[Chorus]  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love  
You are my true love  
You are my true love  
Look at all the things my true love gave to me  
My true love, my true love  
You are my true love  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh-oh, ah, ah)  
You are my true love
