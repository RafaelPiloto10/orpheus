Johnny grew up  
On the dark side of the law  
Livin' in the shadow  
Of the light he never saw  
Rosie came 'round  
In the way that true love does  
Just when you're lookin' elsewhere  
For the thing that never was  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
So they team up  
And they traveled on their way  
Lookin' for forever  
For every yesterday  
She brings him hope  
In the way that Angels do  
Takin' him to heaven  
In ways he never knew  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Every so often  
He gets a stray look in his eye  
She knows how to hold him  
Without ever askin' why  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love  
Wild as the wind  
Wild as the wind is  
Wild as the wind is love
