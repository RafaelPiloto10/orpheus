I'm questioning my education  
Is my education who I am now?  
While you're deciding, I've been finding  
Looking around in the here and now  
  
If I've been taught from the beginning  
Would my fears now by winning?  
I'm questioning my own equation  
Is my own equation relevant somehow?  
  
The flags are waving, the news is breaking  
See the man who can't pick out his own tie  
If I've been taught from the beginning  
Would my fears now be winning?  
  
A wild world, figuring out the answers  
I'll be in my own dance and iiii...  
I'm questioning my education  
Rewind and what does it show?  
  
Could be, the truth it becomes you  
I'm a seed, wondering why it grows...
