I like Charlie Daniels and  
I love big John Cash  
And I think Waylon "Woktosha" Jennings  
Is a table thumpin' smash  
Playin' with Marshall Tucker Band  
Was as good as smokin' grass  
But if you don't like Hank Williams  
You can kiss our ass  
  
Cause I think what they done  
Is well worth doin'  
And their doin' it the  
Best way that they can  
Oh you're the only one  
That you are screwin'  
When you put down what  
You don't understand  
  
I love all them Allman Brothers,  
Merle Haggard, and George Jones  
Shotgun Willie Nelson and them  
Rockin' rollin' Stones  
Everything the Eagles do  
And I'm in love with Linda Rondstat  
Anybody that don't like Hank Williams  
You can kiss our ass  
  
Cause I think what they done  
Is well worth doin'  
And their doin' it the  
Best way that they can  
Oh you're the only one  
That you are screwin'  
When you put down what  
You don't understand  
  
I ain't sayin' that he was  
The first or the last  
But if you don't like Hank Williams  
You can kiss our ass
