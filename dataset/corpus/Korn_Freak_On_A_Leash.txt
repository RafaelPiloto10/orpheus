Something takes a part of me  
Something lost and never seen  
Every time I start to believe  
Something's raped and taken from me from me  
Life's gotta always be messing with me (You wanna see the light)  
Can't they chill and let me be free (So do I)  
Can't I take away all this pain (You wanna see the light)  
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain  
  
Sometimes I cannot take this place  
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste  
Sometimes I cannot feel my face  
You'll never see me fall from grace  
  
Something takes a part of me  
You and I were meant to be  
A cheap fuck for me to lay  
Something takes a part of me  
  
Feeling like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)  
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)  
How many times have I felt diseased (You wanna see the light)  
Nothing in my life is free, is free  
  
Sometimes I cannot take this place  
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste  
Sometimes I cannot feel my face  
You'll never see me fall from grace  
  
Something takes a part of me  
You and I were meant to be  
A cheap fuck for me to lay  
Something takes a part of me

Something takes a part of me  
You and I were meant to be  
A cheap fuck for me to lay  
Something takes a part of me  
Part of me  
Part of me  
Part of me
