The clock is a ring on her finger  
That she checks  
When she's out of time  
The cigarette's a spike  
In the spur of the moment  
Digging in her side  
She cuts the paper with nails  
And her pen is bleeding poetry  
Nervous from the sex that she got  
And the wine that she spilled  
On her clean, white, white sheets  
Like to see you, baby,  
All torn up inside  
Girl you're dead already  
So just let your ego die  
Girl you're dead already  
So just let your ego die  
Die, die, die
