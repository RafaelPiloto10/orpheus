The boy could play before he learned to grow  
Worked in a band who had no name at all  
Every mornin' at the break of dawn  
You could see him draggin' home his drums  
I was vaccinated with a victrolla needle  
And I'm hooked on rock and roll  
  
They called the family doctor to see what he could do  
Doc said "No you can't cure his soul  
Once he's infected with the blues"  
So I travelled 'round from town to town singin' out the news  
  
I was vaccinated with a little needle  
And I'm hooked on rock and roll  
  
When you find you got no mind  
To work from nine to five  
Find the back beat, set your heart free  
And feel that music runnin' through your feet  
  
Mama told me long ago  
"Ain't no future in that rock 'n' roll"  
And I said "Hey mama, it's burnin' hot inside my soul"  
  
It's like a fever that won't cool down  
I've been addicted since I heard that sound  
  
I was vaccinated with a little needle  
And I'm hooked on rock and roll  
  
When you find you got no mind (bop shoo bop, bop bop shoo bop)  
To work from nine to five  
Find the back beat, set your heart free  
(Bop shoo bop, bop bop shoo bop)  
And feel the music runnin' through your feet  
  
Mama told me long ago  
"Ain't no future in that rock 'n' roll"  
And I said "Hey mama, it's burnin' hot inside me soul"  
  
It's like a fever that won't cool down  
I've been addicted since I heard that sound  
  
I was vaccinated with a little needle  
And I'm hooked on rock and roll, yeah  
Hooked on rock and roll  
(I've been addicted since I heard that sound)  
Hooked on rock and roll  
Hooked on rock and roll  
(It's like a fever that won't cool down)  
Hooked on rock and roll, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Hooked on rock and roll  
(It's burnin, burnin, burnin in my soul)  
Hooked on rock and roll  
Hooked on rock and roll  
(I've been addicted since I heard that sound)  
Hooked on rock and roll  
Hooked on rock and roll  
Hooked on rock and roll  
Hooked on
