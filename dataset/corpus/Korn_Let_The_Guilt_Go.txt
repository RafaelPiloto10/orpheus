All the lying and cheating will surely bite you  
Dishonesty tears you apart and will eat you  
All the anger and pain and the suffering and the shame  
And the voices in your brain will surely haunt you  
  
Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through  
  
All the anger, the pain and the suffering, and the shame  
And the voices in your brain will really haunt you  
  
Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through  
  
Now we waste our lives away  
Letting guilt lead the way  
  
I'm such a stupid fuck  
Listening to my head and not my gut  
Constantly thinking and thinking and thinking  
And thinking and thinking and thinking  
  
Now we waste our lives away  
Letting guilt lead the way  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through
