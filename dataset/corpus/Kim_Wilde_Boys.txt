Fresh out of school the young girl lose the sound  
She's gonna go where the young bands hang around  
And it's still to right with a voice inside  
She's screaming, dreaming  
And there's no disguise when you look in her eyes she's scheming  
  
I'm thinking about the boys  
She's thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
  
There in the dark he starts to touch her hair  
Others go round but right now you don't care  
Well you just don't fight when they're holding you tight  
That feeling, feeling  
Well it looks to good and he's making it so appealing  
  
I'm thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
  
Still feeling ground as she goes to make the kill  
Watching her move the world is standing still  
'cause its still too right with a voice inside  
You screaming, dreaming  
And there's no disguise when you look in their eyes she's scheming  
  
I'm thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys
