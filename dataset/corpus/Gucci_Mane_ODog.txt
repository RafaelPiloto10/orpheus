I'mma thug.  
Even though I wan' change my life then get it right  
City judge, I'm always gonna be a thug.  
Like hold on, many of society that wanna see me underground.  
But I just bought a plane  
Sky is the limit (sky)  
My judge just took off the round now,  
Ain't nobody gonna stop my destiny (destiny).  
Ladies like, pop a bottle now ("it's gucci")  
'Cause their man just came home now,  
Doing time in the penitentiary.  
(Gucci "yeah")  
And if come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion,  
Lemme see you put your hands up  
(Gucci "put your hands up")
