I will always love you  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Two words collide  
Before we knew what was happening  
Love crashed into our lives  
So helplessly we fell so hard  
Guess something had to break  
We made our first mistake  
We thought we'd found the answer over night  
To all the problems that were in our lives  
And now I feel the tears  
And not a minute passes by  
When I don't wish  
That you were near  
Time will never mend (oh no)  
This broken heart  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Pain that never ends (oh oh)  
You can be sure  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
When you hear my name  
Tell me how do you fell  
Is it just like me  
My heart fills up with pain  
Just the mention of you makes me fall apart  
But where is there to start  
You sais we missed our chance and it's too late  
But I believe there's one more chance to take  
I know we said goodbye  
But I still can't let go  
Please give us one more try  
Time will never mend (oh no)  
This broken heart  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Pain that never ends (oh oh)  
You can be sure  
Now and forever  
I will always love you  
Think again before you walk away  
There's so many reasons you should stay  
It's our destiny  
It how it's got to be  
Just you and me  
No matter where you go  
No matter what you do  
You know I'm gonna be right here for you  
I will always love you  
Giving you my heart  
Giving you my soul  
Never ever gonna let you go  
I will always love you
