A church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
"You can burn down my churches but I shall be free."  
  
Three hooded men through the back road did creep  
Torches in their hands while the village lies asleep  
Down to the church where just hours before  
Voices were singing and hands were beating  
And saying I won't be a slave any more.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
"You can burn down my churches but I shall be free."  
  
Three hooded men, their hands lit the spark  
Then they faded in the night and they vanished in the dark  
And in the cold light of morning there's nothing that remains  
But the ashes of a bible and can of kerosene.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
"You can burn down my churches but I shall be free."  
  
A church is more than just timber and stone  
And freedom is a dark road when you're walking it alone  
But the future is now, and it's time to take a stand  
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
"You can burn down our churches but I shall be free."
