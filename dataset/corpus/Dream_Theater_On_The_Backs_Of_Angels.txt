Standing on the backs of angels  
Destined to create  
Mounting the attack  
While heroes carry your weight  
  
We spiral towards disaster  
Survival fading faster  
  
Riding out the wave  
Content to feed off the machine  
Bleeding us to death  
The new American dream  
  
You're blinded by your hunger  
Beware your days are numbered  
  
Tears fall from the shameless  
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter  
Blurring lines drawn in between  
What is right and what is wrong  
Victims on the radar string us along  
  
We're on to your agenda  
The dead end road to nowhere  
  
Tears fall from the shameless  
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter  
  
Tears fall from the shameless  
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
