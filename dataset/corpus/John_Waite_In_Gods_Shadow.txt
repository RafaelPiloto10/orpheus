We speak out like children  
Of the dreams that we chase and pursue  
These rights we hold precious  
Say it loud enough  
And it'll be true  
In the company of strangers  
Wild conversation  
And the hours go by so fast  
And you find a lot of wisdom there  
At the bottom of the glass  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
We speak revolution  
But the future's already been sold  
The masters of diffusion  
Spinning their fine webs into gold  
And the party's just begun  
This matter of resistance  
Our ship was built to last  
We're sailing out on troubled seas  
Nail your colors to the mast  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
The avenue is so crowded  
And they're turning up the heat  
And the red lights keep on flashing  
Out there tonight on Bourbon Street  
On Bourbon Street  
Wild conversation  
And the hours go by so fast  
And you find a lot of wisdom there  
At the bottom of the glass  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
But when the lights go down  
And the laughter fades away  
Somewhere beneath the moon and stars  
All of life certainties they  
They all just slip away  
And you lie down in God's shadow  
At the end  
The end of the day  
The end of the day  
The end of the day  
The end of the day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Lay down your soul with me  
Lay down your soul tonight  
Lay down your soul with me  
And everything will be alright  
It'll be alright
