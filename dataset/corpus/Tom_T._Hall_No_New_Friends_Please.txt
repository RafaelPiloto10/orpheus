I'd like to be your friend but think of all the friends I've been  
I never thought there'd come a day I never thought I'd hear me say  
I'd disappoint you in the end no new friends please no new friends for me  
Memories of old acquaintances keep on coming back  
Some I met at garden parties buddies by the railroad track  
I'd like to be your friend  
  
What we are is self-appointed there's nothing we can do  
We'd lose touch with one another and that ain't fair to me or you  
I'd like to be your friend
