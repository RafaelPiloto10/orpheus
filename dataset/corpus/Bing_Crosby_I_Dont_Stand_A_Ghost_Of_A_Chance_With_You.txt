Why did you let me love you?  
Why did you let me fall?  
Why should it be when it's plain to see  
That you can't see me at all?  
  
I need your love so badly  
I love you, oh, so madly  
But I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
I thought at last I'd found you  
But other loves surround you  
And I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender just for a tender  
Kiss or two  
You might discover that I'm the lover  
Meant for you, I'd be true  
  
But what's the good of scheming  
I know, I must be dreaming  
For I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
And I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you  
  
If you'd surrender just for a tender  
Kiss or two  
You might discover that I'm the lover  
Meant for you, I'd be true  
  
But what's the good of scheming  
I know, I must be dreaming  
For I don't stand  
A ghost of a chance with you
