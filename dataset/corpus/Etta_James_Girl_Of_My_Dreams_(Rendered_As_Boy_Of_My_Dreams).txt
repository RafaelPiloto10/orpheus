Boy of my dreams, I love you  
Ohh, honest I do  
Don't you know that you are so sweet?  
  
Ohh, if I could just hold your charms  
Ohh, here in my arms  
Boy of my dreams, don't you know it's you?  
  
Since you've been gone, ohh  
Life, it don't mean a thing  
Please, please, please come back to me  
Ohh, ohh  
  
Ohh, if I could just hold your charms  
Ohh, here in my arms  
Boy of, of my dreams, don't you know it's you?  
  
Ohh, since you, since you've been gone, ohh  
Life don't mean a thing  
Please, please, please come back to me  
Ohh, ohh  
  
Ohh, if I could just, just hold your charms  
Ohh, here in my empty arms  
Boy of my dreams, don't you know it's you?  
Ohh  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Nobody, nobody, nobody but you
