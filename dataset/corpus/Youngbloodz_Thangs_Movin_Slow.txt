Yeah, Attic Crew, Attic Crew and Cooley see my nigga  
Yeah, yeah, my nigga, its Attic Crew and Cooley see my nigga  
Yeah, Youngbloodz, Youngbloodz and Cooley see my nigga  
Um, Mark Twayne  
Now it's time to let y'all nigga know about me  
Oh I can get mo money, mo money, don't come to me  
And everything I say that be on the blow  
Rap for the love of money, stack it up once mo'  
Going once, going twice, got the O for the LOW  
Got my cheese in the soil, tryin' to make my flow grow  
Hell no, never fall off  
Slip pimpin', you can get it hard or get it soft  
All day, round the clock tryin' to get it in  
I ain't worried bout' the rich, cause I'm in the wind  
All I got is my folks, Lord forgive me for my sins  
And if this ain't for me, please make me thank again  
Gotta get my shit right, tight like these gurls draws  
Let me recognize the game, and all the flaws  
While I'm out here, please let me come up  
And watch my every step so I don't have to duck  
Never wanted this, damn how a nigga stuck?  
Hit me on the hill nigga, I'm a' sack it up  
Rabbit on my head all day for good luck  
On the hustle everyday, but who really gives a fuck  
hook  
So what you got, when you ain't got nothing to show  
Thangs movin' slow, can't get your hands on no blow  
Ain't got no flow, naw, need some quick cash  
If hustlin' is the answer nigga, get up off your ass  
I walk about the crib, with my mind on the dough  
Been hustlin' these verses, ain't got a damn thang to show  
I keep my head up, because I feel it's bout to pop  
Done heard about a deal going down at the dock  
Critics say it don't stop, til' you get it and it's gone  
It's all about the fett', set it off, get it crunk  
You catch me on the corner, I'll be buddy with the sacks  
Off in the studio it be Twayne with the tracks  
Fire, fire, like that dope gettin' smoked everyday  
Got a call from my source, he on the way with the llell' (yeah)  
Coming in from overseas, bout' 82 ki's  
Not a word to be said, everybody hit your knees, lets leave  
Get the cheese, make away with the blow  
Slip in the door, right before we do the show  
Mr. Dope Man, your looking kinda sick  
Thangs movin' slow now that you ain't got shit  
hook  
So what you got now, you out of luck  
Sellin' your soul to the devil, just to make a quicker buck  
But for what, you took a chance, receiving half of some blow  
And pushing them quarter ki's underground to keep the flow  
It's toe to toe, we can take it to the deepest of the seas  
And anybody else who want to bite, then try a piece  
Of these Youngbloodz, bustin' 30 slugs, so just perhaps  
You crawlin' out of a shell  
Finding ways up out these traps  
Like craps, you out to gamble, losing everything you own  
And still like to pretend as if this game gonna keep em' known  
And do know, you in a ball of burning hell  
So might as well take a ride on the weed into the A-T-L  
And niggas swear we outdone and out-gunned  
So what's the first attempt when they got you on the run  
With fun, they shootin' tons of shots, so whose to blame  
Nobody but yourself as you hold inside the pain  
hook
