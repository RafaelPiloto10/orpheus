I hope it's not too late  
Just to say that I'm sorry, honey  
All I want to do  
Is just finish what we started, baby  
  
Let's turn over a new leave  
And baby let's make promises  
That we can keep  
And call it a New Year's resolution, hmmm  
  
Oh, I'm a woman  
And woman makes mistakes too  
But will you, will you forget the changes  
That I put you through  
  
let's try it again  
Just you and me  
And, baby, let's see how happy honey, yeah  
That we can be  
And call it a New Year's resolution, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Many times we had our ups and downs  
And times you needed me I couldn't be found  
I'm sorry  
And I'm sorry too  
I'll never, never do it again, no, no, no  
So baby before we fall out  
Let's fall on in, yeah, yeah  
Oh, and we're gonna try harder  
Not to hurt each other again, oh  
Love me baby, huh  
Week after week  
And baby let's make promises  
That we can keep  
And call it a New Year's resolution, yeah, oh

I'm gonna keep my promises  
I'm gonna hold on that we can do it, baby
