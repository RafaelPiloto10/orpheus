Yesterday I saw my love light shine  
Straight ahead in front of me  
You never really know  
When love will come or go  
But yesterday I was alone  
Suddenly I walked you home  
I never really knew  
What love could make me do  
I'll send the message in a bottle  
Trust in the mercy of the sea  
Stormy weather, oh yeah  
Waitin' for love to set me free  
Everyday I watch the tide roll in  
Stay until it rolls away  
Though nothing's on the shore  
I'm running back for more  
I'll send the message in a bottle  
Play for the mercy of the sea  
Stormy weather, oh yeah  
Waitin' for love to rescue me  
Feels so good, feels so nice  
When love comes around  
I feel good, so good, so good, so good  
It feels so nice, so nice  
Feels so good  
  
Feels so good  
Feels so nice  
When love comes around  
I feel good  
Gonna make her feel nice  
When love comes around  
I feel good  
So good, so good, so good  
Come on, baby  
Make me feel good
