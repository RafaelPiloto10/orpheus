All change on then merry go line  
Everybody looking for a sign  
Jumping up and down when the switch goes on  
Nobody knows where it's coming from  
  
I'm here watching, keeping well away  
Oh I'm gonna live it in my own way  
Singing no mister, not me  
I'm staying here with guys on free  
In deep water  
  
I see a captain on a distant shore  
He's got a dream, he wants to make it law  
He's got my number, he's got a plan  
He try to get you any way he can  
Wants to own everything he sees  
While I'm here, well he ain't with me  
Singing no mister, no way  
I got my own deep water  
Deep, deep water
