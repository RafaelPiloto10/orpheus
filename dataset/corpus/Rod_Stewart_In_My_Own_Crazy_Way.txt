The mystery of you and me  
Is colored blue on blue  
We wanted more than we could give  
We couldn't see it through  
  
You won't believe these words from me  
But still they're mine to say  
I will always love you  
In my own crazy way  
I tried to keep my sanity  
  
By being someone else  
Someone that you could hold on to  
I only fooled myself  
I knew the part, but in my heart  
The role I couldn't play  
  
But I will always love you  
In my own crazy way  
I know I didn't do the little things  
That could make a woman's heart sing forgive me  
And darling if I brought you any pain  
I'm trying to explain  
  
In my heart, I was always true  
The memories of you and me  
Are written on the wind  
And sometimes, girl, I'd give the world  
To do it all again  
  
And if you need to call me  
I won't be far away  
I will always love you  
In my own crazy way
