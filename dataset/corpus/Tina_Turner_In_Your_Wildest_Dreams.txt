The sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
My heart is pumping for you  
And a mad thing starts  
Ooooohhh-oooooohhh  
  
Never in you wildest dreams  
Did you ever get this feeling  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Could it ever be this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  
  
The night is hot outside your window  
I hear people walking people talking  
I smell your skin I feel you breathing  
Don't let me go not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Could you ever get this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Did it ever get this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  
  
And the world is slowly turning  
As it turns I see your face  
Touch your eyes, your lips. . .space  
  
We've arrived at the place  
Where they open hearts  
And fill them up with love  
Filled with love filled with love  
This on is pumping for you  
As a mad thing starts  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Did you ever get this feeling  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Could it ever be this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams
