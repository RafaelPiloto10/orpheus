In time this fire will turn to ashes  
The sun will fall out the sky  
Still you see no urgency  
To spend some time with me  
Time with me  
  
I can't believe you haven't noticed  
Just how long I've been waitin' for you  
I've been such a patient man  
But I still don't understand  
You won't  
  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance to show how much I care  
How I care  
  
It's hard to know just what you're thinkin'  
You cloak yourself in mystery  
Conversations always brief  
Like a sigh with no relief  
You won't  
  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance to show how much I care  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
if you dare  
  
You gotta give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance to show how much I care  
Give me a chance to show how much I love you  
Give me a chance
