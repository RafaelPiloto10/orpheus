I was young and not deceived then  
I believed in the heart of the country  
How the words sound, how the truth lies  
I was moved by the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, then I saw through  
The charade, the facade,  
Now I've had it all  
When they ask you who deprives you  
You reply your heart of the country  
I am older, I am wiser  
I despise the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, then I felt it  
All the tears and the grief  
I believed it all  
Taking bad times, by the handful  
Do what you can for the heart of the country  
They dish the dirt out too hard to swallow  
Just to follow the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, heed the words  
And learn the lines  
I'll be fine when I have it all
