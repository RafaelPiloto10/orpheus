When I asked you if everything is alright  
You whisper "Don't worry" and you shut out the light  
Now black is black in this bed we're laying  
And I want to believe the words that you're saying  
  
[Chorus]  
But your eyes look like a leavin' train  
They keep on dragging me down  
Your eyes look like a leavin' train  
They keep on draggin'  
They keep on draggin'  
They keep on draggin' me down  
  
Well I did anything just to try to get close to you  
I took it step by step like a man's supposed to  
Tell me now, is this my  
Is this my contrition  
To have the love that I longed for fill me with suspicion  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it's tellin' time, oh my little sister  
Now can I believe the words, the words of love you whisper  
Is my train in vain, has my soul gone to waste  
Am I just a victim of, a victim of my lost faith  
  
[Chorus]
