When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires  
Will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dreams  
No request is to extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns  
Like a boat out of the blue  
Fate steps in and see's you through  
  
Moma when you wished upon a star  
Your dreams come true  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns  
Like a boat out of the blue  
Fate steps in and see's you through  
  
Baby when you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true  
When you wished upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Your dreams come true
