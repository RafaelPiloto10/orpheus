[Chorus:]  
I don't even know, where my life would be  
If you hadn't shown, shown Your love toward me  
Broke the chains, the chains that were binding me  
Gave me liberty, set me free  
The chains that were binding me  
  
[Verse:]  
If it hadn't been (yeah)  
For the Lord (yeah)  
Who was on my side  
I'd Be lost (yeah)  
Like a ship (yeah)  
Without a guide  
If I'm sinking (yeah)  
Said He (yeah)  
Lifted me, broke the chains  
That were binding me  
  
Ooh (whom the Son sets free)  
Ooh (is truly free indeed) Oh  
Ooh (now I'm walking in my liberty)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
And when I (yeah)  
I felt like (yeah)  
I could not last  
I was bound by (yeah)  
The guilt of (yeah)  
Of my past  
But I gave the Lord (yeah)  
The Lord my life (yeah)  
And in exchange, He gave me brand new life,  
I've never been the same  
  
Ooh (whom the Son sets free)  
Ooh (is truly free indeed) Oh  
Ooh (now I'm walking in my liberty)  
  
[Tag]  
Gave me, victory  
Now I, I have been set free  
Gave me liberty  
Now I, I have been set free  
  
Gave me, victory  
Now I, I have been set free  
Gave me liberty  
Now I  
Set me free
