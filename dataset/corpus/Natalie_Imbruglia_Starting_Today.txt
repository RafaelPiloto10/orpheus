Starting today  
I'm not gonna waste another moment  
Even if I had had the chance before  
I would have blown it  
  
But you took me by surprise  
And you caught me just in time  
  
Everyday  
You give me reason not to walk away  
I'll stop believing that the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
  
Starting Today  
I'm not gonna worry about tomorrow  
I'll wash away  
All this fear that's left me feeling hollow  
  
'Cause you make me want to try  
And you caught me just in time  
  
Everyday  
You give me reason not to walk away  
I've stopped believing  
I should run like crazy  
'Cause if I did you'd chase me anyway  
  
I should of told you so many times  
But I shied away  
Somehow you always seem to  
Be there making it easy  
And you give me reason to stay everyday  
  
Ooh everyday, everyday  
I've stopped believing  
I should run like crazy  
'Cause if I did you'd chase me anyway  
  
You give me reason not to walk away  
I've stopped believing  
That the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
  
Starting today  
I'm not gonna waste another moment
