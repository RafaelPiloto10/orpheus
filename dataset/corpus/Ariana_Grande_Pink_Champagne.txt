[Verse 1]  
Every day I'm grindin'  
I don't even get a weekend  
Been livin' my life  
In black and white, no sleeping  
So tonight I'm gonna flip it  
Like in a New York minute  
We're gonna hail a cab  
And don't look back  
Once we get in it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't need no guest list  
Everybody's invited  
I said even if you can't get in  
We'll dance outside it  
We're gonna make this bubble  
Carbonate some trouble  
When the night gets black  
Gotta take it back to another level  
  
Lemme hear you say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
  
[Bridge]  
Make it pop  
Oooohhh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We're gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud.  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne
