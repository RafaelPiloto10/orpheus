The angels' share  
The secrets of their universe  
It's seldom fair  
Partly blessing, partly curse  
  
All those things we cannot know  
We dream, we hypothesize  
Maybe these are secrets shared by those  
Watching from the sky  
  
If we are only members of the human race  
No supernatural beings from a supernatural place  
If you can't solve the problem Come and tell me to my face  
  
The angels' share  
All the human mysteries  
There is no prayer  
To the thieves of celestial history  
  
The myth of perfect reason  
We're forgotten at birth  
It's a kind of clandestine conspiracy  
A seraphin joke of eternity  
  
If we are only members of the human race  
No supernatural beings from a supernatural place  
If you can't solve the problem Come and tell me to my face  
  
All those things we cannot know  
We dream, we hypothesize  
Maybe these are secrets shared by those  
Watching from the side  
  
If we are only members of the human race  
No supernatural beings from a supernatural place  
If you can't solve the problem Come and tell me to my face
