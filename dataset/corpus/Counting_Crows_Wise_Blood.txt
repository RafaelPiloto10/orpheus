I'm an outcast that no one can save anymore  
And the days of my youth, have all long gone by now  
I was the kind of boy the devil would offer a smoke or a drink to  
Or a ride downtown to some God forsaken land  
  
One Sunday morning at dawn you know they baptized my soul  
But they held me down so long Christ I almost drowned  
Yeah I was the kind of boy who never learned to smile  
So I kicked and I screamed  
'till I tore myself lose from all these great big hands Oh Yeah  
  
Chorus:  
Wiseblood knows how to walk the way the wind blows  
Wiseblood hears grace whisper right behind  
  
My mommma, she turned around and said  
"Little boy you better wake up....cause your a walking dead"  
Oh she was the kind a girl who never touched a smoke or a drink  
She just smoldered like an empty church left to burn in the wind
