Yesterday she thanked me  
For oiling that front door  
This morning when she wakes  
She won't be thankful anymore  
  
She'll never know how much I cared  
Just that I couldn't stay  
Shell never know the reason why  
I always run away  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Last night we talked of old times  
Families and home towns  
She wondered if we both agree on  
Where we'd settle down  
  
And I told her that we'd cross that bridge  
Whenever it'd arrive  
Now through the flames I see her standing  
On the other side  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Like ashes on the water  
I drift away in sorrow  
Knowing that the day my lessons finally learned  
I'll be standing at a river  
Staring out across tomorrow  
And the bridge I need to get there  
Will be a bridge that I have burned  
  
Burning bridges  
One by one  
What I'm doing  
Can't be undone  
  
And I'm always hoping someday  
I'm gonna stop this running round  
But every time the chance comes up  
Another bridge goes down  
  
Another bridge goes down
