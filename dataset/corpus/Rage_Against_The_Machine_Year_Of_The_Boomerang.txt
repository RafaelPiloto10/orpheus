Tha sistas are in so check the front line  
Seems I spent the '80s in the Haiti state of mind  
Cast me into classes for electro shock  
Straight incarcerated, the curriculum's a cell block  
I'm swimmin' in half truths and it makes me want to spit  
Instructor come separate the healthy from tha sick  
Ya weigh me on a scale, smellin' burnt skin  
It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from within  
'Cause I'm cell locked in tha doctrines of tha right  
Enslaved by dogma, talk about my birthrights  
Yet at every turn I'm runnin' into hell's gates  
So I grip tha cannon like Fanon an pass tha shells to my classmates  
Aw, power to tha people  
'Cause tha bosses right ta live is mine ta die  
So I'm goin' out heavy sorta like Mount Tai  
Wit tha five centuries of penitentiary so let tha guilty hang  
In tha year of tha boomerang  
  
I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it  
So let tha guilty hang  
I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it  
In the year of tha boomerang  
I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it  
So let tha guilty hang  
I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it  
In the year of tha boomerang  
  
Yeah!  
Now it's upon you!  
Now it's upon you!
