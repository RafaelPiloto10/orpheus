If you believe all your hope is gone  
Down the drain of your humankind  
The time has arrived  
You'll be waiting here as I was  
In a snow-white shroud  
Waiting underground  
  
There by the ridge be a gathering beneath the pilgrim moon  
Where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth  
Where the great ones tremble  
In their snow-white shrouds  
Waiting underground  
  
If you seek the kingdom come, come along  
Waiting by the ridge there'll be a gathering  
Beneath the pilgrim moon  
Where the [railroad] thunders  
  
Oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth  
And as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble  
And your humankind becomes as one  
And then we will arise  
In our snow-white shrouds  
When we'll be as one  
But until that day we will just await  
In our snow-white shrouds  
Waiting underground  
In our snow-white shrouds  
Waiting underground  
  
Waiting underground  
Waiting underground  
Waiting underground  
Waiting underground  
Waiting underground  
Waiting underground
