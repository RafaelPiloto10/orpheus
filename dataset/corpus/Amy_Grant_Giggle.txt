Giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know it's still true  
That He's always gonna love me  
So just laugh out...  
If you think I'm uncool  
Playin' the part of the fool  
'Cause I love Him!  
Don't you know how I love Him?  
Oh, well, I do!  
When I see somebody cryin'  
Some person who's real mean  
I want to quickly walk right by him  
But I'll stop for You  
Dear Lord, but  
Must I hug him real tight now?  
He smells so bad, I'll faint  
What will my friends think if I kill my pride, I can't  
Well, giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know it's still true  
That He's always gonna love me  
So just laugh out...  
If you think I'm uncool  
Playin' the part of the fool  
'Cause I love Him!  
Don't you know how I love Him?  
Oh, well, I do!  
When I'm in a sticky situation  
Sitting in a class at school  
Everyone is talking evolution  
No one talks of You  
My hand goes up  
I don't want to be too pushy  
My arm, it feels like lead  
But there's such a joy they're missing saying, "God is dead"  
So giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know it's still true  
That He's always gonna love me  
So just laugh out...  
If you think I'm uncool  
Always playin' the part of the fool  
'Cause I love Him!  
Don't you know how I love Him?  
Oh, well, I do!
