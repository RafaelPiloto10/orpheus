I was born in a flatland, usa and all my dreams led me to L. A.  
Another chase of rags to riches, I learned to throw some fancy pitches.  
I found out what ain't and which is just exactly cool, well all right  
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool  
Got a place in Malibu like you never seen  
Picking out your lady friend from Penthouse magazine  
You oughta see the chrome gleam on my Mercedes all shiny and new  
Hey, I'm the Jack of Diamonds, the boy with all the clues  
Not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me). Glorified insanity (no, no, not me).  
Ooh, I'm a hyper-supervisor, fast driver, star driver (fool).  
Heaven help the fool, professional "gimme-fiver", heaven help the fool.  
Anything you could want to be you can buy, even get it free  
Make yourself a smoother dancer, fill your head with answers.  
Never a backward glancer, it's you who makes the rules (aah).  
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool  
No, no, never a backward glancer, (fool), heaven help the fool.  
I meet alot of pentagram, heart of the star (that's what you are)  
You can trade your soul for an electric guitar  
Ooh, not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me). Glorified insanity (no, no, not me)  
And when they offer golden apples, are you sure you'll refuse?  
Heaven help the fool, are you sure you'll refuse it? Heaven help the fool  
It's like a deaf man dancing or a blind man shooting pool  
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
