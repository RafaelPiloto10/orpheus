My victims are rich or poor, young or old, strong or weak  
I cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones  
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth  
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes  
I take what you love, and leave you in tears  
I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games  
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain  
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames  
I bring poverty, sickness and death  
A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth  
I answer your prayers for greed and lust  
More than evil, I laugh at your trust  
I am more powerful than all the armies of the world  
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death  
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars  
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath  
Evil, more evil than violence  
Violent, more violent than death  
Deadly, more deadly than man  
I am yeah, yeah, I'm evil I am  
My kingdom corrupt with dissent  
Your sins erupt by my intent  
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin  
Let the nightmare begin  
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness  
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer  
Prince of darkness  
I take what you love, and leave you in tears  
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games  
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain  
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames  
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness  
Prince of darkness, the most beautiful angel  
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer  
Prince of darkness, unpredictable, the prince of darkness  
Prince of darkness
