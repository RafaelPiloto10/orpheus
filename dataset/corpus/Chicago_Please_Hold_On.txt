Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Tell me the truth tonight  
Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Can I still call you mine?  
  
I've heard the same old story  
So many times  
For every lie you've told me  
I'd be a rich man if I had a dime  
  
Why do you take me  
Why do you rake me  
Over your red hot coals  
Why do you scold me  
After you hold me  
Why do you turn so cold  
  
The lady's constant cruisin'  
Explains the tears  
The lonely path she's choosin'  
If I didn't love her would I still be here  
  
Hold on, stay with me  
Fantasies best left behind  
Hold on to love and just believe  
In love that won't bind you  
Don't leave me behind  
Stay with me baby  
  
Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Tell me the truth this time  
Do you love me  
Do you need me  
Can I still call you mine  
  
Soft lights and quiet music  
Forget your name  
Some people try to use it  
But loneliness chooses the rules to the game  
  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Tell me what you have in mind  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Baby, don't you leave me behind  
  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Loneliness will leave you blind  
Please hold on, stay with me  
Fall in love with me this time
