I don't mind confiding  
That I make stupid mistakes  
Been misled and misguided  
And I'm easily led astray  
  
But you can dance with disaster  
Never missing a step  
Spinning faster and faster  
Long after I've already slipped  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Over and over, again and again  
You float through the door and I'm stumbling in  
I'm twisted and tangled and soaked to the skin  
You float through the door and I'm stumbling in again  
  
Pulled in every direction  
I've a million regrets  
You're the perfect protection  
When I'm diving in over my head  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's bones in my closet,  
I've collected quite a few  
God knows what causes an angel to love a fool  
  
But in the middle of it all  
You always break my fall  
In the middle of it  
  
[Chorus]
