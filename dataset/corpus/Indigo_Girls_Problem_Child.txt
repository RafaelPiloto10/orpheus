I am a problem child  
I've been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
I said go go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside this time  
Don't assume anything  
But go go go  
  
Five generations running fast  
These things will not pass  
This debtors blood runs in my veins  
I can't change anything  
I said no no no  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside this time  
Don't assume anything  
But go go go  
  
So youve learned to cry  
But you don't know why  
So youve learned to laugh  
What are we laughing at  
  
So I am a problem child  
I've been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
And I said go go go  
Go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside this time  
Don't assume anything this time  
Don't assume anything  
I said go go go
