Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss  
No! No! No!  
But when two eager lips are pressed against yours  
You'll know, yes, you'll know  
  
Can anyone explain the glow of romance  
No! No! No!  
But when you hear the phrase "It's you I adore"  
You'll know, yes, you'll know  
  
And you will find, to give love a start  
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart  
  
Can anyone explain the wonder of love  
No! No! No!  
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh  
We know, yes, we know  
  
And you will find, to give love a start  
Don't think with your mind, just feel with your heart  
  
Can anyone explain the wonder of love  
No! No! No!  
But now that you and I are sharing a sigh  
We know, yes, we know
