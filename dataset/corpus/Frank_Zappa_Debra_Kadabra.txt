Debra kadabra, say she's a witch,  
Shit-ass charlotte, ain't that a bitch?  
Debra kadabra, haw that's rich.  
June, a rancho granny,  
Shook her wrinkled fanny  
Shoes are too tight and pointed  
Ankles sorta puffin' out  
Cause me to shout:  
Oh debra algebra ebneezra kadabra  
Witch goddess, witch goddess of lankershim boulevard.  
Cover my entire bodice, with avon cologna.  
And drive me to some relative's house, in east l.a. (foogadah! ? )  
(Just till my skin clears up)  
Turn it to channel thirteen,  
And make me watch the rubber tongue, when it comes out  
From the puffed, and flatulent mexican rubbergoods mask.  
Next time they show the Bernaca  
Make me buy the flosser.  
Make me grow brainiac fingers.  
But with more hair!  
(But with more hair)  
Make me kiss your turquoise jewelry.  
Emboss me.  
Rub the hot front part of my head,  
With ridged unguents  
Give me bas relief!  
Cast your dancing spell my way  
I promise to go under it.  
If she casts a spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
If she casts a spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
Oh, hear this!  
Learn the pachuco hop, and let me twirl you!  
Learn the pachuco hop, and let me twirl you!  
Oh debra fauntleroy magnesium kadabra! take me with you!  
Don't you want any a these?
