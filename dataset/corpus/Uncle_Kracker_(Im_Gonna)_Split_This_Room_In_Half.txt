I know a guy who took too many pills  
Now he's got a mansion that sits on a hill  
14 million served that's correct  
17 cars, 3 cribs, and 2 jets  
I came to test to blood, sweat, tears  
Persevered for ten long years  
10 years, I was there for 8  
And I ain't seen a meaner mother puttin' food on our plate  
I've learned to hate, and that's a damn shame  
Because I'm gettin' pretty good at this bitch ass game  
See, fame ain't the problem, it's broke?  
Pissin' on my dog cause they're down on their luck  
Now you're stuck like a pig in the poke  
You know you're makin' him mad, and you're goin' to get choked  
Don't you know every dog has a limit  
Yo, I'm about to kick somebody's ass in a minute  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
(I said) Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
I'm Gonna Split This Room In Half  
(I said) Why'd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
  
Sometimes success leads to stress  
Legal roles and dumb (hoes) and death threats  
Nat work for network and that works  
And people jerk for perks that ain't theirs  
And that hurts, you work your whole life  
And that still ain't enough  
Cause a bunch of punks wanna poach your stuff  
That's not your stuff  
So don't touch that  
And don't make me break with this baseball bat, cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're not playing nice  
My dog likes to share  
You're going to get smacked for not playing fair  
It's in the air you can feel the tension  
We don't take kind to senseless dissension  
You bark like a dog. You fight like a dog  
You live by your dog. You die by your dog  
Now there's a calm before the storm  
And I'd hate to be you when it starts to get warm  
Clouds are forming. Crowds are swarming  
You've had for-warning. Now pray for mourning, cause  
  
[Chorus: x2]
