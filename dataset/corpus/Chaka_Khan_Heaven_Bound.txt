Darlin' there's a thing or two  
I want to take the time to say  
Every moment here with you  
Puts heaven in my day  
  
I'm mystified by the smile that blossoms on your face  
And the magic seems to lift me to a cloud where we embrace  
I don't have to dream no more, no  
Now I believe in miracles  
Your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
Heaven bound  
  
Oh, I simply must confess  
I'm glad to be a girl  
You've got to be an angel  
Cause you put heaven in my world  
  
Your shadow is my tropic sun  
And it's summer all year long  
Your presence is my paradise  
How could anything go wrong  
  
Now I'm absolutely sure  
That you're all I've been living for, yeah  
Your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
Heaven  
  
I'm in, I'm in heaven  
I'm in, I'm in heaven  
I'm in, I'm in heaven  
  
Every time I'm near you my heart just won't keep still  
The closer that I get to you, the better that I feel  
I don't have to dream no more, no, no  
  
Now you're all I'm living for, yeah  
Cause your love turned my world around  
  
Heaven bound  
  
(repeat)
