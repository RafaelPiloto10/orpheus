They laugh at me aloud  
They say I'm just a clown  
That I ain't got no pride  
I'm on the outside  
The girls look really cute  
They really make it work  
They think I'm just a jerk  
I'm on the outside  
I never could sit still  
I never was too hip  
I never caught the ride  
I'm on the outside  
  
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now  
This is where it all begins right here  
On the outside lookin' in, I'm on the outside  
  
I never was a punk  
I never shot junk  
I never even tried counter  
Culture passed me right by  
(I'm on the outside)  
  
Don't talk to debutantes  
Don't eat in restaurants  
The patrons sit and stare  
The waiters make wise cracks behind my back  
(I'm on the outside)  
  
Teachers there in school  
They flunked me by the rule  
They say I had no motivation, brains or dedication  
I guess the imbeciles were right I'm on the outside  
  
I'm on the outside, I'm on the outside now  
This is where it all begins on the outside looking in  
Looking in  
At you  
I'm just an alien through and through  
Tryin' to make believe I'm you  
Tryin' to fit  
Just a stranger on the outside looking in  
  
The disco makes me sick I  
Wear the wrong clothes  
I say the wrong things  
You know I can't dance  
My feet are much too wide (I'm on the outside)  
  
You think you set the trends  
You wear your hair just right  
Your clothes are out-a-sight  
Your house is modern really kitch  
You get so macho when you're with your bitch  
(I'm on the outside)  
  
I see them go to work  
I see them go to sleep  
I see them on T.V.  
I see them laugh and cry  
I'm on the outside. I'm on the outside. I'm on the outside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm on the outside. I'm on the outside now  
I'm on the outside  
I'm on the outside now
