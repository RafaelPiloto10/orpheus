Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song  
Well, I'll cry everytime that you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one, one more time  
  
Southern California that's as blue as the boy can be  
Blue as the deep blue sea  
Won't you listen to me now  
I need your golden gated cities like a hole in the head  
Just like a hole in the head, I'm free  
  
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song  
Well, I'll cry everytime that you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one, one more time  
  
I do believe I'm headed home  
Hey mister, can't you see that I'm as dry as a bone  
I think I'll spend some time alone  
Yes, unless you've found a way of squeezing water from a stone  
  
Let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can  
Let the springtime begin  
Let the boy become a man  
I done wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song  
I done been this lonesome picker a little too long  
  
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song  
Well, I'll cry everytime that you're up and slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one, one more time  
  
Well, I've been spreading myself thin these days  
Don't you know  
Good-bye
