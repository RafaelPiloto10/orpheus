A sailboat in the moonlight  
And you  
Wouldn't that be heaven  
A heaven just for two  
A soft breeze on a June night and you  
What a perfect setting  
For letting dreams come true  
  
A chance to sail away  
To Sweetheart Bay  
Beneath the stars that shine  
A chance to drift  
For you to lift  
Your tender lips to mine  
Some things dear  
That I long for are few  
Just give me a sailboat in the moonlight and you  
  
A chance to sail away  
To Sweetheart Bay  
Beneath the stars that shine  
A chance to drift  
For you to lift  
Your tender lips to mine  
Some things dear  
That I long for are few  
Just give me a sailboat in the moonlight and you
