Childhood living, is easy to do.  
The things that you wanted, I bought them for you.  
Graceless lady, you know who I am.  
You know I can't let you, slide through my hands.  
  
And wild horses, couldn't drag me away.  
And wild horses, couldn't drag me away.  
  
I watched you suffer, a dull aching pain.  
Now you decided, to show me the same.  
No sweeping exits, or offstage lines.  
Can make me feel bitter, or treat you unkind.  
  
And wild horses, couldn't drag me away.  
And wild wild horses, couldn't drag me away.  
  
(I know, I dreamed you a sin and a lie)  
  
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried.  
Let's do some living, after we die.  
  
And wild horses, couldn't drag me away.  
And wild wild horses, couldn't drag me away.  
  
And wild wild horses, we'll ride them someday.  
And wild wild horses, we'll ride them someday.
