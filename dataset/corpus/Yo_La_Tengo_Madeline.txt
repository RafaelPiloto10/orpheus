Madeline, hair in your eyes  
With the voice as soft as satin  
Madeline, you'll surely find  
Smiles from inside a worried glance  
  
You always kept me waiting  
Somehow I never seem to mind  
When the wind has caught your sail,  
Come back and see me, Madeline  
  
Madeline, after a while  
They found your photo in a drawer  
Madeline, from another time  
I caught you standing in a door  
When you were asked if we were sisters,  
You replied you weren't sure  
  
If the fog should ever lift,  
Come back and see me, Madeline  
  
Will you always keep me waiting?  
Somehow I'm running out of time  
When the wind has caught your sails  
Come back and see me Madeline
