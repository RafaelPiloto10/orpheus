I'm not saying I'm scared of you  
But your love is something new  
When I hold you we're swaying in the wind  
Of all the bridges I've ever crossed  
High and lonesome and wild and lost  
I feel this time I'll take it to the end  
We don't care what the people may say  
If there's a price it's the price we'll pay  
  
Chorus  
And we'll burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn it down  
Burn it down  
  
We've both done our share of runnin' around  
Now we know enough to know the kind of love  
we've found  
It's the real thing and we've got to see it through  
eI'm a singer and a sailor on a midnight sea  
Oh captain come and take me on your fantasy  
If we're crazy that ain't nothin' new  
'Cause we don't care what the people may say  
If there's a price it's the price we'll pay and  
  
Chorus  
  
Who knows how it started  
Who knows it's ends  
The point of no return is waiting  
just around the bend
