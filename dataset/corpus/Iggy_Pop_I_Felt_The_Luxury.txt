She sat on the pavement  
As I pulled in the drive  
Wearing leopard skin velvet  
And shiny black eyes  
"She looks like a sleeper"  
  
Said my wife at the time  
She had curls like Delilah  
And a smile like the sun  
She held my poor corpse  
Like she'd never be done  
And the caption in my mind said  
"This is the one"  
  
But I'm strong and I'm disciplined  
And I avoided her for years  
'Till one night, as usual  
With my heart full of tears  
A hand touched my back  
  
And she was standing right there  
Then I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury  
Whispering  
Whispering  
  
Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is  
How my life was a desert before she came in  
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin  
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house  
The way she curled up quietly on the couch  
I can still see her in my mind that way now  
Aah I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
  
Well time went by quickly  
And her confidence grew  
And she wanted this and that  
And she wanted those too  
And she wouldn't shut up  
And one day I just blew up  
Now she's in the hospital  
For the second time  
Maybe she'll die  
Maybe I'll cry  
Therapists would say  
"You're in denial"  
  
But love became inconvenient  
Love became a literal drag  
Very bad for business  
I'd be better off a fag  
She's a model de sport  
That I can't afford  
'Cause I'm a practical American  
From the Middle-West  
And I can piss on a grave  
While welcoming guests  
If cold's what I am  
I'm cold 'till the end  
And I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
Now I'm gonna continue walking  
In the modern world  
Which justifies every egotistical perversion  
With scientific talk  
And new ways to walk  
  
But I'll remember the religion  
She became to me  
And the other person I could have been  
So for now I'll say so long  
I gotta go do wrong  
I gotta go do wrong  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury  
Aah, Luxury
