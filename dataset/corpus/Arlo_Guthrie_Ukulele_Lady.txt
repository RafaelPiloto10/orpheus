I saw the splendor of the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
There's something tender in the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
  
And all the beaches are filled with peaches  
Who bring their ukes along  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song  
  
1:  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
If you like to linger where it's shady  
Ukulele Lady linger too  
If you kiss Ukulele Lady  
While you promise ever to be true  
And she sees another Ukulele  
Lady foolin' 'round with you  
  
2:  
Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)  
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)  
Maybe she'll find somebody else  
By and by  
To sing to when it's cool and shady  
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
  
She used to sing to me by moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight  
Although I'm far away  
  
Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing  
And lips are made to kiss  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the song I miss
