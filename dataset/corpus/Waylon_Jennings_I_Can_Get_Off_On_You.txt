Take back the weed take back the cocaine baby  
Take back the pills take back the whiskey too  
I don't need them now your love was all I was after  
I'll make it now I can get off on you  
I can get by on little or nothing at all I know  
I can get high just thinkin' about you and so  
Well take back the weed...  
  
Who would have thought this was somethin' that I'd ever do  
I'm working it out mellowing out on you  
Take back the weed...  
Take back the weed...
