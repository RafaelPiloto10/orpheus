I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
I close my eyes  
I'm on the shelf  
I know myself  
  
I've seen the lights of every city  
Tried to work out where I am  
I close my mind for the day  
I know the way  
  
I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes  
I'm on the shelf  
I know my self  
  
There's never ever anybody to rely on  
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on  
That's just circumstances , I must take my chances  
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying  
But I guess that's not true  
And you know that's true  
But there's a method to my madness  
  
I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes for the day  
I know the way
