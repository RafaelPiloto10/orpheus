This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I can do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Yeah, blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up  
I'm alge-ballin', dumb niggaz can't add it up  
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin' up  
All these rappers comin' out, ain't nobody showin' up  
Man, where your talent at? Show me where your balance at  
You the king of the streets? Well, I ain't heard none of that  
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say  
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, 'Did it My Way'  
I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied  
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide  
Recognize, lost a lotta love when my momma died  
Did a gang of shit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive  
Fishburn's yellin' wake up, open up my eyes  
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize  
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize  
And criticize when you on your grind, so I realized  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Go ahead, spit it out, that's right, get it out  
So I can respond, nigga, fuck what you talk about  
Drop like a guillotine, money over everythin'  
Seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine  
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit  
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship  
Came a long way from the place that I started from  
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?  
Hate manifest from the inside out  
The shit starts in your heart, then spill out your mouth  
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out  
I see you tryin' to stand up but you don't stand out  
Now that I found that my path is original  
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle  
I'm not like you, but you think we identical  
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Three wheels, lock it up, ammo, stock it up  
It's not for niggaz 'cause George Bush comin' after us  
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go  
All my people fightin' for they soul, you are not alone  
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant  
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it  
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit  
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, overkill shit  
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize  
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line  
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit  
You know that young shit, the 'Hey nigga, where you from?' shit  
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman  
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand  
Let's part ways and then pray for better days  
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to say  
This cannot continue  
We must go our separate ways  
Without you, I'll do better  
But first these words I have to say  
It's not that I don't hear you  
When you scream and curse my name  
It's just that I don't feel you  
Nigga, you invade my space  
Yeah, knowhatI'msayin'?  
(You invade my space)  
Yeah, stop askin' where the fuck I'm at, yeah  
(Nigga, you invade my space)  
Tryin' to see where I'm at  
Tryin' to be where I'm at all the fuckin' time, c'mon  
(You invade my space)  
Get a life, nigga, I got mines, know'mtalkinbout?  
(Nigga, you invade my space)  
C'mon
