I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did!  
I never dreamed it could be,  
Yet there you were, in love with me.  
  
I found your lips close to mine, so I kissed you,  
And you didn't mind it at all!  
When I'm awake, such a break never happens,  
How long can a guy go on dreamin'?  
  
If there's a chance that you care, then please,  
Say you do Baby!  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true.
