When I think about love  
Honey, you always  
Come across my mind  
Is it the way that you hold me  
Or the way that  
You told me love is blind  
Well, it's a crime of the heart  
These things I'm  
Thinking to myself  
But I can't forget you, babe  
Just can't seem to  
Think of nothing else.  
  
Got a woman at home  
A family to feed  
Three fine children  
They think the Lord of me  
Now I'm standing  
At the crossroads  
Looking for a sign of true love.  
  
Well, I heard that song  
Says girls just wanna have fun  
Well, I guess I  
Bought my ticket, honey  
'Cause it feels as if  
The ride has just begun  
Well, there's two kinds of love  
One is wrong and one is right  
But I can't forget you baby  
Can't forget  
The way you hold me tight.  
  
I got a woman at home  
A family to feed  
Three fine children  
They think the Lord of me  
Well, I'm standing  
At the crossroads  
Looking for a sign of true love.  
  
When I think about women  
Honey, you always  
Come across my mind  
Is it the way that you told me  
The way you told me love is blind  
Well, it's a crime of the heart  
These things I'm  
Thinking to myself now  
Can't forget you, babe  
Can't forget  
The way you make me feel.  
  
I got a woman at home  
A family to feed  
Three fine children  
At the crossroads  
Looking for a sign of true love.
