(CHORUS):  
Some love  
You know it brings me down down down  
Some love  
You know it brings me down down down  
They say that love is heaven sent  
Well I guess they told another lie  
How can it be a part of me  
You can't even look me in my eye  
(CHORUS)  
(BRIDGE):  
All this time you made a fool of me  
You told honey sweet lies  
I'm fed up with your alibis  
I was blind, now I see, yeah  
(CHORUS)  
Let's end this game, let's stop this farce  
'Cause I don't wanna live a lie  
Life's so short, and love's so sparse  
I guess I'll have to say goodbye  
It brings me down down down, yeah  
Some love, it brings me down down down  
(BRIDGE)  
If this is love, I want no part of it  
They call this love  
Now I've got to quit you, baby  
If this is love, I want no part of it  
They call this love, dirty dirty love  
Some love  
If this is love don't break my heart  
If this is love don't want no part  
If this is love don't break my heart  
If this is love don't want no part  
If this is love don't break my heart  
If this is love don't want no part  
If this is love don't break my heart  
Some love  
Oh first you burn me with desire  
Then you go and douse the fire
