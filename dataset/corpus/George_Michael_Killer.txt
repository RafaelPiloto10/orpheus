So you want to be free  
To live your life the way you wanna be  
Will you give if we cry  
Will we live or will we die  
  
Tainted hearts heal with time  
Shoot bad love so we can  
Stop the bleeding

Racism in future kins can only lead to no good  
And besides, all our sons and daughters already  
Know how that feels
