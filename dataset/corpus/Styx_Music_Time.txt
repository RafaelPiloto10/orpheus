I like music,  
The rhythm really gets to me  
I can't control it,  
My feet move automatically  
And I like hot licks  
The kind I wish that I could play  
And when I hear them  
I crank the volume all the way  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up  
Turn it loud  
All the way  
  
I like strangers  
Their kindness means a lot to me  
They don't ask questions  
Don't care about my history  
And I like fast girls  
I don't know what's come over me  
They make me do things  
I would not ordinarily  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up  
Turn it loud  
All the way  
  
Hear it, feel it, like it  
Do it, do it, do it to me  
Want it, need it, love it  
Can't get enough of it  
Try it do it  
Go ahead and go for it  
All the way  
  
And I like daydreams  
I've had enough reality  
My job is boring  
I'm overworked and underpaid  
I like TV  
It stirs up all my fantasies  
Girls in tight jeans  
Acting so outrageously  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up  
Turn it loud  
All the way  
  
Hear it, feel it, like it  
Do it, do it, do it to me  
Want it, need it, love it  
Can't get enough of it  
Try it do it  
Go ahead and go for it  
All the way  
  
Turn it loose, loose  
I like big things  
The size of them impresses me  
Just give me plenty  
Forget about the quality  
And I like fast food  
The burgers always taste the same  
The snotty waiters  
Ask highball or boubiley
