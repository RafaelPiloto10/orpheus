I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain and deep as a river come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me it was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me come rain or come shine  
Happy together unhappy together and won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
  
But I'm with you always, I'm with you rain or shine  
  
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain deep as a river come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me it was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me come rain or come shine  
Happy together unhappy together and won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money.  
  
But I'll love you always, I'm with you rain or shine  
  
Rain or shine.
