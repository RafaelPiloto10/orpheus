Not too long ago when she was mine  
I thought we would be together 'til the end of time  
That's the way it goes when you're in love  
Since she's gone there's no one else I'm thinking of  
[Chorus:]  
I need her to stay with me  
Lay me down and pray for me  
Now I know just where I stand  
Heaven help this lonely man  
  
There will never be anyone else  
Never be another one to take her place  
Might as well give up, I can't go on  
Never find another one to fill this empty space  
  
Chorus  
  
When she came to me she opened my eyes  
Suddenly life was worth living  
Now it's over for me I realize  
Nothing's the same since she's gone  
And I can't go on  
  
Repeat
