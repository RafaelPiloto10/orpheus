Go now, don't look back, we've drawn the line  
Move on, it's no good to go back in time  
  
I'll never find another girl like you, for happy endings it takes two  
We're fire and ice, the dream won't come true  
  
[Chorus]  
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes  
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for goodbyes  
  
Danger in the game when the stakes are high  
Branded, my heart was branded while my senses stood by  
  
I'll never find another girl like you, for happy endings it takes two  
We're fire and ice, the dream won't come true  
  
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes  
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time, oh  
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes  
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for goodbyes  
  
('cause Sara) Loved me like no one has ever loved me before  
(And Sara) Hurt me, no one could ever hurt me more  
(And Sara) Sara, nobody loved me anymore  
  
I'll never find another girl like you  
We're fire and ice, the dream won't come true  
  
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes  
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time, no  
Ooh Sara, why did it, why did it, why did it all fall apart
