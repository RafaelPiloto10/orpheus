Feel like I'm livin' under some kind of hex  
Livin' in here in this industrial military complex  
Doesn't really help when I read Time magazine  
Cause they only distort the scene  
The sky is so hazy I can't even see the sun  
Livin' here is like livin' under a gun  
I really do wonder 'bout the United Nations  
Why don't they face the situations  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin' for a dream  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin' for some dream  
Lord, I'm so tired of payin' all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
Got to make it better cause I've got nothin' to lose  
Ain't too clear to pay my income taxes  
'Specially when I know it goes to kill the masses  
Love to hear the President make it perfectly clear  
How the donkeys and the elephants are police up here  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin for a dream  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin for some dream  
Lord, I'm so tired of payin' all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
I've got to make it better cause I've got nothin' lose  
Won't somebody help me cause I've gotten in my shoes  
Those industrial military complex blues
