Hey, uh, um, hey, oh girl, oh girl  
  
We did everything we could do  
To try to make it work (we did, we did)  
Baby, you look soo confused,  
Cause it feels like, there was no way we could lose (no way, no way)  
Baby, I just don't reply  
Cause I can't find the things you need in me (I can't, I can't girl)  
Baby, they know just know what to say,  
Their trying to break us away from one another,  
But maybe their right for a change  
  
I think God will give you  
Someone, much better  
Than me, trust me your life will be o.k. it will be alright.  
You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine)  
  
I know that baby we would disagree constantly  
On the basic things (we did, we did)  
You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way)  
Baby I want to decide to stay right by your side  
Baby, they know just what to say.  
They wanna keep us away from one another  
But Maybe they're right for a change  
  
I think, God will give you  
Someone, much better  
Than me, trust me your eyes will be  
O.k. (o.k.), alright (alright) just fine (just fine)  
  
I know, baby baby can't you see that another fella  
Just may be the kinda man you need  
Baby you deserve it and I know that  
I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say  
You earned it (you earned it)  
  
I think, God will give you  
Someone, much better  
Than me, trust me your eyes will be  
O.k., it will alright, it will be just fine (just fine)
