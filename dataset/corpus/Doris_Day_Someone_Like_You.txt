SOMEONE LIKE YOU  
Doris Day  
Someone like you cures everything gloomy  
Turns wrong into right, brightens the night,  
Brings happiness to me.  
Makes me luckier than throwin' a seven  
Takes me nearer to heaven than anyone's allowed to do  
When your heart is talkin' I feel like I'm walkin  
On a cloud with someone like you  
Some day I'll find someone I can boast to,  
Somebody to hug a bug in a rug to snuggle up close to  
And whenever I do, do you know th ewho,  
Who I'll give the most to.  
You prey on my mind, stay till I find,  
Someone like you
