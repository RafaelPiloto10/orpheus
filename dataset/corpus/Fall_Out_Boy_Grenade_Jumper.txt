My heart ticks in beat with  
These kids that I grew up with  
Living like life's going out of style  
And you came to watch us play  
Like a big shot talent  
But at the end of the day you know  
Where we came from and where we call home  
  
Hey Chris, you were our only friend  
And I know this is belated, we love you back  
  
They'll say it's not worth  
So we'll leave this town in ruins  
Living like life's going out of style  
And you came to watch us play  
Like a big shot talent  
But at the end of the day you know  
These busted lips we take back home  
  
Hey Chris, you were our only friend  
And I know this is belated, we love you back  
  
I know you would be there either way  
I'm so glad it seems like these time will never fade
