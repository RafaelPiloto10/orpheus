Tonight it's very clear as we're both lyin' here  
There's so many things I want to say  
I will always love you, I would never leave you alone  
  
Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret  
It breaks my heart to see you cryin'  
I don't want to lose you, I could never make it alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
I am a man who will fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero you're dreamin' of  
We'll live forever, knowin' together  
That we did it all for the glory of love  
  
You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all  
I'm always strong when you're beside me  
I have always needed you, I could never make it alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a knight in shining armor from a long time ago  
Just in time I will save the day  
Take you to my castle far away  
  
I am a man who will fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of  
Gonna live forever, knowin' together  
That we did it all for the glory of love  
  
We'll live forever  
Knowin' together  
That we did it all for the glory of love  
  
We did it all for love  
We did it all for love  
We did it all for love
