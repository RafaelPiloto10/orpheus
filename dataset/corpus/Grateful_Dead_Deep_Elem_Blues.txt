If you go down to deep elm put your money in your shoes  
The women in deep elem, they give you the deep elem blues  
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them deep elem blues  
Once I had a girlfriend, she meant the world to me  
She went down to deep elem, now, she ain't what she used to be  
Once I knew a preacher, preached the bible through and through  
He went sown to deep elem, now, his preaching days are through  
When you go down to deep elem to have a little fun  
Have your ten dollars ready when the police man comes  
When yo go down to deep elem put your money in your pants  
'Cause the women in deep elem, they don't give a man a chance  
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them deep elem blues
