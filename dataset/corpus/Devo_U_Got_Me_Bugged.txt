Since you came around  
Wigglin' under my skin  
I've been lost in the lost 'n found  
Feeling like a helpless pin  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
Girl I don't know what to do  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
You fluttered on down  
As graceful as can be  
Then you stuck in the needle  
And sucked my blood  
It was the loveage that came over me  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
I don't know what to do  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
I'm always bugged over you  
Now I'm hopelessly entangled  
In the web of love you dangled  
Helpless like a worm watch me twist and squirm  
Your love has left me strangled  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
Girl, I don't know what to do  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
Girl, I'm all bugged out over you  
You got me bug bug bug bug  
Now I'm hopelessly entangled  
In the web of love you dangled  
Should have trusted sick fear  
Now you stepped out on my tail  
Your love has left me strangled  
You got me bug bug bug bug
