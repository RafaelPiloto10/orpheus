Yeah, it goes away  
All of this and more of nothing in my life  
No color clay  
Individuality not safe  
As of now I bet you got me wrong  
So unsure you run from something strong  
I can't let go  
  
Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow  
Feel a tortured brain  
Show your belly like you want me to  
As of now I bet you got me wrong  
So unsure you run from something strong  
I haven't felt like this in so long  
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love  
  
That don't last forever  
Something's gotta turn out right  
You sugar taste  
Sweetness doesn't often touch my face  
Stay if you please  
You may not be here when I leave  
  
As of now I bet you got me wrong  
So unsure we reach for something strong  
I haven't felt like this in so long  
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love  
Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long  
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love  
  
That don't last forever  
Something's gotta turn out right
