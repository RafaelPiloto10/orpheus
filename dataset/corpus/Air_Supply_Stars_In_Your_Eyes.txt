We are civilized and free from all confusion  
And yet we always worry for the things that we can't see  
But now to give your love away, a miracle in motion  
You know what seems invisible will never ever be disguised to me  
  
I start to lose control  
I start to lose control  
  
CHORUS  
I know I will remember for longer than forever  
All the love and the stars in your eyes  
Until my arms surround you and build the world around you  
All I see are the stars in your eyes  
  
First you hear the angels sing and then you see the wedding ring  
Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven  
You know what you've found, you want to last forever  
You heart has found its wings and left for never never  
  
And then I lose control  
I start to lose control  
  
CHORUS  
  
I know I will remember for longer than forever  
All the love and the stars in your eyes  
  
CHORUS - REPEAT
