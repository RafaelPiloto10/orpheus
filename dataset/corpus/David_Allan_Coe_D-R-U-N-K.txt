How do you spell relief?  
I get D-are-you-N-K  
Lately Dave since my baby left me  
I do it almost every day  
It's the only thing that I've found  
That'll take the hurt away  
  
Well how do you spell relief John?  
  
I get D-are-you-N-K  
Every night about sundown I get a pain down deep inside  
This old broken heart acts up  
There's a hurtin' in my pride  
Well I've found a sure fire treatment  
That'll get me feelin' right  
When your memory starts flarin' up  
I just head for the neon lights

I don't need no doctor  
Tell me what is wrong  
I can fill my own perscriptions  
And it lasts me all night long  
It's the perfect medication  
For an ailment such as mine  
I forget about the tears I've cried  
When the whiskey hits my mind  
  
How do we spell relief?  
We get D-are-you-N-K

Well I tell ya Johnny
