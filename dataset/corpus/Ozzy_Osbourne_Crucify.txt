Give me your money,  
I'll sell you my vote,  
I promise I'll save you,  
While I'm cutting your throat  
  
You want to feel pleasure,  
Look into my eyes,  
I'm gonna swear on the bible  
While I'm feeding you lies  
  
My touch thickens your blood,  
I know the things that you love,  
My voice swallows the purest heartbeat  
I'm your counterfeit friend,  
I'll still be here 'til I crucify you,  
I crucify you again  
  
Give me your heroes,  
Your sinners and saints,  
A little temptation  
Is all that it takes  
I've been here forever,  
I'm your oldest friend,  
Until I pull on the trigger,  
The fun never ends  
  
My touch thickens your blood,  
I know the things that you love,  
My voice swallows the purest heartbeat  
I'm your counterfeit friend,  
I'll still be here 'til I crucify you,  
I crucify you again  
  
I've been around here for a long, long time,  
I'll be around until your soul is mine,  
Until your soul is mine  
  
My touch thickens your blood,  
I know the things that you love,  
My voice swallows the purest heartbeat  
I'm your counterfeit friend,  
I'll still be here 'til I crucify you,  
I crucify you again
