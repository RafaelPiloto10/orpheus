[Verse 1]  
Back scatters (male): Doo-bee-doo-bee-do-bah (x5)  
Doo-bee-doo-bee-do-bah (Male singer: Yeah!)  
Doo-bee-doo-bee-do-bah  
Doo-bee-doo-bee-do-bah (Male singer: C'mon!)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Female singers: Pe-erry!  
Male singer: He's a semi-aquatic egg-laying mammal of act-ion,  
Back scatters (male): [immediately after "o" in "action"] Doo-bee-doo-bee-do-
bah (x2)  
Male singer: He's a furry little flatfoot who'll never flinch from a fra-ee-
ay-ee-ay [fray].  
(Female singers begin vocalizing.)  
He's got more than just mad skill,  
He's got a beaver tail and bill,  
(Female singers stop vocalizing.)  
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say ["ay" is vocalized]...  
(Instruments stop, half rest)  
Perry: (Platypus mating call)  
(Instruments continue playing. Female singers audibly "swoon")  
  
[Chorus]  
Male singer: He's Pe-err-ry, Perry the Platypus!  
Male singer: Pe-err-ry, Perry the Platypus!

Male singer: Well, he's lookin' real sharp in his nine-teen-fourties [1940s]
fe-do-ora [fedora]  
Back scatters (male): [immediately after "d" in "fedora"] Doo-bee-doo-bee-do-
bah (x2)  
Male singer: He's got an iron will  
Nerves of steel  
And sev-eral other metal-themed at-tri-butes  
(Female singers begin vocalizing.)  
His fur is watertight  
And he's always up for a fight  
(Female singers stop vocalizing.)  
So when evil hears this sound, it shakes in its boots...  
Perry: (Platypus mating call)  
  
[Chorus]  
Male singer: He's Pe-err-ry, Perry the Platypus!  
Male singer: Pe-err-ry, Perry the Platypus!  
(Instrument solo)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Female singers begin vocalizing.)  
He's got more than just mad skill,  
He's got a beaver tail and bill,  
(Female singers stop vocalizing.)  
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say ["ay" is vocalized]...  
Perry: (Platypus mating call)  
  
[Chorus]  
Male singer: He's Pe-err-ry (Female singers: Perry!), Perry the Platypus!  
Male singer: Yeah, Pe-err-ryyy (Female singers: Perry!), Perry the Platypus!  
All singers: Talkin' bout Perry!  
A- (eighth rest) -GENT P [P is vocalized]!  
(All instruments stop, cymbal crash)
