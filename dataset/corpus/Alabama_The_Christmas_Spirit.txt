I see the lights of the city tonight and I see a star shinin' so bright  
A babe in a manger in swaddling clothes, it's you, it's me everyone knows  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like th day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
I hear the sound of church bell ring, and I see kids and grown-ups sing  
A real live nativity scene, it's you, it's me, we all know what it means  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
An it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King  
It's time for that eastern star to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time  
  
Yes, it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King  
It's time for that eastern start to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time  
  
Since the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down
