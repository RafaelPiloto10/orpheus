I'll be lovin' you always  
With a love that's true always  
When the things you've planned need a helpin' hand  
I will understand always, always  
  
Days may not be fair always  
That's when I'll be there always  
Not for just an hour, not for just a day  
Not for just a year, but always  
  
Days may not be fair always  
That's when I'll be there always  
Not for just an hour, not just a day  
Not for just one year, but always  
  
Always  
Always  
All the time
