Just a small town girl  
Livin' in a lonely world  
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere  
Just a city boy  
Born and raised in south Detroit  
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere  
  
A singer in a smokey room  
A smell of wine and cheap perfume  
For a smile they can share the night  
It goes on and on, and on, and on  
  
[Chorus]  
Strangers waiting  
Up and down the boulevard  
Their shadows searching in the night  
Streetlight people  
Living just to find emotion  
Hiding somewhere in the night  
  
Working hard to get my fill  
Everybody wants a thrill  
Payin' anything to roll the dice  
Just one more time  
Some will win, some will lose  
Some were born to sing the blues  
Oh, the movie never ends  
It goes on and on, and on, and on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop believin'  
Hold on to the feelin'  
Streetlights, people  
  
Don't stop believin'  
Hold on  
Streetlight people  
  
Don't stop believin'  
Hold on to the feelin'  
Streetlight people
