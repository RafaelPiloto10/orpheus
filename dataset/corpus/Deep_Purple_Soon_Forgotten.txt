Sometimes I sit and wonder  
Sometimes I just sit  
I hope you all know  
What you're doing  
Anyway  
Who is driving this thing  
  
Did you know  
The warriors of the flat earth  
Have become the tyrants of the globe  
It's 'round about that time again  
She cried  
It's all for one my friends'  
  
All my dreams are soon forgotten  
When you leave me on the shelf  
I can think of nothing better  
Than to sit here by myself  
  
Least remembered  
Soon forgotten  
Didn't matter anyway  
How can I ever miss you  
If you never go away  
  
I'm amazed by the way  
How are you?  
I'm amazed how could you  
It wasn't that good to start with  
Anyway  
Nothings quite that simple  
  
Did you know  
The warriors of the flat earth  
Have become the tyrants of the globe  
It's 'round about that time again  
She cried  
It's all for one my friends  
  
Least remembered  
Soon forgotten  
Didn't matter anyway  
How can I ever miss you  
If you never go away  
  
Sometimes I sit and wonder  
Sometimes I just sit  
I hope you all know  
What you're doing  
Anyway  
Who is driving this thing  
  
Least remembered  
Soon forgotten  
Didn't matter anyway  
How can I ever miss you  
If you never go away
