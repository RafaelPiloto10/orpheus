Here comes Santa Claus,  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane,  
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  
Pullin' on the reins.  
Bells are ringin', children singin',  
All is merry and bright.  
So hang your stockings and say your prayers,  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane,  
He's got a bag that's filled with toys  
For boys and girls again.  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,  
Oh what a beautiful sight,  
So jump in bed, and cover your head,  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
[musical interlude]  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane,  
He'll come around when chimes ring out,  
It's Christmas time again.  
Peace on earth will come to all,  
If we just follow the light,  
So let's give thanks to the Lord above  
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
