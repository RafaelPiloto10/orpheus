Psst, hey, come on man, wake up.  
Oh, yeah, yeah!  
I see the power,  
Changin' hands  
Risin' from the streets  
A self made businessman,  
Knows how the system can be beat.  
Oh, we're the lost generation,  
Have no place to go,  
The road to destruction,  
Is all we need to know,  
Cause it's a rip off,  
We're stripped, drawn, and cheated,  
We're flat stone cold lied to  
But we're not defeated, nooo, sir  
Easy money,  
It's your way out,  
Join the Family  
No middleman,  
No I.R.S.  
Your ticket out of poverty  
Oh, we're the lost generation,  
I hold fate from a string  
Lookin' for direction  
Reachin' out for anything, so  
Dream another dream  
This dream is over, (oooh oooh oh)  
Dream another dream  
This dream is over, (dream another dream)  
Dream another dream  
This dream is over, (oooh) over yeah, (dream another dream)  
So dream another dream  
(Solo)  
Ah,  
Yeow!!!!  
Oh, it's a rip off,  
We're stepped on an' cheated,  
Flat stone cold lied to,  
We're not defeated, noooo,  
Dream another dream, this dream is over, (oooh oooh oh)  
Dream another dream, this dream is over, (dream another dream)  
Dream another dream, this dream is over, (oooh oooh oh) oh  
Dream another dream, this dream is over, over yeah, (dream another dream)  
Dream another dream, (ooh ooh ooh)  
Dream another dream, (dream another dream, oooh ooh ooh)  
Dream another dream, oh, this dream's all over (dream another dream)  
Dream another dream, (dream another dream)
