We live and dream about the future  
Please ask me out, I need to pow-wow now  
So through the annals of our flavored times  
Our heroes and all their fader thoughts  
  
Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I, sing  
Lay me down, down, down, down  
Lay me down, down, down, down, down  
  
Help me off to sleep  
But take me deep again  
  
We live and dream about our heroes  
I listened closely and I said  
"I'm not sure where to place myself here, friend.  
Am I upon the gold rings and stand?"  
  
The winners write the rulebooks, the histories and lullabies  
  
Lay me down, down, down, down  
Lay me down, down, down, down, down  
  
Help me off to sleep  
(Down, down, down)  
Take me deep again  
(Down, down, down)  
I have watched you sing  
(Down, down, down)  
I picture glass wings in your head  
(Take me down, down, down)  
While golden broads and combines  
(Down, down, down)  
Or brasses mixed with lead
