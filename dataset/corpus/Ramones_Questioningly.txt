Questioningly  
Her eyes looked at me  
And then she spoke  
Aren't you some one I used to know  
And weren't we lovers a long time ago?  
Looked at her close  
Forced her into view  
Yes, I said, you're a girl  
That I, once may have knew  
But I don't love you anymore  
What do you want to talk to me for?  
You should have just let me walk by  
Memories make us cry  
  
In the morning, I'm at work on time  
My boss, he tells me  
That I'm doing fine  
When I'm going home  
Whiskey bottle  
Movie on TV  
Memories make me cry  
And I'm alone  
Just me  
Just me  
Questioningly  
  
But I don't love you anymore  
Why do you want to talk to me for?  
You should have just let me walk by  
Memories make us cry  
  
Looked at her close  
Forced her into view  
Yes, I said  
You're a girl  
That I, once may have knew  
  
Questioningly  
Her eyes looked at me  
And then she spoke  
Aren't you someone that I used to know  
And weren't we lovers a long time ago?
