Who the hell you guys think you are  
Rockstars or somethin', oh, yeah  
  
Oh, yeah, limousines, champagne  
Get my clothes custom made  
  
I take handfuls of pills  
Trash my house in the hills  
Smash up my cars  
Just to give me my thrills  
  
I'm rollin' 'round the world  
I'm gonna do me 'bout a million girls  
Well, I break all their hearts  
Bring 'em down to their knees  
  
I do what I want  
Yeah, I do as I please  
  
I wanna be a big rockstar, yeah  
I wanna drive a big black car, yeah  
All the girls'll stroke on my guitar  
When I'm a big rock star  
  
Want my face on my wall  
Want Cameron Diaz just to give me call  
I've been nobodies fool  
Gonna die while I'm cool  
  
I make all their laws  
And I break all their rules  
  
Porno stars  
King of sleaze  
Dirty movies  
Hey, look at me  
  
Velvet rope, V.I.P.  
Hollywood cowboy  
Mama look at me  
  
I wanna be a big rockstar, yeah  
I wanna drive a big black car, yeah  
I'm gonna push it all way to far  
When I'm a big rock star  
  
C.C., do it  
  
I play for the masses  
Sex on the stage  
Girls shake their asses  
They come taste my fame  
  
Backstage is my thing  
So get in the ring  
We do anything  
'Cause here I'm the king  
  
I wanna be a big rockstar, yeah  
I wanna drive a big black car, yeah  
I wanna be a big rockstar, yeah  
I wanna drive a big black car, yeah  
  
Who the hell you think you are?
