HARD ACT TO FOLLOW  
WRITERS DAVID CHAMBERLAIN, GARY NICHOLSON  
My leading lady is gone  
And it's so hard to go on  
Without the part she played  
My life's just an empty stage.  
She's a hard act to follow  
I thought I'd find somebody by now  
She's a hard act to follow  
Her leavin' brought the whole house down.  
She was so right for the part  
The way she fit into my heart  
After the love she gave  
Who could ever take her place?  
She's a hard act to follow  
I thought I'd find somebody by now  
She's a hard act to follow  
Her leavin' brought the whole house down.  
She's a hard act to follow  
I thought I'd find somebody by now  
She's a hard act to follow  
Her leavin' brought the whole house down...
