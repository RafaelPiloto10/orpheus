Keep smiling, keep smiling, keep smiling, keep right on smiling  
I know sometimes your whole world seems blue  
Seems like the whole weight of the world is resting on you  
But remember when you hang your head, it's hard to see the sun  
There's a brighter day, yes it is, just ask and I sure will come  
But you've got to keep (keep smiling) well, ooh, yeah  
(keep smiling) keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on  
(keep smiling) ooh, ha (don't you ever stop smiling)  
Oh, don't you ever stop, no, no, no, oh, when you've got to keep on stepping
on  
You know that you've got to be strong and understand the facts of life  
You won't get no place until you make some sacrifice  
Try to make it a little easy when you're doing it on your own  
Once you think you've got everything, the next day it's all gone  
But you got to keep (keep smiling), well, well, well, well (keep smiling)  
Oh I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but you've to keep (keep smiling),
oh---  
(don't you ever stop smiling) yeah, yeah---, oh-----, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh---  
Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, (keep smiling) keep a grin on your face yaul  
Keep on stepping now, (keep smiling) oh, keep your head up to the sky  
(keep smiling) oh-got to notice on the tip of your eyes, (keep smiling)  
You've got to keep on, keep on, keep on, (keep smiling)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (keep smiling), ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha---  
(keep smiling) oh--keep on (don't you ever stop smiling) smile, smile---  
(keep smiling)
