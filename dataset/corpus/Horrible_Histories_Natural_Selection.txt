[Intro]  
Mmmm yeah.  
Mmmm yeah.  
  
[Verse 1]  
People thought all animals  
Arrived here unrelated  
The world began, and then came man  
All perfectly created  
  
[Verse 2]  
But then someone looked up a tree.  
And said "That monkey looks just like me!"  
So it really was a mystery  
What I'd learned in natural history!  
  
[Verse 3]  
So I joined HMS Beagle  
Watched the eagle and the seagull  
We studied rock and plants  
Flowers, trees and bees and ants  
  
[Verse 4]  
Slept on hammocks without pillows  
Eating rats and armadillos  
Till I realised on reflec-tion  
It's natural selection! Yeah!  
  
[Verse 5]  
Natural selection means  
Each animal evolved  
To blend with its surroundings  
Ch-ch-changes were involved  
  
[Verse 6]  
So birds with different, foods to seek.  
Seem to have developed, different beaks.  
  
[Verse 7]  
And over time they'd,  
Modified  
So just the fittest  
Of them all survived!  
  
[Verse 8]  
On the Isles of Galapagos  
I noted the giant tortoise  
Had interesting shells  
And I rode on them as well  
  
[Verse 9]  
Iguanas land and swimming  
Meant my new theory was winning  
It all led in the direction  
Of natural selection.  
  
[Verse 10]  
My findings went with outrage  
From the ch-ch-ch-ch-church of England  
And from me.  
  
[Verse 11]  
The idea that we came from ch-ch-chimps  
Questioned my own Christianity  
But it was hard to disagree!  
  
[Verse 12]  
Every species new mutation  
Had a perfect explanation  
It seems the worlds inception  
Must predate common perception  
  
[Verse 13]  
And if lack of adaptation  
Means a fatal limitation  
So each creature's imperfection  
Over time gets a correction  
  
[Verse 14]  
Meaning animal collections  
Grow unique means of protection  
And to fail nature's inspection  
Means immediate rejection  
Which all leads to the detec-tion  
Of natural selection!  
Natural selection!
