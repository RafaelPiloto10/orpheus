The Weight  
  
I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past DEAD  
I just need some place where I can lay my head  
Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed  
He just grinned and shook my hand, "No" was all he said.  
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny, and you put the load right on me  
I picked up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide  
Then I saw old Carmen and the devil walking side by side  
I said, "Hey Carmen, c'mon, let's go downtown"  
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around"  
  
Chorus  
  
Go down, Miss moses, ain't nothin you can say  
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on judgement day  
Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Annalee  
He said, "Do me a favor, so, won't you stay and keep Annalee comapany"  
  
Chorus  
  
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog  
Said, "I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog"  
I said, "Wait a minute Chester-you know, I'm a peaceful man"  
He said, "That's ok, boy, won't you feed him when you can"  
  
Chorus  
  
Get you cannonball, now to take me down the line  
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time  
To get back to miss Fanny, you know she's the only one  
Who sent me here, with her regards for everyone  
  
Chorus
