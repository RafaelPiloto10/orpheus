When you feel the sunlight  
Fade into the cold night  
Don't know where to turn  
I don't know where to turn  
And all the dreams you're dreaming  
Seem to lose their meaning  
Let me in your world  
Baby, let me in your world  
All you need is someone you can hold  
Don't be sad, you're not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
I will be here for you  
Somewhere in the night  
Somewhere in the night  
I'll shine a light for you  
Somewhere in the night  
I'll be standing by  
I will be here for you  
  
In this world of strangers  
Of cold and friendly faces  
Someone you can trust  
Oh there's someone you can trust  
I will be your shelter  
I'll give you my shoulder  
Just reach out for my love  
Reach out for my love  
Call my name and my heart will hear  
I will be there, there's nothing to fear  
  
[Chorus]
