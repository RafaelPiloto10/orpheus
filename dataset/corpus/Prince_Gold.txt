There's a mountain and it's mighty high  
You cannot see the top, unless you fly  
There's a molehill, of proven ground  
There ain't nowhere to go if you hang around  
  
1-Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold  
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told  
What's the use of money  
If you ain't gonna break the mold  
Even at the center of the fire, there is cold  
And all that glitters ain't gold  
And all that glitters ain't gold  
  
There's an ocean, of despair  
There are people livin' there  
They're unhappy, each and every day  
Hell is not fashion, so whatcha tryin' to say?  
(repeat 1)  
  
There's a lady, ninety nine-years-old  
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul  
That's a theory and if you don't want to know  
Step aside and make a way for those who want to go...
