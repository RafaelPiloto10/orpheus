"You know I wanna  
Get a little somethin'  
You didn't know  
Little,  
It ain't what you got baby  
It's what you do with it  
And you doin' it  
You doin' it"  
  
And my guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire  
Caught in a love affair with feminine narcotic style  
So fine, you got good taste  
But I hate to see your pretty body go to waste  
Before I see you in the bare necessities  
Like Coco de Mer or La ?, babe  
Get me aroused in that intimate attire  
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like  
Think you got a secret, everybody knows  
Lady in the street, in bed hos and me  
Wearin' Cosabella with nothin' but a trench coat  
Nothin's better  
  
Girl, you're sexy  
When you slip it on  
Love to see you in it  
If you add a little splash  
You can have a lot of fun  
(You know what I'm talkin' about)  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie  
Wearing a teddy and a thong with the high-strung lace  
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder,  
Do G strings and pumps  
A sheer baby doll, put it on  
Is it up to her  
  
Girl, you're a goddess  
So when you sip that ? on,  
Stop, your sexy silhouette  
On the wall turns me on, oh  
Good god, your bod, and my bod  
Keep deep, don't mope when I say  
Nice but nasty, I wanna tell your man  
I do what I say  
  
Girl, you're sexy  
When you put it on  
Love to see you in it  
'Cause when you add a little splash  
You can have a lot of fun  
(You know what you're doin')  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What you gonna do  
You gonna put it on  
Girl, you so sexy  
Ain't gotta take it off  
I want you to feed my fetish  
Slide them thigh highs down  
Looking at you got me up  
Throw them heels back on, c'mon  
  
Oh  
  
Put it on  
Girl you know you turn me on  
On, hey, oh  
  
[Chorus: x3]
