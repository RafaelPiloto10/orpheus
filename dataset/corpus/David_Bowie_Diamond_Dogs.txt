This ain't rock'n'roll. This is genocide!  
  
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent  
You asked for the latest party  
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump  
Dressed like a priest you was  
Todd Browning's freak you was  
  
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee  
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see  
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees  
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal  
  
(Will they come?)  
I'll keep a friend serene  
(Will they come?)  
Oh baby, come unto me  
(Will they come?)  
Well, she's come, been and gone.  
Come out of the garden, baby  
You'll catch your death in the fog  
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat  
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase  
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope  
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go  
  
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach  
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch  
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake  
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are stabilized  
  
(Will they come?)  
I'll keep a friend serene  
(Will they come?)  
Oh baby, come unto me  
(Will they come?)  
Well, she's come, been and gone.  
Come out of the garden, baby  
You'll catch your death in the fog  
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs  
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch  
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch  
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch  
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow  
  
(Will they come?)  
I'll keep a friend serene  
(Will they come?)  
Oh baby, come unto me  
(Will they come?)  
Well, she's come, been and gone.  
Come out of the garden, baby  
You'll catch your death in the fog  
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs  
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow  
Call them the Diamond Dogs  
Dogs  
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them  
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo  
Call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
Keep cool  
Diamond Dogs rule, OK  
Hey-hey-hey-hey  
Beware of the Diamond Dogs  
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
