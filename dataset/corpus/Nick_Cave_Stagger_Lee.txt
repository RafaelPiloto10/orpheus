It was back in '32 when times were hard  
He had a colt. 45 and a deck of cards  
Stagger lee  
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat  
Had a '28 ford, had payments on that  
Stagger lee  
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow  
And told him, never ever come back no more  
Stagger lee  
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the  
Mud  
Till he came to a place called the bucket of blood  
Stagger lee  
He said mr motherfucker, you know who I am  
The barkeeper said, no, and I don't give a good  
Goddamn  
To stagger lee  
He said, well bartender, it's plain to see  
I'm that bad motherfucker called stagger lee  
Mr. Stagger lee  
Barkeep said, yeah, I've heard your name down the  
Way  
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day  
Mr stagger lee  
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said  
'cause stag put four holes in his motherfucking head  
Just then in came a broad called nellie brown  
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town  
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt  
Over to stagger lee, she starts to flirt  
With stagger lee  
She saw the barkeep, said, o god, he can't be  
Dead!  
Stag said, well, just count the holes in the  
Motherfucker's head  
She said, you ain't look like you scored in quite a  
Time.  
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime  
Mr. Stagger lee  
But there's something I have to say before you  
Begin  
You'll have to be gone before my man billy dilly comes  
In,  
Mr. Stagger lee  
I'll stay here till billy comes in, till time comes  
To pass  
And furthermore I'll fuck billy in his motherfucking  
Ass  
Said stagger lee  
I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know  
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one  
Fat boy's asshole  
Said stagger lee  
Just then billy dilly rolls in and he says, you  
Must be  
That bad motherfucker called stagger lee  
Stagger lee  
Yeah, I'm stagger lee and you better get down on  
Your knees  
And suck my dick, because if you don't you're gonna be  
Dead  
Said stagger lee  
Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head  
And stag filled him full of lead  
Oh yeah.
