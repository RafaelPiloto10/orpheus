Feather in your cap if you catch a robber,  
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through  
Pay close attention to my story  
You'll find every word is true.  
Junk man standing on the corner  
Selling death, no conscience has he.  
  
In the name of God, won't somebody stop him  
Stop him, think about the children  
Its a matter of life and death, you see.  
Ain't no time to stand back and point your finger,  
We've got to face reality.  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
Don't turn your back on this problem, people,  
Too much depends on you and me.  
Desperate with no sense of value,  
Just an evil mind lurking through the night.  
  
Because of you, the streets ain't safe no more for walking,  
Cause you're feeling so up-tight.  
Take a look around
