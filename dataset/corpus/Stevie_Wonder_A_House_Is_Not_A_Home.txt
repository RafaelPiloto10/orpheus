A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there,  
But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home  
When there's no one there to hold you tight,  
And no one there you can kiss good night.  
  
A room is still a room, even when there's nothing there but gloom,  
But a room is not a house, and a house is not a home  
When the two of us are far apart,  
And one of us has a brok, en heart.  
  
Now and then I call your name,  
And suddenly your face appears,  
But it's just a crazy game, when it ends, it ends in tears.  
  
Darling, have a heart, don't let one mistake keep us apart.  
I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home.  
When I climb the stair and turn the key,  
Oh, please be there, still in love with me.
