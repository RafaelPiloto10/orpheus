Well excuse me if I break my own heart  
It's mine from the finish I guess  
It was mine from the start  
This situation just don't seem so goddamn smart  
This situation is tearing me apart  
  
So you'll have to excuse me  
I break my own heart  
  
Well excuse me if I break my own heart tonight  
Some things are born too strong  
Have to learn how to fight  
This situation keeps me drinking every goddamn midnight  
This situation don't seem so right  
  
So excuse me if I break my own heart tonight  
Well excuse me if I break my own heart tonight  
  
After all it was mine  
After all it was mine  
After all it was mine  
Can I have it back sometime?  
  
So if the rain falls down on your Mississippi town  
Let your eyes drift easy into mine  
If the rain falls down on your Mississippi town  
Let your eyes drift into mine  
You're on the road but your diary entry reads blank(it reads blank)  
Is this some sort of joke to you?  
Is this some sort of joke to you?  
  
Well excuse me if I break my own heart tonight  
Well excuse me if I break my own heart tonight  
After all it was mine  
After all it was mine  
After all it was mine  
Can I have it back sometime?
