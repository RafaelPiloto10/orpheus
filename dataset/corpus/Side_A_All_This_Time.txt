Days and nights are passing by  
I just couldnt get you off my mind  
All this time  
I, I?ve known you all my life  
I always knew  
You?ll always be a friend to me  
You?re there all this time  
You were always there for me  
You opened up my eyes  
Now I can see  
That the one I've been looking for  
Was here  
Right from the start  
All this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
That can make a brand new world  
In my life  
All this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
But I?ve never really looked inside my heart  
It was you all along  
All this time  
Now, now I understand  
Why I always cared enough for you  
All this time?  
Oh you, lift me up when I am down  
You gave me all the strength I need  
When I'm weak  
You turn my hopes up high  
You were always there for me  
You opened up my eyes  
Now I can see  
That the one I've been looking for  
Was here  
Right from the start  
All this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
That can make a brand new world  
In my life  
All this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
But I?ve never really looked inside my heart  
It was you all along  
All this time  
You lift my soul up high  
I can barely touch the sky  
You bring out all the best  
That I can ever be  
All this time?  
all this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
No one in this world can take your place?  
All this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
That can make a brand new world  
In my life  
all this time  
I?ve been searching for a love  
Coz He?s finally given you in my life  
It was you all along  
All this time  
Oh its you.. Oh..  
I love you all this time
