I see you walkin' down the street  
You're turnin' into paradise  
The boys are crawlin' at your feet  
Burn them and turn them to ice  
No one gets a piece of your heart  
It's over 'cause you won't let it start  
You keep your love in chains, love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isn't it time (enough), isn't it time (enough)  
Oh yeah  
  
They know you feel just like a queen  
Baby, are you havin' life  
But all the things they'd never seen  
Stab at your heart like a knife  
  
No one knows the way that you love  
It's over when it's never begun  
You keep your love in chains, love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isn't it time (enough), oh, isn't it time (enough)  
Oh yeah  
  
But isn't it time (enough), oh isn't it time (enough)  
You keep your love in chains, love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isn't it time (enough), oh isn't it time (enough)  
  
Love in chains, love in chains  
Love in chains, love in chains  
Love in chains, love in chains  
Love in chains, love in chains  
Love in chains
