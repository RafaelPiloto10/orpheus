I've got no worries  
I've got no regrets  
Who they think they're kidding  
They ain't seen nothing yet  
  
You point my finger try to tell me I'm wrong  
That never stopped me from singin' my song  
I got the last laugh at the things they do  
Eliminate them at the turn of a screw  
  
I never lived by nobody's rules  
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools  
Can't push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back, it's my turn to fly  
  
[Chorus]  
Come hell, hell or high water  
Nothing's gonna hold me down  
Come hell, hell or high water  
Ain't no body messin' me around  
  
I see their wicked ways  
and miles of endless lies  
Their jaded lives  
Couldn't erase my smile  
  
But what's this shit that I just heard  
Son of a bitch you're working on my nerves  
I'll watch you choke on your last words  
It's about time you got what you deserved  
  
I never lived by nobody's rules  
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools  
Can't push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back, it's my turn to fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got something that's been on my mind  
Come close I'll tell you the problem that I find  
I'm sick and tired of the damage you've done  
Don't blame me I ain't the one  
Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past  
Kiss my ass  
  
[Chorus]
