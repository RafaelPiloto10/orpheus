What can they all be thinkin'  
Wanna' take the cross off of the hill  
Put away the pledge of allegiance  
Lord, just the thought gives me a chill  
They can take god off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny  
How were all gonna see him on the judgment day  
So sing it loud  
  
[Chorus]  
One more time  
Hear what you say  
When you got the truth inside, now they can't take that away  
One more time  
'cause it ain't too late  
Hold on to what you believe 'cause they can't take that  
They can't take that away  
  
They want to change somethin' somewhere for everybody  
Right now a change ain't what we need  
Just like my father's father before him  
They held on with pride to everything they believed  
They can take god off our money but, in the end 'o ain't it funny  
How were all gonna see him on the judgment day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a fire that burns forever  
Come a day we ain't gonna take no more  
  
[Chorus]
