Night turns to daylight  
And things are quite the same  
You wake up and make up  
Another day's routine  
Then the sun begins to shine as if  
The face of god were near  
And a trumpet sound is played as if  
All the world could hear  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's the day when the wind blows  
That's the day when the earth begins to move  
When the lion and the lamb start walking  
Two by two  
That's the day when the wind blows  
When the sky is torn in two  
And the lord of lords in all his glory  
Comes for you  
Oh, when the wind blows  
  
Beside you, behind you  
Believers on their knees  
And somehow you know now  
Everyone you see  
So hand-in-hand you fly away  
To meet him in the sky  
This man that you have dreamed about  
He's right before your eyes  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
That's the day when the earth begins to move  
When the lion and the lamb start walking  
Two by two  
When the wind blows  
When the sky is torn in two  
And the lord of lords in all his glory  
Comes for you oh, when the wind blows  
Well be swept away, swept away  
When the wind blows
