I try to sing this song  
I...I try to stand up  
But I can't find my feet  
I try, I try to speak up  
But only in you I'm complete  
  
Gloria...in te domine  
Gloria...exultate  
Gloria...Gloria  
Oh Lord, loosen my lips  
  
I try to sing this song  
I...I try to get in  
But I can't find the door  
The door is open  
You're standing there  
You let me in  
  
Gloria...in te domine  
Gloria...exultate  
Oh Lord, if I had anything  
Anything at all  
I'd give it to you  
I'd give it to you  
  
Gloria...Gloria...
