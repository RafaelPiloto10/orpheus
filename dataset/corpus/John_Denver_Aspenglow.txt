See the sunlight through the pine  
Taste the warm of winter wine  
Dream of softly falling snow  
Winterskol Aspenglow  
  
As the winter days unfold  
Hearts grow warmer with the cold  
Peace of mind is all you know  
Winterskol Aspenglow  
  
Aspen is a life to live  
See how much there is to give  
See how strongly you believe  
See how much you may receive  
  
Smiling faces all around  
Laughter is the only sound  
Memories that can't grow old  
Winterskol Aspenglow  
  
Aspen is a life to live  
See how much there is to give  
See how strongly you believe  
See how much you may receive  
  
See the sunlight through the pine  
Taste the warm of winter wine  
Dream of softly falling snow
