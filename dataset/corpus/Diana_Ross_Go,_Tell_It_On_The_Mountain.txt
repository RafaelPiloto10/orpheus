Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
When I was just a learner  
I sought by night and day  
To have the good lord help me  
To guide me on my way  
For I am like a shepherd  
My hopes and faith to guard  
Each day I find the answer  
And love is my reward  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
The shepherds kept their watching  
O'er silent flocks by night  
When lo! throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When high above the earth  
Rang out an angels' chorus  
To hail our savior's birth  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain  
Our jesus christ is born  
Our jesus, jesus christ is born  
That jesus christ is born  
Go and tell, tell it on the mountain  
That jesus christ, christ is born
