And so you have come back to me  
And say the old love's growing yet  
You tried through all these weary years  
You tried too vainly to forget  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives us back our youth  
The loving heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth  
Come close and let me see your face  
Your raven hair is tinged with snow  
Oh yes, it is the same dear face  
I loved so many years ago  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives us back our youth  
The loving heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth  
Farewell, I think I love you yet  
As friend to friend God bless you dear  
And guide you through these weary years  
To where the skies are always clear  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives us back our youth  
The loving heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives us back our youth  
The loving heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth
