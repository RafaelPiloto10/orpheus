Where do you go  
When it is all complicating  
Where do you go  
When you steer it all away  
Where will you find  
The nerve to find it complicating  
What will you find  
When you steer it all away  
I could go on but it's only conversation  
I could go on but it seems likes persuasion  
Where do you go  
You know that it's complicating  
Where do you go  
When you steer it all away  
I could go on but it's only conversation  
I could go on but it seems likes persuasion  
Where do you go  
You know that it's complicating  
Where will you go  
When you steer it all away  
How can you go  
You know that it is just persuasion  
How can you go  
When you steer it all away
