Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...  
I know my enemies...  
Everytime I know...  
I know my enemies...  
They will come and  
Sit round your table  
Wanting to kill you like  
Cain kill Abel  
Only trying to find an easy way  
That they can try to eliminate you  
Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...  
I know my enemies...  
Everytime I know my enemies...  
Anytime you see your friend there  
The first thing you see  
Is him teeth, yes  
But if you could see the inner part  
Then we gonna know the sucker have got a wicked heart  
May Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know, everyday...  
I know my enemies...  
Said I know my enemies...  
Oh Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...  
I know my enemies...  
Long time I been watching them, I know...  
I know my enemies...  
Your enemies stay far from you  
And they don't...  
They don't want to see you  
While your friends will come  
With a smiling face  
And it don't mean another shoe's lace...  
So Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know my enemies...  
Everyday I know...  
Oh my enemies...  
Jah Jah guide me from my friends...  
I know, I know, I know them, I know them...
