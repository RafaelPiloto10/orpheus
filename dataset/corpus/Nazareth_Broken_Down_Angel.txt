She used to be someone you could depend on  
To brighten up your coldest winter day  
But the one she leaned upon  
Let her down, now has moved on  
  
And morning brings another empty day  
Now she's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way  
  
She used to be a girl of simple pleasures  
A breath of spring to chase your blues away  
But now she bears a cross, for a love that she has lost  
No sunshine in her life just clouds of gray  
  
Now she's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way  
  
She's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way  
  
Now she's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way
