See'est la belle 'la Louise Anne te va fomma faire ma faume  
Ta jolie a ta meion a ta pas bon  
Why did you go and leave me in Lou'siana sweet Susannah  
You left me for a fella who wore a big black umbrella  
He came to the sticks to buy some antiques  
He was a wheeler and a dealer the woman stealer  
See'est la belle 'la Louise Anne...  
Oh sweet Susannah you're a loser  
You ran off and you left me for a California boozer  
You stole all his goods and left him in the woods  
I hope you store in a bore you flirty girlie  
See'est la belle 'la Louise Anne...  
[ fiddle ]  
Please come back to Lou'siana sweet Susannah  
Since you left nothing's right and the catfish don't bite  
I can't pay my rent cause you stole every cent  
And I can't stand to see my landlord cry  
See'est la belle 'la Louise Anne...
