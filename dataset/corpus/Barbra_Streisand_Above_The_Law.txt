This is me talking to you  
Tell me what your heart can do?  
And take me by surprise  
Whatever you see, you'll never be alone with me  
  
I close or open the door  
Telling you that less is more  
You cannot disguise whatever you do  
No one is above the law  
  
In these dark and troubled times  
People just surviving, we live a double life  
  
You'd be safe and warm at home  
Something else is going on  
We don't have to kiss  
And say no more about it  
  
And if your eyes are watching me  
Baby, life could be so beautiful  
And we become invisible  
The pleasure is the punishment for the crime  
  
Break away the chains that bind  
It's not enough to be satisfied  
It's knowing how it all begins  
Or knowing where the heart belongs  
  
And we all make mistakes  
It's your heart and my heart  
And no one can take part  
And our love, love above the law  
  
So you decide we go insane  
I know what you came here for  
Whether you're mine, I'll never be sure  
We'll ever be above the law  
  
On this dark and stormy night  
Where these walls may hide us  
(The walls may hide us)  
You sigh and let me in  
  
You let me hold you in these arms of mine  
(One flame inside)  
Tomorrow is eternity  
(Temtation eyes)  
And we may get to kiss and say no more about it  
(No tears to cry)  
  
And if my eyes are watching you  
Baby, life could be so beautiful  
(So beautiful)  
And everything is possible  
(Everything is possible)  
And we become invisible  
(We become invisible)  
  
It's your heart and my heart  
And no one can take part  
I'll always be with you  
It's what I'm living for  
  
The end of my rainbow  
Is outside your window  
And our love is one love  
Love above the law  
(Love above the law)  
  
It's your heart and my heart  
And no one can take part  
I'll always be with you  
It's what I'm living for  
(It's what I'm living for)  
  
The end of my rainbow  
Is outside your window  
Love above the law
