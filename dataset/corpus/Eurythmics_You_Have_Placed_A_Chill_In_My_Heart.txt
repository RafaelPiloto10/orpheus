Take me to the desert  
Where there's got to be  
A whole heap of nothing  
For you and me  
Take me to the desert  
Take me to the sand  
Show me the colour of your right hand.  
  
Love is a temple  
Love is a shrine  
Buy some love at the five and dime  
A little bit of love  
From the counter store  
Get it on credit if you need some more.  
I'll the figure of your disgrace  
A criss cross pattern upon your face  
A woman's just too tired to think  
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink.  
  
I wish I was invisible  
So I could climb through the telephone  
When it hurts my ear  
And it hurts my brain  
And it makes me feel too much  
Too much too much too much.  
Don't cut me down  
When I'm talking to you  
'Cause I'm much too tall  
To feel that small.  
  
Love is a temple  
Love is a shrine  
Love is pure  
And love is blind  
Love is a religious sign  
I'm gonna leave this love behind.  
Love is hot and love is cold  
I've been bought and I've been sold  
Love is rock and love is roll  
I just want someone to hold.
