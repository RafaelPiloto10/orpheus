Well come on pretty baby won't you walk with me  
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me  
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance  
Try to save our romance  
  
Chorus:  
Slow down  
Baby now you're moving way too fast  
You've got to give me a little lovin'  
Five me a little lovin'  
If you want our love to last  
  
Well I tried to take you home baby after school  
Carry your books home too  
I need your lovin' baby oh so fast  
The best little woman I ever had  
  
Chorus:  
Slow down  
Baby now you're moving way too fast  
You've got to give me a little lovin'  
give me a little lovin'  
If you want our love to last  
  
Knock me down  
Step on my face  
Slander my name all over the place  
Do anything that you want to do  
What the hell you tryin' to do  
  
Chorus:  
Slow down  
Baby now you're moving way too fast  
You've got to give me a little lovin'  
give me a little lovin'  
If you want our love to last.......  
(just rappin' and rollin')
