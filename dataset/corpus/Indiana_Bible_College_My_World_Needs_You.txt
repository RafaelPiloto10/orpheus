[Chorus 1]  
Show me Your face, fill up this space,  
My world need You right now, my world need You right now.  
I can't escape being afraid, fill me with You right now,  
My world needs You right now.  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Power fall down, bring with it a sound,  
That points us to You right now, erase substitutes right now.  
Fix what I see and God, please fix me.  
My world needs you right now, let us see You right now. (X2)  
  
[Verse]  
Every heart in the world, God needs You to rescue.  
Storms have come and torn our hearts in two, we need You.  
  
[Chorus]  
Show me Your face, fill up this space,  
My world needs You right now, my world needs You right now.  
  
[Bridge 1]  
Storms may come but when we call Your Name, all things change.  
Kingdoms fall, one thing forever reigns is Your Name.  
Oh. Oh. Oh.  
  
[Bridge 2]  
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus (X2)  
  
[Bridge 3]  
Storms may come but when we callYour Name, all things change.  
Kingdoms fall, one thing forever reigns is Your Name.  
Oh how sweet to know Your great Name will never change, it stays the same.  
  
[Ending]  
Show me Your face, come fill this place,  
My world needs You right now, my world needs You right now.
