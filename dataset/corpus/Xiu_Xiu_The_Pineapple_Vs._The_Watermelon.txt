Can I pray for your return?  
The bird I am looking for is not in me  
It is you  
It's so clear you missed it  
What we saw in you  
Green like flame  
someone felt something pure  
And told it all to you  
That was why you killed yourself  
To prove it wasn't true  
say hello to Cory's mom  
Say hello to Freddy's mom  
Say hello to Ryan's mom  
we're all and have been  
On your side  
What is worse for you to bear?  
it's obscene  
Why you missed  
What they saw in you  
Grey like flame  
can I pray for your return?
