Every song I sing's a sad song,  
Every note seems out of key,  
Every line I write falls out of rhyme,  
Since you're far away from me.  
  
Every night I watch the stars fall,  
Watch them till I'm fast asleep,  
But when I'm sleeping, I'm not dreaming,  
Since you're far away from me.  
  
Oh but I need you,  
Honest I do,  
You know that I miss you,  
I'll always miss you.  
  
Every song I hear's a sad song,  
Every word applies to me,  
Loneliness is something I know about,  
Since you're far away from me.
