[Judah to Jesse] It is getting hard  
For you to be  
God of broken light  
Will you be the martyr  
Can't you see  
We'll follow you for life  
  
Come and walk on water  
Let'em see  
The Chosen One's Alive  
Won't be their father  
Don't you see  
They all believe your lies  
  
Are you coming back  
To the black where we hide  
Are you coming back  
I'll make you larger than life  
  
Judas and Jesus we're  
Prophecies here for all time  
And with a kiss and the our  
Destinies are sealed for life  
  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Oh no don't you do it  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Where you gonna go  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] No road to ruin  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] It's you only road home  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Oh no don't you lose it  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Where you gonna go  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Your forever ruined  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Oh your Neon God's home  
  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back  
[Judah to Jesse] To the edge of Heaven  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Our prodigal son  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back  
[Judah to Jesse] Come back forever  
[Disciples to Jesse] Come back to black  
[Judah to Jesse] Oh, the Prophet's home
