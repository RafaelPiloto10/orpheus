[Intro:]  
Over the mountains and the sea  
Your river runs with love for me  
And I will open up my heart  
And let the Healer set me free  
I'm happy to be in the truth  
And I will daily lift my hands  
For I will always sing of  
Of when Your love came down  
  
[Chorus:]  
I could sing of Your love forever (x4)  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oh I feel like dancing  
It's foolishness I know  
But when the world has seen the light  
They will dance with joy  
Like we're dancing now  
  
I could sing of your love forever (5x)
