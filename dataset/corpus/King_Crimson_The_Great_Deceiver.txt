Health-food fagot with a bartered bride  
Likes to comb his hair with a dipper ride  
Once had a friend with a cloven foot  
Once he called the tune in a checkered quit  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
In the door on the floor in a paper bag  
There's a shoe-shine boy with a gin-shop slag  
She raised him up and she called him son  
And she canonized the ground that he walked upon  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
  
Cigarettes, ice cream, Cadillacs blue jeans  
  
In the night he's a star in the Milky Way  
He's a man of the world by the light of day  
A golden smile and a proposition  
And the breath of God smells of sweet sedition  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
Sing hymns make love get high fall dead  
He'll bring his perfume to your bed  
He'll charm your life 'til the cold winds blow  
Then he'll sell your dreams to a picture show  
  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
  
Cadillacs, blue jeans, dixieland playing on the ferry  
Cadillacs, blues jeans, drop a glass full of antique sherry
