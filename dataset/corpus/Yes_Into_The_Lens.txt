Memories, how they fade so fast  
Look back, that is no escape  
Tied down, now you see too late  
Lovers, they will never wait  
  
I am a camera  
  
Take heart, I could never let you go  
And you, always let the feeling show  
Love us all, how you never broke your heart  
You lose them  
If you feel the feeling start  
  
I am a camera, camera, camera  
  
And you, may find time will blind you  
This to just remind you  
All is meant to be  
  
There, by the waterside  
Here, where the lens is wide  
You and me  
By the sea  
Taken in tranquility  
  
Taken, taken so easily  
To pass into glass reality  
Transform, to transfer, to energy  
  
Taken, taken, so easily  
To pass into glass reality  
Transformer, transferring energy
