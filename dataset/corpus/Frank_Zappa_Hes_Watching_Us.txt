[Kensington Palace Hotel  
1st script reading of "200 Motels"  
January 18, 1971]  
  
Howard: It's him, he's watching us!  
Mark: You think he heard us?  
Ian: I've been in the band for years, and. .. You can bet that he hears
everything  
Jeff: Let's go over and pretend to be nice to him  
Howard: Let's go over and pretend we don't know he's watching  
Mark: And ripping off all our good material  
Howard: Hi, man  
Ian: Hi, Frank  
Mark: Hi, man  
Jeff: Hi, Frank  
Aynsley: Hi, man  
George: Hi, Frank  
Mark: Well, that's a great new comic song you wrote, that one about the penis
and everything, I was laughing a lot while I was learning it  
Howard: Yeah, Frank, uh, it was a little hard to get into it first, but, uh,
once we got the drift. ..  
Jeff: That's a real great part you got in there for the chorus when they go
ran-tan-toon ran-ta-tan, while I steal the room and everything, I don't mind
he's ripping it off so long I get paid. ..  
Mark: Me too, I won't even care 'bout the part where it goes "what can I say
about this elixir?" so long as me and Howard and Jeff get credit for special
material, there's some bad ground acid. .. Aynsley, you can take it with a
grain of salt, ha ha ha. ..  
Aynsley: I don't mean to upset you, lads. .. I don't mean to upset you, lads,
but the reason my retorts were so snappy is because he's making me do this, I
should imagine he's making you do yours too, isn't he?  
Howard: Get out of here, you creep, you used to live in his house!  
Aynsley: See you later, lads
