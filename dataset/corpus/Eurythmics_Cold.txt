Come to me  
Do and be done with me  
(Cold cold cold)  
Don't I exist for you  
Don't I still live for you  
(Cold cold cold)  
Everything I possess  
Given with tenderness  
Wrapped in a ribbon of glass  
Time it may take us but God only knows  
How I've paid for those things in the past  
Dying is easy it's living that scares me to death  
I could be so content hearing the sound of your breath  
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight  
That falls from the heavenly skies  
Catch me and let me dive under  
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes  
I want to be with you baby  
Slip me inside of your heart  
Don't I belong to you baby  
Don't you know that nothing can tear us apart  
Come on now come on now come on now  
Telling you that  
I loved you right from the start...  
But the more I want you the less I get  
Ain't that just the way things are...  
  
Winter has frozen us  
Let love take hold of us  
(Cold cold cold)  
Now we are shivering  
Blue ice is glittering  
(Cold cold cold)  
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight  
That falls from the heavenly skies  
Catch me and let me dive under  
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes
