(There's a pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
And I walk up and down 'neath the clock  
(By the pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
But I ain't got a thing left to hock  
  
She was peaches, she was honey, and she cost me all my money  
'cause a whirl 'round the town was her dream (was her dream)  
Took her dancin', took her dinin' till her blue eyes were shinin'  
With the sights that they never had seen (never seen)  
If you should run into a golden-haired angel  
And ask her tonight for a date  
She'll tell you somewhere there's a rich millionaire  
Who is calling again about eight  
  
(There's a pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
And I've just gotta get five or ten (five or ten)  
(From the pawnshop on a corner in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)  
Gotta be with my angel again
