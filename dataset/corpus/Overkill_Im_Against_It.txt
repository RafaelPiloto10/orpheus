Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
I don't like politics, I don't like communists  
I don't like games and fun, I don't like anyone  
And I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
I don't like Jesus freaks, I don't like circus geeks  
I don't like summer and spring, I don't like anything  
I don't like sex and drugs, I don't like waterbugs  
I don't care about poverty, all I care about is me  
And I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
I don't like playing ping pong, I don't like the Viet Cong  
I don't like Burger King, I don't like anything  
And I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it
