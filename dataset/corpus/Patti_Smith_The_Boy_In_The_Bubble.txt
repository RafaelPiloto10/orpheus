It was a slow day and the sun was beating  
On the soldiers by the side of the road  
There was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry  
It was a dry wind and it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth  
And the dead sand falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry  
It's a turn-around jump shot, it's everybody jump start  
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop chart  
Medicine is magical and magical is art  
Think of the Boy in the Bubble and the baby with the baboon heart  
And I believe there're lasers in the jungle  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere  
Staccato signals of constant information  
A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
Dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
Don't cry baby don't cry, don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry  
Don't cry
