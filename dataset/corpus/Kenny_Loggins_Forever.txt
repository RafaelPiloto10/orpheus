Now, while we're here alone  
And all is said and done  
Now I can let you know  
Because of all you've shown  
I've grown enough to tell you  
You'll always be inside of me  
  
How many roads have gone by  
So many words left unspoken  
I needed to be by your side  
If only to hold you  
  
Forever in my heart  
Forever we will be  
And even when I'm gone  
You'll be here in me  
Forever  
  
Once, I dreamed that you were gone  
I cried out trying to find you  
I begged the dream to fade away  
And please awaken me  
But night took a hold of my heart  
And left me with no one to follow  
the love that I lost to the dark  
I'll always remember  
  
Forever in my heart  
Forever we will be  
And know that when I'm gone  
You'll be here in me  
Forever in my heart  
You always thought I'd be  
I'd be yours  
Forever
