A careless heart ain't no good to no-one  
I was going back my friends to see  
Of what became of my childhood daydreams  
Of all the things that used to be  
To my surprise I stood alone  
I walked a river of a waking dream  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
  
It's all gone  
Ain't nothing for you here now  
Sail on  
  
You talk of change, something better  
Cutting down that big old tree  
There's flesh and blood in there somewhere  
But no matter what you just don't seem to see  
I walk your chambers, your empty halls  
I see you talking behind the doors  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
  
It's all gone  
Ain't nothing for you here now  
Sail on  
  
I'm sailing on, I'm running faster  
Than I ever run before  
My father say 'Know what you're thinking'  
I guess this old town seen better days  
Sail on
