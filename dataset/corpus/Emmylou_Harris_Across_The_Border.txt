(Bruce Springsteen)  
  
Tonight my bag is packed  
Tommorrow I'll walk these tracks  
That will lead me across the border  
Tommorrow my love and I  
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies  
Somewhere across the border  
  
We'll leave behind my dear  
The pain and sadness we found here  
And we'll drink from the Brazos muddy waters  
Where the sky grows gray and wide  
We'll meet on the other side  
There across the border  
  
For me you'll build a house  
High up on a grassy hill  
Somewhere across the border  
Where pain and memory  
Pain and memory have been stilled  
There across the border  
  
And sweet blossoms fill the air  
Pastures of gold and green  
Roll down into cool clear waters  
And in your arms 'neath the open skies  
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes  
There across the border  
  
Tonight we'll sing the songs  
I'll dream of you my Corazon  
And tommorrow my heart will be strong  
And may the saints blessing and grace  
Carry me safely into your arms  
There across the border  
  
For what are we  
Without hope in our hearts  
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters  
And eat the fruit from the vine  
I know love and fortune will be mine  
Somewhere across the border
