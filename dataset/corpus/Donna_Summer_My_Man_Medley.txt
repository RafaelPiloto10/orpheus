Spoken:  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
(the man I love)  
Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
Spoken:  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' "come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine"  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all  
(I got it bad and that ain't good)  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good!  
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)  
Spoken:  
Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?  
And how about you?  
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!  
My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
Spoken:  
So you see on Monday nights  
I just go out and drink and drink  
But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'  
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out  
Cryin' my heart out  
Lord above me (come on) make him love me  
Then he should  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad and that ain't good!  
No it ain't good at all you know  
Spoken:  
But listen mister big shot I've got your number  
And I'll take care of you  
And you too and you and you and you  
(some of these days)  
Some of these days  
You're gonna miss your donna  
Some of these days  
You're gonna feel so lonely  
You'll miss my huggin'  
You'll miss my kissin'  
You'll miss me honey  
When you're far away  
You're gonna be so lonely  
For me only  
Cause you know daddy  
You had you way  
And if I leave you  
You know it's gonna grieve you  
You're gonna miss your sweet lovin' donna  
Some of these days  
And if I leave you  
You know it's gonna grieve you  
You're gonna miss your sweet little donna  
Some of these days  
Hey honey call me when you got time  
Know what I mean...
