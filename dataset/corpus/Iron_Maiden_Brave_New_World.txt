Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here  
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear  
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone  
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home  
  
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all  
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall  
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell  
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now  
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh  
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth  
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home
