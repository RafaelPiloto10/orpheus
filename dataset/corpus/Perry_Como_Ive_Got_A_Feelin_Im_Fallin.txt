I'm flyin' high but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'  
Fallin' for nobody else but you  
You caught my eye and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'  
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through  
  
I used to travel single, we chanced to mingle  
Now I'm a tingle over you, hey Mister Parson  
Stand by for I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'  
Fallin' for nobody else but you  
  
Yes, it's a plain to see that he's flyin' high  
And we've got a feelin' he's fallin'  
I'm a fallin' for nobody else but you  
  
No one else will do, since you caught his eye  
And we've got a feelin' he's fallin'  
I'm a fallin' for nobody else but you  
  
I used to travel single, we chanced to mingle  
Now I'm a tingle over you, hey Mister Parson  
Stand by 'cause we've got a feelin' he's fallin'  
I'm a fallin' for nobody else but you  
  
Nobody else will do  
But you
