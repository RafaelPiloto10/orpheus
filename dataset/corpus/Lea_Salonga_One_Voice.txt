One voice singing in the darkness  
All it takes is one voice  
Singing so they here what's on your mind  
And when you look around you'll find  
There's more than one voice  
Singing in the darkness  
Joining with your one voice  
Each and every note another octive  
Hands are joined and fears are locked  
If only one voice would start it on its own  
We need just one voice facinf the unknown  
And then that one voice will never be alone  
It takes that one voice  
It takes that one voice  
Just one voice singing in the darkness  
All it takes is one voice  
Shout it out and let it ring  
Just one voice  
It takes that one voice  
And everyone will sing
