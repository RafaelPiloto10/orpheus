It's never where you think you'll find it  
The thing you think you're looking for  
It could take you all your lifetime  
And still you'd never quite be sure  
  
You could look everywhere  
Because you know it's there  
Somewhere beneath the sky  
But too close and you'll get burned  
There's no lesson learned  
Yet some people pass it by  
  
You'll see things different when you look through my eyes  
Things are different if you see what I see  
Just look closely and you'll see through my eyes  
It could be different, you'll see how it could be,  
If you can see  
  
You may need help to find your way home  
Those who brought you here have flown  
The road you take is full of hope or sadness  
The choice you make will be your own  
  
But you're not alone in there  
Just say hello in there  
Cause there are many just like you  
They'll help you find someway  
To make it all the way  
They'll tell you all you have to do  
  
You'll see things different when you look through my eyes  
Things are different if you see what I see  
Just look closely and you'll see through my eyes  
It could be different, you'll see how it could be,  
If you can see  
  
No one warns you of the heartache  
No one can hide you from the storm  
But from the shadows there will come the sunshine  
A place to dry and keep you warm  
  
Though no one tells you how  
Your hearts beating faster now  
Getting stronger day by day  
  
Suddenly it's clear, what you seek is near  
It's what you learn along the way  
  
Its never where you think you'll find it  
The thing you think you 're looking for  
Well it could take you all your lifetime  
Still you'll never quite be sure  
You'll find it, just look closer
