Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
  
When Def Jam signed me  
They hit the lottery  
It wasn't free but don't call it a robbery  
They underestimated me quite possibly  
It's like that when you a godfather b  
I'm the greatest of all time  
You heard that before  
But now when I say it  
It means so much more  
Cause It's so true  
No hype man, No crew  
No reason for ghost writers  
Every year I get tighter  
Mothers and daughters agree I'm on fire  
Check ya T-Mobile it's all over the wire  
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire  
You think I'm hot  
You preaching to the choir  
Smiling and giggling  
Thirsting like Gilligan  
More flavor than cinnamon  
They rush with adrenaline  
I make 'em nervous  
I do it on purpose  
I come back hotter  
Every time I resurface  
Drop to ya knees baby  
Praise the king  
Now ask Russell Simmons  
Who built the west wing  
I ain't gotta be cocky  
I do the damn thing  
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting  
Internationally known and respected  
You talk slick I'm too large to be affected  
You crank call my cells disconnected  
You keep slipping but my games perfected  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
  
I'm a star for real my aura is crazy  
Hollywood love me in the streets I'm gravy  
Born with a gift to inspire the hood  
You want to out do me and I wish you would  
I'm the master separate from all these cats  
I'm laughin' in '86 I balled like that  
Honey catching feeling from sittin' in Maybachs  
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax  
That's understandable but everybody relax  
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act  
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact  
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react  
Been had an entourage and platinum cards  
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton  
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don  
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blond  
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted  
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it  
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it  
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it  
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row  
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show  
I could care less who drop and blow  
My name is LL baby that's beyond the flow  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
  
These rap cats get upset with me  
When security clear out the V.I.P  
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID  
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee  
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot  
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot  
While you waste advances on gray market rocks  
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks  
A family man but hard as a rock  
And I die for my kids so stay off my block  
They might be impressed with you but I'm not  
After all these years I still walk with a bop  
Still keep the ink hot  
Still scheme like a fox  
Still ready to battle  
You don't want your career stopped  
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot  
And ran around humble with my joint on cock  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop
