And no more shall we part  
And no more shall we part  
It will no longer be necessary  
And no more will I say, dear heart  
I am alone and she has left me  
And no more shall we part  
The contracts are drawn up, the ring is locked upon the finger  
And never again will my letters start  
Sadly, or in the depths of winter  
And no more shall we part  
All the hatchets have been buried now  
And all of birds will sing to your  
Beautiful heart  
Upon the bough  
And no more shall we part  
Your chain of command has been silenced now  
And all of those birds would've sung to your beautiful heart  
Anyhow  
Lord, stay by me  
Don't go down  
I will never be free  
If I'm not free now  
Lord, stay by me  
Don't go down  
I never was free  
What are you talking about?  
For no more shall we part  
And no more shall we part
