Her heart has had more knocks than a gypsy's tambourine  
Yet it's worth more gold than any man has ever seen  
And although no one has fallen for her like she's fallen for them  
She says her heart isn't broken, it's only broken in  
She's ready for someone to love her  
Someone to hold her tight  
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  
She's weathered the whirlwind romance  
Stood through the one-night stands  
She's ready for someone to love her  
Who'll be the lucky man  
Well she has had her fill of those unfullfilling men  
You know the kind that come calling never to call back again  
Oh she's bound and determined not to be fooled anymore  
And poor thing she'll keep that promise  
The same way she kept it before  
She's ready for someone to love her  
Someone to hold her tight  
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  
She's weathered the whirlwind romance  
Stood through the one-night stands  
She's ready for someone to love her  
Who'll be the lucky man  
She's ready for someone to love her  
Someone to hold her tight  
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night  
She's weathered the whirlwind romance  
Stood through the one-night stands  
She's ready for someone to love her  
Who'll be the lucky man  
You know she's ready for someone to love her
