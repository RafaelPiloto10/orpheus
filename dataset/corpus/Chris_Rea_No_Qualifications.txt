Now he wanted to fly all those big aeroplanes  
Trans-continental and back home again  
But his brain, it was grounded  
His head could not cope  
No qualifications, no reasons for hope  
  
They told him the right way to fasten his tie  
Beat him for laughing and never said why  
They left his for dead when the results came through  
And still never asked what he wanted to do  
No qualifications so late in the day  
  
We've screwed you up, well, now you make your own way  
Now to label your trousers and label your shoes  
If you don't wear nothing then label that too  
No qualifications, you are the time born  
  
If you want to succeed you better get some qualifications  
So late in the day  
We've screwed you up, well, now you make your own way
