It's a funny thing.  
I look at you.  
I get a thrill  
I never knew.  
  
Isn't it a pity  
We never met before?  
Here we are at last.  
It's like a dream.  
  
The two of us  
A perfect team.  
Isn't it a pity  
We never met before?  
  
Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted.  
Me with the neighbors.  
You at silly labors.  
What joys untasted.  
  
My nights were sour,  
Spent with Schopenhauer  
Let's forget the past.  
Let's both agree  
  
That I'm for you  
And you're for me.  
And it's such a pity  
We never, never met before.  
  
Imagine all the years we've wasted.  
Fishing for salmon  
Losing at backgammon.  
What joys untasted.  
  
Me at the Prado,  
You in Colorado.  
Happiest of girls I'm sure to be  
If only you would say to me  
  
That it's such a pity  
We never met before.  
What an awful pity  
We never, never met before.
