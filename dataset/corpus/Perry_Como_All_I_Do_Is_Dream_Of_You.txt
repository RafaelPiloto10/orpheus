All I do is dream of you the whole night through  
With the dawn, I still go on dreamin' of you  
  
You're every thought, you're every thing  
You're every song I ever sing  
Summer, winter, autumn and spring  
  
And were there more than twenty four hours a day  
They'd be spent in sweet content, dreamin' away  
  
When skies are gray, skies are blue  
Morning, noon and night time too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you  
  
When skies are gray, skies are blue  
Morning, noon and night time too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
