Matraca Berg, Jeff Hanna  
  
Little angel, are you lonely?  
Did I hear you calling?  
I will be there right beside you  
Before night is falling  
For you I'd walk across the blazing sun  
And when my time on earth is done.....  
  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly to get to you  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly if you want me to  
  
Just as sure as the stars above us  
We'll be together  
I'll give you love that's everlasting  
If it takes forever  
I know that I can't stop the hands of time  
But when it's up for you and I......  
  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly to get to you  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly if you want me to,  
If you want me to  
  
Little angel, are you lonely?  
Did I hear you calling?  
I will be there right beside you  
Before night is falling  
  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly to get to you  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly if you want me to  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly to get to you  
I'll fly, little angel  
I'll fly if you want me to
