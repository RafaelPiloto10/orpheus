[Intro]  
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution. ...of men,
they claimed responsibility for the executions. Described as severely mentally
disturbed. It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group.
Deserve to be annihilated.  
  
[Verse 1]  
I get my kicks and I wanna start a rager  
I wanna dance like I'm on the video  
I got a fever for the violent behavior  
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo  
[Chorus]  
Bang, bang, give me fame  
Shoot me up to entertain  
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy  
You're dead, I'm well fed  
Give me death or give me head  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier  
  
[Verse 2]  
I testify like a lullaby of memories  
Broadcasting live and it's on my radio  
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam  
I love a lie just like anybody else  
  
[Chorus]  
Bang, bang, give me fame  
Shoot me up to entertain  
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy  
You're dead, I'm well fed  
Give me death or give me head  
Broadcasting from my room and playin' with my toys  
I wanna be a celebrity martyr  
The leading man in my own private drama  
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier  
  
[Bridge]  
I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen  
It's my private movie (Holy War)  
Oh baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta  
Oh this is love or it's World War Zero  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna be a celebrity martyr  
The leading man in my own private drama  
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier  
I wanna be a celebrity martyr  
The leading man in my own private drama  
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier
