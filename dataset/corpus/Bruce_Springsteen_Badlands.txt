Lights out tonight  
Trouble in the heartland  
Got a head-on collision  
Smashin' in my guts man  
I'm caught in a crossfire  
That I don't understand  
I don't give a damn  
For the same old played out scenes  
I don't give a damn  
For just the in-betweens  
Honey I want the heart, I want the soul  
I want control right now  
Talk about a dream  
Try to make it real  
You wake up in the night  
With a fear so real  
Spend your life waiting  
For a moment that just don't come  
Well don't waste your time waiting  
  
[Chorus]  
Badlands, you gotta live it every day  
Let the broken hearts stand  
As the price you've gotta pay  
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood  
And these badlands start treating us good  
  
Workin' in the fields  
Til you get your back burned  
Workin' 'neath the wheel  
Till you get your facts learned  
Baby got my facts  
Learned real good right now  
Poor man want to be rich  
Rich man want to be king  
And a king ain't satisfied  
Till he rules everything  
I want to go out tonight  
I want to find out what I got  
  
I believe in the love that you gave me  
I believe in the faith that can save me  
I believe in the hope  
And I pray that some day it may raise me  
Above these badlands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the ones who had a notion  
A notion deep inside  
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive  
I want to find one face that ain't looking through me  
I want to find one place  
I want to spit in the face of these badlands  
  
[Chorus]
