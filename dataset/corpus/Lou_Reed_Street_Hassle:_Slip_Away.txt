Believe me, that's just a lie  
That's what she tells her friends  
There's a real song, the real song  
She won't even admit it to herself  
Narrow heart, the song let's the people know  
It's a painful song  
It'll only say the truth  
It lasts for sad songs  
Twenty for wish  
Wish it won't make it so a pretty kiss and a pretty face  
Can't have it's way  
There're tramps like us who were born to pay  
  
Love has gone away  
And there's no one here now  
And there's nothing left to way  
But, oh, how I miss him, baby  
Oh, baby, come on and slip away  
Come on, baby, why don't you slip away  
  
Love has gone away  
Took the rings of my fingers  
And there's nothing left to say  
But, oh how, oh how I need you, baby  
Come on, baby, I need you baby  
Oh, please don't slip away  
I need your loving so bad, baby, please don't slip away
