Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream I dream is only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
It seems so hard to bear  
How I longed to always have you near  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream I dream is only brought with pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you
