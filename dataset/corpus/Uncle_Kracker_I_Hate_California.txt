She's probably in a Bentley  
Showing off her new fake boobies  
Tryin' to break into the movies  
With some producer  
Who seduced her  
With some sushi and cologne  
  
She's probably down on Sunset  
Doin' all the things that she ain't done yet  
With some actor she calls Hector  
Man I wish he meet Phil Spector  
And he'd ask to take her home  
  
She's lovin' Californ-I-a  
She loves the beach  
She loves to party everyday  
Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in L.A.  
Ever since she went away  
I hate California  
  
Maybe she's livin' in a commune  
Dancin' with Hippies under the moon  
It's all free love, weed and patchouli  
And there's a guru named Visuli  
And he's doin' her for sure  
  
Maybe she's scummin' some big rap star  
Drinkin' pink Cosmos at the Sky Bar  
Those Hollyweirdos with their tofu, avocado  
I bet she think she won the lotto good for her  
  
She's lovin' Californ-I-a  
She loves the beach  
She loves to party everyday  
Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in L.A.  
Ever since she went away  
I hate California  
  
I think I seen her on TV  
Last night on TMZ  
With the pretty people on parade  
She's sellin' Scientology with John, Tommy and Katie  
Man I guess she's really got it made  
  
She's lovin' Californ-I-a  
That string bikini and the sunshine on her face  
  
She's lovin' Californ-I-a  
She loves the beach  
She loves to party everyday  
Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in L.A.  
Ever since she went away  
I hate California
