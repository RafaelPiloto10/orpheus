(One, two, three)  
You, you've made no mistake  
You take everything I ever wanted into account  
When you walk into the room  
You give me, reason  
Talk in turn, never too late or too soon.  
  
You are, poetry in motion  
You inspire, power and devotion  
You are, turning all the tide underneath  
You are, the potential in me  
  
You are  
  
You are, the first one that I wish to tell  
Everything that matters  
Matters because you reflect it back to well  
  
You see understanding  
Wherever you are standing  
Between reason, passion, balance.  
  
You are, poetry in motion  
You inspire, power and devotion  
You are, turning all the tide underneath  
You are, the potential in me  
  
You are, my strongest link  
You are, everything I ever wanted to be, yeah
