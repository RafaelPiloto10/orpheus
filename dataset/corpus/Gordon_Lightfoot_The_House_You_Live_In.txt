Go first in the world, go forth with your fears  
Remember a price must be paid  
Be always too soon, be never too fast  
At the time when all bets must be laid  
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children  
Remember the woman who waits  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
  
When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail  
Beware of the dangers below  
And the song that you sing should not be too sad  
And be sure not to sing it too slow  
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces  
And know what they're doin' it for  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost  
Consider the burden of fame  
And he who is wise will not criticize  
When other men fail at the game  
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places  
Be careful while bending the law  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal  
Decide what it is that you need  
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live  
Or is it the mouth you must feed  
Be known as a man who will always be candid  
On questions that do not relate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate
