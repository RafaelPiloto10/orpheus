You got to walk a little slower when you're with her  
Take the time to be tender, that's the plan  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
You got to live for every moment that she gives you  
Make the one in a million understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
Now too many faces have come down between us  
And I was the fool to be  
And I can't deny you the wide open spaces  
As long as she stops loving me  
  
You got to stand a little closer when you hold her  
Make her feel like a woman , understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand
