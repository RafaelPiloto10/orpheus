Diamonds on the windshield, as heaven starts to cry,  
In his rear-view mirror, his angle waves goodbye,  
She knows he's got to go, she knows he's one of them,  
  
[Chorus]  
Brothers of the highway, children of the wind,  
That Detroit diesel pirate ship goes rollin' out again,  
Sailin' for that settin' sun, freedoms your best friend,  
Brothers of the highway, children of the wind.  
  
He putts the peddle to the metal, trying to out run the rain,  
Another shot of truck stop coffee, goes runnin' through his veins,  
This country turns on eighteen wheels, thank god we can depend, on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Carolina west to Denver, Batton Rouge east to Pittsburgh, Portland south to
San Diego, sail on sail on, Tallahassee north to Boston, up to  
Bangor west to Austin, coast to coast sea to sea sail on sail on, you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
God bless you brothers of the highway, children of the wind.
