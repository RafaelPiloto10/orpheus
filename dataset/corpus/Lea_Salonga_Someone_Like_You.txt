I peer through windows, watch life go by  
Dream of tomorrow and wonder why  
The past is holding me, keeping life away  
I wander lost in yesterday  
Wanting to fly, but scared to try  
  
But if someone like you, found someone like me  
And suddenly nothing would ever be the same  
My heart would take wing, and I'd feel so alive  
That someone like you found me  
  
So many secrets I long to share  
All I have needed is someone there  
To help me see a world I've never seen before  
Allow to open every door  
To set me free, so I can soar  
  
If someone like you, found someone like me  
And suddenly nothing would ever be the same  
There'll be a new way to live, a new life to love  
If someone like you found me  
  
Oh, if someone like you, found someone like me  
Then suddenly nothing would ever be the same  
My heart would take wing, and I'd feel so alive  
If someone like you found me
