Well I told ya not to fall in love  
I ain't the kind you can tie down  
You went did it anyway  
As though I'd done ya harm  
And each time I went reaching out  
That's when you let go  
Now don't try and pretend  
That you didn't know  
Chorus:  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Come on baby set me free  
I've got to be free  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Butterflies were made to fly  
I've got to be free  
Sometimes like butterflies  
Oh don't hold me no no...  
Well I told you right from the beginning  
I couldn't stay for love  
I had to go  
Now it's not because in my heart  
Baby I don't love you  
It's just because I'm meant to be  
I'm meant to be free  
Reapeat chorus  
Now it's not because in my heart  
Baby I don't love you  
It's only that I'm meant to be  
I'm meant to be free  
If you wanna love me  
If you wanna hold me  
Come on baby set me free  
I've got to be free  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Butterflies were made to fly  
I've got to be free  
Sometimes like butterflies.....
