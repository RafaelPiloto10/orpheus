I see the headlights  
Shining on the wall  
It seems, I've got a visitor  
Who is kind enough to call  
And I hope and pray, everyday  
I hope and pray, it's you  
I thought I heard some footsteps  
On the floor  
And tell me, am I dreaming  
Or is someone at the door?  
And I hope and pray, everyday  
I hope and pray, it's you  
Autumn turns to winter  
And winter turns to spring  
I only know the passing  
Of the days  
And if you were to ask me  
'Bout the meaning of my life  
It kind of lost it's meaning  
On the day you went away  
You know that when it comes  
To matters of the heart  
I thought I had it covered  
But it's tearing me apart  
And I hope and pray, everyday  
I hope and pray, it's you  
Autumn turns to winter  
And winter turns to spring  
The summer sun still lingers  
In my head  
If it wasn't for the letters  
That you wrote me from the heart  
I'd sometimes wonder, baby  
If I dreamed it all instead  
You see, I've got to feel your hand  
Upon my face  
I need to get the calling  
To rejoin the human race  
And I hope and pray, every day  
I hope and pray, it's you  
I hope and pray, every day  
I hope and pray, it's you, yeah  
Yeah, I hope and pray, every day  
I hope and pray, it's you
