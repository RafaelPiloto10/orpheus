[Verse 1:]  
If anyone ever finds a better way to love  
It'll be her,loving me  
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care  
It'll be her,loving me  
[Chorus:]  
  
She's every women I've ever known rolled up in one  
If I'm ever loved anymore,she'll be the one  
To get it done,the way it should be  
It'll be her,loving me  
[Verse 2:]  
  
If ever I'm down and out and need someone to love  
It'll be her,loving me  
When everyone else is cold and i need someone warm to hold  
It'll be her,loving me  
[Chorus(x2)]
