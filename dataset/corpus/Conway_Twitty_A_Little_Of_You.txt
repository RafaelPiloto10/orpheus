Today, I put on your favorite shirt  
I know you won't see me but what can it hurt  
It's just a piece of your memory that stayed behind  
It hangs in my closet and here in my mind  
Oh, oh, in everything that I do  
There will always be a little of you  
In my soul emblazoned and blue  
There will always be a little of you  
In every smile I have to force on my face  
In every tear that I ever taste  
In every victory that I like to share  
In every loss when I wish you were there beside me  
Oh, oh, in everything that I do  
There will always be a little of you  
In my soul emblazoned and blue  
There will always be a little of you  
I'm all over the pain  
But the scars remain to remind me  
Oh, oh, in everything that I do  
There will always be a little of you  
In my soul emblazoned and blue  
There will always be a little of you  
Oh, oh, there's a little of you
