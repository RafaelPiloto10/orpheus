Today  
Today  
  
I saw a man  
Today  
I saw a man  
Using an empty whiskey flask  
As a walkie talkie  
  
Today  
Today  
  
I saw a man  
Today  
I saw a man  
With a flaming eight ball  
Tattooed on his arm  
  
Today  
Today  
Today  
  
I saw a man  
Today  
I saw a man  
Using an empty whiskey flask  
As a walkie talkie  
  
Today  
I met a man  
Who threw his arms around me  
  
And you give in...  
Today...  
We laughed  
We laughed waiting for a train  
For a few into the city  
Seconds today  
That great stuff  
That great stuff  
That stuff  
That stuff makes me feel waiting for a train  
Feel into the city  
Feel today  
Happy today
