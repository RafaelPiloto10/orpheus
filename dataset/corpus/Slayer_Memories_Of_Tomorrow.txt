Bombers in flight  
Trident missiles in the air  
My missiles underground  
Protect us till we're dead  
Memories of tomorrow, crying sorrow  
  
Push the button  
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal  
A bomber flying off their ramps  
Nuclear bombs explode  
  
Radio active people  
Search for medicine  
Pray for shelter  
Kill for food  
  
Mass starvation  
Contaminated water  
Destroyed Cities  
Mutilated bodies  
  
Memories of tomorrow, crying sorrow  
I'll kill myself  
I'd rather die  
If you could see in the future  
You'd know why  
  
Memories of tomorrow
