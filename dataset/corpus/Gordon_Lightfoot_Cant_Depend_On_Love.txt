I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain  
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities  
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me  
It took most of my time to do what never was done  
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone  
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way  
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you  
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane  
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price  
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?  
I can't depend on love to defend me  
I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me
