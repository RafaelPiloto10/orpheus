There's a rose on the bed  
A letter that I wrote what you mean to me  
Words I wished I'd said,  
Were still in my head, now I pray you'd see  
  
I don't know how to tell you that I miss you, baby  
I struggle with the words sometimes  
But in my heart, I know you'll find  
  
Chorus:  
I know, you know  
Our souls will be together till the end of time  
You know, I know  
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side  
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away  
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say  
  
I'd ever say....  
  
You walked beside me,  
You stood by me and got me through my darkest times  
And now I close my eyes  
And visuallize your face for the last time  
  
I didn't know how to tell you that I loved you baby  
I struggle with the words sometimes  
But in my heart, I know you'll find  
  
Chorus:  
I know, you know  
Our souls will be together till the end of time  
You know, I know  
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side  
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away  
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say  
  
I never fell in love,  
No one ever touched me like this before  
You opened my eyes  
Made me realize something worth living for  
  
Solo (guitar and piano)  
  
But if fate took you from me before I got to let you know  
You're the one thing in my life worth dying for  
If the world fell apart,  
I know in my heart  
I know would never change  
If the devil himself  
Tried to raise hell's bells  
I know it would be in vain  
If the heavens come down  
Let 'em fall to the ground  
Let 'em take my breath away  
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say
