I gotta take a little time, a little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines, in case I need it when I'm older  
  
Now this mountain I must climb, feels like the world upon my shoulders  
Through the clouds I see love shine, it keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, to change this lonely life  
  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me  
  
I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide, it looks like love has finally found me  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, to change this lonely life  
  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
(And I want to feel) I want to feel what love is  
(And I know) I know you can show me  
  
Let's talk about love, I want to know what love is  
The love that you feel inside, I want you to show me  
And I'm feeling so much love, I want to feel what love is  
No, you just can't hide, I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is (let's talk about love), I know you can show me  
I want to feel it too, I want to feel what love is  
I want to feel it too, and I know and I know, I know you can show me  
Show me love is real, yeah, I want to know what love is
