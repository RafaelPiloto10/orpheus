Wide eyes show white  
White enough to shoot  
But if you ain't got the strength to fight it  
and you just can't hide it  
And I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore  
ain't gonna open my eyes anymore  
Pale faces burn.  
I would've thought by now we'd learn  
But every fool still waits their turn in  
the rotisseries turning  
Well I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore  
I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore  
I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore
