Michael mcdonald  
  
Sure as that old whistle's blowin'  
There's a tug upon my heart  
Somewhere in that misty mornin' light  
There's another brand new start  
Sometimes I'd love to see this end  
And watch it fall apart  
'cause it's still such a long road  
And we're a long way from the start  
You know anyone can say what's wrong  
That don't make it right to me  
We weren't born into this life  
To walk away from everything  
Once you get the blues in your stride  
All you need's a song to survive  
You think by now we would know that  
We're gonna keep this train a-rollin'  
We ain't gonna break down on this highway  
We could sit here waitin', worried, wonderin'  
Wishin' we were somewhere other than right her  
But we're right here
