Open your mouth, boy  
Just to swallow your teeth  
I will not pay the price for your self-inflicted grief  
My meekness lies there shivering and raped  
Trembling prophet  
Anointed wrath of God incarnate  
  
Cutting and tearing dissection  
Strangled and hanging before me  
Weeping and screaming become you  
Carry out your suffering  
  
Raise your first, boy to bring upon your demise  
Never had a clue what waited behind these eyes  
Your body turn apart  
You could not escape  
Trembling prophet  
Anointed wrath of God incarnate  
  
Inspiration from your damnation  
Your breath blackens my lungs  
  
You marked the line to guide my first incision  
Breath of the black muse
