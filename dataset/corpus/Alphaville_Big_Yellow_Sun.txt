On na round-about I'm turning on to you  
Don't you love the way we're turning, yes you do  
Little schools of hummingbirds are streaming by  
While we're merging with the color of the sky  
Big yellow sun  
You're the one  
Here's our souls  
Heal them, heal them  
Beutiful girl  
You're the world  
I'm in you, bretahing  
Love me do  
At the entrance of the airport as you see  
There's an icecream-man who's selling sweets for free  
You might watch descending rockets from the moon  
While we're taking off with 99 ballons  
Bless our souls...  
Big yellow sun  
You're the one  
Here's our souls  
Heal them, heal them  
Beutiful girl  
You're the world  
I'm in you, bretahing  
Love me do
