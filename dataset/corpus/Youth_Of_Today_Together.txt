Growing up with kids  
I can truly call my friends  
There from the beginning  
And they'll be there until the end  
Together we've built this  
And all done our part  
Together we've stood here  
Right from the start  
With all these great experiences  
I know I won't forget  
All the places that we've traveled  
And the people we've fucking met  
Together we've built this  
And all done our part  
Together we've stood here  
Right from the start  
I will never forget  
All that we've done  
All that it's meant  
There's a youth culture rising  
In front of your eyes  
Take pieces of you in my memory  
Until the day I die  
Together we've built this  
And all done our part  
Together we've stood here  
Right from the start
