The sun sets across the ocean  
I'm a thousand mile from anywhere  
And my pocketbook in my heart  
Both just got stolen  
And the sun act like she don't even care  
The wind blows cold when you reach the top  
Feels like somebody's face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe  
Got a plastic Jesus, a cordless telephone for every corner of my room  
Got everybody but you tellin' me what to do  
  
Well I've been down so long  
It can't be that much longer still  
And I've been down for so long  
That the end must be drawing near  
  
I looked to everybody but me  
To answer my prayers  
Until I found an angel in the bathroom  
Who said she didn't see anybody who was saving anywhere  
And the blind man said, "Simple... like flipping a coin -  
Don't matter what side it lands on  
So long as it's somebody else's dime"  
Cause if you're the top of the bottom  
It all feels the same  
We live out of fear if we're too rich or we're too poor  
Guess all I can do is muster up some change  
And a little bit of faith  
And take some dignity when I walk through this door  
  
Gonna take a trip  
Catch a train  
Got a ticket in my hand  
And then a fat man takes my money  
And like cattle we all stand  
I'm just a faceless body lost in this vast and worthless sea  
In a thousand people I do not know  
But really they are no different from me  
They all have passion  
They all have fear  
They all have intense confusion  
And no sweet moments that are clear  
They all have aspirations  
High hopes and dreams  
And are really that alone like me  
  
We've been down so long  
It can't be that much longer still  
We've been down so long  
That the end must be...  
The end must be...  
The end must be drawing near
