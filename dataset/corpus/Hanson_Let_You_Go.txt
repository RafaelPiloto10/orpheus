You were amazing in ways I never knew  
It's driving me crazy but I can't get over you  
You were holding on and I was letting go  
Looking for a love I thought I could control  
All the things we said when we had a fight  
Now I realize that I was wrong and you were right  
  
But it's all right now  
I need you back somehow  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you  
  
I never held you the way I'd hold you now  
I wish I could change it, the way it all came down  
It's killing me to know I let you get away  
Holding on to all the things I didn't say  
I thought I couldn't be the way you wanted me  
But there is more to love than I could ever see  
  
But it's all right now  
I need you back somehow  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
  
Let's turn it around  
I know that it's love that I've found  
And I promise I won't let you down  
  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go  
This is the last time baby that I let you go
