Flip this capital eclipse  
Tha vocal tone has got 'em sweatin' their own apocalypse  
Yes, rebel of tha grains stand masterless  
Tha masked ones cap one  
NAFTA comin' with tha new disaster  
And yes we in wit tha wind an tha plan de Ayala kin  
Are comin' back around again  
Tha slave driver saliva, one night power turns  
Them devils mouths dry, now Mexico burns  
So here they come one by one them killers of the new frontier  
Occupy, causin' fear, come on  
Wit the wind below  
We in wit the wind below  
Wit the wind below  
  
Flip this capital eclipse  
Them bury life wit IMF shifts, and poison lips  
Yo they talk it, while slicin' our veins yo so mark it  
From the FINCAS overseers, to them vultures playin' markets  
She ain't got nothin' but weapon and shawl  
She is Chol, Tzotzil, Tojolobal, Tzeltal  
The tools are her tools, Ejidos and ovaries  
She once suffocated, now through a barrel she breathes  
She is the wind below  
The wind below  
She is the wind below  
  
And all the shareholders gonna flex, and try ta annex the truth  
While the new trust is gonna flex, and cast their image in you  
Yeah all the shareholders gonna flex, and try ta annex the truth  
And while the new trust tries ta flex, and cast their image in you  
And GE is gonna flex and try and annex the truth  
And NBC is gonna flex and cast their image in you  
And Disney bought the fantasies and piles of eyes  
And ABC's new thrill rides of trials and lies  
And while the gut eaters strain to pull the mud from their mouths  
They force our ears to go deaf to the screams in the south  
Yeah!  
But we in wit the wind below!  
But we in wit the wind below!  
But we in wit the wind below!
