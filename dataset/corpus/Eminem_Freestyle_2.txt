Let me tell your first  
When I'm done freestylin youll need a fuckin hurst  
I'm white yeah I'm kinda like slim shady  
And looking at you, ur probably hung like a baby.  
I pissed you off with that one liner  
But I'm sure ill do it again like a big tymer.  
Ok right now I'm gonna let you flow  
And when I'm tired of hearin your shit ill let you know.  
  
Its my turn and I'm gonna drop a bomb  
Blow you up like a fucking Vietcong.  
I'm sick with the rhymes I've just said  
Don't mind my face its a little red.  
Cuz I'm embarrassed to be up here its true  
Its not cuz I'm scared its cuz I'm battling someone like you.  
I mean jesus your rhymes aint even witty  
And every one here knows your lyrics are shitty  
But its ok cuz your tryin your best  
And if you have a girlfriend I'm sure her backs like her chest  
In other words you be fucking a guy  
And don't tell me the excuse, its cuz I was high  
Its cuz your like at the other fags who think their cool  
But infact your really enjoy pushing it stool!  
  
I'm done ok I can't think of any thing else to say  
I'm at lost for words cuz my rhymes might be soundin gay  
But then again we listened to your rhymes so I guess it would be ok.  
Ill finish your off with a one liner and then I'm done.  
This is the rhyme that with solididfy that I won.  
I listened to every rhyme youve said  
And it was all mumble jumble like your were giving some head.  
Now remember I'm white so I don't belong in the rap game  
But id be there before you cuz your lyrics where fuck in lame!!!
