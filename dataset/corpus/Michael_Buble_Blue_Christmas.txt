I'll have a blue Christmas  
Without you,  
I'll be so blue just thinking about you.  
Decorations of red  
On a green Christmas tree  
Won't be the same dear  
If you're not here with me  
  
When those blue oh-snowflakes, are falling  
That's when those blue memories, start calling (hey)  
You'll be doin' alright, with your Christmas in white  
And I'll have a blue blue blue Christmas  
(Oh let's go, let's go)  
  
(Alright J man let's go J)  
  
And when those blue oh-snowflakes, start falling  
Well that's when those blue oh-memories, start calling  
You'll be doin' alright, with your Christmas all white  
And I'll I'll have a blue blue blue Christmas  
Yes I'll, I'll have a blue oh Christmas
