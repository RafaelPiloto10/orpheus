I didn't meet you in the jungle  
Swinging from a tree  
I sat down at the piano  
You were playing with me  
I couldn't believe all the things you could do  
The apes I've seen were in the zoo  
  
They say we are unique with this language that we speak  
But you have proved them wrong  
Skinner and Chomsky, how could they be so blind  
With evidence this strong?  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
When you watch King Kong or The Planet of the Apes  
Upon your video screen  
When the animals die, tears fill your eye  
And you question what you've seen  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where I come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to me now  
I am listening  
  
You can search the internet  
You can use your video phone  
To call another friend  
If we gave you all the tools  
You can do whatever you want  
Who knows when this will end  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where I come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to me now  
I am listening  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where we come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to us now  
We are listening  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Starting to hear the things you've said  
Getting to know what's going on in your head  
There's no humans on the line  
But there'll be plenty more there in good time  
Dolphins, cats, and elephants  
This is not some wild romance  
Just look in their eyes and say it's not true  
Look in their eyes, they're checking out you
