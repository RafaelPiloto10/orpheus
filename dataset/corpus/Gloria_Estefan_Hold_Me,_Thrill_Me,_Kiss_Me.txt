Hold me, hold me  
Never let me go  
Until you've told me, told me  
What I want to know  
And just hold me, hold me  
Make me tell you I'm in love with you  
(Hold me tight, never let me go)  
Thrill me, thrill me  
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be  
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be  
When you make me tell you I love you  
(Will you take me in your arms)  
They told me, "Be sensible with your new love  
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find"  
But they never stood in the dark with you, love  
When you take me in your arms  
and drive me slowly out of my mind  
Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do  
I know that you will miss me, miss me  
If we ever say adieu, so kiss me, kiss me  
Make me tell you I'm in love with you
