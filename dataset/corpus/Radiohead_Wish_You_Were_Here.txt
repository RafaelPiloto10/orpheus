So, so you think you can tell  
Heaven from hell,  
Blue skies from rain  
Can you tell  
A green field from a cold steel rail?  
A smile from a veil?  
Do you think you can tell?  
  
And did they get you to trade  
Your heroes for ghosts?  
Hot ashes for trees?  
Hot air for a cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for change?  
And did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?  
  
How I wish, how I wish you were here  
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,  
Year after year running over the same old ground  
What have you found?  
The same old fears  
  
Wish you were here...
