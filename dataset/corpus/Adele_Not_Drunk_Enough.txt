Never been a girl who used to cry  
Didn't show emotions, don't know why  
Didn't wanna feel the pain inside, I guess  
  
But as the years keep going by,  
You came along and changed my mind  
I should leave the past behind me,  
I should let you find me,  
Supposed to stay beside me  
You were supposed to guide me,  
Through the ups and downs,  
You were always gonna be around until the end  
  
I still think we could  
'Cause you and me, we're good  
And I'll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I'm sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
So I'm gonna get myself another drink  
Whenever I start to think about you  
'Cause I do what I really don't want to  
But sometimes my dreams just come through  
  
And when I get there,  
To a place where I see you in a kitchen  
I stop wishing but that thing and I don't need you,  
I don't really wanna see youAnd I don't want you to see me,  
You would think that I was crazy,  
You might think that I wanna be close to you  
But I'd rather wanna drink some Whisky  
And maybe have a little sip 'o wine  
'Cause right now it's the only thing that makes me forget you are mine  
But right now I am sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
I still think we could  
(I'm not drunk enough)  
'Cause you and me, we're good  
'Cause I'm sober  
  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough  
  
(I still think we could)  
But I just wanna be drunk  
So I can forget about you  
And all the stupid things that love has pulled me through  
('cause you and me we're good)  
Even when I've had too much,  
I still feel your touch  
Maybe this just means that I'm not drunk enough
