I found it hard to believe  
Someone like you cared for me  
You put this love in my heart  
  
I tried but could not refuse  
You gave me no time to choose  
You put this love in my heart  
  
I want to know where the bad feelings go  
When I'm depressed and I get down so low  
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright  
  
I want to tell you right now  
I'm not afraid to say how  
You put this love in my heart  
  
There are sometimes when I doubt  
But you always find me out  
You put this love in my heart  
  
Cause when I see all that you've done for me  
It's hard to doubt, I just have to believe  
Cause you followed and proved it all of your life  
  
Well I know  
the loneliness I had before  
Is gone now  
I'll never feel it anymore  
  
Cause your love has released me  
From all that's in my past  
And I know I can believe you  
When you say I'll never be forsaken  
Your love is gonna last  
  
There's so much more I should say  
If I could just find a way  
You put this love in my heart  
  
Is all this real or a dream  
I feel so good I could scream  
You put this love in my heart  
  
I want to know where the bad feelings go  
When I'm depressed and I get down so low  
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright  
  
You put this love in my heart  
  
You put this love in my heart  
  
You put this love in my heart
