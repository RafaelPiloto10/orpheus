You wanna know if I know why  
I can't say that I do  
Don't understand the you or I  
Or how one becomes two  
I just can't recall what started it off  
Or how to begin again  
I ain't here to break ya  
Just see how far it will bend  
Again and again, again and again  
  
I wanna make it  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
Anytime, anywhere  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
  
Sometimes the same is different  
But mostly it's the same  
These mysteries of life...  
That just ain't my thing  
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue  
The only thing I know for sure  
Is what I won't do  
Anytime, anywhere, and I said...  
  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
Anytime, anywhere  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
I wanna make it  
(Anytime, anywhere)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
Yeah  
I wanna make it  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
I wanna make it  
(Anytime, anywhere)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
I wanna make it  
(Again and again)  
I wanna make it wit' chu  
(Again and again, and again, and again)  
I wanna make it
