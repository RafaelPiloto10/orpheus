Hey, hey, hey  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back  
  
Hey, hey  
I can stand tall, I can stick out a mile  
I can come crawlin' like a hungry reptile  
  
I'm coming' around, I'm wired for sound  
Shakin' it for all it's a-worth  
I'm a spaced-out alien, a techno-sapien  
Crashin' on down to earth  
  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back  
  
I can pour your drink and be the perfect host  
I can scare the pants off the holiest ghost  
  
I'm coming' around, I'm wired for sound  
Shakin' it for all it's a-worth  
I'm a spaced-out alien, a techno-sapien  
Crashin' on down to earth  
  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back  
  
Back in the middle, back in the ring  
Backin' a winner, it's a sure shot thing  
Back in your good books I did you no wrong  
Here I am honey, I back where I belong  
Belong, belong, belong  
  
I'm back  
Well, I'm back  
Yeah I'm back  
You better believe that I'm back  
Now lemme tell you I'm back  
Can't you see that I'm back  
Come on and do it, I'm back  
There's nothing to it, I'm back  
  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back in your face and don't it feel so good  
I'm back in your face and just like I knew that it would  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
Sheer heart attack and a Jumpin' Jack Flash  
Like a leader of the pack  
And as a matter of fact I'm back
