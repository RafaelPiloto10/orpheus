3000 miles across the sea, are you waiting there for me  
I'm stuck here in this state, so I must communicate  
Don't know just where you are, just know that you're too far  
There's only one thing I can do  
  
Chorus:  
Gonna send my love to you (Transatlantic)  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency (Transatlantic)  
Send it E.S.P.  
  
through the static in the air, I will transmit that I care  
Do you read me loud and clear, yes that's my heartbeat that you hear  
No phone no radio, the telegram's too slow  
I'm going crazy without you  
  
Gonna send my love to you (Transatlantic)  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency (Transatlantic)  
Send it E.S.P.  
  
S.O.S, in distress  
Close my eyes for your reply  
Do you read me  
Will you reach me  
  
Transistor tube and microchip  
Won't bring me closer to your lips  
Send a kiss out through the night  
Like a laser beam of light  
No underwater train, no supersonic rain  
Is fast enough to get to you  
  
Gonna send my love to you (Transatlantic)  
Beam my message through  
Gonna find your frequency (Transatlantic)  
  
Will you  
Will you read me  
Send my love (Transatlantic)  
I want to know  
Do you read me
