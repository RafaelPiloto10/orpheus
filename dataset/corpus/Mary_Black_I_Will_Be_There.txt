When times are hard and friends are few  
And you need someone to help you through  
Just call my name and I'll come running to your side  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
I will be there  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to run  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
When morning comes and nothing's changed  
And the world around plays the same old game  
Just call on me and I will ease your lonely heart  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
I will be there  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to turn  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
I will be there  
When every one that you believe still lets you down  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
  
'Cause I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When morning comes and nothing's changed  
And the world around plays the same old game  
When everyone still lets you down  
I will be there  
  
When morning comes and friends are few  
You need someone you need someone to help you through  
I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to turn  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When everyone that you believe still lets you down  
I will be there  
Don't be afraid don't be afraid  
I will be there  
  
When you are lost in the night  
No where to turn
