About this map, here we are, here  
See, this is us, the exit is here, and  
We've come too far, to just feel like this, yeah  
We've come too far, to be feeling like this  
  
Certain, certain  
You want to, want to  
Certain, certain  
You want to, want to  
  
About this map, it's a bit out of date, yeah  
Territories shifted, and things get renamed  
There's coups, revolutions, and boundaries blur  
Volcanoes and earthquakes turn words into birds  
  
It's certain, certain  
You want to, want to  
Certain, certain  
You want to, want to, want to  
  
But, oh, about this map  
It goes beyond, beyond  
And, oh about this map  
About this map  
  
About this map, here we are, here  
See, this is me, and there you are, there, and  
There's got to be more than just to despair  
There's got to be more than just to despair  
  
I'm certain, certain  
I want to, want to  
You're certain, certain  
You want to, want to, want to  
  
And, oh, about this map  
It goes beyond, beyond  
Forget about this map  
About this map  
  
And, oh, about this map  
We don't live in our heads  
Forget about this map  
About this map  
About this map  
About this map  
About this map
