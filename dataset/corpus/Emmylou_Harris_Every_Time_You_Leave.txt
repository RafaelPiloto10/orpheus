Everytime you leave  
You tear the soul from me  
I die a little more each time part  
I can't control my dreams  
My heart can't seem to learn  
To turn and lock its door when you return  
  
I know that you'll come back again  
As soon as you get blue  
And I know what will happen then  
One kiss and I'll give one to you  
  
Everytime you leave  
You tear the soul from me  
But I want to live so I'll forgive  
Everytime you leave
