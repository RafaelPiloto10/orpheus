They tied his arms behind his back  
To teach him how to swim  
They put blood in his coffee  
And milk in his gin  
They stood over the soldier  
In the midst of the squalor  
There was war in his body  
And it caused his brain to holler  
Make the sacrifice  
Mutilate my face  
If you need someone to kill  
I'm a man without a will  
Wash the razor in the rain  
Let me luxuriate in pain  
Please don't set me free  
Death means a lot to me  
The pain was lean and it made him scream  
He knew he was alive  
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest  
He thought he was a saint  
I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother  
What am I to do  
When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car  
It cannot be controlled  
Spit upon his face and scream  
There's no oedipus today  
This is no play you're thinking you are in  
What will you say  
Take the blue mask down from my face  
And look me in the eye  
I get a thrill from punishment  
I've always been that way  
I loathe and despise repentance  
You are permanently stained  
Your weakness buys indifference  
And indiscretion in the streets  
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not  
You deserve to be soundly beat  
Make the sacrifice  
Take it all the way  
There's no "won't" high enough  
To stop this desperate day  
Don't take death away  
Cut the finger at the joint  
Cut the stallion at his mount  
And stuff it in his mouth
