Your thoughts are compromising  
Self - centered, patronized  
Your image supersedes your soul  
You find me mystifying  
Subhuman, so annoying  
You can't have me under control  
You think you live forever  
You don't find that profound  
You won't think, you're so clever  
When you hear thunder underground, all right now  
Your morbid fear of losing  
Destroys the lives you're using  
You only have one point of view  
The stigma of delusion  
Confirms your self illusion  
And after all this could be you  
When you hear thunder underground, here we go now  
Could it be that I have found my mind or have I gone insane?  
Roller coaster of the madness and there's only me to blame  
The ever faithful hand of doom will take the pain away  
I'll never know the answer to it all 'til my dying day  
Your bullshit culture licking  
Can't stop the deathwatch ticking  
You're only mortal after all  
Your appetite for power  
Subverts your every hour  
But every time the mighty fall
