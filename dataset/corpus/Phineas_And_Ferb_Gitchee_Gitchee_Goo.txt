Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!  
Mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'  
Chika chika chu whop  
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You  
  
My baby's got her own way of talking  
Whenever she says something sweet  
And she knows it's my world she's a-rockin'  
Though my vocabulary's incomplete  
And Though it may sound confusing  
Sometimes I wish she'd give it to me straight  
But I never feel like I'm Losing (losing)  
When I take the time to translate  
That's what I'm talking 'bout  
  
Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!  
Mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'  
Chika chika chu whop  
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You  
  
When I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)  
But I think I'm getting through (I think I'm getting through)  
'Cause when I say I Love You (I Say I Love You)  
She says I Gitchi Gitchi Goo You Too!  
Don't need a Dictionary
