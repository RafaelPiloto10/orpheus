I'm sleepin' an' right in the middle of a good dream  
Like all at once I wake up  
From somethin' that keeps knockin' at my brain  
Before I go insane  
  
I hold my pillow to my head  
An' spring up in my bed  
Screamin' out the words I dread  
I think I love you  
(I think I love you)  
  
This mornin', I woke up with this feelin'  
I didn't know how to deal with  
An' so I just decided to myself  
I'd hide it to myself  
  
An' never talk about it  
An' didn't I go and shout it  
When you walked into my room  
I think I love you  
(I think I love you)  
  
I think I love you  
So what am I so afraid of?  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of  
A love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you  
Isn't that what life is made of?  
Though it worries me to say  
That I never felt this way  
  
I don't know what I'm up against?  
I don't know what it's all about?  
I got so much to think about  
  
Hey, I think I love you  
So what am I so afraid of?  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of  
A love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you  
Isn't that what life is made of?  
Though it worries me to say  
That I never felt this way  
  
Believe me  
You really didn't have to worry  
I only wanna make ya happy  
An' if you say, "Hey, go away"  
  
I will  
But I think better  
Still, I'd better stay around an' love you  
Do you think I have a chance?  
  
Let me ask you to your face  
Do you think you love me?  
I think I love you  
  
(Do you think you love me?)  
I think I love you  
(Do you think you love me?)  
I think I love you  
(Do you think you love me?)  
I think I love you
