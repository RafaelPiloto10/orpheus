Horizon of blue, hills are rollin'  
Walkin' with you through a field of red stones  
I been confused from voices callin', callin' to me  
Where the white sun has shown  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
It's got to be free  
  
The old man is weak, but strength comes from him  
A smile full of youth, and a gleam in his eye  
His garden is green and seems overflowin'  
And his dreams await in his rockin' chair sky  
  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
It's got to be free
