if only i die  
just once in my life  
if only to try  
to take a guess, to be the best  
a feeling i hide  
that runs this world, that keeps us alive  
i want you to climb with me  
  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die  
  
the heart of a child  
is in your hands now  
so let's see you smile  
'cause i'm not impressed with your loneliness  
and it's been a while  
since you forgave all your changes made  
so let's count the miles together  
  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die  
  
if only i die  
just once in my life  
if only to try together  
  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die of a broken heart  
a broken heart  
until i die
