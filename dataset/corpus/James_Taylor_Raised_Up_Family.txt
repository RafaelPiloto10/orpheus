I was raised up family, man,  
I'm glad I'm on my own.  
I was raised up family, man,  
I'm glad I'm on my own.  
I mean, God bless the child  
That can learn to live alone, yeah.  
  
Thinking about my cousin,  
What it was that did him in.  
Could it have been that whiskey,  
Rotgut, bootleg, bathtub gin?  
It's like it took a lot of liquor  
Just to let him live in his own skin.  
  
Back in Raleigh, North Carolina,  
You got to ride it on back  
In Raleigh, North Carolina.  
  
The ship set down on the shore  
Of this uncharted desert island,  
Me and my people fanned out,  
I guess we settled down a little while.  
Ah, but the devil came with the dark days  
Of winter, man, the children ran wild.  
  
I used to know why, no, I don't know why anymore.  
I used to know why, no, I don't know why no more.  
  
I get to wonder at the Kundalini thunder,  
Down under my floor.  
  
You got to ride it on back,  
Take me back.  
Back in Raleigh, North Carolina, yeah,  
Do you want to go?  
Way back in Raleigh, North Carolina.
