When we were kids he used to go over the back wall into old Dan's scrapyard  
Into the snooker hall where most us kids were barred  
An' into the roxy and the stella where film stars starred  
That's where me and Hopalong an' Roy Rogers got drunk and jarred  
And we might have been the saviour of the men,  
The captured captain in the devil's demon den  
And we might have been the magic politician in some kind of tricky position  
Like an old, old, old master musician we kept on wishin'  
We was headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
There's an old photograph of Dan that I wish you could-a seen  
Of him and the boys posed, standing in St. Stephen's green  
Ya see, they were a part of the great freedom dream  
But they were caught and detained and are locked inside the frame  
Of the photograph  
An' he might have been the clever con, the good samaritan, the rassclaut man  
An' he might have been the loaded gun, the charlatan of the tap dancin' fan  
But like an old pioneer from outer Afghanistan,  
Headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
Old Dan in a raincoat hums the very, very, very special notes  
Of a long lost favorite melody  
It reminds him of a love affair when he was young and did not care  
And how he parted so soft, so sadden  
And he might have been the laughing cavaliero, the wise old commanchero  
Ow, the desperate desparado, the good looking Randolph Valentino,  
The gigolo from glasgow  
But like an old, old hunter of the female buffalo,  
He's headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
It's so true  
Ummm, it's true  
I swear I've said it  
Swear I've said it  
I swear I said it  
I swear it's true  
And it's true  
True blue  
Oh, its irish blue  
And it's true...
