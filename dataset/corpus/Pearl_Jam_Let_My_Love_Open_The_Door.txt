Pete Townshend) (various dates)  
The people keep repeatin'  
The children follow along  
Everybody keeps from changin'  
And you could say you did enough...  
Let my love open your door... (3x)  
To your heart...  
Let my love open the door (2x)  
When everything feels all over  
Everybody seems unkind  
I'll give you a four-leaf clover  
Take all worries out of your mind  
Let my love open your door... (3x)  
To your heart...  
Let my love open the door...  
To your heart...  
Let my love open the door...  
Have the only key to your heart...  
I can stop you from fallin' apart  
Tried to say in my own way...  
Somebody give me the chance to say...  
Let my love open your door...  
It's all I'm lookin' for  
And erase yourself from misery  
There's only one thing that's gonna set you free...  
When trouble really falls you...  
Don't let it tie you down  
Love can cure your problems  
You're so lucky I'm around  
Let my love open your door... (3x)  
To your heart...  
Let my love open the door...  
To your heart...  
Let my love open the door... (5x)  
Oh...to your heart...  
Oh...baby, I know I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said...  
...I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said...  
Oh...na na na...let my love open the door...  
Let my love... (2x
