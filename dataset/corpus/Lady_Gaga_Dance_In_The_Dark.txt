Silicone, saline, poison inject me  
Baby, I'm a free bitch, I'm a free bitch  
  
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track  
She won't walk away but she won't look back  
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a mess  
She's a mess she's a mess  
Now the girl is stressed  
She's a mess she's a mess  
She's a mess she's a mess (Tell 'em, girls)  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)  
  
Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin  
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him  
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a tramp  
She's a tramp she's a vamp  
But she still does her dance  
She's a tramp she's a vamp  
But she still kills the dance  
(Tell 'em, girls)  
  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)  
  
In the dark she loves to dance in the dark  
In the dark she loves, she loves to dance in the dark  
  
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia  
Tell 'em how you feel girls!  
  
Work your blond (Jean) Benet Ramsey  
We'll haunt like Liberace  
Find your freedom in the music  
Find your Jesus, find your Cupid  
You will never fall apart  
Diana, you're still in our hearts  
Never let you fall apart  
Together we'll dance in the dark  
  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance in the dark  
Baby, baby loves to dance in the dark  
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart  
Baby loves to dance in the dark in the dark
