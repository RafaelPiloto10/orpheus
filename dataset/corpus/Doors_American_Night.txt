All hail the American night!  
  
What was that?  
I don't know  
Sounds like guns, thunder.  
  
Alright! Alright! Alright!  
Hey, listen! Listen! Listen, man! listen, man!  
I don't know how many you people believe in astrology  
Yeah, that's right, that's right, baby, I, I am a  
Sagittarius  
The most philosophical of all the signs  
But anyway, I don't believe in it  
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself  
But I tell you this, man, I tell you this  
I don't know what's gonna happen, man,  
But I want to have my kicks  
Before the whole shithouse goes up in flames  
Alright!
