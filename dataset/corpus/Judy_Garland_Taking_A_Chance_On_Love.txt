Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.  
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.  
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.  
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.  
I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.  
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is  
High.  
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.  
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.  
Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.  
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.  
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.  
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.  
I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.  
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your... Foot  
Good-bye.  
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.  
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.
