Legendary child  
I tell ya what I'm talkin' about  
  
Makin' love at seventeen, yeah, we had the luck  
But we traded 'em toys and other joys, and we didn't give a (whoa-oh-oh)  
I took a chance at the high school dance, never knowing wrong from right  
And that same show, forty years ago, being televised tonight  
  
'Cause journey from inside my head to the Taj Mahal  
I went from never-havin'-none to wanna-have-it-all  
I wanna keep that dream alive  
And eat that honey from the hive  
With all the noise and all the glamor  
No surprise you know I am a  
  
Legendary child  
I think that what I'm tryin' to say is  
  
Sticks and stones will break your bones, at least they'll rearrange  
I drop a dime and every time I get myself a nickel's change (whoa-oh-oh)  
They say we don't know jack  
At the plant, we proved 'em wrong  
We traded in our souls at night and sold 'em for a song  
  
And if Satan had a lady friend, her name was Mary Jane  
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane  
And how we got the golden fleece  
From tokin' on that pipe of peace  
Yeah, as far as I can see  
There is a God 'cause I got me a
