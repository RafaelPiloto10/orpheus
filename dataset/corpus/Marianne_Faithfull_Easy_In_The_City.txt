Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  
Light is slanting sideways  
Sun is getting through.  
Gonna take a taxi  
Gotta get to you!  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the rooms.  
Isn't it a pity  
Time goes by so soon ...  
Time goes by so soon.  
If I can find the secret in the green  
I'll let you know.  
And if you seek a treasure made of silver  
You can go ... go  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the rooms.  
Isn't it a pity  
Time goes by so soon ...  
Time goes by so soon.  
If I can find the secret in the green  
I'll let you know.  
And if you seek a treasure made of silver  
You can go ... go.  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.
