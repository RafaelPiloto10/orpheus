Walk in my shadow  
My throat is dry  
My knees are weak  
It's so damned hot  
I can't even speak  
  
Walk in my shadow  
I can't take it anymore  
When I get you in the shadows  
I gonna show you what it's for  
  
Yes I know baby  
That's a shady kind of deal  
I just want to find out  
How you feel  
  
Walk in my shadow  
I ain't gonna take it anymore  
When I get you in the shadow  
I'm gonna give you what's in store  
  
Yes I know you say I'm stupid  
It just wouldn't be cool  
Well I can tell baby that  
I aint no fool  
  
Walk in my shadow  
I can't take it anymore  
When I get you in the shadow  
I'm gonna lay you on the floor  
  
When I get you in the shadow  
I'm gonna give you what's in store
