In some of my songs I have casually mentioned  
The fact that I like to drink beer  
This little song is more to the point  
Roll out the barrel and lend me your ears  
  
[Chorus:]  
I like beer, it makes me a jolly good fellow  
I like beer, it helps me unwind and sometimes it makes me feel mellow (Makes
him feel mellow)  
Whiskey's too rough, Champagne costs too much, vodka puts my mouth in gear  
This little refrain should help me explain as a matter of fact I like beer  
(He likes beer)  
  
My wife often frowns when we're out on the town  
And I'm wearing a suit and a tie  
She's sipping vermouth and she thinks I'm uncouth  
When I yell as the waiter goes by  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last night I dreamed that I passed from the scene  
And I went to a place so sublime  
Aw, the water was clear and tasted like beer  
Then they turned it all into wine (Awww)  
  
[Chorus]
