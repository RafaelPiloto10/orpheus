Dani:  
Here comes the sun, doo doo doo doo  
Here comes the sun, and I say  
It's all right, mmm...  
  
Santana:  
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter  
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here  
  
Dani and Santana (Santana):  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, (and I say)  
It's all right  
  
Dani and Santana (Dani):  
Little darling, (the smiles returning to their faces)  
Little darling, (it seems like years since it's been here)  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, (and I say)  
It's all right  
  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
  
Dani and Santana (Santana):  
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting  
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, (and I say)  
It's all right  
  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, (and I say)  
It's all right  
It's all right
