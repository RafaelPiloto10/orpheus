Long shadows  
Bright light  
That falls to the front  
From a darkness behind  
There is no end  
To this mountain top  
Inside these stones  
Only peace will we find  
  
Inside out  
We're all part of the stone  
That makes up the mountain  
And harbors the bones  
The bones of angels  
That showed us the way  
You can feel them at night  
While they sleep through the day  
  
The bones of angels  
The bones of angels  
  
Together we will be  
Forever we will see  
I see you  
And I see me  
And the bones of angels
