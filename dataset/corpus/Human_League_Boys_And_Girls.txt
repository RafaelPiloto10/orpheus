Boys and girls come out to play, playing till they're old and grey  
Time to leave the old school suit, grown ups can be real cute  
Do you think they're wiser than in the past  
How long do you think it's gonna last  
I don't have to prove to you adults can be kidding too  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
  
Boys and girls stay home today  
Think they're more mature that way  
Secret friends can soon be found  
Indiscretions underground  
Maybe growing up can seem more graceful  
If they make their style become more tasteful  
With your looks you could go far  
But better watch the calendar

Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh  
Boys and girls, ahh
