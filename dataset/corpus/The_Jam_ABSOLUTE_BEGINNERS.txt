In echoed steps I walked across an empty dream  
I looked across this world, there was no one to be seen  
This empty feeling turned and quietly walked away  
I saw no warmth in life, no love was in my eyes  
I stared a century thinking this will never change  
As I hesitated, time rushed onwards without me  
Too scared to break the spell too small to take a fall  
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts!  
  
I lost some hours thinking of it  
I need the strength to go and get what I want  
I lost a lifetime thinking of it  
An' lost an era daydreaming like I do  
  
In echoed steps you walk across an empty dream  
But look around this world, there's millions to be seen  
Come see the tyrants panic see their crumbling empires fall  
Then tell 'em we don't fight for fools  
'Cos love is in our hearts!  
  
I lost some hours thinking of it  
I need the strength to go and get what I want  
I lost a lifetime thinking of it  
An' lost an era daydreaming like I do  
  
You can lose some hours thinking of it  
You need the strength to go and get what I want  
You can lose a lifetime thinking of it  
And lose an era daydreaming like I do
