Love started out like fresh April dawn  
Dreams I have left faded and torn  
  
I was born to lose baby  
I was born to lose baby  
  
There was this woman when I was a boy  
She was my queen and I was her toy  
  
I was born to lose baby  
I was born to lose baby  
  
Now I could not give what the rich man could give no  
Only myself for as long as I live  
  
I was born to lose baby  
Oh I was born to lose baby  
  
Born to lose  
Born to lose  
Born to lose
