Well ever since you were a little girl  
You set the rules in your little world  
But girls grow up and throw their toys away  
You're a big girl now but you still wanna play  
(Girl we're living)  
You dress them up the way you want to  
(Girl we're living)  
You make them do just what you want them to  
(Girl we're living)  
Once I thought we had a love that was true  
But I'm just another doll in your dollhouse to you  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
It's all been neatly arranged in your mind  
Every detail fits your own design  
Every room is perfectly in place  
But I can see the sadness, baby, on your face  
You had a plan and darling like a child  
You thought it's down to fashion, down to style  
But your little dreamhouse is runnin' wild  
Before your very eyes we're shrinking down to size  
  
We're living in a dollhouse  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl we're living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
  
Everything's as you dreamed it would be  
But there's something wrong that you can't see  
Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw  
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall  
Something, girl, that will explain away  
The hurt you feel, darling, when we play  
  
Your little dolls they got grip on you  
Until you're just another doll in your dollhouse too  
We're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
We may feel safe and sound  
But our dollhouse, girl, is falling down  
Oh we're living in a dollhouse  
Girl, we're living in a dollhouse  
Yeah we're living in a dollhouse
