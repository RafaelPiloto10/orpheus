The sun will come out, tomorrow  
Bet your bottom dollar  
That tomorrow, there'll be sun  
Just thinkin' about, tomorrow  
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow  
'Til there's none  
  
When I'm stuck with the day that's gray and lonely  
I just stick out my chin and grin and say, ohhh  
  
The sun will come out, tomorrow  
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow  
Come what may...  
  
[Chorus]  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
I love ya, tomorrow  
You're always a day away  
  
The sun will come out, tomorrow  
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow  
Come what may...  
  
[Chorus]  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
I love ya, tomorrow  
You're always a day a--way!
