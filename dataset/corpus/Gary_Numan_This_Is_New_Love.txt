We are strangers here  
I suppose  
We are not welcome  
Or so I'm told.  
We are not old friends  
But believe this,  
We can be nightmares.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
This is new love.  
  
We are the hunters,  
So one by one  
You know we'll find you.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
  
These boys of passion  
Will rule the world  
Put their fingers in a dyke  
Well you know it's what she needed.  
These boys of passion  
With cruel idiot smiles  
Fight for you.  
You know, they said so.  
  
Cold fascination  
With dead sound.  
Oh God let me sleep  
Forever.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops
