I know you don't love me no more  
No more ah no more  
I don't wanna be hurt any anymore no no more  
Ain't no use in me cryin now  
Everything I did, you put me down  
I don't want you no more baby  
Ain't no use in you hangin round  
  
I know you don't want me no more  
No more ah no more  
And with someone else  
Lovin you more, lovin you more  
Ain't no use in me cryin now  
If weren't for you I won't be down  
Cause you don't want me no more baby  
Ain't no use in you hangin round  
  
I know you don't love me no more  
No more no no more  
I don't wanna be hurt any anymore anymore  
I have loved so hard everything I did was no joy  
Since I can't love you right baby  
I don't have to love you at all  
  
I know you don't love me no more  
No more ah no more  
I don't wanna be hurt any anymore anymore  
I have loved so hard everything I did was no joy
