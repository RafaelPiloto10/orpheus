A double secret agent  
And he was paid to kill  
With cold steel magnum force is how the man possessed the skill  
He shot a man in Paris  
He did a job in L.A.  
And if the price was right, he'd surely  
Take your life away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wanted, dead or alive, blood for money, money  
Assault, homicide, blood for  
Money, money, money, money  
Wanted  
  
He drove a Maserati, lived up in the hills  
A cat with nine lives that's gone  
Too far to feel the chill  
He never though it'd happen  
It was his last mistake  
Cause he was gunned down by a  
Heartless woman's thirty eight.  
  
[Chorus]
