I been up, down  
And all around  
Tell you what I'm feelin'  
I been hurt and I've found  
Been pushed around  
It's how I got this feelin'  
I never thought I could hurt so good, no no  
I never thought I could lose myself  
But I just can't hide it  
They never let you down easy  
Now listen  
Sometimes love is like a slap in the face  
You been burned and still  
It's the same old mistake  
If you want my opinion  
I'll give it to you straight  
Love is like a slap in the face  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na  
na na na na na na na na na  
Love's got a hold on me  
I can't believe it  
But it's plain to see  
Turns me upside down and inside out  
Don't know why it never fails  
To make you scream and shout  
I never knew I could fool myself, no no  
I never thought I could hurt so good  
But I just can't hide it  
Guess I'm feelin' no pain  
Now listen  
Sometimes love is like a slap in the face  
You been burned and still  
It's the same old mistake  
If you want my opinion  
I'll give it to you straight  
Love is like a slap in the face  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na  
na na na na na na na na na  
I never knew I could hurt so good, no no  
I never thought I'd say nonono, no no  
But I'm here babe  
I got a secret inside  
Sometimes love is like a ball and chain  
Keeps you up at night, why is it always the same  
If you want to know the truth  
It's something I can't explain  
Yeah love is like a ball and chain  
Yeah na na na na...
