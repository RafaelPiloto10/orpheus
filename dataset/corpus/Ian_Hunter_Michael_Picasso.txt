Once upon a time  
Not so long ago  
People used to stand and stare  
At the spider with the platinum hair  
They thought you were immortal  
  
We had our ups and downs  
Like brothers often do  
But I was there for him  
He was always there for me  
And we were there for you  
  
How can I put into words  
What my heart feels?  
It's the deepest thing  
When somebody you love dies  
  
I just wanted  
To give something back to you  
Gift to gift  
Michael, michael picasso good night  
  
You used to love our house  
You said it was relaxing  
Now I walk in the places you walk  
I talk in all the spaces you talk  
It still hasn't sunk in  
  
Are the words real  
That come into my head  
On a morning walk?  
Do the shadows  
Play tricks with my mind?  
  
For it feels like  
Nothing has changed  
But I know it has  
Michael, michael picasso  
Good night  
  
Heal me  
Won't you  
Heal me?  
Nothing lasts forever  
Set me free  
  
Heal me  
Won't you  
Heal me?  
I'm the one who's left here  
Heal me  
Heal me  
Heal me  
  
You turned into a ghost  
Surrounded by your pain  
And the thing that I liked the least  
Was sitting 'round hasker street  
Lying about the future  
  
And we all sit  
In a room full of tears  
On a windy day  
And I looked out  
But none of these words seem right  
  
I just wanted  
To give something back to you  
Gift to gift  
Michael, michael picasso  
Good night
