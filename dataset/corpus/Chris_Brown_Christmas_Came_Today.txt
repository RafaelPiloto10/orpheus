Oh, do you want me girl?  
Baby love how you been doing?  
Have you been naughty and nice baby?  
Tell me what are we doing?  
It's snowing on this beautiful music  
And when I'll earn a present tonight, you gonna be the one, listen to me now  
Go Judith  
... You want me boy X 2  
Just kiss me, Oh baby  
  
Christmas came today, and we can... , Christmas came today  
Baby love, you know I'm hungry  
You brought them pennies with your ride  
... Just wanna... They won't hear a sound  
I'm like... She come back like a yo yo  
Girl I don't make you rain, I make you snow  
You and me start, tell me now, your life is so... On the floor  
...  
Girl you want me more  
Oh baby, we can both say Christmas came today  
We can both say Christmas came today  
Oh Judith,
