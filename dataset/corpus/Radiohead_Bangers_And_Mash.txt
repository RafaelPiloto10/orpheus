You bit me, bit me, bit me, oh  
You bit me, bit me, and now I want more  
I'm standing in the hall  
I'm kicking out the wall  
It's all been sent to the Conger Hill  
  
The bangers and the mash  
The negatives for cash  
You're either in the club, baby  
Or you're not  
  
Whatever turns you on  
Whatever gets you off  
Chief of police, the vice-chancellor  
Lord and lady blah-blah  
The vicar and the judge  
You're all dancing to my little red book  
  
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh  
I've got the poison, poison  
And now I want more  
  
If you are on the top  
Then it is a long drop  
The pyramid is power  
We're changin' by the hour  
If you are on the top  
Then it is a long drop  
You stare into the dark  
The dark will stare back  
Back into your soul  
  
The ch-ch-cheque came through (x7)  
  
I'm taking you down  
I'm taking you down  
I'm taking you down when I go down  
I'm taking you down  
I'm taking you down  
I'm standing in the hall  
I'm kicking out the wall  
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh  
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh  
I've got the poison (x4)
