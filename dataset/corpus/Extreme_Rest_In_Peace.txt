Let's talk of peace,  
Sounds so cliche  
A novelty,  
Catch phrase of the day  
Middle, index,  
Sign of the time  
Just as complex,  
As water to  
  
Someone said  
Give peace a chance  
And, that's all that we're saying  
While we're sitting  
On the fence  
Pretending,  
Our hearts are in the right place  
But, your face  
Shows a trace of  
  
Hypocrisy,  
Don't tread on me,  
Now you can see  
  
Make love not war,  
Sounds so absurd, to me  
We can't afford  
To say these words, lightly  
Or else our world  
Will truly, rest in peace  
  
Let's not pretend,  
To justify  
Rather amend,  
Where treasures lie  
Straight through the heart,  
Peace can be found  
That's where you start,  
Not all around  
  
Someone said  
Give peace a chance  
And, that's all that we're saying  
While we're sitting  
On the fence  
Pretending,  
Our hearts are in the right place  
But, your face  
Shows a trace of  
  
Hypocrisy,  
Don't tread on me, boy  
Now you can see
