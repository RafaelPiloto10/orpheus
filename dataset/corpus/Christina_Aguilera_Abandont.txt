She sits alone,  
In the abandon't corner, of her room, (oh her room)  
Lost her life, her lovely past, ooo ooo ooo ooo  
She used to love, feel and have compation,  
But now Her life has lead nowhere, nowhere(hold 4 count)  
(Chorus)  
She feels attached,  
And can't come loose,  
Like strings holding on,  
She can't let go,  
She begs and pleads,  
As she tries to relase,  
And falls to her knees (hold 4 counts)  
  
What's holding her back?  
No one has know,  
Maybe her shadow,  
The shadow of doom,  
She is miserable each day, each week  
While tears begin to run down her cheeks  
Hoping for her day to come, (hold 4 counts)  
For her to pry loose,  
The day has not begun... (o when?)  
(Chorus)  
She feels attached,  
And can't come loose,  
Like strings holding on,  
She can't let go,  
She begs and pleads,  
As she tries to relase,  
And falls to her kneeeees  
(Oh Oh hold last "oh" 4 counts)  
  
Stings, Strings,  
They hold her back,  
No one has notcied,  
Or cared,  
No one knows,  
What's she is really like,  
Deep down inside,  
Oh What's there to hide?  
  
She is nervous, frightened, scared and weak,  
She must peer or peak from that...  
Corner of the room,  
Open her eyes, and face doom (hold doom 4 counts)  
  
(Slower)  
Maybe she has, maybe she did,  
She woke up one day and saw the light,  
Her love and compasion, had all faded away,  
As she ran through her shadow, and began to  
Beg and plead as she fell to her knees and finally,  
She broke loose
