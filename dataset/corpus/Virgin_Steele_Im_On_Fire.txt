I'm hot and I'm ready  
Like a star in the night  
Cold as ice  
Quicker than sight  
  
Yeah I'm wild and I'm mean  
Like a lion deep in heat  
You'll feel my love  
A pounding beat-Yeah!  
  
But what you don't see  
You'll never own me  
I hear the call of the wild  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm on fire, I'm on fire,  
Strange desire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire, on fire, I'm hot!  
  
My love is danger  
Oh my love is steele  
And I'm the vicious sting  
A raging king, a diamond ring  
And you're my meal  
  
Yeah I'm a phantom of delight  
I'll thrill you once  
I'll thrill you twice  
But when the first light- hits the sky  
I will be gone- gone!  
  
It's like I told you  
I'll never be true  
I hear the call of the wild  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say you love me  
Oh no you can't  
My life is blazing  
Burning fast-way too fast  
Hey hey
