Jesse rides through the night  
Under the Main Street light  
Ridin' slow  
  
This ol' town, ain't the same  
Now nobody knows his name  
Times have changed, still he rides.  
  
Traffic lights, keepin' time  
Leading the wild and restless  
Through the night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Still they ride, on wheels of fire  
They rule the night  
Still they ride, the strong will survive  
Chasing thunder  
  
Spinning 'round, in a spell  
It's hard to leave this carousel  
'Round and 'round  
And 'round and 'round  
  
[Chorus:]
