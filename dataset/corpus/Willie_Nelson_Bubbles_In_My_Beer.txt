Tonight in a bar alone  
I'm sitting apart from  
The laughter and the cheer  
Scenes from the past  
Rise before me while  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
Visions of someone  
Who loved me brings  
Along salty tears to my eyes  
And I know that my life's  
Been a failure  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
  
I'm seeing the road  
That I've traveled  
A road paved  
With heartaches and tears  
And I'm seeing the past  
That I've wasted  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
Visions of someone who loved me...
