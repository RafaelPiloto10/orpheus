I've always been the kind of girl  
That hid my face  
So afraid to tell the world  
What I've got to say  
  
But I have this dream  
Bright inside of me  
I'm gonna let it show  
It's time to let you know  
To let you know  
  
This is real, this is me  
I'm exactly where I'm supposed  
To be now gonna let  
The light shine on me  
Now I've found who I am  
There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be  
This is me  
  
Do you know what it's like  
To feel so in the dark  
To dream about a life  
Where you're the shining star  
  
Even though it seems  
Like it's too far away  
I have to believe in myself  
It's the only way  
  
This is real, this is me  
I'm exactly where I'm supposed  
To be now gonna let  
The light shine on me  
Now I've found who I am  
There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be  
This is me  
  
You're the voice I hear inside my head  
The reason that I'm singin'  
I need to find you  
I gotta find you  
  
You're the missing piece I need  
The song inside of me  
I need to find you  
I gotta find you  
  
This is real, this is me  
I'm exactly where I'm supposed  
To be now gonna let  
The light shine on me  
Now I've found who I am  
There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be  
This is me  
  
This is me, this is me  
  
You're the missing piece I need  
The song inside of me  
  
You're the voice I hear inside my head  
The reason that I'm singin'  
  
Now I've found who I am  
There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be  
This is me
