What child is this layed to rest  
While Mary's man is sleeping  
Whom angles greet with anthems sweet  
While shepards watch their king  
  
Why lies he in such lowly place  
While cows and sheep are feeding  
Good christian fear for sinners here  
A silent word is pleeding  
  
Chorus  
This This is christ the King  
Whom shepards guard and angles sing  
Hast hast to bring him praise  
The baby son of mary  
  
  
So bring him insence, gold, and myrrh  
Come peasant King to owe him  
The king of kings salvation bring  
That loving hearts inthrone  
  
Chorus  
This this is christ the king  
Whom Shepards guard and angles sing  
Hast Hast to bring him praise  
The baby son of Mary
