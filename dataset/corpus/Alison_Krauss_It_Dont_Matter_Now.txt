It's finally come  
Is that sorry on your breath?  
Where were you when  
I was sitting back here  
Missing you to death?  
It don't matter now  
How, I want to know  
Can you tell me plain and true  
How high will you fly  
Without me there to be your sky?  
Well, it don't matter now  
  
Don't mean to leave you  
Standing on your own  
I think back on days and nights  
We had long ago  
Maybe love  
Is just a game you play  
This much I do know  
It don't matter now  
  
It's finally come  
Is that sorry on your breath?  
Where were you when  
I was sitting back here  
Missing you to death?  
It don't matter now  
Now I don't tell stories  
And I don't pretend  
I won't be around  
To say I told you then  
'Cause it seems like something's  
Finally broken  
That'll take a lot of mend  
But it don't matter now  
  
Is that sorry on your breath?  
Where were you when I  
Was sitting back here  
Missing you to death?  
It don't matter now  
It don't matter now  
It don't matter now
