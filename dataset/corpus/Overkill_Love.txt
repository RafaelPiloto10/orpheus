Come, come, come alive,  
Protect me from myself  
Come, come satisfy  
Will I ever tell  
  
Touch me with your fire  
Your everlasting glow  
Lead me to your inner peace  
That I only know  
  
Stay, stay, stay alive  
Take me from your shelf  
Will you have to try  
To keep me from myself  
  
Cover me in secrets  
Blanket me in hope  
Give me faith, so I can too  
Untie this holy rope  
  
This is... love  
  
Will you come if I don't call  
Help me if I fall  
All about just living  
Deep inside your wall  
  
Speak your sweet desire  
With your devil breath  
Lead me through your chaos  
Before I am put to death  
  
Will you be around  
If I come unwound  
Keep me in your inner  
Sanctum of the bound  
  
Feel my torrid blessing  
Cast upon your cheek  
Touch the hand that leads you  
To eternal sleep  
  
The damage to the under  
world of light  
A medal on the chest of right  
A contradiction  
A no one knows  
Speak your mine, and go  
  
Come, come come alive  
Take me from your shelf  
Never satisfied  
I will never tell  
  
The damage to the under  
World of light  
A scar upon the face of right  
A contradiction  
A no one knows  
Speak your mine, and go
