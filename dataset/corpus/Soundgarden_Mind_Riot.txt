I was slipping through the cracks  
Of a stolen jewel  
I was tightrope walking in two ton shoes  
Now somebody is talking about a  
Third world war (I've been caught in a mind riot)  
And the police said this is normal control (I've been caught in a mind riot)  
  
The candle was burning yesterday  
Like somebody's best friend died  
I've been caught in a mind riot... mind riot  
  
I was crying from my eye teeth and  
Bleeding from my soul  
And I sharpened my wits on a dead man's skull  
I built an elevator from his bones (I've been caught in a mind riot)  
Had climb to the top floor to  
To stamp out the coals (I've been caught in a mind riot)  
  
The candle was burning yesterday  
Like somebody's best friend died  
I've been caught in a mind riot  
  
I'm tied within  
The candle was burning yesterday  
Like somebody's best friend died  
I've been caught in a mind riot  
I'm tied within  
I'm luck's last match struck  
In the pouring down wind  
Pouring down wind  
  
Mind riot, mind riot, mind riot, mind riot...
