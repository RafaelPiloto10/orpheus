[Intro]  
And all I remember is your back  
Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past  
I traveled 1,500 miles to see you  
Begged you to want me  
But you didn't want to  
  
[Chorus]  
But piece by piece you collected me  
Up off the ground but you abandoned things  
And piece by piece you filled the holes that you burned in me  
At six years old and no  
He never walks away  
He never asks for money  
He takes care of me  
He loves me  
Piece by piece  
He restored my faith  
That a man can be kind  
And a father could stay  
  
[Verse 1]  
And all of your words fall flat  
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back  
But your love isn't free  
It has to be earned  
Back then I didn't have anything you needed  
So, I was worthless  
  
[Chorus]  
But piece by piece you collected me  
Up off the ground but you abandoned things  
And piece by piece you filled the holes that you burned in me  
At six years old and no  
He never walks away  
He never asks for money  
He takes care of me  
He loves me  
Piece by piece  
He restored my faith  
That a man can be kind  
And a father could stay  
  
[Hook]  
Piece by piece...  
  
[Verse 2]  
Piece by piece I fell far from the tree  
I would never leave her like you left me  
She will never have to wonder her worth  
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first  
He'll never walk away  
He'll never break her heart  
He'll take care of things  
He'll love her  
Piece by piece  
He restored my faith  
That a man can be kind  
And a father should be great  
  
[Hook]  
Piece by piece...  
Piece by piece...
