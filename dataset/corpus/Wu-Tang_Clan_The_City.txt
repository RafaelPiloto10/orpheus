That's black?  
Whattup God?  
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?  
Oh shit! Yo!  
Hold the fuck up  
  
Aiyyo yo, eight niggaz down (just enough)  
Fuckin' around with my sound (city)  
Yo, bring backup (city)  
Fuckin' with me, and mine  
Murderous  
  
Check it, yo  
The world is shifty, we livin' just enough for the city  
The rough witty killa bee sting just like the jiggy  
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone  
Label them my anus and the casualty's home  
It glows coffin, Wu stormin' like the light brigade  
ride the wave like Frankie Avalon  
As I decipher AIDS crime pays  
The law's long arm be tryin' to strongarm, walkin timebombs  
before I bomb firearm  
The chalm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster  
He toke with his own love and expose the black toaster  
Composer was shook  
I took your bad looks for joke get your back broke  
Deep throat this murder I wrote  
The antidote be seekin' like a buried treasure  
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector  
Wanted dead or alive  
Rebel I escapes across the desert sand  
leavin' no footprints to trace  
Keep a war face, in your place  
Conceal the baby knives on the North breaks  
I still shine in shady times  
  
Yeah, yo  
We livin' just enough (livin' just enough)  
Just enough (in the city)  
Just enough, for the city  
  
Yo, in the jungle  
I make moves like Iron Monkey  
Plots to bump me off D.O.T. be on the hunt for me  
We stay hungry, for money drugs and guns  
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs  
Know the science be my Goddess  
The facts tell gats sell like sex and violence  
And break the project silence, a vision  
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison  
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world  
for the world war is ocean bomber  
Visionary soldier comma  
My code of honor, mind still start from the drama  
Trauma sent the victim, witness them run, scream in horror  
Military chopper come gun down the slum  
The outcome do or die Son it's bound to come  
Mentally aware I see truth within the square  
The future's here catch me on computer software  
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official  
It's a thirty-eight special, that steps through  
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle  
I may die in the scuffle but I'm takin' forty devils  
  
We livin' just enough  
Just enough  
Just enough  
For the city  
  
Killa beez, sting McEEEZ, yeah, Wu
