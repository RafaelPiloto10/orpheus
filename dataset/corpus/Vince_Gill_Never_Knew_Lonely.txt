No other lover ever really cared  
When I've reached out for you you've always been there  
Now I'm so far away and baby I'm scared  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
You are my rock and the strength I need  
To keep me sane in this life that I lead  
Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I never knew lonely could be so blue  
I never knew lonely could tear you in two  
I never loved someone like I love you  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I can't make up for the times I've been gone  
But I'll prove I love you in the words of this song  
Back in your arms girl it's where I belong  
I never knew lonely til you  
  
I never knew lonely could be so blue  
I never knew lonely could tear you in two  
I never loved someone like I love you  
I never knew lonely til you
