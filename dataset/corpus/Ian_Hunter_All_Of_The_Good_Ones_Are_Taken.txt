Girl, things ain't been goin' too good for me  
Girl, I'm living in the middle of a mystery  
You're the one that can turn me on  
'N' now that you're gone  
I said Girl, I'm livin' in the middle of your memory  
Girl, you're still the figure in my favorite fantasy  
I know you know that's the way it goes  
And still my love grows  
  
I said all o' the good all o' the good ones are taken  
All o' the good all o' the good ones are taken  
  
I'm hangin' around with my head in the air  
Watchin' the lovers go by  
I had a lover, but she never cared  
All you could say was goodbye  
Maybe I was mistaken, maybe I got it wrong  
But all of the good ones are taken from now on  
'N' girl, I'm livin' in the middle of a broken dream  
I said girl all this fallin' in love ain't like it seems  
Out in the rain can't you feel my pain  
Again 'n' again 'n' again 'n' again 'n' again  
All of the good all o' the good ones are taken  
Maybe I was mistaken, maybe I got it wrong  
But all of the good ones are taken in my song
