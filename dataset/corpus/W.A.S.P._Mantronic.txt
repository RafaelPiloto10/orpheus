You see me, a man and machine  
All my life so hungry and lean  
Watch me bleed and I feel no pain  
I'm going wild and slowly insane  
  
Mantronic, I'm on the loose  
Bionic, my neck in the noose  
Mantronic, I'm still the king  
Bionic, half man and machine  
  
One fast lane, on top of the world  
Balls of steel, mechanical pearls  
I pay my dues and suffer alone  
Feel like hell and cut to the bone  
  
Mantronic, I'm on the loose  
Bionic, my neck in the noose  
Mantronic, I'm still the king  
Bionic, half man and machine  
  
Be careful now  
Because what you wish for  
Just may come true  
If you look  
Behind that door  
  
Mantronic, I'm on the loose  
Bionic, my neck in the noose  
Mantronic, I'm still the king  
Bionic, half man and machine
