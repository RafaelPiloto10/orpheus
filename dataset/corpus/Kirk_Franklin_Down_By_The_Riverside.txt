Kirk Franklin:  
For those of you that are going through  
I want you to wipe every tear from you eye  
Cause Jesus said he'll meet us someday  
Down by the riverside  
Can I get A witness up in here  
  
Choir:  
It's Friday and my bills are due  
My 3 month old baby need some shoes  
Can't you feel what I'm going through  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking tocking  
No stopping and somebody's knocking  
On my door telling me to go  
Brother I can't take no more  
So wit my knees I hit the floor  
And say help me Jesus, help me Jesus  
  
Chorus:  
Let's go down by the riverside  
Leave your problems all behind  
You can rest troubled minds  
Down by....  
The riverside  
  
Kirk Franklin:  
I don't think you heard me the first  
So then why don't I say it one more time  
Everybody Jesus is going to meet us down there  
By the riverside  
One time for the holy mind  
  
Choir:  
If I concentrate on all the bad  
And all the things I wish I had  
How can those dark clouds ever pass  
Weeping, enduring for night  
But joy comes in the morning light  
Gotta keep the spirit right  
So no matter what the people say  
Ain't nobody taking this joy away  
In spite of everything I been through  
I can say...  
Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus  
  
Chorus(2X):  
Let's go down by the riverside  
Leave your problems all behind  
You can rest troubled minds  
Down by....
