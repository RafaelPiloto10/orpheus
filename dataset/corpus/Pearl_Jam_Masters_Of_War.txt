Come you masters of war  
You that build all the guns  
You that build the death planes  
You that build all the bombs  
You that hide behind walls  
You that hide behind desks  
We just want you to know we can see through your masks  
You that never done nothing  
But build and destroy  
You play with our world  
Like it's your little toy  
You put a gun in my head  
And then you hide from my eyes  
Then you turn and run following the fast foolish line  
Like Judas of old  
You lie and deceive  
A world war can be won  
You won't need to believe  
But I see through your eye  
And I see through your brain  
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain  
You that fasten all the trigger  
For the others to fire  
And you sit back and watch  
While the death toll gets higher  
You hide in your mansion  
While young people's blood  
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud  
You've thrown the worst fear  
That could ever be hurled  
The fear to bring children  
Into this world  
For threatening my baby  
Unborn and unnamed  
You ain't worth the blood that runs through your veins  
How much do we know  
To talk out of turn?  
You might say that we're young  
You might say we're unlearned  
But there's one thing I know  
Though I'm younger than you  
Even Jesus would never forgive what you do  
Let me ask you one question  
Is your money that good?  
Will it buy you forgiveness?  
Do you think that it would?  
Oh, I think you will find  
When your death takes its toll  
All the money you made will never buy back your soul  
And I hope that you die  
And your death will come soon  
I'll stand on your [Incomprehensible]  
In the pale afternoon  
And I'll watch while you're lowered  
Into your deathbed  
And I'll stand on your grave till I'm sure that you're dead
