We sit secure in time-honored traditions made  
Never wondering where or when the sickle may come  
If we don't seek our knowledge to be greater men  
When the rain starts falling gonna drown before we get our feet wet  
  
We build our ivory towers to protect us from the flood  
A fleet of vessels made of wood so they won't rust  
But can we see the bottom of the bottle when we start to drink?  
There's fire on the mountain fire and it's coming our way  
  
Can we pick the pieces up  
We're mending Babylon  
Tryin' to right the wrong  
Can we pick the pieces up  
  
Live learn life love die dust gone  
  
There's fire on the mountain  
  
Can we pick the pieces up  
We're mending Babylon  
Tryin' to right the wrong  
Can we pick the pieces up  
  
Live learn life love die dust gone
