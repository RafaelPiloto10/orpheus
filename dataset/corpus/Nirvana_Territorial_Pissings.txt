When I was an alien  
Cultures weren't opinions  
  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
I had better wait  
  
Never met a wise man  
If so it's a woman  
  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
I had better wait  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
I had better wait  
  
Just because you're paranoid  
Don't mean they're not after you  
  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
I had better wait  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
I had better wait  
Gotta find a way  
To find a way  
When I'm there  
Gotta find a way  
A better way  
I had better wait
