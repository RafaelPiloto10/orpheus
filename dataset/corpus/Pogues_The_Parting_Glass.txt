Of all the money that e'er I spent  
I've spent it in good company  
And all the harm that ever I did  
Alas, it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of wit  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
If I had money enough to spend  
And leisure to sit awhile  
There is a fair maid in the town  
That sorely has my heart beguiled  
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips  
I own she has my heart enthralled  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had  
They're sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had  
They'd wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all
