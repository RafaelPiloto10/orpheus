Mercedes:  
When the world is seeing yellow  
I only see gray  
When everybody sees the rainbow  
I'm stuck in the rain  
You take a little piece of me  
Every time you leave  
I don't think that I'll  
Ever find that silver lining  
Or a reason to smile  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now I'm colour blind, colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind, never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Always black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind  
  
Ain't it funny that you managed  
To just wash away  
Even pictures that you're not in  
Have started to fade  
I try to play my favorite songs  
But I can't sing along  
The words don't feel the same  
You've taken all the best things from me  
And thrown them away  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now I'm colour blind, colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind, never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Always black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind  
  
I'll wait  
For roses to be red again  
And I hate  
That you took my blue from the ocean  
Give me back green greens and goldens  
My purples, my blues, you stole them  
How long will I be broken?  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now I'm colour blind, colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind, never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Only black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind  
It's only black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind
