Pass me not Oh gental savior  
Hear my humble cry  
While the others thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
  
I've got the feelin' and the feelin's not the same  
I did the hip hop a little hammer and the james  
But a touch a touch from up above  
And I get the feelin' the feelin of your love  
Reachin out (reachin out)  
Callin' for your people  
To keep us all safe from a world that's full of evil  
Tryin' cryin'  
Lord sometimes I'm cryin  
When I think of his gifts and the world jusk keeps denying  
  
When I think of his goodness and what he's done for me  
My soul cries Hallelujah  
Thanks for savin' me sing  
  
Savior, savior, why don't you  
Hear my humble cry  
  
While the others thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
  
(dance break?)  
  
I don't want the lord to pass me by (7)  
  
Ii need him  
At home  
At work  
At school  
Do you need him?  
I know you need him!  
  
While the others thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
  
Do not pass me by!
