You say that this is the end,  
And I feel the knife cut off my right hand.  
You may not care right now,  
But if it's over, it's done and I won't turn around.  
  
Love is dyin'.  
There ain't no use in cryin'.  
  
You oughta know me better than that,  
I really love you if that's where it's at.  
I really love you but I won't be back,  
Oh how I love you, I love you but I won't be back.  
  
A dreamer of dreamers I have always been,  
And this time there won't be no givin' in.  
Chances are we could change our minds,  
But I don't think I can make it another time.  
  
Love is dyin'.  
There ain't no use in cryin'.  
  
You oughta know me better than that,  
I really love you if that's where it's at.  
I really love you but I won't be back,  
Oh how I love you, I love you but I won't be back.  
  
Love is dyin'.  
There ain't no use in cryin'.  
  
I really love you if that's where it's at.  
I really love you but I won't be back,  
  
Love is dyin'.  
There ain't no use in cryin'.
