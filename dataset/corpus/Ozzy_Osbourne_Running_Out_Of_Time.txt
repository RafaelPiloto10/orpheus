Been around this world so many times  
If you could only see my mind  
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell  
  
Faith alone has guided me  
The ghost of my own destiny  
I haven't even got a soul to sell  
  
All the thing I put me through  
I wouldn't wish my hell on you  
You'll never know what's going on inside  
  
Just another lonely broken hero  
Picking up the pieces of my mind  
Running out of faith and hope and reason  
I'm running out of time  
Running out of time  
  
Trouble always seems find  
A way to live inside my mind  
My haunted head and me remain alone  
Underneath my masquerade  
A simple man who's so afraid  
I try to find a light to guide me home  
  
Momma please just hold me tight  
Feeling so afraid tonight  
'Cause your the only one that really knows  
  
Just another lonely broken hero  
Picking up the pieces of my mind  
Running out of faith and hope and reason  
I'm running out of time  
Running out of time  
  
Fighting for my sanity  
Many nights of tragedy  
Got to leave my Wretched ways behind  
  
Just another lonely broken hero  
Picking up the pieces of my mind  
Running out of fate and hope and reason  
I'm running out of time  
Running out of time  
I'm running out of time  
Running out of time  
  
Underneath my masquerade  
A simple who's still afraid
