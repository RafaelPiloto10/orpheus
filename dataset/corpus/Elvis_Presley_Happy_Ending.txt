Happy ending, happy ending  
Give me a story with a, happy ending  
When boy meets girl and then  
They never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
Our love story gets me so upset  
Like romeo, and juliet  
I'm not smart enough to figure why  
Some folks enjoy, a real good cry  
  
Happy ending, happy ending  
Give me a story with a, happy ending  
When boy meets girl and then  
They never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
Never thought that i would stand a chance  
That you'd give me, a second glance  
But i think that you can play the part  
And give a guy, a happy heart  
  
Happy ending, happy ending  
Give me a story with a, happy ending  
When boy meets girl and then  
They never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
When boy meets girl and then, they never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
Like you and me, like you and me  
Like you and me
