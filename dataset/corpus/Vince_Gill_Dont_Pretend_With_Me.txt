They say you'll lie, they say you'll cheat  
And your kisses taste so sweet  
If you're not in love then let me be  
No baby, don't pretend with me  
  
That honky-tonking life you lead  
With neon lights you'll never leave  
Give me one reason to believe  
But baby, don't pretend with me  
  
Your foolish heart will never change  
Well, I want no part of your love-sick games  
I know you're wild and runnin' free  
So baby, don't pretend with me  
  
I'll lay my poor heart at your feet  
If you'll leave behind those lonely streets  
Oh, we could make sweet memories  
So baby, don't pretend with me  
  
Your foolish heart will never change  
I want no part of your love-sick games  
I know you're wild and runnin' free  
So baby, don't pretend with me  
I know you're wild and runnin' free  
So baby, don't pretend with me
