You gotta feel so guilty  
Got so much for so little  
Then you find that feeling just won't go away  
You're holding on to every thing so tightly  
Till there's nothing left for you anyway  
Goodbye  
You can keep this suit of lights  
I'll be up with the sun  
And not coming down  
I'm not coming down  
I'm not coming down  
  
You wanted to get somewhere so badly  
You had to lose yourself along the way  
You change a name but that's okay  
It's necessary  
And what you leave behind  
You don't miss anyway  
  
Goodbye  
You can keep this suit of lights  
I'll be up with the sun  
And not coming down  
I'm not coming down  
I'm not coming down  
  
And I'm already gone  
Felt that way all along  
Closer to you every day  
I didn't want it that much anyway  
  
You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy  
Then you get to like the way it feels  
You hurt yourself you hurt your lover  
Then you discover  
What you thought was freedom is just greed  
  
Goodbye  
No emotional  
Goodnight  
We'll be up with the sun  
Are you still holding on  
I'm not coming down  
I'm not coming down  
I'm not coming down
