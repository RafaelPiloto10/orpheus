Sitting in the cellar, watching all the others  
  
It was only yesterday, needles in my skin  
They turned my last remains into this puppet thing  
  
Blood to walk, blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
I can see, but I cannot move at all  
Yet I have feelings, I know it's very strange  
  
Blood to walk, blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
I'm on my shelf...eternal eyes they never sleep  
I take a look...and in the dark I see victoria  
  
Solo: andy  
  
There is no mistake, that is my beloved  
Sitting on her shelf.. alone and so dead  
  
Solo: mike  
  
There's a light outside the door  
Mommy and daddy are back for more.. "let's play"  
  
"Hello my children...in blood I will teach you"  
  
They take Victoria down from her shelf  
They sit her on the floor.. and me in front of her  
  
Blood to walk, blood to see  
Blood to walk again and blood to be  
  
There are strings attached to our heads  
There are strings in arms and legs  
The puppet master"s hands  
Oh they keep us straight  
  
Pressing the needle in... I feel the sting, it's emerencia  
Injecting blood... into the both of us...it's hot  
  
I think I see her move  
There's a tingle in our skin  
I can't believe...that she can she again...  
  
There is no mistake, that is my beloved  
I have missed you so.. oh no  
It's like a horror show without a word we know  
As we communicate.. with our eyes.. deep inside  
We wonder why  
  
Why our minds are now in our eyes  
We can move without any strings  
  
"They're alive...that's enough for today.. put them away"
