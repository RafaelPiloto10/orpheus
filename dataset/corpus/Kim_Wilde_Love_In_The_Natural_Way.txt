Well it sounded like a whisper  
But soon became a cry  
And the moment that I touch you  
I know the reason why - we got love  
No union is stronger than a woman with a man  
I'm gonna give love in the natural way  
With everything I can  
Never mind if things go wrong  
You and I will still be strong  
And how I love you now  
  
Oh baby, we're here tonight  
We can make it last forever  
Wen can make it last for life  
Oh, baby, no matter what  
I'm gonna give love in the natural way  
With everything I got  
  
All times it can be gentle  
And at times it can be cruel  
It can treat you like a stranger  
It can treat you like a fool  
But tonight I wanna hold you  
Cos tonight you're gonna see  
I'm gonna give you love in the natural way  
And keep you here with me  
Lovin' like you've never known  
Now at last We're on our own  
And I still love you now  
  
Oh, baby, we're here tonight  
We can make it last forever  
We can make it last for life  
Oh, babe, it's me and you  
And it's a natural reaction  
When you feel the way we do  
What is left that's still unknown  
Let's discover on our own  
  
Cos when love's the culmination  
Of everything you feel  
Well it's the only thing that's precious  
It's the only thing that's real
