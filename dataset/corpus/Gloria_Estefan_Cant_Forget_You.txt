There's a part of me that's dying every time I hear your name  
There's a part of me that's trying to bring back your love again  
There are times when I just want to run, but there's no place to hide  
Even though mu heart is breaking in a million bits inside  
I can make believe that none of this is true  
  
But I can't forget you, can't break free  
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you  
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday  
What we lost yesterday  
  
There are nights when I lay wide awake thinking of how good it could be  
Other nights I don't feel worthy of the love you gave to me  
I remember not too long ago we both were here to stay  
But it seems it happened overnight when I threw it all away  
I can walk away and find somebody new  
  
But I can't forget you, can't break free  
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you  
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday  
What we lost yesterday  
  
Hope that I can make you love me once again but I can't forget you  
  
But I can't forget you, can't break free  
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you  
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday  
What we lost yesterday
