If I were a pendulum swing and you were the bird in the cuckoo clock  
Ev'ry time you cucko-cooed I would double tick another tick tock  
I'd double my swing ev'ry time you'd sing we'd make good time with each other  
Oh, but that would be just so much fun cooin' and swingin' together  
If I were a little bitty boy and I had just a little bit o' credit  
I would make a loan for an ice cream cone and I'd go right away and get it  
You would lick a little and I would lick a little, we surely could lick with
each other  
Oh, but that would be just so much fun, eating it all together  
And if I were a little honey bee and you were a little butterfly  
I would be waiting at the garden gate until you came fluttering by  
Maybe you'd stop on a red rose top and then we could talk to each other  
Oh, but we cou'd flutter up so much fun being in the garden together  
But I'm just an ordinary guy and I love all the things you do  
You seem such a talented, beautiful girl and I'm afraid to even talk to you  
If I were as bold like some guys, hearin' them talk to each other  
I'd come over and ask you if we could go out together  
But if you were a Mercedes-Benz, I'd have to be a Fleetwood Brougham  
And ev'ry time I saw you rollin' on the freeway I think I'd have to follow you
home  
You could let me lodge in your double garage, bumper to bumper out of the
weather  
Nobody home but the Benz and the Brougham, really rarin' to roll off together
