Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette  
Thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic  
What's missing? He's living a day he'll soon forget  
  
That's one more time around, the sun is going down  
The moon is out, but he's drunk and shouting, putting people down  
He's pissing, he's living a day he'll soon forget  
  
Counts his money every morning, the only thing that keeps him horny  
Locked in a giant house, that's alarming  
The townsfolk, they all laugh  
  
Sorry is the fool who trades his love for hi-rise rent  
Seems the more you make equals the loneliness you get  
And it's fitting, he's barely living a day he'll soon forget  
  
That's one more time around, and there is not a sound  
He's lying dead, clutching Benjamins, never put the money down  
He's stiffening, we're all whistling, a man we'll soon forget
