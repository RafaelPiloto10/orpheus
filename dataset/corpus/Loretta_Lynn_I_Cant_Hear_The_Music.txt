He showed me there was more to me  
When I thought I had nothing else to give  
God knows he wasn't perfect  
Ah, but then, again, nobody is  
He always told me the truth  
No matter how hard it was to hear  
When he said, "I believe in you"  
It was music to my ears  
Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune  
The kind that inspires and helps me get through  
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, "You can"  
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan  
Now he's gone to a distant shore  
And I can't hear the music anymore  
Sometimes late at night  
I forget that he's not lyin' next to me  
He may be out of sight  
But out of mine is something he won't ever be  
Things that he said to me  
Are still ringing out loud and clear  
When he said, "I love you, baby"  
That was music to my ears  
Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune  
The kind that inspires and helps me get through  
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, "You can"  
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan  
Now he's gone to a distant shore  
And I can't hear the music anymore  
I can't hear the music
