There's nothing in my life I'd say I regret  
But there's something in your eyes that makes me forget  
The times that I believed that love was good as love could be  
I had it all but I was wrong  
  
Thought I'd been touched  
Thought I'd been kissed  
Thought I'd been loved  
But it was nothing like this  
  
You can't describe the sea unless you've been there before  
It's just a mystery until you're standing on the shore  
And moved by every wave  
Taking your breath away  
Like you do to me  
  
Thought I'd been touched  
Thought I'd been kissed  
Thought I'd been loved  
But it was nothing, nothing like this  
  
It's like another life  
Like I hadn't felt a thing  
Until you  
  
Thought I'd been touched  
Thought I'd been kissed  
Thought I'd been loved  
But it was nothing, nothing like this  
It was nothing like this  
Nothing like, nothing like this
