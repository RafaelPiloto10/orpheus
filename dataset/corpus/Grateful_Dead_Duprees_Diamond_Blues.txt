When I was just a little young boy,  
Papa said "Son, you'll never get far,  
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know,  
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go"  
  
Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring  
Wants it more than most any old thing  
Well when I get those jelly roll blues  
Why I'd go and get anything in this world for you.  
  
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun,  
Says "Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one"  
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said  
Dupree he said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"  
  
Well you know son you just can't figure,  
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger  
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -  
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad  
  
Judge said "Son, this gonna cost you some time"  
Dupree said "Judge, you know that crossed my mind"  
Judge said "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"  
Dupree said "Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right"  
  
Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man  
Dupree come out with a losing hand  
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile  
Then go on out and find another sweet man's  
Gonna treat her with style  
  
Judge said "Son, I know your baby well  
But that's a secret I can't never tell"  
Dupree said "Judge, well it's well understood,  
And you got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good"  
  
Well you know son you just can't figure,  
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger  
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad,  
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad  
  
Same old story and I know it's been told,  
Some like jelly jelly - some like gold  
Many a man's done a terrible thing  
Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring
