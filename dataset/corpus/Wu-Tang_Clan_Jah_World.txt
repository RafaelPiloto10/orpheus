Him speaketh in tongues into the hearts of all flesh  
Yeah stanyoi, whoi  
Oh God, I beg for forgiveness, so help me Lord, yes I beg for forgiveness  
Deep in my heart, please, I'm crying for forgiveness  
Allah you Akbar, I fall to my knees for forgiveness  
Branded by the steel iron, bullets flying  
Ladies being hit through wickedness, I'm losing my grip  
I thought we lived by the books, The Bible, Koran  
We pick cotton, my back is still hot and dark and  
They threw burners in our babies' faces  
Pale hands that looked scary  
Touched our bodies in the strangest places  
Sweat from the white man's head  
Fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head  
Almighty, alrighty, niggaz is screwing  
God won't you tell me why these ho niggaz is screwing?  
I'm sorry Father, sacrifice me, leave me wife  
Sacrifice me twice, so my kids can see paradise  
So we heed our God King Sellasie I, Jah rastafari  
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in all, in the hearts of all flesh  
Let my task oh Jah with them that strive with me  
Fight against them, that fight against me  
Take hold thy shield and rock and stand up for my health  
Oh Jah, oh Jah, only you can comfort me  
La la la, la la la la la, la la la  
La la whoi stand out  
Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away  
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away  
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow and white seed  
We don't discriminate man over color, creed  
They tried to snatch up our beats, son and steal our culture  
And German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures  
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?  
Kidnap the truth and destroying the black evidence  
Glory be to the Father, glory be to the Son  
Glory be to the holy one, the holder of creation whoi  
As Jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be  
Jah world, Jah world without end whoi  
So we heed our God King Sellassie I, Jahova God, Jah rastafari  
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in the hearts of  
In the hearts of all flesh whoi
