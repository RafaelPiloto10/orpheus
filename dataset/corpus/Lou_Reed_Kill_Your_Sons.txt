All your two-bit psychiatrists are giving you electro shock  
They say, they let you live at home, with mom and dad  
Instead of mental hospital  
But every time you tried to read a book  
You couldn't get to page 17  
'Cause you forgot, where you were  
So you couldn't even read  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
They're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Until they run run run run run run run run away  
  
Mom informed me on the phone  
She didn't know what to do about dad  
Took an axe and broke the table  
Aren't you glad you're married  
And sister, she got married on the island  
And her husband takes the train  
He's big and he's fat and he doesn't even have a brain  
They're gonna kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Until they run away  
  
Creedmore treated me very good  
But Paine Whitney was even better  
And when I flipped on PHC  
I was so sad I didn't even get a letter  
All of the drugs, that we took, it really was lots of fun  
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke  
You choke like a son of a gun  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
They're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Until they run run run run run run run run away
