She was a working girl  
North of England way  
Now she's in the big time...in the USA  
And if she could hear him, this is what he'd say  
Honey pie, you are making me crazy  
I'm in love but I'm lazy  
So won't ya please come home  
Oh honey pie, my position is tragic  
Come and show me that magic of your Hollywood song  
You became a legend on the silver screen  
And now the thought of meeting you makes me weak in the knees  
Tee tee tee  
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic  
Sail across the Atlantic to be where you belong  
Honey pie come back to me  
Oh wa wa wa...... wa wa wa wa wa wa wa... wa wa wa  
Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa  
I like it like this (laughing)  
Woo  
I like this...  
What kinda music (laughing)  
What kinda music, play it to me... play it to me  
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea  
Kindly send her sailing back to me? tee hee hee  
Oh honey pie you are making me crazy  
I'm in love but I'm lazy  
So won't ya please come home  
Come..come back to me honey pie  
Do do do do da da da dum  
Now don't get fresh fellas  
De da de do da dumb  
Honey pie come back...
