(Verse 1)  
So young in love,  
They couldn't wait.  
Said their vows,  
Had to run away.  
Suddenly,  
They felt their lives  
Had changed.  
They believed...  
Their hearts were strong.  
Just to find  
They couldn't get along.  
The dream they shared...  
Had slowly come undone.  
  
(Chorus)  
Will she go  
Or will she stay?  
Fool herself for  
One more day.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
Love's the promise...  
That he made.  
In his heart...  
It still remains.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
  
(Verse 2)  
They had to meet...  
Somewhere... halfway...  
Heart to heart and  
Face to face.  
Compromise...  
A price they had to pay.  
Cared enough...  
To stand her ground.  
Screamed and shouted  
Till the walls came down.  
Worth the fight  
To see a brand new day.  
  
(Chorus)  
Will she go  
Or will she stay?  
Fool herself for one more day.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
Love's the promise that he made.  
In his heart...  
It still remains.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
  
(Chorus)  
Will she go  
Or will she stay?  
Fool herself for one more day.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
Love's the promise that he made.  
In his heart...  
It still remains.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
  
Never walk away.  
  
Ooohhh...  
  
Never walk away!
