I think I'm headed for a terrible accident.  
Made more plans than anyone who ever paid their rent.  
I'm not stupid and I might be havin' too much pride.  
Surgeon general has determined that I may as well die.  
  
Jesus are you watching or have you gone blind.  
Evil souls are upon us and we're surely runnin' out of time.  
  
Chorus  
I tried religion and some holy roller steals my tenth.  
In the grave yard I ain't strong enough to jump the fence.  
Some men they say they got more soul than both my shoes.  
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.  
  
I might be workin' on a scene that I can never act.  
Everybody's gonna think that my mind is cracked.  
I don't care because it's my right to win or lose.  
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.  
  
Crazy, am I crazy for wanting so much more.  
My mind says I can't ever give up but I still can't be sure.  
  
Chorus  
  
Can we ever stop payin' dues.  
Can we ever stop payin' dues.  
Can we ever stop payin' dues.
