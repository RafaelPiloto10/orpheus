Down In The Depths"  
by Cole Porter  
  
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,  
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,  
Here I sit, above the town,  
In my pet-paillated gown,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,  
I'm deserted and depressed  
In my regal-eagle nest,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
When the only one you wanted wants another,  
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?  
Why, even the janitor's wife  
Has a perfectly good love life,  
And here I am, facing tomorrow,  
Alone in my sorrow,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor
