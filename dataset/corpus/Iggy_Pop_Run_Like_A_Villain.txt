Big dick is a thumbs-up guy  
He shot a missile in the sky  
It functioned just as advertised  
Until the fire made him cry  
Look into it later  
  
When the dust is clearing off the crater  
Run like a villain let the good times roll  
Run like a villain to the sugar bowl  
Run like a villain cause you can't adjust  
To a saccharine suburb in the mush  
I've got some loving arms around me  
Darker than the tombs of Egypt,  
Dumber than the crudest fiction,  
Buried in a melting coffin  
Nights like this appeal to me!  
  
Tracy got an afghan, pedigreed,  
Prescription shades and designer jeans  
A sony walkman on her head  
All she wants is to be fed  
Run, run, run, cause you're soft  
Run, run, but don't get lost  
The shining moon the dead oak tree  
Nights like this appeal to me  
  
I've got some loving arms around me  
The shining moon the dead oak tree  
Nights like this appeal to me  
I've got some loving arms around me  
Trying to steal a moment of pleasantry  
In this zombie birdhouse  
  
Run, run, run run like a villain  
Let the good times roll  
Run like a villain to save your soul  
It can't be done I already know  
So I run like a villain to the sugar bowl  
Cause who you are nobody knows  
Who you are nobody knows  
Rings on your fingers  
And bells on your toes
