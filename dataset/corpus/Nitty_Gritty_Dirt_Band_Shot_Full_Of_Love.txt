Once I had a heart cold as ice  
And love to me was only for fun  
And I made a mark for each broken heart  
Like nuches on the but of a gun  
  
Once I had a track on my sleeve  
And a reputation all over town  
I was heartless and cold and wherever I go  
I shut down every young girl I found  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
  
Who thought that someone like you  
Would take a desperado like me  
But all here I am, I'm week as a lamb  
With my bleading heart there at your feet  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
Shut full of love
