Seven on a Monday morning.  
And it's a sunny day.  
It's just too hot to be working  
But you've got to pay your way.  
  
So here I am sitting at the bus stop  
Wishing I was somewhere else  
Where I didn't have to work my rocks off  
Wishing I could please myself.  
  
Ten hours a day I'm grafting  
Under the bosses eye,  
Earn just enough to keep going,  
Making cars I'll never buy.  
  
So here I am sitting...  
Five days a week I'm giving,  
My time is clocking on.  
Just two days left for living,  
Wondering where my life has gone.  
  
So here I am sitting...
