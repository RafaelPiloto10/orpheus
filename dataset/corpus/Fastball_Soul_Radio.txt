No one knows the way  
(Which way the wind is gonna blow my mind)  
Another day has slipped away  
(And I have wasted so much time goes by)  
  
I feel like I'm floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
  
You and I, we scream, we cry  
(We just can't seem to see things eye to eye)  
Who knows why we're here, we're gone  
(I get so lost I cannot see the sky)  
  
I feel like I'm floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
Now you're fading out of view  
There's no me and there's no you  
Only white noise static  
Over my soul radio  
  
And I feel like I'm floating out in space  
I no longer see your face  
And your voice is breaking  
Over my soul radio  
Now you're fading out of view  
There's no me and there's no you  
Only white noise static  
Over my soul radio
