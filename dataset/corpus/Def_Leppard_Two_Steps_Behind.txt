Walk away if you want to  
It's OK, if you need to  
You can run, but you can never hide  
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Whatever you do)  
I'll be two steps behind you  
(Wherever you go)  
And I'll be there to remind you  
That it only takes a minute of your precious time  
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind  
  
Take the time  
To think about it  
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it  
Take a look around and see what you can find  
Like the fire that's burning up inside me  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you, you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Two steps behind  
Yeah, baby  
Two steps behind  
Ohh, sugar  
Two steps behind.
