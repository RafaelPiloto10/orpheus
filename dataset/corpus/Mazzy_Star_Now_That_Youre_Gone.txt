When you were down  
I was around  
But don't you call  
Out my name  
Because you know it ain't the same  
Anymore  
Anymore  
When you were young  
I was around  
But I wouldn't listen to you  
'Cause you're driving me wrong?  
But you know it ain't the same  
Anymore  
Anymore  
Because when you're young and so in love  
So in love inside  
But even though I tell you this now  
I really, really don't care  
No I don't care  
No I don't care  
When you were young  
I was always around  
But I wouldn't listen to you  
'Cause you're driving me wrong?  
But if you hear me I guess you know  
What I think?
