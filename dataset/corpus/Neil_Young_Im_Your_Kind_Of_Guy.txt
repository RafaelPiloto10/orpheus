Baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.  
  
I said, baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.  
  
I'll send you flowers  
Every day girl,  
If you will promise to be mine,  
Forever more.  
And if you say  
The words I long to hear,  
You know how happy I'll be.  
  
So baby,  
Why don't you be my girl?  
I'll give it a try,  
Cause I'm your kind of guy.
