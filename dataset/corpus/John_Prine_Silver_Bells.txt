City Sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there is a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Greeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you'll hear.  
  
Silver Bells, Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
  
Strings of streetlights even Stop Lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Here the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
It Santa's big day  
And above all the hustle you'll hear  
  
Silver Bells, Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
  
Silver Bells, Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.
