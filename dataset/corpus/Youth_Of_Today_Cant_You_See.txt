Pressure to drink  
Has always been there  
And to smoke and use drugs  
But I don't care  
I don't feel the pressure  
Don't listen to those jerks  
I'm straight because  
For me it works  
I'M STRAIGHT-NOT BECAUSE IT'S COOL  
I'M STRAIGHT-NOT SOME FOOL  
I'M STRAIGHT-BECAUSE I WANT TO BE  
I'M STRAIGHT-CAN'T YOU FUCKING SEE  
Don't go to parties  
To get high  
Don't want to get drunk  
Don't want to try  
Won't smoke cigarettes  
To look cool  
Don't smoke pot  
I don't care about the rule  
I'M STRAIGHT-NOT BECAUSE IT'S COOL  
I'M STRAIGHT-NOT SOME FOOL  
I'M STRAIGHT-BECAUSE I WANT TO BE  
I'M STRAIGHT-CAN'T YOU FUCKING SEE
