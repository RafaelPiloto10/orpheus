Then they came on me  
They dragged me from the bar  
Still wet from sweat and beer  
  
I bruise so prettily by men  
Blinded by their fear, these men  
Broke my back and made me lame  
  
Then she said to me  
"I'd give you everything to make it like before  
To make you love me like you used to"  
  
Make you love me more  
She said to me  
"Your life is large but your mind is lame"  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
When I see the truth  
And all the things I've done  
  
And every place, I'm queer  
I never stay, I run  
I know now why I live in shame  
  
Lame  
It's hard to sleep at night  
I hardly ever sleep at night
