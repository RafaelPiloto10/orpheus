Whenever skies look grey to me  
And trouble begins to brew  
Whenever the winter winds  
Begin to blow  
I concentrate on you  
  
When fortune cries nay, nay to me  
And people declare "you're through"  
Whenever the blues becomes my only song  
I concentrate on you  
  
On your smile to sweet so tender  
When first my kiss you deny  
On the love in your eyes  
When you surrender  
And once again our arms intertwine  
  
And so when wise men say to me  
That loves young dreams never come true  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong  
I concentrate on you
