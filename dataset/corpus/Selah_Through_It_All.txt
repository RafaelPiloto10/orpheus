I've had many tears and sorrows  
I've had questions for tomorrow  
There've been times I didn't know right from wrong  
But in every situation  
God gave blessed consolation  
That my trials only come to make me strong  
I've been a lot of places  
And I've seen so many faces  
But there've been times I've felt so all alone  
But in that lonely hour  
In that precious, lonely hour  
Jesus let me know I was His own  
Through it all, through it all  
I've learned to trust in Jesus  
I've learned to trust in God  
Through it all, through it all  
I've learned to depend upon His Word  
So I thank God for the mountains  
And I thank Him for the valleys  
I thank Him for the storms He's brought me through  
'Cause if I never had a problem  
I wouldn't know that He could solve them  
I wouldn't know what faith in His Word could do  
Through it all, through it all  
I've learned to trust in Jesus  
I've learned to trust in God  
Through it all, through it all  
I've learned to depend upon His Word  
Yes, I've learned to depend upon His Word  
I've learned to depend upon His Word
