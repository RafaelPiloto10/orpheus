You say it's better to behave  
Just like I never met you  
Why is it only I can cry  
And you can say goodbye in a minute  
Don't you remember I was your friend  
And you can just erase all those days  
And those tender reflections we bear  
We promised not to fall in love  
But it was there and soon I was in it  
Already I was more than your friend  
It's harder for me  
  
No words or expressions  
Can make you hungry for me  
I've never seen you on your knees  
Like I'm beggin' you  
  
Don't give up, give up on each other  
Back where we started  
No love to hold us down  
I'll never give another anymore than I gave to you  
Will never come around  
  
Always and always  
You told me love was ever and ever  
Together the dream will come true  
If we turn back  
If you turn back to me  
  
You won't be sorry if you stay  
I'll stake my life upon it  
Little flame inside us can be fed  
Take our precious love to the limit  
It's the one that you need and it's your friend  
It's harder for me  
  
No words or expressions  
Anything that makes you worry  
I've never seen you on your knees  
And I'm in a hurry  
How is it you can break my heart  
But you can't be sorry  
Push away whoever you please  
But I'm begging you  
  
Don't give up, give up on each other  
Back where we started  
No love to hold us down  
I'll never give another  
Anymore than I gave to you  
Will never come around, oh  
Don't give up, give up on each other  
We can't lose tomorrow  
Better treasure what we've got  
I'll never give another anymore than I gave to you
