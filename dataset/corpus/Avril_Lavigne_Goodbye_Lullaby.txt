Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, my love  
I can't hide, can't hide, can't hide, the while has come  
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go, and leave you all alone  
But always know, always know, always know.  
That I love you so, that I love you so, that I love you so  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, for now,  
Goodbye, sunshine, take care of yourself,  
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go, and leave you all alone,  
But always know, always know, always know.  
That I love you so, I love you so, oh, I love you so, oh  
Lullaby, they strike me with your eyes,  
Lullaby, lullaby, help me sleep tonight,  
Lullaby(lullaby), lullaby  
I have to go(goodbye), I have to go(goodbye), I have to go(goodbye), and leave  
You all alone,  
But always know(goodbye), always know(goodbye), always know(goodbye).  
That I love you so(goodbye, goodbye), that I love you  
So(goodbye, goodbye), that I love you so(goodbye, goodbye), I love you  
So(goodbye, goodbye), I love you so(goodbye, goodbye)  
Goodbye, brown eyes, goodbye, my love
