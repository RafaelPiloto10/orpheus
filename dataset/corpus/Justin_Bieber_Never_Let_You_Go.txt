Ooh no, ooh no, ooh  
They say that hate has been sent  
So let loose the talk of love  
Before they outlaw the kiss  
Baby give me one last hug  
  
There's a dream  
That I've been chasing  
Want so badly for it to be reality  
(Reality, reality)  
And when you hold my hand  
Then I understand  
That it's meant to be  
  
Cause baby when you're with me  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better  
(Don't want you to go oh no so)  
  
Let the music blast  
We gon' do our dance  
Bring the doubters on  
They don't matter at all  
Cause this life's to long  
And this love's to strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
I got my favorite girl  
Not feelin' no pain or fear  
(Pain or fear, pain or fear, no pain)  
Oh no, don't have a care in the world  
Why would I, when you are here  
(You are here, you are here)  
There's a moment I've been chasin'  
And I finally caught it out on this floor  
(On this floor, in this floor)  
  
Baby, there's no hesitation,  
No reservation by taking a chance and more  
Oh no, because  
  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better  
(Don't want you to go, oh no so)  
  
Let the music blast  
We gon' do our dance  
Bring the doubters on  
They don't matter at all  
Cause this life's too long  
And this love's to strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better  
(Don't want you to go, oh, no, so)  
  
Take my hand, lets just dance  
Watch my feet, follow me  
Don't be scared, girl I'm here  
If you didn't know, this is love  
  
(Let the music blast)  
(We gon' do our dance)  
(Bring the doubters on)  
(They don't matter at all)  
Oh baby  
(Cause this life's to long)  
(And it's much to strong)  
(So baby no for sure)  
That I'll never let you go  
(I'll never let you go)  
  
So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing  
I am here (right here)  
I'll never let you go, ooh  
Don't shed a tear, whenever you need me I'll be near  
I'll never let you go,  
  
(Ooh no, oh no, ooh)  
I'll never let you go  
Ooh no, ooh no, ooh  
I'll never let you go
