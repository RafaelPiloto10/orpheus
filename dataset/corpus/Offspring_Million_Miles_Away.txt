There was a time  
Looking through myself  
Wanted to pretend  
If I escaped  
I could feel myself  
I don't think you can  
Been far and wide  
But that hole inside  
Never really leaves  
  
I went away  
But I really lost  
Left behind was me  
  
Install in me  
Clear me on my way  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh  
A Million Miles Away  
(Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't stay  
I can't stay  
(Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
Each passing day  
Every passing face  
Seems like such a gloom  
I long to be  
Home silently  
Lying next to her  
  
Just to get back  
By her side is all,  
All I need to be  
  
I went away  
What I really lost  
Left behind was me  
  
I need to be  
Getting on my way  
  
Ohhhh oh oh oh  
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh  
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh  
A Million Miles Away  
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't take  
I can't take  
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
Install in me  
Turn me on my way  
  
I can't take, I can't take  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't take, I can't take  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't take, I can't take  
A Million Miles Away  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
I can't take  
I can't take  
A Million Miles Away
