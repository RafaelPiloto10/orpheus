In the last rays of the setting sun  
And the past days, that's where our memories run  
And all of those times  
Still race through my mind  
I'm shattered inside to find  
  
When the night comes down  
And I'm here all alone  
When the night comes down  
There's nowhere to go  
  
Call me and I'll wait till the summer  
You never understood  
That I'll wait forever  
For love that's only good  
As the light starts to dim  
The fear closes in  
And the nightmares begin  
  
When the night comes down  
And I'm here all alone  
When the night comes down  
And there's no place to go  
  
Oh no you won't be there tomorrow  
Oh no say it isn't true  
I can't take this pain and sorrow  
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two  
  
Oh, say I'm trying inside to fight  
  
When the night comes down  
And I'm here all alone  
When the night comes down  
And there's no place to go
