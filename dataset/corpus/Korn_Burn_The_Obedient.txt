Are you scared?  
  
Holding on to sacred places  
Holding on to what is found  
I'm looking forward to see their faces  
Flat on the ground, the horror profound  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Smashed on the ground in your own debris  
While choking on your blood from the sodomy  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free  
  
Walk the path of secrecy  
Used to heartless mockery  
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes  
Your misery  
  
All the damage it just erases  
Mediocrity all around  
The grandiose disorder replaces  
Conditions of peace, is this my release?  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Smashed on the ground in your own debris  
While choking on your blood from the sodomy  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free  
  
Walk the path of secrecy  
Used to heartless mockery  
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes  
Your misery  
  
(La la la)  
  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Now  
  
Walk the path of secrecy  
Used to heartless mockery  
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes  
Your misery
