[Chorus]  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
(Mama said, mama said)  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
  
I went walkin' the other day, yeah  
Everything was goin' fine  
And then I met a little boy named Billy-Joe  
And then I almost lost my mind, come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My eyes were wide open  
All that I could see, yeah  
The chapel bells were tollin'  
For everybody but me  
But I don't worry 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And then she said  
Someone would look at me  
Like I'm lookin' at you  
One day  
Then I might find  
I don't want you any old way  
  
So, don't worry, 'cause  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
(Mama said, mama said)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Mama said there'll be days like this  
There'll be days like this, my mama said  
Oh, yeah  
(Mama said, mama said)  
  
Don't worry, yeah, don't worry, now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Don't worry, worry, now, now, now  
Don't you worry
