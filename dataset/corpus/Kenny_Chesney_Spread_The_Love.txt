All God's children we got to come together  
And share the good feeling  
'Cause nothing ever gonna make this world better  
If we don't start believing  
That love really really really is the answer  
Just like the wise men say  
Let the night come to see us, the music come free us  
And let's start drifting away  
  
Leave all our problems behind now, no worries  
Everybody join hands 'cause it's time now, now  
(It's time to)  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
All God's people  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
All over the world  
  
All my brothers and sisters, ain't nobody can tell us  
That this planet is falling apart (No no no)  
If we just love each other (If we just love each other)  
And lift up one another  
Shout out loud from every heart  
  
Leave all our troubles behind now (no worries, no worries)  
Everybody join hands cause it's time now, now  
(It's time to)  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
All God's people  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
Spread it all over the world  
(Spread it all over the world)  
We got to spread the love  
(We got to spread the love, spread the love)  
  
Love is the ticket, the train it will take us  
No one can stop us, nobody will break us  
Follow the rhythm that leads us to Heaven tonight  
  
Leave all our troubles behind now, now  
Everybody join hands cause it's time now, now, now  
(We got to)  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
All God's people  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
All God's children  
Spread the love, spread the love  
All over the world  
We've got to spread the love  
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
  
Love is the ticket, the train it will take us  
No one can stop us, nobody will break us  
Follow the rhythm that leads us to Heaven tonight
