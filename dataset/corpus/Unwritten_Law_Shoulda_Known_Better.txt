I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever  
  
It all started out in a tan Dodge van  
Two hundred bucks that we stole from her dad  
Out the back of his meth lab  
Took the 45, out demand that  
  
Livid Bonnie, 'bout to be a mommy  
Came to California with Johnny  
They had a run in with the law  
She shoulda listened to her ma  
  
And she said we'd be together  
(She said)  
She used the word 'Forever'  
(She said)  
  
Oh, my lovely lover  
(She said)  
Why had I love to love her?  
I, I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever, yeah, lasts forever  
  
I shoulda known better  
(Ooh, better)  
I shoulda known better  
(Ooh, better)  
I shoulda known  
  
Abortion clinic, I shoulda forced the issue  
But she did it with the hanger and some tissue  
Don't cry, dry your eye  
(She said)  
I'll be back on my feet tonight  
(She said)  
  
I'll be walking the street tonight  
(She said)  
'Cause these arms gotta eat tonight  
Then we made love like a couple of drunk buffalo  
Was I rough enough?  
  
It was the last time I'd ever see her  
I'd try to thank her with gonorrhea  
But then she split and stole my sweater  
Dude, I shoulda known better  
  
I, I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever, yeah, lasts forever  
Shoulda known better  
  
Shoulda ended in the tan Dodge van  
With two hundred dollars worth of partying  
But instead I'm sitting on Sunset  
Selling my soul for a hit, yeah, what next?  
  
Yeah, I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever, yeah, lasts forever  
When you said you'd never leave and we'd be together  
Nothing lasts forever, nothing ever lasts forever  
  
Shoulda known better  
(Ooh, better)  
I shoulda known better  
(Ooh, better)  
  
I shoulda known better  
(Ooh, better)  
I shoulda known better  
(Ooh, better)  
I shoulda known
