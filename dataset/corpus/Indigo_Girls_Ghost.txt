There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer  
The last truce we ever came to  
In our adolescent war  
And I start to feel the fever  
From the warm air through the screen  
You come regular like seasons  
Shadowing my dreams  
  
And the Mississippi's mighty  
But it starts in Minnesota  
At a place that you could walk across  
With five steps down  
And I guess that's how you started  
Like a pinprick to my heart  
But at this point you rush right through me  
And I start to drown  
  
And there's not enough room  
In this world for my pain  
Signals cross and love gets lost  
And time passed makes it plain  
Of all my demon spirits  
I need you the most  
I'm in love with your ghost  
I'm in love with your ghost  
  
Dark and dangerous like a secret  
That gets whispered in a hush  
(don't tell a soul)  
When I wake the things I dreamt about you  
Last night make me blush  
(don't tell a soul)  
And you kiss me like a lover  
Then you sting me like a viper  
I go follow to the river  
Play your memory like a piper  
  
And I feel it like a sickness  
How this love is killing me  
I'd walk into the fingers  
Of your fire willingly  
And dance the edge of sanity  
I've never been this close  
I'm in love with your ghost  
  
Unknowing captor  
You never know how much you  
Pierce my spirit  
But I can't touch you  
Can you hear it  
A cry to be free  
Oh I'm forever under lock and key  
As you pass through me  
  
Now I see your face before me  
I would launch a thousand ships  
To bring your heart back to my island  
As the sand beneath me slips  
As I burn up in your presence  
And I know now how it feels  
To be weakened like Achilles  
With you always at my heels  
  
This bitter pill I swallow  
Is the silence that I keep  
It poisons me I can't swim free  
The river is too deep  
Though I'm baptized by your touch  
I am no worse than most  
In love with your ghost  
  
You are shadowing my dreams  
(In love with your ghost)  
(In love with your ghost)  
(In love with your ghost)
