The breaker's war on an unseen shore,  
In the teeth of a hurricane,  
Oh, we struggle in vain  
A hellish night, a ghostly light,  
Appears through the driving rain,  
Salvation in the human chain  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target
is you  
  
Driven to the ground,  
With that awful sound  
Drowned by the cheer from the shore,  
Oh, we wonder what for  
  
The people swarm,  
through the darkening storm,  
Gather everything they can score,  
Turn their backs when there's no more  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew,  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know that sometimes the truth is contrary, because sometimes the target
is you.  
  
The brink of war on an unseen shore,  
In the teeth of an icy grave,  
In the teeth of an icy grave  
  
Whoah, the human chain leaves a bloody stain,  
Washed away in the pounding waves,  
Washed away in the pounding waves  
  
All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of all the things in life
you thought you knew,  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target
is you.  
  
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry,  
striking out like a bull from a balloon,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew
