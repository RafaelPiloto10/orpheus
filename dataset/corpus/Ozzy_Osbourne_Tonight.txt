Now I'm back on the street again  
It never rains unless it pours  
Try to get back on my feet again  
I hear the raging thunder as it roars  
  
[Chorus]  
Tonight tonight is it just a rhapsody  
Or am I right  
Tonight tonight is it all a mystery  
I just can't fight no more  
  
I hear the questions surface in my mind  
Of my mistakes that I have made  
Times and places I have left behind  
And am I ever going to make the grade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As I beat my head against the wall  
Running round in circles in vain  
I'm feeling three feet tall  
You don't understand I'm fading away  
  
Don't want your pity or your sympathy  
It isn't gonna prove a thing to me  
Good intentions pave the way to hell  
Don't you worry when you hear me sing  
  
[Chorus]
