Time is like a dream  
And now, for a time, you are mine  
Let's hold fast to the dream  
That tastes and sparkles like wine  
Who knows (who knows)  
If it's real  
Or just something we're both dreaming of  
What seems like an interlude now  
Could be the beginning of love  
Loving you  
Is a world that's strange  
So much more than my heart can hold  
Loving you  
Makes the whole world change  
Loving you, I could not grow old  
No, nobody knows  
When love will end  
So till then, sweet friend...  
Time is like a dream  
And now, for a time, you are mine  
Let's hold fast to the dream  
That tastes and sparkles like wine  
Who knows (who knows)  
If it's real  
Or just something we're both dreaming of?  
What seems like an interlude now  
Could be the beginning of love  
What seems like an interlude now  
Could be the beginning of love  
What seems like an interlude now  
Could be the beginning of love
