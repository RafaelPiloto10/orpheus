My little crazy cat  
Took a train to meet his gang downtown, yeah  
They played Black Jack  
Fritz played his false game too far, ooh  
A guy got up and started a gunfight  
  
He's looking for trouble day by day  
(For trouble, day by day)  
Don't waste time, cute runaway  
(You cute runaway)  
He kept being taken by surprise  
My stray cat in town  
  
Addicted to chicks  
He's got a rental tree near the nudist beach, yeah  
Oh watch out!  
Booze and ladies are his fate, ooh  
Too much sex and food and Rock 'n' Roll  
  
He's looking for trouble day by day
