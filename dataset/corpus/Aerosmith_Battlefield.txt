It cannot be seen  
But there's blood on the green  
Only god knows I'm innocent  
Take me, take me home  
A dark seed reigns in me  
Like the storm rules over the sea  
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone  
  
Don't dare me now  
The threatening shadows will pass by  
There're getting closer now  
Open your eyes  
Wake up my dear young friend  
And hate shall fade away  
  
I will not move, yet  
I'll stand still, instead  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
The field's been left in sorrow  
The father and the son  
They're gone  
  
The sun shines bright  
And anger rises  
Lorn and lonely  
Torn apart  
Don't you think  
It's time to stop now  
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss  
  
Let's pray  
That heaven is on our side  
Through violence and horror  
Shall honour arise  
  
So let's pray  
And blessed shall be our leader  
We follow the noble and bright  
  
Don't you hear me crying  
Crying  
Come take me away  
I hallow thy name  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
That's what minstrel sing  
Join in the horrible screams  
Take part in murderous deeds  
Renowned be the lion-hearted  
Join in the minstrelsy  
Wailing in endless grief  
It eagerly longs for more  
Broken bodies lay down on the ground  
  
Blood sheds all over the place  
The green will be stained forever  
And hate reigns all over the field  
They keep struggling on in anger  
  
Fiercely intense  
Outrageous, too blind to see  
And in pain they keep on singing  
We claim the land for the highlord  
God bless the land and our highlord  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore
