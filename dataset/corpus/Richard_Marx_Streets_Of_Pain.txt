She's still another party blonde  
Who had had it all her way  
Now just another hanger on  
With a faded resume  
He's gonna be a leading man  
In the Gary Cooper mold  
Now working at a pretzel stand  
But it's him that's getting sold  
  
Big dreamer gonna take the town  
But she's running out of time  
Still singing at a sleazy lounge  
To a house of drooling swine  
Self satisfied narcissist  
With a body like a god  
He's thinking that's all there is  
But I don't want that job  
  
Streets of pain  
They don't hear the crying  
Streets of pain  
Never felt the tears  
Streets of pain  
They just keep on lying  
Get it through your head  
'Cause some things never change  
  
Won't it finally be obvious  
That there's very little chance  
Can't they see it's a Greyhound bus  
And not their handsome prince  
Isn't anybody satisfied  
With the average girl next door  
Does she have to be glamourized  
So the world will love her more  
  
Streets of pain  
Sinking like a rock in a river  
Streets of pain  
Never felt so cold  
Streets of pain  
Lower than a snake can slither  
Not to mention all the  
Stories never told  
  
Pretty girl becomes a socialite  
Standing in somebody elses light  
Anything can happen late at night  
In the morning she'll be out of sight  
Made a million on a lucky streak  
Threw it all away as foolishly  
One of many comic tragedies  
What else can there be  
  
So you better get on the road  
To the desolation station  
And you better bring all you own  
It's a permanent vacation  
We're waiting here with open arms  
But it isn't what it seems  
Just looking for the boulevard  
On the trail of broken dreams  
  
Repeat both choruses
