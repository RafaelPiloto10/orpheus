Stay around don't play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
A lot of people won't get no justice tonight  
The battle is gettin' hotter  
In this iration, Armagideon time  
  
A lot of people runnin' and a hiding tonight  
A lot of people won't get no justice tonight  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you - Armagideon time...
