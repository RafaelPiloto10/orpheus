[Verse 1]  
Hold on to me  
Don't let me go  
Who cares what they see?  
Who cares what they know?  
Your first name is Free  
Last name is Dom  
We choose to believe  
In where we're from  
  
[Chorus]  
Man's red flower  
It's in every living thing  
Mind, use your power  
Spirit, use your wings  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Freedom  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hold on to me  
Don't let me go  
Cheetahs need to eat  
Run, antelope  
Your first name is King  
Last name is Dom  
Cause you still believe  
In everyone  
  
[Chorus]  
When a baby first breathes  
When night sees sunrise  
When the whale hunts in the sea  
When man recognizes  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Breathe in  
  
[Verse 3]  
We are from heat  
The electric one  
Does it shock you to see  
He left us the sun?  
Atoms in the air  
Organisms in the sea  
The son and, yes, man  
Are made of the same things  
  
[Outro]  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Freedom!  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Freedom
