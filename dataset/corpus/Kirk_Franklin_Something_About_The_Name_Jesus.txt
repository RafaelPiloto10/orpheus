[Chorus:]  
Something About The Name Jesus  
Something About The name Jesus  
It is the sweetest thing I know  
Oh how I love the name Jesus  
Oh how I love the name Jesus  
It is the sweetest name I know  
Some people say I'm crazy but  
I can't explain  
The power that I feel  
When I call your name  
It's just like fire  
Shut up in my bones  
The Holy Ghost is movin  
And it just won't leave me alone  
(repeat Chorus)  
Sweeter than honey from the honey comb  
I can feel the Holy Ghost movin  
It won't leave me alone  
At the name of Jesus  
Every knee has got to bow  
You don't have to wait until the fire comes  
You can go on and shout and praise Him right now  
(repeat Chorus)  
I know I know I know I know  
(repeat Chorus)
