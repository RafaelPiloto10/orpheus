He packed his few belongings left a note and now he's gone  
It's hard for me to know he's left me here so all alone  
As soon as he's gone for enough and I know he's out of sight  
Oh I'll go all to pieces and I'll cry  
Yes I need someone to hold me when I cry  
Someone who really understand the way I feel inside  
When my heart breaks the tears won't stop no matter how I try  
And I need someone to hold me when I cry  
  
I don't know why he left me or what his leavin's for  
I guess he didn't need me or love me anymore  
He drove me into a world as dark and cold as ice  
With no one here to hold me when I cry  
Yes I need someone to hold me....
