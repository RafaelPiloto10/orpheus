Uh oh, there you go again talking cinematic  
Yeah you! You're charming, got everybody star struck  
I know how you always seem to go  
For the obvious instead of me but get a ticket and you'll see  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song, yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah when you call me I can hear it in your voice  
Oh sure! Wanna see me and tell me all about her  
La la, I'll be acting through my tears  
Guess you'll never know that I should win an Oscar for the scene I'm in  
  
If we were a movie you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song  
  
Wish I could tell you there's a twist, some kind of hero in disguise  
And we're together, it's for real, now playing  
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss like something more than in my mind  
I see it could be amazing  
(Could be amazing!)  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song  
  
If we were a movie, you'd be the right guy  
And I'd be the best friend that you fall in love with  
In the end we'd be laughing, watching the sunset  
Fade to black, show the names, play the happy song
