Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?  
It's the time that every Santa has a ball  
Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer  
Does a ton-up on his sleigh  
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day  
  
So here it is, Merry Christmas  
Everybody's having fun  
Look to the future now  
It's only just begun  
  
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?  
Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?  
Does your granny always tell ya  
That the old songs are the best?  
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest  
  
So here it is, Merry Christmas  
Everybody's having fun  
Look to the future now  
It's only just begun  
  
What will your daddy do  
When he sees your mommy  
Kissing Santa Claus  
Aaah, ah, aaah, aahh  
  
Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?  
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?  
Do you ride around the hillside  
In a buggy you have made  
When you land upon your head  
And you've been sleighed  
  
So here it is, Merry Christmas  
Everybody's having fun  
Look to the future now  
It's only just begun  
So here it is, Merry Christmas  
Everybody's having fun  
Look to the future now  
It's only just begun  
  
So here it is, Merry Christmas  
Everybody's having fun  
Look to the future now  
It's only just begun  
So here it is, Merry Christmas  
Everybody's having fun  
(It's Christmas)  
Look to the future now  
It's only just begun
