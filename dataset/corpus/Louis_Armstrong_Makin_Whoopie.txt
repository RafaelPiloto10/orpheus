Another bride, another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season, another reason  
For makin' whoopie  
  
A lot of shoes, lot of rice  
The groom is nervous, he answers twice  
It's really killin' that he's so willin'  
To makin' whoopie  
  
Now picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring  
  
Yes, he's washing dishes and baby clothes  
He's so ambitious, he even sews  
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks  
For makin' whoopie  
  
Another year, maybe less  
What's this I hear, well, can you guess?  
She feels neglected and he's suspected  
Of makin' whoopie  
  
Yes, she sits alone most every night  
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write  
He says he's busy but she says, "Is he?"  
He's makin' whoopie  
  
Now he doesn't make much money  
Only five thousand per  
Some judge who thinks he's funny  
Says you'll pay six to her  
  
He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"  
The judge says, "Budge right into jail"  
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper  
Than makin' whoopie  
  
Yes, yeah, you'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper  
Than makin' whoopie
