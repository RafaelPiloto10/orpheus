Oh no no no no,  
  
If love was a bird, then we wouldn't have wings  
If love was a sky, we'd be blue  
If love was a choir, you and I could never sing  
'Cause love isn't for me and you  
If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win  
'Cause we could never act out our parts  
If love is the bible, then we are lost in sin  
Cause it's not in our hearts  
  
So why don't you go your way  
And I'll go mine  
Live your life  
And I'll live mine  
Baby you'll do well  
And I'll be fine  
'Cause we're better off separated  
  
If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark  
Love never felt so cold  
If love was the light, then we're lost in the dark  
Left with no one to hold  
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team  
You and i are destined to lose  
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream  
'Cause love isn't for me and you  
  
Why don't you go your way  
And I'll go mine  
Live your life  
And I'll live mine  
Baby you'll do well  
And I'll be fine  
'Cause we're better off separated  
  
Girl I know we had some good times  
It's sad but now, we gotta say goodbye  
Girl you know I love you, I can't deny  
Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I  
I know it hurts, so much but it's best for us  
Somewhere along this winding road we lost the trust  
So I'll walk away, so you don't have to see me cry  
It's killing me so, why don't you go  
  
Why don't you go your way (oh)  
And I'll go mine (baby)  
Live your life (oh)  
And I'll live mine (I'll live mine)  
Baby you'll do well (I'll be fine)  
And I'll be fine  
'Cause we're better off, so much better off  
  
Go your way (Go your way)  
And I'll go mine (I'll go mine)  
Live your life (Your life)  
I'll live mine  
You'll do well (ohh hoo)  
And I'll be fine  
  
'Cause we're better off, so much better off  
So much better off  
Separated  
  
I'm sorry we didn't make it
