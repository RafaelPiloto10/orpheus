Build your dreams to the stars above  
But when you need someone true to love  
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me  
Play with fire till your fingers burn  
And when there's no place for you to turn  
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me  
For, when you hear a call to follow your heart  
You'll follow your heart I know  
I've been through it all and I'm an old hand  
And I'll understand if you go  
So make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers, come on to me  
Oh, make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me
