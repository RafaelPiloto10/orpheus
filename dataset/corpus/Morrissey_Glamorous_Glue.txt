First day with the jar  
You find  
Everyone lies  
First day with the jar  
You find  
Everyone lies, nobody minds  
  
Everyone lies  
Where is the man you respect?  
And where is the woman you love?  
Where's the woman you love?  
  
Third week with the jar  
You find  
Everything dies  
We won't vote Conservative  
Because we never have  
  
Everyone lies, everyone lies  
Where is the man you respect?  
And where is the woman you love?  
Where's the woman you love?  
  
Everything of worth  
On Earth  
Is there  
To share  
  
I used to dream, and I used to vow  
I wouldn't dream of it now  
We look to Los Angeles  
For the language we use  
London is dead, London is dead  
London is dead, London is dead  
London is dead, London is dead  
Now I'm too much in love  
I'm too much in love  
  
I know  
I'll go  
Empty hand  
From the land
