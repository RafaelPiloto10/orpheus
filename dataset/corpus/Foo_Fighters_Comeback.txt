Tie up the transmission  
This one is not a test  
Silent all these years  
But now I'm getting you off my chest  
Reeling in the moment,  
I know it will never last  
Tired of keepin' quiet,  
Riding with all the rest  
  
Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move  
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose  
  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback for you  
For you  
  
Hide behind obsessions,  
I'm trying to keep in check  
Ride you for the finish  
We're coming??  
Reeling in the moment  
I know it will never last  
Rise up to the surface  
High but I'm sinking fast  
  
Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move  
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose  
  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback for you  
  
Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move  
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose  
  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback  
I will comeback,  
I will comeback for you
