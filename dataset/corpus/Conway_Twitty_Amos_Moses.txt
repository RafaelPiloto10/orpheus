Now Amos Moses was a Cajun he lived by himself in the swamp  
He haunted alligators for a livin' he just knock 'em in the head with a stump  
The Louisiana law's gonna get ya Amos  
It ain't legal huntin' alligators down in the swamp boy  
Now everybody blames his old man for makin' him mean as a snake  
When Amos Moses was a boy his daddy would use him for alligator bait  
  
Tie a rope around his waist throw him in the swamp  
Alligator bait in the Louisiana bayou  
  
About forty five minutes southeast of Tippidoe Louisiana  
Live a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah  
Well they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groc'ries  
Named him after the man of the cloth called him Amos Moses  
  
Now folks around south Louisiana said Amos was a hell of a man  
He could trap the biggest the meanest alligator and just use only one hand  
That's all he got left cause the alligator bit him  
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow  
Well the sheriff got wind that Amos was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins  
So he snook in the swamp gonna get the boy but he never come out again  
  
Well I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to  
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou  
About forty five minutes  
About forty five minutes
