(2x):  
It's kinda crazy  
I feel this way  
Baby, I'm sayin  
Wat kinda man  
Have I come to know  
To be out there playin'  
But baby  
I got alot to say  
I hope u listen  
'Cause I been  
A fool gone crazy  
Without you with me  
  
Girl  
Oh why, oh why, oh why  
I been stupid  
Lately  
Girl  
I apologize I owe u  
Baby, please  
Don't burry me alive  
Cause iy's  
Killing me inside  
And I can't lie girl  
Ahhhhhhh  
  
Chorus:  
I'm afraid  
That your cheating  
Must have been  
My love me  
Neglectin your trust  
As if it  
Was enough I messed up  
I'm afraid  
That your givin' up  
I did to much  
My love rite now  
It's all about us  
All about  
All about us  
My love  
  
It's kinda crazy  
About my baby  
She was  
Neva complainin'  
She was neva  
Fed up with me  
But I kept  
On changin' one time  
Had the nerve to say  
That she was lammin'  
She couldn't compare  
Thoose otha girl  
Wouldn't care  
To deal with me  
  
(Repeat 2nd verse)  
  
(Chorus)
