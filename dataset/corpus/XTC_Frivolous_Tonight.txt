Let us talk about some trivial things we like  
A bit of this and that  
Let's chew the fat  
  
Pour ourselves a glass of stout  
And let our Rael Brook shirts hang out  
Nothing makes us more content  
To let us wallow in a bit of nonsense  
  
We're all so frivolous tonight, tonight  
  
Let's reveal our childlike nature  
And leave our stocks and invoices to rot  
Let's go to pot  
  
Tell our jokes about mothers in law  
But watch him jump when she comes through the door  
Oh the party goes with a swing  
When we talk about the trivial things  
  
We're all so frivolous tonight  
  
But there's always one  
Who wants to talk shop  
We'll drive him through the door  
With a broom or a mop  
  
Let us tell our favourite story  
About some poor chap who put it on display  
Hip hooray  
And let the girls gather in their slacks  
To talk about husbands hairy backs  
  
Some might think we're a bit of a shower  
But this could be our finest hour  
  
We're all so frivolous tonight, tonight  
We're all so ridiculous tonight.
