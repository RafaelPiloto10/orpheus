In praise of fruit I wrote this song  
Because of fruit my heart is strong  
Who could estimate its worth?  
Fruit's the finest food on earth  
  
Fresh fruit, juice and seeds  
Please don't touch, please don't squeeze  
Fresh fruit, juice and pulp  
Like to gulp the whole lot up  
  
Here's another point of view  
Fruit is good for doggies too  
Rover wags his tail with glee  
When he gets his vitamin C  
  
Have you caught a touch of flu  
And you can't think what to do  
Famous doctors all agree  
fruit's the safest remedy  
  
Fresh fruit Good and sweet  
Makes you want to give up meat  
Fresh fruit, ripe and firm  
Makes them squealing taste-buds squirm.
