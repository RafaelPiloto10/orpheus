Ask me how do I feel  
Now that we're cosy and clinging  
Well sir, all I can say, is if I were a bell I'd be ringing!  
  
From the moment we kissed tonight  
That's the way I've just gotta behave  
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light  
And If I were a banner I'd wave!  
  
Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing  
Well sir, all I can say is if gate I'd be swinging!  
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs!  
Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding!  
  
Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson I'm learning.  
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bridge I'd be burning!  
Yes, I knew my moral would crack  
From the wonderful way that you looked!  
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack!  
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!  
  
Ask me how do I feel,  
Now that we're fondly caressing  
Well, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing  
Oh, If I were a season  
I shortly be spring  
Yes, or if I were a bell I'd go  
Ding dong, ding dong ding!
