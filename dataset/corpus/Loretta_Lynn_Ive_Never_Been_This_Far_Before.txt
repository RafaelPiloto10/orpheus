I can almost hear the stillness  
As it yelds to the sound of my heart beating  
And I can almost hear the echo  
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking  
You can feel my body tremble  
As I wonder what this moment holds in store  
And as you put my arms around me  
You can tell I've never been this far before  
I can hear you say you love me  
As your trembling fingers touch forbidden places (pum pum pum)  
But you don't know how I've waited  
So long for the chance that we're finally takin' (pum pum pum)  
I don't know and I don't care  
What made you tell her you don't love her anymore  
As I taste your tender kisses  
You can tell I've never been this far before (pum pum pum)  
And as you take the love I'm givin'  
I can feel the tension buildin' in my mind (pum pum pum pum pum pum)  
Now I wonder if tomorrow  
Will you still love me like you're lovin' me tonight (pum pum pum pum pum pum)  
Oh you have no way of knowin'  
But tonight will only make me want you more  
And I hope that you'll believe me  
Cause you know I've never been this far before (pum pum pum pum pum pum)  
(Pum pum pum)
