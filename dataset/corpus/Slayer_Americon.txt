With our callous minds we infect  
Other ways of life no regrets  
Like a masochist we instigate  
While the rest of the world must tolerate  
  
Americon, it's all about the mother fucking oil  
Regardless of the flag upon it's soil  
In a blood bath we pad our fucking greed  
This precious hunt may take maintain liberty  
  
Americon, so here we live in a land of deceit  
That imprison the minds of the weak  
No immunity for swaying the odds  
From this resistant strain Americon  
  
Americon, some feel the need to play God  
No immunity for swaying the odds  
From this resilient plague Americon  
  
With our poison minds we infest  
Other ways of life we ingest  
In a blood bath we steal you dignity  
This precious hunt it may take liberty  
  
Americon
