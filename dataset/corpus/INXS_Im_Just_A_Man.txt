I'm just a man  
My will is so strong  
When I've got plans  
I close my eyes to the pain  
My mother ran  
My father left town  
But we still have  
What's necessary to go on  
Flesh and blood  
Flesh and blood  
  
I'm part of you  
You're part of me  
There's nothing said  
That cannot be undone  
  
My brothers sane  
His heart is so strong  
He's killed some pain  
To himself nearly did the same  
It washed away  
Into the cruel sea  
Like everything  
That's built upon the sand  
  
Flesh and blood  
Flesh and blood  
  
Sweet sister T  
She loved so long and hard  
Kept to herself  
Until that right man came along  
Some men they lie  
Some men they cheat  
But now she's found  
Someone to be as strong  
  
I'm just a man  
My will is so strong  
When I've got plans  
I close my eyes to the pain  
My Father ran (Flesh and blood)  
My Mother left town  
But we still have (Flesh and blood)  
What's necessary to go on  
  
I'm part of you  
Your part of me
