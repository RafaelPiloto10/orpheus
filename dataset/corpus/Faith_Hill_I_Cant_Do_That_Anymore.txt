Cut my hair the way you wanted  
Watched you become important  
Quit my job to make our new home far away  
Now you're Mr. Successful and I'm queen of the treadmill  
Trying to stay the size you think that I should stay  
I used to dream about what I would be  
Last night I dreamed about a washing machine  
  
I keep on giving  
But I can't stop living  
A woman needs a little something of her own  
I like happy endings  
I don't like depending  
I keep right on pretending  
But I can't do that anymore  
  
Now you say I'm being silly  
But you don't know me really  
You never take the time to ask me how I feel  
I keep the checkbook balanced  
I decorate your palace  
You know I used to think that you were king  
Somewhere down deep I know you really love me  
But you can't see that what we have's not all I needed  
  
I keep on giving  
But I can't stop living  
A woman needs a little something of her own  
I like happy endings  
I don't like depending  
I keep right on pretending  
But I can't do that anymore  
  
You try to tell me I'm not being fair to you  
But life's too short for a selfish attitude  
  
I keep on giving  
But I can't stop living  
A woman needs a little something of her own  
I like happy endings  
I don't like depending  
I keep right on pretending  
But I can't do that anymore
