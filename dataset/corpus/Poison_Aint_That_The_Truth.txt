Now pardon my personal demons, child but if you do insist  
Sit down and listen to me story awhile, cause it goes something like this  
  
The joint was small but we were having a ball  
At a place called the Blue Duck Inn  
When I couldn't help but notice her  
My future wife walked in  
  
I needed me a dose of her, so I got a little closer  
And this is what she said  
My old man stands about six foot five  
And if he catches you, you're dead  
  
Now I don't need none of that  
giving me the blues  
The old man sitting next to me said  
Son, let me tell you  
  
[Chorus]  
Life, you just can't fake it  
Love, you gotta make it  
Time, you better take it  
Lord, ain't that the truth  
Hear me out  
Your heart will surely feel it  
Women come and steal it  
Time can only heal it  
Lord, ain't that the truth  
  
I save Friday night for the ladies  
Saturday night for my gin  
Come Sunday morning, I'm asking the good Lord  
To forgive me for my sins  
  
Lately my heave-ho get-up-and-go  
Wouldn't get me out of bed  
I felt like some big wrecking ball  
Done hit upside my head  
  
Now I don't need a preacher man  
Telling me how to run my life  
Until an angel sitting next to me  
said son, heed my advice. She said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You better get your story straight  
What comes around goes around  
  
[Chorus]
