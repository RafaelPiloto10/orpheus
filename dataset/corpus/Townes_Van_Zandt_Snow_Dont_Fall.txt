Snow don't fall  
On summers time  
Wind don't blow  
Below the sea  
My loves lies  
'Neath frozen skies  
And waits in sweet  
Repose for me  
  
Her eyes did laugh  
Her lips did sing  
Her legs did roll  
My soul to bring  
Her hair did curl  
And her thoughts unfurled  
Like birds upon  
The wings of spring  
  
My love I need not see  
To know she cast her glance at me  
  
Snow don't fall  
On summers time  
Wind don't blow  
Below the sea  
My loves lies  
'Neath frozen skies  
And waits in sweet  
Repose for me
