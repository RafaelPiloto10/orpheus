I'm chained to the highway, there's no other way for me  
Always looking for a new day, always a dream ahead of me  
Seems like it's so many lifetimes, through the sunshine, rain and snow  
  
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Yes I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
  
Solo  
  
I'm gonna end up dyin' my body is listening for you  
But you may as well be gone already if you say dreams can't come true  
There's been good times there's been bad, but I still love the show  
  
Yeah I've come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Yeah I come so far, but I still got so far to go  
Still got so far to go  
  
Solo  
  
Yeah I've come so far, but I still got so far to go
