In my heart, in my heart  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
I've got some lovely in my head, in my head  
Where the lions, wear the right eye,  
Where the jems [unverified] roar, there be lovely  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my bed, in my bed  
Where the ocean wears the shore down  
Where's the on switch?  
There be lovely laying waiting naked for you  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my yard, in my yard  
There be inchworm, there be footlong  
There be yardstick stir, some lovely  
Laying waiting naked for you  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my field, in my field  
There be green grass, there be big sky  
There be blue birds come and nest there  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my heart, in my heart for you
