Belle:  
If I could give a gift to you  
To hold to your heart dear  
I'd give the Christmas memories  
To hold throughout the year.  
  
And when you have them all, I think  
There's something more I'd bring  
The gift of Christmas laughter now  
So you could learn to sing...  
  
La la la la, it's Christmas time  
Memories everywhere  
Singing of hope, peace to mankind  
And love is in the air.  
  
And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start  
To make the prayers the children pray  
Come true in all our hearts...  
  
Beast:  
If you could give a gift to me  
To hold to my soul dear  
I'd love to see you smile upon my face,  
Without a fear  
  
And when you've smiled your fear away  
There's something more you'd bring  
The gift of gifts, remembering  
How I first learned to sing...  
  
Both:  
La la la la, it's Christmas time  
Memories everywhere  
Singing of hope, peace to mankind  
And love is in the air.  
  
And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start  
To make the prayers the children pray  
Come true in all our hearts...
