Oh here it comes again  
That old ennui  
I hope it won't stay long  
Well it's every-man to his own thing  
And every singer to his song  
If you're feeling low  
And all upset  
  
Nothing's going right  
You just make a wish  
Like in a fairy tale  
And I'll bewitch you  
If it takes all night  
There are many things  
That I could say  
To try and comfort you  
But I know the words you'd like to hear  
Are simply "I love you"  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes I'm down  
A topsy-turvy life  
But only searching  
For the truth  
And I'll find it  
If it takes all night long  
Well I myself  
May main concern  
Is what I can afford  
So if music be my mistress  
  
Then at least she's Madame Claude, d'accord  
Ah, more champagne!  
To lose this pain  
Would be very nice  
So I'll help myself to one more drink  
And I'll find myself  
If it takes all night long
