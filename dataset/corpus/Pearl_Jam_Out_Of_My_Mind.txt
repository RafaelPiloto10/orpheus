Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
All of the time  
Wish you could help me mister  
Wish you could lift me up  
Wish you could pack my parachute mister  
Wish you could pull me up  
The winds of change...I'm stuck beneath the rain  
I wish you could help me up  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Once inside, I'm out of my mind out  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind yeah  
Once inside, I'm out of my mind  
Wish you could help me...give me a pill  
A-just a little drink that I could swill  
A little something anything anything, I'll try it all  
I ain't got nowhere to go from here  
I'm just about this far from drowning in my very own tears  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Once inside, I'm out of my mind yeah  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
I don't feel so fine  
Out of my mind  
Where do I go...where do I stay  
I got no place to lay on the hay  
Where do I go to soothe my head  
Guess I'll turn on music instead  
Where do I see...where do I shine  
No one wants to take my mind  
Where do I go...how do I feel  
Guess I'll waste away in here  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Out of my mind every single time.
