Well  
Mom and dad  
Said we could  
So I did  
What I should  
I hung  
My stocking  
On a wall  
I didn't get  
A thing at all  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
  
'Cause  
I didn't get  
Nothin' last year  
Well  
Stayin' up late  
To see  
Santa Claus fly  
Well  
Sure enough  
Don't ya know  
The fat boy  
Didn't show  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
  
'Cause I didn't  
Get nothin'  
Last year  
Well  
I tried  
To get  
A little kiss  
From  
A pretty  
Little miss  
She  
Slapped me down  
And said  
"You jerk  
Mistletoe  
Doesn't work"  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
  
'Cause  
I didn't get  
Nothin' last year  
Oh, right  
Well  
Wakin' up  
The reindeer  
Makin'  
Little kids cheer  
The reason  
That his nose  
Shine  
Santa gave him  
Mmoonshine  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
  
'Cause  
I didn't get  
Nothin' last year  
Ah  
Decorate  
The street light  
People lookin'  
To get right  
One hand  
Will slap ya back  
The other one  
Will take ya back  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
  
'Cause  
I didn't get  
Nothin' last year  
  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas  
I don't believe  
In christmas  
I don't believe  
In Christmas
