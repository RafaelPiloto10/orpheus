Outside my window a robin builds a nest  
At last winter's gone away to rest  
Once again the leaves has return to the trees  
I can just feel that soft summer breeze  
  
There's magic in the air  
Winter disappear, it's summer  
  
Children will be playing in the park  
Days will be longer till the dark  
Nights will be warm with star filled skies  
A perfect setting for a girl and a guy  
  
There's magic in the air  
Green grass every-everywhere  
It's summer  
  
Don't you know it's summer time (Time, time, time)  
And the livin' is easy. Oh, so easy  
Everybody sing summer time (Time, time, time)  
Now that summer's here there be million things to do  
Vacation near or far, whatever pleases you  
Summer is the happiest season of them all  
So everybody get together and have yourselves a ball  
  
There's magic in the air  
Green grass every-everywhere  
It's summer  
Oh  
  
There's magic in the air  
Green grass every-everywhere  
It's summer  
Woo  
  
It's summer time (Magic in the air, green grass everywhere)  
Oh, it's summer  
Take a look around you  
It's summer time (Magic in the air, green grass everywhere)  
Oh, it's summer  
Hmm  
It's summer time
