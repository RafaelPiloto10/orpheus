Hey, good lookin' what you got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' something up with me?  
I'm free and ready so we can go steady  
How's about keeping steady company  
I'm gonna throw my name book over the fence  
Buy myself one for five or ten cents  
Keep it till it's covered with age  
'cause I'm writing your name on every page

Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe  
That we could find a brand new recipe?  
I've got a hopped up Ford and a ten dollar bill  
I know a spot right over the hill  
There's soda pop and the dancing's free  
So if you wanna have fun come along with me  
Hey, good lookin'  
Hey, good lookin'  
Hey, good lookin'
