I'm seeing it your way  
But i don't believe it's true that  
I'm not the one to make you happy  
It would be so wrong for us to break in two  
But do what you gotta do  
  
[Chorus]  
I hope you find someone  
Who can love you like i do  
I'll be strong inside  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
Since the day that i found you  
I built my dreams all around you and i  
Believed you would never leave me  
So sure it was love forever more  
But if you walk out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say the magic has gone forever  
But deep down inside i don't believe it's so  
But i'm letting you go  
  
[Chorus: until fade]
