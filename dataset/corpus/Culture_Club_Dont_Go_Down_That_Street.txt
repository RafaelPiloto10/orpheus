Don't go down that street  
In those shoes that squeak  
'cause I get afraid that you might not come home  
Careful how you speak  
When you're on the street  
'cause they've broken down all the telephones  
  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street  
  
Don't go down that street  
Where the brave boys meet  
'cause I'm chicken feed when they're on their own  
Don't get in that car  
Things might go too far  
(line in japanese)  
  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street  
  
(japanese talkover by miko)  
  
(ooh, ooh, aaah, aah)  
  
(japanese verse)
