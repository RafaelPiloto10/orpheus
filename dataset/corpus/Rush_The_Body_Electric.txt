One humanoid escapee  
One android on the run  
Seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun  
  
Trying to change its program  
Trying to change the mode -- crack the code  
Images conflicting into data overload  
  
[Chorus]  
One-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one  
SOS  
One-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one  
In distress  
One-zero-zero-one-zero-zero  
  
Memory banks unloading  
Bytes break into bits  
Unit One's in trouble and it's scared out of its wits  
  
Guidance systems break down  
A struggle to exist  
To resist  
A pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It replays each of the days  
A hundred years of routines  
Bows its head and prays  
To the mother of all machines
