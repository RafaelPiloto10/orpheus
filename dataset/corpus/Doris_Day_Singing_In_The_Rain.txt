I'm singing in the rain  
just singing in the rain  
What a glorious feeling  
I'm happy again  
I'm laughin the clouds  
So dark up above  
the suns in my heart  
and I'm ready for love  
let the stormy clouds chase  
everyone from the place  
comon with the rain  
I have a smile on my face  
I walk down the lane  
with a happy refraim  
and I'm singing,  
Just singing in the rain  
I'm singing in the rain  
Just singing in the rain  
what a glorious feeling  
I'm so happy again  
I'm laughing the clouds  
So dark up above  
the sun's in my heart  
and I'm ready for love  
let the stormy clouds chase  
Everyone from the place  
comon with the rain  
I have a smile on my face  
I walk down the lane  
with a happy refraim  
and I'm singing,  
Just singing in the rain
