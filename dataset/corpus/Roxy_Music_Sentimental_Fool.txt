Surely you cannot be leading me on?  
Well if that's so, however can I love again?  
How could I believe again?  
How can I hold on?  
Sentimental fool  
  
Knowing that fate is cruel,  
You ought to forget it.  
Yes, I know it's true,  
I've seen what love can do,  
But I don't regret it.  
Oh, you silly thing  
Don't you see what's happening?  
You're better without it.  
  
No, that's not the case  
If you were in my place,  
You never would doubt it.  
  
Sentimental fool  
Who broke the golden rule,  
You couldn't resist it.  
Though it's all in vain,  
I'd do it all again  
Just to relive a minute.  
A woman in love  
Can make you feel good  
  
You know what you're living for.  
She'll give you so much  
And keep you in touch  
With all that's worth living for.  
Oh once she gets in  
Through thick and through thin  
She'll show you what living's for.  
  
The rhythm of love  
It must go on  
Can't stop.  
The beat of your heart  
Is like a drum  
Will it stop?
