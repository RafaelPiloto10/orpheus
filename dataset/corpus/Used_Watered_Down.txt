In my eyes  
Course and jaded  
It's no surprise  
The lights have faded  
I always walk away  
You'll always hear me say  
I don't need this  
I've been given such a gift  
Shame to take advantage of it  
Watch it, wasting leaves you wanting more  
Be careful what you're wishing for  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Don't care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
  
Now my days are feeling numbered  
This sad cliche I'm hiding under  
This spider web of dreams  
I'm stuck here as it seems to be breaking  
Shining brighter than you burn  
Something that I would never learn  
I could never lay this curse on you  
Cursing the days where there's  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Don't care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Cause it makes no difference  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
It makes no difference  
It makes no difference if I throw it away  
Makes no difference if I throw it away  
Throw it away  
Throw it away  
  
It all just ends up tasting watered down  
(Instead of being so complicated)  
And everyone has found an easy way out, an easy way out  
It all just ends up tasting watered down  
(Instead of being so complicated)  
And everyone has found an easy way out, an easy way out  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Don't care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Cause it makes no difference  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
It makes no difference  
It makes no difference if I throw it away  
Yeah, it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Throw it away  
Throw it away  
  
Get outta town by Sunday  
I say if they don't get outta town  
We kill the men  
We kill the women  
We kill the children  
We kill the babies  
We kill the blind  
We kill the crippled  
We kill the crazy
