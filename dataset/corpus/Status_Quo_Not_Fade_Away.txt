Fade away  
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be  
You're gonna give your love to me  
I'm gonna love you night and day  
Love is love and not fade away  
Love is love and not fade away  
My love's bigger than a Cadillac  
I try to show it but you drive me back  
Your love for me has got to be real  
For you to know just how I feel  
And not fade away, not fade away, not fade away  
My love's bigger than a Cadillac  
I try to show it but you drive me back  
Love to last more than one day  
Said love is love and not fade away  
Said love is love and not fade away  
Not fade away  
And not fade away  
And not fade away  
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be  
You're gonna give your love to me  
I wanna love you night and day  
Love is love and not fade away  
You know love is love and not fade away  
Not fade away  
And not fade away  
It won't fade away
