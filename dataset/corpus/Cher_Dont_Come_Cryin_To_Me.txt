Throw out our love  
Like it was old news  
Be sure to wear your best pair  
Of walking out shoes  
Go take the world  
Into your hot hands  
You want the music baby,  
Go have the dance  
Ooh when you miss my love  
And you're thinking about  
How good it use to be  
Ooh when you long for my touch  
[Chorus:]  
Baby please don't come crying to me  
Remember you were the one  
Who wanted to be free  
That's how you wanted to be  
So don't come crying,  
Don't come crying to me  
Don't you come crying  
Walk out the door and go on and go free  
Step on my heart like  
It's the ground under your feet  
Find another lover if you want to  
You got to do whatever you got to do  
Ooh but when the nights get cold  
And you're thinking about  
How hot we used to be  
Ooh and when there's no one to hold  
[Chorus x3]
