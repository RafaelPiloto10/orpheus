It's wonderful  
Everywhere, so white  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me skating fast  
I'm speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice,  
Cotting out, little lines in the ice  
Splitting, splitting sound,  
Silver heels spitting, spitting snow.  
  
("Sonar says ? deep ?")  
  
There's something moving under  
Under the ice moving  
Under ice through water  
Trying to  
"It's me."  
Get out of the cold water  
"It's me."  
Something,  
"It's me."  
Someone, help them  
  
Wake up
