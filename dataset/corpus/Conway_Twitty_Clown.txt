You love the way it makes me feel when I can't catch my breath  
Like walkin' on a high wire, Lord, it scares me half to death  
You're always high above me and I'm always fallin' down  
Our love's just a circus baby, and I'm just the clown  
  
And I'll do tricks for you, just like you want me to  
I'll do anything it takes just to hang around  
I'll paint a smile for you to cover up my frown  
'Cause our loves a circus and I'm just the clown  
  
Everyone's in love with you, but they just look at me and laugh  
And I'll bet when they see me cry, they think it's just an act  
Ah, but someday when it's over and we bring the big top down  
You can say it was one big circus and I was just the clown  
  
And I'll do tricks for you, just like you want me to  
I'll do anything it takes just to hang around  
I'll paint a smile for you to cover up my frown  
'Cause you love the circus, but you don't love the clown
