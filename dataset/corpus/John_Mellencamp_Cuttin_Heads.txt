Hey Poppi yea ho  
Hey Poppi yea ho  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Lay low proud Poppi  
Lay low proud Poppi (shout it out)  
He's from the deep south (shout it out)  
Pass Christian Mississippi  
Where the cane breaks are burning every night  
Lay low proud Poppi (shout it out)  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Oh Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
  
Poppi had a wife  
And she was black and Poppi was white (shout it out)  
Everything was rolling great (shout it out)  
Till some man called her race a disgrace  
Oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well Poppi went down to the river  
To defend the honor of his wife  
(somebody's killing somebody)  
Gonna drown the man in the water (shout it out)  
And the water was shiny like a new knife  
But Poppi stopped at the banks of the delta  
He said this sure ain't worth this man's life  
Someday the wind of change  
Is gonna blow on through  
And put all of these jokers right  
See man and sing now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[chuck d]  
Papa got a brand new bag  
Delta blues got 'em dazed and confused  
Came a long way crazy  
Seems the abuse  
Is racism's baby  
It's wild  
'Cause I connect the word with pain  
Now some smile when they scream the name?  
Funny how the times have changed  
And the rhymes have changed  
But some cat's frame remains the same  
Agitating adjective  
What gives? Die "n" word die  
But I want to live  
Known' all this  
Where the word came from  
I must be three times stupid  
And stuck on dumb  
If I use it and confuse it  
With a term of love  
Now popular culture  
Can't stop 'til it gets enough  
Underlined in marketing campaigns  
I feel undermined  
Heard the "n" word promotes the bottom line  
Down by the river there's a great divide  
Let's ride  
  
[repeat: x4]  
Don't call me nigga cause you know I don't like it like that  
  
Shout it out  
Yeah shout it out  
Tell the world  
Shout it out  
I said  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Oh Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Tell the world  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Tell the world  
That it ain't right  
Tell the world  
Don't set us back oh Poppi  
Don't set us back now Poppi  
Tell the world
