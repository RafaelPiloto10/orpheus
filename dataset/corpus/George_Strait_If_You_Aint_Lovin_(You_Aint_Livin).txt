If you got a Cadillac boy and a 40 room shack boy  
A bucket full of money and a tree full of honey  
But if you're gettin' no huggin'  
No smoochin' or a muggin'  
If you ain't lovin'  
Then you ain't livin'  
  
If you're ridin' on a gravy train  
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane  
You can't make hey boy  
'Cause you're goin' the wrong way boy  
You gotta get a a little honey  
It's better than money  
If you ain't lovin'  
Then you ain't livin'  
  
If they call you a big man  
'Cause you got a lot of bottled land  
If you're kin to the President  
And ya help from the Government  
But if you're gettin' no attention  
You're better off on the pension  
If you ain't lovin  
Then you ain't livin'  
  
If you got a string of long cards  
And you're smokin' them 4 bid cigars  
You ain't so well to do  
Unless you get a little coochy-coo  
It takes a little bit a smackin'  
Or your lifes lackin'  
If you ain't lovin'  
Then you ain't livin'
