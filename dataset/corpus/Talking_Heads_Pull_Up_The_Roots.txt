Hello again  
Yes indeed my friend  
I can tell  
Goin' get together again  
I could be right  
I could be wrong  
I feel nice when I sing this song  
And I don't mind  
Whatever happens is fine  
Baby likes to keep on playing...  
What do I know, what do I know?  
Wilder than the place we live in...  
I'll take you there, I'll take you there  
I don't mind some slight disorder...  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
And I know ev'ry living creature...  
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots  
  
And I know you  
I understand what you do  
Yes, indeed  
I put the hat on my head  
Come outta your mess  
Bring yourself in  
I feel nice when I start to sing  
And I can see  
Ev'ryone else is like me  
  
Towns that disappeared completely...  
Pull up the roost, pull up the roots  
Miles and miles of endless highway...  
Pull up the roost, pull up the roots  
Colored lights and shiny curtains...  
I'll take you there, I'll take you there  
Ev'rything has been forgiven...  
Pull up the roost, pull up the roots  
  
Well I have a good time...when I go out of my mind  
And it's a wonderful place...and I can't wait to be there  
And I hear beautiful sounds...coming outta the ground  
Gonna take us a while...but we'll go hundreds of times  
  
Baby likes to keep on playing...  
What d'you know? what d'you I know?  
Wilder than the place we live in...  
I'll take you there, I'll take you there  
And I don't mind some slight disorder...  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
And no more time for talkin' it over...  
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots  
  
Well I have a good time...when I go out of my mind  
And it's a wonderful place...and I can't wait to be there  
And I hear beautiful sounds...coming outta the ground  
Someone musta been high...but I guess it's alright
