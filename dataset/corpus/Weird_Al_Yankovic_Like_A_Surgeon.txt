I finally made it through med school  
Somehow I made it through  
I'm just an intern  
I still make a mistake or two  
  
I was last in my class  
Barely passed at the institute  
Now I'm trying to avoid, yah I'm trying to avoid  
A malpractice suit  
  
Hey, like a surgeon  
Cuttin' for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Organ transplants are my line  
  
Better give me all your gause nurse  
This patient's fading fast  
Complications have set in  
Don't know how long he'll last  
  
Let me see, that I.V.  
Here we go time to operate  
I'll pull his indsides out, pull his insides out  
And see what he ate  
  
Like a surgeon, hey  
Cuttin' for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Here's a waiver for you to sign  
  
Woe, woe, woe  
  
It's a fact I'm a quack  
The disgrace of the A.M.A.  
'Cause my patients die, yah my patients die  
Before they can pay  
  
Like a surgeon, hey  
Cuttin' for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Got your kidneys on my mind  
  
Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon  
When I reach inside  
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and re-tractors  
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh  
  
Ooh baby, yeah  
I can hear your heartbeat  
For the very last time
