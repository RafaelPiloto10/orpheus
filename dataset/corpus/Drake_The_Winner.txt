I'm performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed  
Pay me in advance and make sure that it's exact  
My ex girl'll probably show up for the simple fact  
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack  
But?  
This about me  
They say my whole fan base is missin I'd  
What the young trend settin musician I be  
Got critics givin up the recognition I de-serve  
Never bring yo mrs. By me  
I'm it I'm it call me mr. i-t  
If I get one wish imma wish to die free  
They say gon head, ball like mrs.?  
And I do  
The realest in my age group, no shit  
Soho, cosmo, bob mar blow fish?  
Lets make a toast, tell yo friends come closer  
Drinks on me like a coaster  
We doin it big  
Look at what I done  
Look at where I'm is  
It's only just begun  
Cause I was stayin home  
When they was havin fun  
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won  
And this is how my speech goes  
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit  
That's all I got to say, at the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner  
Long awaited, hated  
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated  
It's about time that you made it  
I was bumpin yo songs when nobody else played it  
When I was up in? in atlanta steady givin daps  
Fetchin niggas drinks but I never got to rap?  
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped  
But I can't sign nothin til my lawyer get the fax and  
No one decides who the definition of talent is  
And mrs.? look at what my talent did  
And what yo business is?  
It's been a couple years  
Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it  
It's always awkward to... a nigga artist  
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest  
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach ya  
My plan just hatched, happy easter  
I'm doin it big  
Look at what I done  
Look at where I'm is  
It's only just begun  
Cause I was stayin home  
When they was havin fun  
So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won  
And this is how my speech goes  
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit  
That's all I got to say  
At the top is where I stay  
And tell my haters never go away, the winner
