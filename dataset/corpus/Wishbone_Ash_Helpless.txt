Ooh, there's something happening, ooh  
Ooh, there's something happening, ooh (repeat)  
Won't you take my love forever  
Won't you take my love for you  
Won't you take my love together  
Won't you give me your love too?  
  
I will give you my love gladly  
And I hope you'll give me yours  
Somehow we can live together  
Could not love you any more  
  
I'm so helpless, helpless  
I can feel you're helpless too (repeat)  
I'm so helpless, helpless  
So helpless without you
