Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings  
Racing to the battle in the sky  
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing  
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die  
  
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air  
I am invisible, I move without a sound  
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there  
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground  
  
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn  
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm  
We must die to be reborn  
  
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign  
Now welcome me into this wicked wind  
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride  
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!  
  
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne  
All Commandments and the laws of man disown  
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone  
Into the fire with your soul!  
  
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn  
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm  
We must die to be reborn
