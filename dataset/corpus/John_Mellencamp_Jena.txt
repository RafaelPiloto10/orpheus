An all white jury hides the executioner's face  
See how we are, me and you?  
Everyone here needs to know their place  
Let's keep this blackbird hidden in the flue  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh Jena  
Oh oh oh Jena  
Oh oh oh Jena  
Take your nooses down  
  
So what becomes of boys that cannot think straight  
Particularly those with paper bag skin  
Yes sir, no sir, we'll wipe that smile right off your face  
We've got our rules here and you must fit in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some day some way sanity will prevail  
But who knows when that day might come  
A shot in the dark, well it just might find its way  
To the hearts of those that hold the keys to kingdom come  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Take those nooses all down
