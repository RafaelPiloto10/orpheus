Abide with me, fast falls the eventide  
The darkenss deepens, Lord, with me abide  
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me  
  
I need Thy presence every passing hour  
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
Through cloud and sunshine, o abide with me  
  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me  
  
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, Thy victory?  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me  
  
Abide , with me  
Abide, abide with me  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me
