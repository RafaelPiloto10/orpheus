Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum  
Our new born king to see pa rum pa pum pum  
Our finest gifts we bring pa rum pa pum pum  
To lay before the king pa rum pa pum pum  
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum  
  
Little baby pa rum pa pum pum  
I am a poor boy too pa rum pa pum pum  
I have no gift to bring pa rum pa pum pum  
To lay before the king pa rum pa pum pum  
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum  
  
So to honor him pa rum pa pum pum  
I played my drum for him pa rum pa pum pum  
I played my best for him pa rum pa pum pum  
And then he smiled at me pa rum pa pum pum  
Me and my drum, me and my drum, me and my drum, me and my drum
