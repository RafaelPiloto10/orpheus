You've got to accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
  
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom down to the minimum  
Have faith or pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate his last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark  
What did they do  
Just when everything looked so dark  
  
Man, they said we better, accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
No, do not mess with Mister In-Between  
Do you hear me?  
  
Oh, listen to me children and-a you will hear  
About the elininatin' of the negative  
And the accent on the positive  
And gather 'round me children if you're willin'  
And sit tight while I start reviewin'  
The attitude of doin' right  
  
You've gotta accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
  
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom, down to the minimum  
Otherwise pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate my last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark  
What did they say  
Say when everything looked so dark  
  
Man, they said we better accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
No, don't mess with Mister In-Between
