[Chorus:]  
What can I?  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
  
[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Just one of them days  
A n-gga feel like flossin'  
A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin  
Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's  
Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome  
He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me  
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me  
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only  
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me  
Well look I'm back b-tch, back with an attitude  
Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the sh-t I gotta prove  
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved  
Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude  
Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you aint believe me  
Now I'm living just like the n-ggas you see on tv  
Vip feeling like this club oughta thank me  
I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', hd  
  
[Chorus:]  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Big chains, big whips with wood grain  
(It's cost me a lot)  
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Fast life and till the gas light  
Copped the type of sh-t you couldn't get at half price  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Look but don't touch muthaf-cker, think twice  
(It's cost me a lot)  
  
Now I don't love no material things  
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)  
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)  
Now I don't love no material things  
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)  
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)  
  
[J Cole - Verse 2]  
Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy  
Somebody get the pilot and ask "is the plane ready?"  
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off  
Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off  
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling  
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame  
Felt naked cause the boy rocked bout a dozen chains  
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain  
That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em  
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon  
Jay put a stamp on the n-gga but wouldn't nail him  
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him huh?  
  
My chain heavy and my b-tches look very thorough  
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl  
White Range, call that Muthaf-cker Larry Bird  
I got em hanging on every word  
  
[Chorus:]  
[End]
