I left my anger in a river running highway 5  
New hampshire, vermont, bordered by  
College farms, hubcaps, and falling rocks  
Voices in the woods and the mountaintops  
  
I used to search for reservations and native lands  
Before I realized everywhere I stand  
There have tribal feet running wild as fire  
Some past life sister of my desire  
  
[Chorus]  
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now  
Steady now and don't come out  
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face  
Whose turn is it anyway?  
Anyway?  
  
Now when I was young my people taught me well  
Give back what you take or you'll go to hell  
It's not the devil's land, you know it's not that kind  
Every devil I meet becomes a friend of mine  
Every devil I meet is an angel in disguise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
White, chain, rope, fear  
(hush my darling)  
Be still my dear  
  
A bullet in the head, now he's dead  
A friend of a friend, someone said  
He was an activist with a very short life  
I think there's a lesson here - he died without a fight  
  
In the war over land where the world began  
Prophecies say it's where the world will end  
But there's a tremor growing in our backyard  
Fear in our heads, fear in our hearts  
Prophets in the graveyard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now  
Steady now I feel your ghost about  
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face  
Whose angel are you anyway?  
  
I said there's prophets in the graveyard  
(now I walk in beauty)  
Prophets in the graveyard  
(beauty is before me)  
Prophets in the graveyard  
(beauty is behind me)  
(above and below me)
