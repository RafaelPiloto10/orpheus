Feeling the heat,  
I can't keep  
The pressure off me.  
Hear the man say  
Earn your pay  
Or I'll let you go today.  
  
But that's not for me  
I was born to be alive  
Not livin' to survive  
Come closer to me, baby  
Make me believe it, I can  
  
Own the night  
Reach up and touch the light  
Own the night  
You make me come alive  
I own the night.  
  
Here in the dark,  
Turn it on  
Love me forever like this.  
Baby don't stop  
Make it hot  
I want to taste your burn again  
  
Take me away  
To a place I've never known  
Livin' right down to the bone  
Closer to me baby,  
Make me believe it, I can  
  
Own the night  
Reach up and touch the light  
(love still shines)  
Own the night  
You make me come alive  
I own the night.  
  
You make me feel  
I own the night  
  
Own the night  
Touch the light  
(love still shines)  
Own the night  
  
(repeat to end)
