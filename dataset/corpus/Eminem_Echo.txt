[Chorus:]  
Oh, all around the World,  
There's an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls, the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo  
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo  
  
[Royce]  
Classical palms  
Battle my own demons  
I need a glass of Patron  
Bad as I need a horn  
Stabbing my clavicle bone  
I'm at it or prone  
First time I seen a dessert eagle  
I was letting the 44 buss  
The 44 pop  
First time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs  
Looking at Robocop  
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain  
In order to clean my things you need saline  
I'm never refering to the solution  
I'm talking about more like the mustang  
Vroom  
Get respect from the get-go, hello  
Set to the echo, pyscho  
Pen got a mind of it's own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise  
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song  
As the echo follows the Maserati  
As the petrol swallows,  
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton  
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant  
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings  
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,  
Right now I'm living a dream  
Though we may be reckless  
The ladies check us  
They whisper Shady records  
Baby echo  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, all around the World,  
There's an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls, the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo  
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo  
  
[Eminem]  
I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling  
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em  
The only f-cking thing that you consume is time  
I'm super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube  
It's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming  
My mentality's caveman stupid woman  
My life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe  
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago  
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow  
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo  
Oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful  
Diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair folicle and cuticle  
Rhyming to the call, to the [?] all the way down to my sock and the hair on my
toe  
Learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole  
Cause I aint took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first
pubic grow  
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire  
And this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her  
Cause this time muthaf-ckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her  
I aint even put my tip in that hoe yet  
Ima go get tip and try to rip it wider  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, all around the World,  
There's an echo  
As he takes a bow  
And they all know all the girls, the boys  
They chase the noise  
Through the highs and through the lows  
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo  
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
