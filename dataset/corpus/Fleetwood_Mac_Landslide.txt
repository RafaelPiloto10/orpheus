I took my love, I took it down  
Climbed a mountain and I turned around  
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills  
'Til the landslide brought it down  
Oh, mirror in the sky  
What is love?  
Can the child within my heart rise above?  
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?  
Can I handle the seasons of my life?  
?  
  
Well, I've been afraid of changin'  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Even children get older  
And I'm getting older too  
And I'm getting older too  
Oh, take my love, take it down  
Climb a mountain and turn around  
  
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down  
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down  
The landslide will bring it down
