Hey you out there in the cold  
Getting lonely getting old  
Can you feel me?  
Hey you standing in the aisles  
With itchy feet and fading smiles  
Can you feel me?  
Hey you don't help them to bury the light  
Don't give in without a fight.  
  
Hey you out there on your own  
Sitting naked by the phone  
Would you touch me?  
Hey you with you ear against the wall  
Waiting for someone to call out  
Would you touch me?  
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?  
Open your heart, I'm coming home.  
  
But it was only fantasy.  
The wall was too high,  
As you can see.  
No matter how he tried,  
He could not break free.  
And the worms ate into his brain.  
  
Hey you, out there on the road  
Always doing what you're told,  
Can you help me?  
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,  
Breaking bottles in the hall,  
Can you help me?  
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all  
Together we stand, divided we fall.
