Find me a rose that never fades and dies  
And I'll show you a man who never, ever cheats and lies  
Find me a star and if you can prove  
The star you've found just never disappears  
I'll show you a man who'll never, never, ever, ever bring you tears  
  
[Chorus]  
Another night, when I'm all alone  
Another night without him  
Another night, when I stay at home  
And worry so about him  
Oh, I love him  
And my love makes me cry  
I need him  
If he doesn't come back  
I know I'll surely die  
  
Find me a cloud that never brings you rain  
And I'll show you a man who never, ever brings you pain  
Find me a bird and if you can prove the bird you've found  
Has wings and still can't fly  
I'll show you a man  
Who'll never, never, ever, ever leave you high and dry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And he'll never, never, never, never leave you high and dry  
Another night when I'm all alone  
Another night without him  
Another night when I stay at home  
And worry so about him  
Another night  
Another night, yeah  
I'm so alone baby  
Another night  
I can't stand it, ah  
I can't stand it
