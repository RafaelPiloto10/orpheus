Weekends in bed, no scramble eggs, or bacon  
I just have time for you  
Backs on the grass, heads in the clouds, we  
Closed our eyes  
Enjoy the view  
  
We don't wanna hear  
The real world passing by  
Saying that we're crazy  
  
We spend all our time lying side by side  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy doing nothing  
We spend all our time running for our lives  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy, doing nothing.  
  
No magazines or DVD's we both got  
Better things to do  
I'll hold your hand  
Or shall we dance together  
It's so hard to choose  
  
Every time we hear  
The whole world rushing by  
I know that we're not crazy  
  
We spend all our time lying side by side  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy doing nothing  
We spend all our time running for our lives  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy, doing nothing  
  
Should be working hard  
Instead of lying here naked  
Phone rings but I wont take it  
'Cause you only get one life, only get one life  
  
All our time lying side by side  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy doing nothing  
We spend all our time running for our lives  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy, doing nothing  
  
All our time, doing nothing  
All our time, getting busy doing nothing
