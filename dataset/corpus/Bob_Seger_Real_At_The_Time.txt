I still remember how I fell for you  
There wasn't one thing I would not do  
I still recall the love in your eyes  
Blue like the sky on a clear sunrise  
And it was Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
I was yours you were mine  
It was Real At The Time  
  
You were a lioness tall and lean  
You were the best thing I'd ever seen  
I heard a loneliness in your voice  
I charged ahead I had no choice  
Cause it felt Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
Like a mountain you climb  
It felt Real At The Time  
  
And babe you meant so much to me  
I never will forget your face  
I never will forget those nights  
Those nights  
Those nights  
  
Lost in the pettiness and the fights  
Lost in the battle for bragging rights  
We were a couple of kindred souls  
Fighting for childish things like control  
  
But it was Real At The Time  
Real At The Time  
Like the scene of a crime  
It was Real At The Time  
It was Real At The Time  
I was yours you were mine  
We got way out of line  
But it was Real At The Time
