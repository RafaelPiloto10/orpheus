What have I got  
That makes you want to love me  
Now is it my body  
Someone I might be  
Somethin' inside me  
  
You better tell me  
Tell me  
It's really up to you  
Have you got the time to find out  
Who I really am  
  
What does it take  
To get inside of your mind  
Give me a break, yeah, yeah  
And take a chance for the very first time  
  
You better tell me  
Tell me  
It's really up to you  
Have you got the time to find out  
Who I really am  
  
What have I got  
That makes you want to love me  
Now is it my body  
Or someone I might be  
Or somethin' inside me  
  
You better tell me  
Tell me  
It's really up to you  
Have you got the time to find out  
Who I really am  
Oh
