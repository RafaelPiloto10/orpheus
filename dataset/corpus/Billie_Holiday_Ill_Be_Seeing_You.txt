I'll be seeing you  
In all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces  
All day and through  
In that small cafe  
The park across the way  
The children carrousel  
The chestnut trees  
The wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you
