Just off of the beaten path  
A little dot on a state road map  
That's where I was born and where I'll die  
Things move at a slower pace  
Nobody's in the rat race  
And these days that's a special way of life  
  
[Chorus]  
Down home, where they know you by name  
And treat you like family  
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake  
Are all you need  
Folks know if they're falling on hard times  
They can fall back on  
Those of us raised up down home  
  
In the corner of the hardware store  
Gathered 'round a checkerboard  
Old men telling lies and crowning kings  
Kids driving 'round the old town square  
Tops rolled down in the cool night air  
Go and see what's shaking at the Dairy Queen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place  
But now I want to see my children raised down home, down home  
  
Folks know if they're falling on hard times  
They can fall back on  
Those of us raised up...  
  
[Chorus]
