Sad to be alone  
Your only comfort is the telephone  
Homesick again  
Thoughts of far away  
Silence is the only way to say  
Ain't it a shame  
What's goin' down, she don't understand  
Can't you be with her every night  
Why must it be, you're away so long  
But she plays along, and it's alright  
People all around  
You don't see or hear them make a sound  
It's not the same  
What's goin' down, she don't understand  
Can't you be with her every night  
Why must it be, you're away so long  
But she plays along, and it's alright  
  
Countin' out the days  
That don't help to ease the days away  
The price you pay  
Homesick again
