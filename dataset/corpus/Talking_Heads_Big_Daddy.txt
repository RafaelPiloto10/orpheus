She had such tiny tears  
Just like a Barbie doll  
She likes to shop at Sears  
And visit shopping malls  
Now she's a big mamma  
Tell poppa  
Cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Old money  
Your old money doesn't matter now  
Have mercy  
Mercy, mercy, daddy's going fishing now  
He put the bait onto his line  
He's winding out his reel  
Fish are swimming in the pond  
Gonna let 'em sail away  
  
He's got his eye on you  
He knows just what she wants  
The fish is gonna bite  
She is his latest catch  
'Cause he's Big Daddy  
Oh, mammy  
Cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Big Daddy  
Oh, daddy's scraping bottom now  
Oh, momma  
Daddy, daddy, daddy does the talking now  
Mesmerized like horny toads  
By shiny things like jewels and gold  
Throwing all their pearls to swing  
Let 'em sail away  
  
You lucky dog  
You'll be on Easy Street  
Drinking champagne  
She gets all that she wants  
His heart's desire  
No more worries anymore  
Like a fairy tale  
Anything that she likes  
  
I seen you do the dog  
I seen you getting down  
A swimming back and forth  
When daddy's not around  
  
Big Daddy  
Oh, she's pretty as a picture now  
Oh, momma  
Oh, what a little martyr now  
He knows how to drive 'em wild  
One day you'd think she'd see  
Saying "This is mine and this is her.  
Now take that stuff away"  
  
It's best left unspoken  
One and one is two  
The velvet lies sing softly  
Each with a golden spoon  
And she passed her time in the wind and the rain  
Got a one way ticket on a Southbound train  
Said baby, baby, wants to have a good time  
And Big Daddy laughed  
And Big Daddy smiled  
  
Like dynamite  
One fine day she'll explode  
Who's laughing now?  
No one sees anymore  
Sneak in and out  
Don't get caught running 'round  
Swim back and forth  
Bubbles float to the top
