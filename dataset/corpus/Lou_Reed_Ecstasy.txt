They call you ecstasy  
Nothing ever sticks to you  
Not Velcro, not Scotch tape  
Not my arms dipped in glue  
  
Not if I wrap myself in nylon  
A piece of duct tape down my back  
Love pierced the arrow with the twelve  
And I can't get you back  
  
Ah, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
Ah, ecstasy  
  
Across the streets an old ford, they took off it's wheels  
The engine is gone  
In it's seat sits a box  
With a note that says, goodbye charlie, thanks a lot  
  
I see a child through a window with a bib  
And I think of us and what we almost did  
The Hudson rocketing with light  
The ships pass the statue of liberty at night  
  
They call it ecstasy, ah  
Ecstasy  
Ecstasy, ah  
Ecstasy  
  
Some men call me st. ivory  
Some call me St. Maurice  
I'm smooth as alabaster  
With white veins runnin' through my cheeks  
  
A big stud through my eyebrow  
A scar on my arm that says, domain  
I put it over the tattoo  
That contained your name  
  
They called you ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
  
The moon passing through a cloud  
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd  
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do  
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you  
  
They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down  
I can't hold you up  
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio  
No engine, no hood  
  
I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music  
And I hope that they can play  
But if we have to part  
I'll have a new scar right over my heart  
I'll call it ecstasy  
  
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
Ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy
