Yonder she's walking  
She comes my way  
Her red dress on  
Her long black hair  
  
Walking like  
Talking like  
Wanting like  
She comes to me  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I can't go on  
  
Helpless baby  
Evil child  
I've known you well  
And if you want to stay  
That's alright  
That's alright  
  
And now she's gone  
She's walking away  
Her red dress on  
Her long black hair  
  
Well I love her so  
And now she'll come running  
Anytime I say now  
Anytime I say  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I can't go on  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I can't go on  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I can't go on  
  
I love you so baby  
I need you so  
I want you back  
I can't go on
