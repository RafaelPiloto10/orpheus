Start up beef, we in yo front yard with gats  
So don't go with that, we leave you flat paralyzed from the neck  
With a motherfuckin' hole in ya back

You'll die quickly, when we apply all fifty  
My real niggaz, hard hitters they ride with me

Runnin' with thugs, when it get down to them broads  
They ain't showin' no love  
Put his face in the mud  
Fuckin' with the hard hitters, D-Tay my nigga  
Got contracts to get 'em, lyrical spitter  
We slaved on the figures found out who's better  
From Nashville to Chucktown we go round for round  
City to city and then we knock it down  
[Verse 4]  
Yeah we'll lock it down  
Then we hit these niggaz spot up with fifty rounds  
The best pound for pound  
Representin' the town  
That'll clown when it's time for the showdown, better slow down

First Born, D-Tay we hard hitters combined  
Talk shit and ya dyin' if ya think that I'm lyin'  
Ask that nigga named Bryan, caught six in the spine  
And we ain't hard to find we just sleep in the daytime  
After the sunshine we duckin' for war time  
You said you want what now  
See go to war nigga, hard hitters we buck wild  
Just us four niggaz  
See we live for gunfire, kick in ya door nigga  
If we come at lunchtime, we afternoon killers

Who done did some time and wanna mitch new figures  
Get the tools niggaz, let's show the world how we abuse niggaz  
Cock back the hammer and just shoot nigga
