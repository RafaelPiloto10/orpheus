Stuff your pockets stuff your mouth  
Much more than feeding  
Your bloated God your bank account  
Your empathy's fleeting  
Now that you own the cure, you bought the truth, still you want more  
Down on you're knees you bleed it out  
This type of believing  
  
Hold on wait, we have had all we can take  
You can keep the money  
'Cause all we need is El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
El-Oh-Vee-Ee, El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
  
You pushed the point to no return  
Take more and repeat it  
Stockpiled possessions watch them burn  
We've got all we needed  
Before you got to far  
We realized  
Just who you are  
Down on your knees you bleed it out  
This type of believing  
  
Hold on wait, we have had all we can take  
You can keep the money  
'Cause all we need is El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
El-Oh-Vee-Ee, El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
  
You've got your mansion.  
You've got your minions.  
Protected privilege.  
But we've got love.  
You've got your black gold.  
You've got your pipeline.  
Capitalism.  
But we've got love.  
  
You've got reserve banks with no reserves.  
You've got religion.  
Control the herds.  
You've got your slave trade of prostitution.  
You've got your green God.  
But we got love.  
  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
  
Hold on wait, we have had all we can take  
You can keep the money  
'Cause all we need is El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
El-Oh-Vee-Ee, El-Oh-Vee-Ee, love  
  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Yes we got love  
Love, love, love, love
