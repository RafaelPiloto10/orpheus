You always wanted a lover I only wanted a job.  
I've always worked for a living.  
How am I gonna get through?  
How am I gonna get through?  
  
Now you've left me with nothing.  
(Can't take it.)  
How am I gonna get through?  
How am I gonna get through?  
  
I brought you drinks, I brought you flowers,  
I read your books and talked for hours ev'ry day.  
So many drinks, such pretty flow'rs, so tell me.  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
  
What have I, what have I, what have I  
Since you went away.  
I've been hanging around.  
I've been wondering why  
I'm feeling down.  
You went away.  
It should make me feel better  
But I don't know  
  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
Gonna get through. (Gonna get through.)  
  
You always wanted a lover I only wanted a job.  
Now I can do what I want to forever.  
How am I gonna get through?  
How am I gonna get through?  
  
At night the people come and go, they talk to fast and walk to slow  
Chasing time from hour to hour, I pour the drinks and crush the flowers.  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?  
  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)  
How I'm gonna get through, how I'm gonna get through.  
Gonna get through. (Gonna get through.)
