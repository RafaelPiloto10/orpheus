I was all alone and drifting on a lonely sea of sin  
Nothing but darkness, no sunshine within  
I lifted my eyes, to the Lord in the sky  
And Jesus remembered me  
Jesus remembered me  
And so He set me free  
Once I was blinded, but now I can see  
Glory to God, He remembered me  
Now the sun is shining, I'm happy and free  
No more sorrow, no troubles to see  
I'm going home to glory, my savior to see  
Glory to God, He remembered me  
Jesus remembered me  
And so He set me free  
Once I was blinded, but now I can see  
Glory to God, He remembered me  
When He talked to his disciples at the sea of Galilee  
He said He'd remember a mortal like me  
I asked for his blessing down on my knees  
And glory to God, He remembered me
