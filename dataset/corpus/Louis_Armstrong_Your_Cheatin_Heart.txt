Your cheating heart will make you weep  
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep  
But sleep won't come the whole night through  
Your cheating heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You'll toss around and call my name  
You'll walk the floor, yes, the way I do  
Your cheating heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You'll toss around and call my name  
You'll walk the floor, yes, the way I do  
Your cheating heart will tell on you  
Yes, your cheating heart will tell on you
