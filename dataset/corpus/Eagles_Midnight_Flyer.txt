Oo, Midnight Flyer  
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on  
  
A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay  
So throw your rope on another man  
And pull him down your way  
Make him into someone who can take the place of me  
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be  
  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?  
Oo, Midnight Flyer,  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on  
Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe, maybe San Antone,  
Any town is where I'm bound any way to get me gone  
Don't think about me, never let me cross your mind  
'Cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine  
  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?  
Oo, Midnight Flyer  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on  
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
