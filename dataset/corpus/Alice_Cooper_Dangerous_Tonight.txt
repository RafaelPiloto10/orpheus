Take another bite  
It'll be alright  
What's wrong will soon feel right  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Take another sip  
Let it kiss your lips  
And let a little drip on your thighs  
  
If you let me I'll untie your sensuality  
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm dangerous, I'm a dying breed  
Poisonous like a centipede  
I'm capable of the foulest deed  
Dangerous at night  
I'm dangerous like a razorback  
Deadly like a heart attack  
Well, I don't bend and I don't crack  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Take another turn  
The rules have all been burned  
And you've got tricks to learn  
Dangerous tonight  
  
Play another role  
Try and lose control  
And stain your soul to red from white  
In my mind, oh, a million voices tell me no  
It's prime crime time and I gotta let it go  
  
I'm dangerous like a broken glass  
I'm a flesh fanatic psychopath  
I can cause you pain and make it last  
Dangerous tonight  
I'm dangerous when the sun goes down  
So cross yourself, don't fool around  
I'll drag your heart into the ground  
Dangerous tonight  
  
If you let me I'll untie your sensuality  
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm dangerous like a broken glass  
I'm a blood bubonic psychopath  
I can cause you pain and make it last  
Dangerous tonight
