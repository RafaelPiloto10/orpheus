Welcome to our sanguinary sect or worship  
Feel at home in our black conventicle  
As we anathmastise  
All those who oppose us.  
Don't summon the devil,  
Don't call the priests  
If you need the strength,  
The conjuring, obey!  
Behold! the flames rise  
From the compass' cardinal points  
Burn the sacred oil,  
And with the ashes you'll annoint  
Arrange the symbols  
Of the wizard and magician.  
Light the candles,  
Place the parchment paper in position  
Between its leaves place  
The lash from a black cat's eye,  
A straw of a broom,  
Fold, burn and centralize.  
Don't summon the devil,  
Don't call the priests  
If you need the strength,  
The conjuring.  
I am the devil's advocate  
A salesman, if you will.  
You know my name.  
I met your father years ago  
Gave him what he'd please.  
He called my name, you'll do the same.  
I'm claiming what is mine by right  
It's time to close the deal.  
You're bought and sold, bought and sold.  
Come join me in my infernal depths,  
Mephisto's Hall of Fame  
I've got your soul, I've got your soul.  
The conjuring. Obey!
