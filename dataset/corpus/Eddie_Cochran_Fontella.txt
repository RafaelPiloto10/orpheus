You see that girlie in the yellow sweater  
Her cheeks are roses and her lips are mellow  
That's a-my girl and her name is Fontella  
Oh-oh, Fontella is the girl for me  
I says a-oh Fontella, well Fontella  
I says a-oh Fontella, you know Fontella  
Fontella is the girl for me  
She loves me more when I hold her tight  
She wants to kiss me with all her might  
Oh Fontella, won't you be my wife  
Oh-yeah pretty baby I'll treat you right  
I says a-oh Fontella, well Fontella  
I says a-oh Fontella, you know Fontella  
Fontella is the girl for me  
I'm tellin' you gal, she's a mighty fine  
I just can't get her off of my mind  
When she goes struttin' down the street  
All the little birdies go tweet-tweet-tweet
