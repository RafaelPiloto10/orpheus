What you gonna do and what you gonna feel when suddenly I slip away?  
Almost am a ghost of who I use to be, yesterday  
How you going to touch and how will you collect the beauty when it turns to
dust?  
Everything we make, the cells we generate are both of us  
  
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life  
  
Hold you in my arms, I'll hold you in my gaze, singing with my dying breath  
Underneath this earth I'd resurrect your soul and nothing less  
Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void an ocean wouldn't hold the love  
And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life  
  
I will forget me  
I will forget me  
I will forget me  
I will protect you [x9]  
  
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life  
  
This ain't the time, this ain't the place [x4]  
  
This ain't the time, this ain't the place [x3]  
  
I will protect you [x5]
