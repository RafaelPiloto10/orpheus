I know it's over  
You know it's over  
We're just goin' through the motions  
But we're sailing separate oceans, worlds apart  
And you know it's breakin' my heart  
  
I was a dreamer  
You were a dreamer  
But perfection is consuming  
And it seems we're only human after all  
And we've both been takin' the fall  
  
[Chorus]  
But tomorrow  
We'll run a little bit faster  
Tomorrow  
We're gonna find what we're after at last  
Feelings that we left in the past  
There's romance in the sunset  
We're boats against the current to the end  
  
Maybe we're older  
And maybe we're colder  
So we disregard solutions  
While we cling to our illusions once again  
And we keep remembering when  
Seasons are changing  
Oh my reasons are changing  
But the story isn't ending  
So we find ourselves pretending one more day  
And the years keep slipping away  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Romance in the sunset  
We're boats against the current to the end  
To the end
