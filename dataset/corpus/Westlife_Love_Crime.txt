I didn't know what to say  
I tried to look the other way  
When I saw you there with him  
Acting like I don't care  
But you can read from how I stare  
That I'm hurting deep inside  
But even though you look so good tonight  
I'll be fine  
  
But I know that for you  
To be here without me by your side  
It's a love crime  
Why you act so surprised  
I can tell from the guilt in your eyes  
It's a love crime to me  
  
Love has never been good to me  
Maybe it's just my destiny  
To live my life alone  
Who was I trying to fool  
Thinking our love would break the rule  
Still I'm standing on my own  
And even though you look so good tonight  
I'll be fine  
  
But I know that for you  
To be here without me by your side  
It's a love crime  
Why you act so surprised  
I can tell from the guilt in your eyes  
It's a love crime to me  
  
Here I am not knowing  
Tell me what to do  
  
But I know that for you  
To be here without me by your side  
It's a love crime  
Why you act so surprised  
I can tell from the guilt in your eyes  
It's a love crime to me
