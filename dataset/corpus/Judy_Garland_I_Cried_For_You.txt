I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
That's one thing you're learning.  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
But I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,  
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me.  
  
I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby - like her.  
But maybe someday you'll realize that glamour isn't the only thing in this
world.  
If your show's a flop you'll find you can't eat glamour for breakfast.  
Anyway, I might be pretty good-looking myself when I grow out of this ugly-
duckling stage.  
And you're no Clark Gable yourself.  
But that's all right.  
Don't worry about me, I'll recover.  
Time is a great healer.  
But in the future if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball, and  
I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps,  
And surrounded by lords and dukes and princes, you'll probably be sorry.  
And you'll probably realize that life is just an idiot's delight.  
And as I speed through the night into the abyss of oblivion,  
I can only say thanks - thanks for the memory.  
  
I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,  
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me.
