I'm traveling light  
It's au revoir  
My once so bright, my fallen star  
I'm running late, they'll close the bar  
I used to play one mean guitar  
I guess I'm just somebody who  
Has given up on the me and you  
I'm not alone, I've met a few  
Traveling light like we used to do  
  
Good night, good night, my fallen star  
I guess you're right, you always are  
I know you're right about the blues  
You live some life you'd never choose  
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you  
I'm not alone, I've met a few  
Traveling light like we used to do  
Traveling light  
It's au revoir  
My once so bright, my fallen star  
I'm running late, they'll close the bar  
I used to play one mean guitar  
I guess I'm just somebody who  
Has given up on the me and you  
I'm not alone, I've met a few  
Traveling light like we used to do  
  
But if the road leads back to you  
Must I forget the things I knew  
When I was friends with one or two  
Traveling light like we used to do  
I'm traveling light
