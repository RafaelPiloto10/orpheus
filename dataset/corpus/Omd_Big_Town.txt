I discovered a big town  
On the crest of a wave  
Throwing money at strangers  
Taking candy from babes  
  
Shaking hands in a big top  
As the rain came down  
I though it would not stop  
Sending letters to paris  
From the empire state  
Taking pictures from the top  
  
There's a lot of things  
For you to do  
There's a lot of dreams  
That won't come true  
  
I grew up in a big town  
The lessons were not hard to learn  
If you want them to love you  
Then you must not love them in return  
  
Spent the night at a party  
Where I drank so much  
I fell under your spell  
  
Eight o'clock in the morning  
And the daylight makes me  
Look and feel like hell  
  
There's a lot of things  
For you to do  
There's a lot of dreams  
That won't come true  
  
There's a lot of things  
For you to do  
There's a lot of dreams  
That won't come true  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry
