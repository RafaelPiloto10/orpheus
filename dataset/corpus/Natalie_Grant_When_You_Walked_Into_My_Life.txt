I've waited all this time  
Counting minutes as they passed  
Searching for a sign  
Wishing for the best  
And just when I thought my chance was gone  
You came to me with open arms  
  
Like a miracle out of the blue  
You rescued me when I turned to You  
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies  
When You walked, when You walked into my life  
  
When You appeared  
Like sight to the blind  
Like music to my ears  
Like a reason to a rhyme  
Just when my hope was wearing thin  
You taught my heart to love again  
  
Like a miracle out of the blue  
You rescued me when I turned to You  
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies  
When You walked, when You walked into my life  
  
You spoke my name and the Word began again  
You touched my heart and it opened  
  
Like a miracle out of the blue  
You rescued me when I turned to You  
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies  
When You walked, when You walked into my life
