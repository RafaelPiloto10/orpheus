I'm going down  
I'm going, down, down, down  
Down, down  
Yes, I'm going down, yes  
I'm going down, down, down  
Down, down  
Yes, I've got my feet in the window  
Got my head on the ground  
  
Let me down  
And close that box car door  
Yes, let me down  
And close that box car door  
Well, I'm goin' back to Chattanooga  
And sleep on sister Irene's door  
  
Hey!  
  
Yes, I'm going down  
I'm going down  
I'm going, down, down, down  
Down, down  
  
Yes, I got my feet in the window  
I got my head on the ground
