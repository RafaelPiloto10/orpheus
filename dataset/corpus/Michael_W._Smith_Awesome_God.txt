When He rolls up His sleeves  
He ain't just putting on the ritz  
There's thunder in His footsteps  
And lightning in His fists  
The Lord wasn't joking  
When He kicked 'em out of Eden  
It wasn't for no reason  
That He shed His blood  
His return is very close  
And so you better be believing that  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
And when the sky was starless  
In the void of the night  
(God is an awesome God)  
He spoke into the darkness  
And created the light  
(God is an awesome God)  
Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom  
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross  
I hope that we have not  
Too quickly forgotten that  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God (Our God is an awesome God)  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
Our God is an awesome God (Our God is an awesome God)  
He reigns from heaven above (He reigns)  
With wisdom, power, and love (With wisdom and power)  
God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
Our God is an awesome God
