If I could catch a star before it touched the ground  
I'd place it in a box, tie ribbons all around  
And then I'd offer it to you  
A token of my love and deep devotion  
The world's a better place  
With you to turn to  
I'm a better man  
For having loved you  
  
And now, at last, I face the future unafraid  
With you here by my side, how fast the shadows fade  
And there is hope inside my heart  
Cause I have something wonderful to live for  
The world's a better place  
With you to turn to  
I'm a better man  
For having loved you  
  
And as I am today  
That's how 'll always stay  
A better man for having loved you  
A better man for having loved you  
  
The world's a better place  
With you to turn to  
I'm a better man  
For having loved you  
And as I am today  
That's how I'll always stay  
A better man for having loved you  
A better man for having loved you  
  
If I could catch a star before it touched the ground  
I'd place it in a box, tie ribbons all around  
And then I'd offer it to you
