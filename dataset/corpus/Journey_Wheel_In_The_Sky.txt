Winter is here again oh lord,  
Haven't been home in a year or more  
I hope she holds on a little longer  
Sent a letter on a long summer day  
Made of silver, not of clay  
I've been runnin' down this dusty road  
  
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'  
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow  
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'  
  
I've been trying to make it home  
Got to make it before too long  
I can't take this very much longer  
I'm stranded in the sleet and rain  
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again  
The mornin' sun is risin'  
It's kissin the day  
  
Oh the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'  
I don't' know where I'll be tomorrow  
Ooo the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
