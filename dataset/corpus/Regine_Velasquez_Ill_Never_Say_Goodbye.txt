I'll never say goodbye  
Composed by: Willy Cruz

Night after night we stay together  
Sharing moments that spell forever  
Day after day our love gets stronger  
Growing every minute as we get closer  
If we ever have to say goodbye  
And go our own separate ways  
I wouldn't know how to get by on my own  
After all the love and passion you have shown  
I'll never say goodbye  
No matter how they try  
To show me love  
That last if we're prisoners  
Caught in the past  
Don't let your tears run dry  
No need for you to cry  
I promise I will stay  
And with you all the way  
Our friends will soon forget  
That you and I once met  
As long as deep inside  
I know it's love not pride  
And I will never say  
Ever say goodbye  
I'll never say goodbye  
There are no reasons why  
Our souls are so entwined  
There is us, not you and I  
And time will soon regret  
Regretting we once met  
Because we'll show them all  
With love we can walk tall  
And we will never say  
Ever say goodbye  
I'll never say goodbye
