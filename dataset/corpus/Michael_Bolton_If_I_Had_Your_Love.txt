If I had my way  
Fly into the air  
You know I would  
And if I had my way  
Fly without a care  
You know I would  
And if I had your love  
If I only had your love  
There'd be no if I had's at all  
  
If there was a road  
Travel down that road  
To get to you  
If there was a mountain  
You know I'd climb that mountain, too  
'Cause if I had your love  
If I only had your love  
There's be no if I had's at all  
  
If I had your love  
If I only had your love  
There'd be no if I had's at all  
There'd be no if I had's at all  
If I had your love  
If I only had your love  
If I had your love  
If I only had your love
