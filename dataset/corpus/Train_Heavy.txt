Home all night, nothing's wrong  
Just my nature got me holding on too tight  
So, you say you're on the way  
Got me feelin' like I should be holdin' on this tight  
  
I'm heavy on my knees  
Oh my, slip and slide  
Hope they gonna make you feel  
Like someday I will, I know  
'Cause every girl I know has to go out to dance  
Before my butterfly has it's chance to fly, fly, fly, fly, fly  
  
And I know that I'll fall in too deep  
And you'll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away, fade away  
And I know that it won't take too long  
Before you find something wrong  
And fade away, fade away  
  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
  
Oh you, what you do?  
Seems you got me feelin' like you want me to  
Fade  
But it's all right, how we'll be  
Nothing that you want from me  
Fade  
  
And I know that I'll fall in too deep  
And you'll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away, fade away  
And I know that it won't take too long  
Before you go and find something wrong  
And fade away, fade away  
And I know that I'll fall in too deep  
And you'll wait till I fall asleep  
Before you fade away, fade away  
  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah  
I'm heavy on, I'm heavy on  
I'm heavy on my knees, yeah
