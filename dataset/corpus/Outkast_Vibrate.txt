[Chorus]  
Every boy and girl, woman and man  
When you feel you've done about the best you can  
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band  
Vibrate, vibrate higher (Repeat)  
  
Sometimes when it's late at night  
And you have no one to talk to  
Here's what you don', you go through that  
Raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times  
Tracy ain't home, Tina ain't home  
The Love Below start talkin' to ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The circumcision has already begun  
Desensitizing the very thing or thang that Brought you into this motherfucker
in the first place  
And when I say "motherfucker" I do mean "motherfucker"  
Because Mother Earth is dying  
And we continue to fuck her death  
Play with your own score sheet,  
Become the master of your own,  
And Yes, God is watching you  
But no need to be embarrassed  
For the future is in your hands,  
No the future is in your hand  
Play with your own score sheet  
  
[Chorus]
