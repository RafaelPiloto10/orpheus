Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar.  
Oh, don't ask why. Oh, don't ask why.  
'Cause I must find the next whiskey bar.  
If I don't find the next whiskey bar,  
I tell you I will die, I tell you I will die.  
I tell you, I tell you, I tell you I will die.  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama, so high up in the sky.  
I lost him, I lost my lover.  
I need a drink. Can you guess why?  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama, so high up in the sky.  
I lost him, I lost my lover.  
I need a drink, and you know why.  
I bet you know why. I bet you know why.
