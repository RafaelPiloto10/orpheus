My garden is filled with papayas and mangos  
My life is a mixture of reggaes and tangos  
Taste for the good life, I can live it no other way  
  
While out on the beach there are two empty chairs  
That say more than the people who ever sit there  
From under my lone palm I can look out on the day  
  
Where no bird flies by my window  
No ship is tied to my tree  
Love is a wave building to a crescendo  
Ride if you will, ride it with me  
  
I knew this girl made of memories and phrases  
Who lived her whole life in both chapters and stages  
Danced til the dawn, wished all her worries away  
  
Well she wasn't crazy no she wasn't mad  
She just wanted the father that she never had  
From under my lone palm I think about her today  
  
We sailed from the port of indecision  
Young and wild with oh so much to learn  
Days turn into years as we tried to fool our fears  
But to the port of indecision I returned  
  
My gardens are filled with papayas and mangos  
My life is a mixture of jingles and jangles  
Come Christmas winds and blow all my worries away  
  
Sing if you will and we'll sing to the sea
