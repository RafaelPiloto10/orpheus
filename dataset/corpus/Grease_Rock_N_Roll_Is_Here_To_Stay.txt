Rock 'n roll is here to stay, it will never die  
It was meant to be that way, though I don't know why  
I don't care what people say, rock 'n roll is here to stay  
(We don't care what people say, rock 'n roll is here to stay)  
  
Rock 'n roll will always be our ticket to the end  
It will go down in history, just you wait, my friend  
Rock 'n roll will always be, it'll go down in history  
(Rock 'n roll will always be, it'll go down in history)  
  
So come on, everybody rock, everybody rock, everybody rock, everybody rock  
Everybody rock  
Now everybody rock 'n roll, everybody rock 'n roll, everybody rock 'n roll  
Everybody rock 'n roll, everybody rock 'n roll  
  
Rock 'n roll will always be our ticket to the end  
It will go down in history, just you wait, my friend  
Rock 'n roll will always be, it'll go down in history  
  
If you don't like rock 'n roll, think what you've been missin'  
But if you like to bop and strawl, come on down and listen  
Let's all start to have a ball, everybody rock 'n roll  
  
Ah, oh baby, ah, oh baby, ah, oh baby, ah, oh baby, rock!
