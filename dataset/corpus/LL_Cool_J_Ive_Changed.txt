Just starin' at these four walls closin'  
In on me, feelin' like time's frozen  
Fadin' in and out, noddin' and dozin'  
Guilt tearin' up my brain like erosion  
What I did to you was wrong I admit it  
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'  
All alone in what used to be a home  
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in  
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'  
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron  
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through  
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you  
Talkin' slick like she ain't here  
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click  
I need to hit her with a brick  
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament  
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge  
With her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin' rain  
Whylin' out screamin' yo' name  
And keepin' ringin' yo' bell 'til you mad as hell  
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)  
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them  
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)  
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere  
And I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha  
To show you I changed shawty  
  
I seen you at the movies with some tall cat  
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat  
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that  
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?  
That's what I get for creepin' and crawlin'  
Every other weekend gone until the mornin'  
Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong  
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on  
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings  
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn  
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights  
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck  
That was the old me, the one I still regret  
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (I'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(i still love you!) [cars peel]  
  
I don't care if the cops got me surrounded  
Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in  
My mind's in an altered state  
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake  
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes  
I already played the fool when I let you escape  
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex  
Everything about you and yours connects  
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin  
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'  
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'  
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'  
Please find it in your heart to forgive me  
Realize only god can convict me  
We all make mistakes, so have you  
If god show mercy on me, then you should too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (i'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(I still love you!) ow!  
(I'm tellin' you I've changed)
