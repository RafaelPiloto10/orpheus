I've been down to the water  
I've been on top of the world  
Somebody should come and see me  
Somebody should give me the word  
  
'Cause I don't know how many more  
I don't know how many more  
I don't know how many more to see  
  
Sometimes the free thoughts clash  
Sometimes I see through the grass  
Sometime the light begins to dim  
Somebody should come and be me  
Somebody should come and free me  
  
'Cause I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more to see  
  
Oh darlin', darlin', I always want to see you  
Oh darlin', darlin', I always want to see you  
  
I cannot learn much more life  
I cannot see much more  
Somebody should stop the new sight  
Somebody should close the door  
  
'Cause I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more to see  
  
Wrapped in a blanket, lyin' in the snow  
Feelin' like the men felt a long time ago  
Goin' to find me a home, goin' to build it with my hands  
Can't you see there's food to be grown  
Got to dig up, dig up the land
