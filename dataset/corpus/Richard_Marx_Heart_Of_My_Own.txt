I can't go near the scent of flowers.  
I can't look at the sky.  
I can't turn on the radio  
And not cry.  
  
I wont watch lovers holding hands  
Or the sun sinking down.  
I can't look at a single thing in this town.  
  
You were playing a game and I,  
I lost count of the days and the nights.  
Do you know that you were my life?  
  
I'm tryin hard to find all that's left of me,  
Now that you left me alone.  
Tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
I have looked through every single book,  
Torn through every poem,  
Heard the words of every voice  
That I've known.  
  
How can you have such a hold on me,  
When youve already let go?  
You must have more power than I know.  
  
Woah.  
You were playing a game and I,  
I lost count of the days and the nights.  
Oh, did you know that you were my life? !  
  
I'm tryin hard to find all that's left of me,  
Now that you left me alone,  
I'm tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
You gave me heaven and showed me how to fly,  
Then laughed when I fell from the sky, yeah!  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
Tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
I'm tryin hard to find all that's left of me,  
Now that you left me alone,  
I'm tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
[repeat chorus]
