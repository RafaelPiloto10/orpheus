You were streets ahead, I couldn't sleep a wink  
Staring in the dark, by the light of your skin  
At myself sitting, on a suitcase  
Or as the sleeping youth, in the upset sleigh  
  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
They run with the weather  
They don't wait  
  
Listen, you can hear, the sound of the sleigh  
The panting of the team, of all runners away  
And all the gentle work, of the traces  
Their jingle-jangle jerk, destroying all space  
  
They won't wait  
They don't wait  
They run with the weather  
They don't wait  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
Just stay together  
They don't wait  
  
Wait, wait, wait, wait  
Please, just stay together  
  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
They run with the weather  
They don't wait  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
Just stay together  
They don't wait  
  
Wait, wait, wait, wait  
Please, just stay together
