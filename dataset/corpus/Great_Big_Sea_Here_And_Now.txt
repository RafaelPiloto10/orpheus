The sun must set to rise  
The light will leave your eyes again  
Then breaking like morning's dawn  
Does summer feel the winter come  
The hardest part of life  
Is to live while you're alive my friend  
So sing an unwritten song  
Or repent for the deeds you left undone  
This is Here  
This is Now  
It's the moment that we live for  
And we just can't live without  
It's all clear to me now  
We've already started dying  
And our time is running out  
Oh, Right Now  
Time is ours to steal  
She's a secret to reveal my friend  
And when your children have all grown  
You'll wait by the window  
And wish them all back home  
Walk a little further off the beaten path  
And we'll drive on even if we get there last  
Our backs against the wall  
And we will lunge and bite  
And we'll rage, rage, rage  
Against the dying of the light
