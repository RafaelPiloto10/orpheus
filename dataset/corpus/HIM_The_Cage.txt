For years I've seen you fighting  
Against your heart  
Living like you're dying  
So far from the sun  
  
Waiting for a guardian angel  
To lead you through the dangers  
That lie ahead on your way  
Towards tomorrows arms  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage  
  
We all have our fears but yours are  
The scariest of them all  
Lift your head and let us taste  
The horror you adore  
  
And it all starts to makes sense  
All the blood wisely shed  
Just wait until the cure comes knocking on your door  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage you're locked in  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage you've locked yourself in
