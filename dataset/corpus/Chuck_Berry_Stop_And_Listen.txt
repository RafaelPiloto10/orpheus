Stop and listen, I hear my baby call my name  
Stop and listen, I hear my baby call my name  
She don't call too loud, but she calls, ooh, nice and plain  
  
Stop and listen, before you make a start  
Stop and listen, before you make a start  
Because if you fall in love, it may break your heart  
  
I love my baby, I'll tell the world I do  
I love you, baby, I'll tell the world I do  
And they'll just have to stop and listen to everything for you
