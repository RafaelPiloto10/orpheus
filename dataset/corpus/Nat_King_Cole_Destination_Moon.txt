Come and take a trip in my rocket ship  
We'll have a lovely afternoon  
Kiss the world goodbye and away we fly  
  
Destination moon  
Travel fast as light 'til we're lost from sight  
The earth is like a toy balloon  
What a thrill you get ridin' on a jet  
  
Destination moon  
We'll go up up up up  
Straight to the moon we two  
High in the starry blue  
I'll be out of this world with you  
So away we steal in a space-mobile  
A supersonic honeymoon  
Leave your cares below, pull the switch, let's go!  
  
Destination moon  
There once was a time when the colorful thing to do  
Was to call for a date on a bicycle built for two  
But cars and trains and even planes  
  
All have had their day  
Now the time is due to call for you  
In the modern atomic way  
We'll go up up up up  
Straight to the moon we two  
High in the starry blue  
I'll be out of this world with you  
So away we steal in a space-mobile  
  
A supersonic honeymoon  
Leave your cares below, pull the switch, let's go!  
Destination moon
