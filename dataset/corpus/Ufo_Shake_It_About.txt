Little girl, you're so fine  
With that body you gotta be mine  
Was a brownie and I was a scout  
Baby I never knew how you shook it about  
Do me a good deed give me what I need  
If you move like that I?ll give you what's in store  
You won't come back asking me for more  
(II)..Too hot ain't slept so well  
Young boys troubles aren't doing me well  
Give me your kisses every night  
I want to shake you and hold you tight,  
I want to shake..  
  
Since I met you I ain't slept so well  
Young boy trouble aren't doing me well  
Give me your kisses every night  
I want to shake you and hold you tight  
Come on and shake, ah, ...shake...
