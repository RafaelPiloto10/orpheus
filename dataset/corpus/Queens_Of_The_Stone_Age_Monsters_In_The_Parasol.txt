The walls are closing in again, oh well  
The walls are closing in again, oh well  
I seen some thing I thought I never saw  
Covered in hair  
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well  
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well  
And my mind is out here on another wave  
Covered in hair  
  
She won't grow  
  
[Chorus]  
You've got a monster (distress) in your parasol (body out??)  
You've got a monster (dwarfs, doors?) in your parasol (of course)  
You've got a monster (displeasure) in your parasol (I told you??)  
You've got a monster ? in your parasol (x-nay?)  
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well  
  
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well  
I seen some things I thought I never saw  
Covered in hair  
  
She won't grow  
  
You've got a monster (distress, my pest?) in your parasol  
You've got a monster (dwarfs) in your parasol (war horse)  
You've got a monster (displeasure) in your parasol ?  
You've got a hole in you I never saw ?  
In your parasol, in your parasol
