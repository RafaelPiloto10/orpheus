Stretch the bones over my skin  
Stretch the skin over my head  
I'm going to the holy land  
Stretch the marks over my eyes  
Burn the candles deep inside  
Yeah you know where I'm coming from  
  
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me  
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me  
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it  
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you  
  
Slip down the darkness to the mouth  
Damn the water burn the wine  
I'm going home for the very last time  
  
So throw it away, you don't have to take me  
Make no mistakes I'm what you make me  
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it  
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you  
  
I see you turn around and burning down  
The feeling stars to sink  
I feel the hurt surround me  
Please dissolve me  
She's resolved to be  
  
Heal my wounds without a trace  
Seal my tomb without my face  
I'm going to the lonely place  
  
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me  
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me  
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it  
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
