Tonight will be for the first time  
I have learned what my lips are for  
And darling, now that I've kissed you  
I'm craving to kiss you more  
Let me tell you long after tonight is all over  
Long after tonight is all gone I?ll be yours  
Forever and a day and yours, come anything that may  
You'll always be just everything to me, yeah  
Here in my arms when I hold you  
I can feel that the world is mine  
Don't go away, don't you leave me  
Or I?ll cry ?til the end of time  
Let me tell you, long after tonight is all over  
Long after it?s all gone I?ll be yours  
Come anything that may and yours, forever and a day  
You'll always be just everything to me, yeah  
Let me tell you long after tonight is all over  
Long after it?s all gone I?ll be yours  
Forever and a day and yours, come anything that may  
You'll always be just everything to me, yeah  
Long after tonight is all over  
Long after tonight is all over  
After it?s over and done, yeah  
After it?s over and done, hey, boy, yeah  
After it?s gone, hey, yeah after it?s gone
