You - have got everything I need  
You - can bring my soul out of me  
I'll pay your wicked price-deliver your merchandise  
Gypsy you'll drive me a dream  
  
Acid Queen  
  
Wild - tames the raging beast  
Child - helps the blind to see  
Demon controls my mind - leaves the real world behind  
Mould me a purgatory scene  
  
Acid Queen  
  
Acid Queen...  
  
Can you hear me - I said get out of here you..  
  
Witch - now you've given all you've got  
Bitch - thought you'd left me here to rot  
You're coming down and fast - you've tripeed your very last  
I'll take your place and sing  
  
Acind King
