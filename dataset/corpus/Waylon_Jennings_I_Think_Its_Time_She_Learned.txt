How many times must I tell her  
How many times must I say  
I won't be around to pick her up again  
From now on she'll have to find her own way.  
  
How many years have I loved her  
While she stood by so unconcerned  
But the things she don't know I'll teach her when I go  
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
I think it's time she learned  
Love can't live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
I think it's time she learned  
Love can't live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned
