Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
Blinded by science, where do I belong?  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
I worry 'bout the world that we live in  
I'm worried by all the confusion  
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading  
I wonder where this madness is leading  
  
Is this a road going nowhere?  
Or is someone leading us somewhere?  
I can't believe we're here for no reason  
There must be something we can believe in  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm not an appliance, so don't turn me on  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
I worry 'bout the world that we live in  
I'm worried by all the confusion

I wonder where this madness is leading

I'm not an appliance, don't turn me on  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm blinded by science, on the run
