It's high time for a walk on the real side  
Let's admit the bastards beat us  
I move to dissolve the corporation  
In a pool of margaritas  
So let's switch off all the lights  
And light up all the Luckies  
Crankin' up the afterglow  
Cause we're goin' out of business  
Everything must go  
  
Talk about your major pain and suffering  
Now our self-esteem is shattered  
Show the world our mighty hidey-ho face  
As we go sliding down the ladder  
It was sweet up at the top  
'Til that ill wind started blowing  
Now it's cozy down below  
Cause we're goin' out of business  
Everything must go  
  
We gave it our best shot  
But keep in mind we got a lot  
The sky the moon good food and the weather  
First-run movies, does anybody get lucky twice?  
Wouldn't it be nice  
  
Tell me can you dig it Miss Fugazy  
Now it's gone from late to later  
Frankly I could use a little face time  
In the service elevator  
And if Dave from Acquisitions  
Wants to get in on the action  
With his Handicam in tow  
Well we're goin' out of business  
Everything must go  
  
Can it be the sorry sun is rising  
Guess it's time for us to book it  
Talk about the famous road not taken  
In the end we never took it  
And if somewhere on the way  
We got a few good licks in  
No one's ever gonna know  
Cause we're goin' out of business  
Everything must go
