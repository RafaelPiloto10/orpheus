You don't love me no more  
Get out my life woman  
You don't love me no more  
Get out my life woman  
You don't love me no more  
  
Get out my eyes teardrops  
I got to see my way around  
Get out my eyes teardrops  
I got to see my way around  
Get out my life, heartaches  
Nothin' but heartaches by the pound  
  
Get off my ladder, woman  
I got to climb up to the top  
Get off my ladder, woman  
There is nothin that can make me stop  
  
Get out the way, woman  
I got to be movin' on  
Get out the way, woman  
I got to be movin' on  
Get out the way, woman  
I got to be movin' on  
  
I'm sorry I've got leave you
