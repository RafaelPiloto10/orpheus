Aren't you the girl who used to call me names?  
Aren't you the girl who used to play at games?  
Weren't you the one who said she'd never fall?  
Now you're the one who's cryin' not so tall  
Oh, I know what it's like  
It's happened many times to me  
Oh, do you ache inside  
Do your eyes want a cry?  
Do you want me back again?  
Yes you're the one  
Shall I throw you a crumb?  
Shall I come and pass you by?  
Would that make you want to try?  
Shall I come and kiss your lips?  
Would that make your rain slip?  
Shall I come and dry your eyes?  
Will that make you realize?  
Oh, I know what it's like  
It's happened many times to me  
Oh, do you ache inside  
Do your eyes want a cry?  
Do you want me back again?  
Aren't you the girl who used to call me names?  
Aren't you the girl who used to play at games?  
Weren't you the one who used to run and hide?  
Now you're the one who's cryin' way inside  
Oh, I know what it's like  
It's happened many times to me  
Oh, do you ache inside  
Do your eyes want a cry?  
Do you want me back again?
