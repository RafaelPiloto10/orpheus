It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me  
Its so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be  
But there are facts in our lives that we can never change  
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same  
This perfect romance that I created in my mind  
I'd live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side  
And yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance  
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be  
I just believe that somehow it wasnt meant for me  
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain  
And I don't think that I could face it all again  
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about  
A deeper love I found and you and I no longer doubt  
You touhced my heart and it altered every plan I made  
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
I locked away my heart but you just set it free  
Emotions I felt held me back from what my life should be  
I pushed you far away and yet you stayed with me  
I guess this means that you and me were meant to be  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
