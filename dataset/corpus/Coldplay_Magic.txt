Call it magic, call it true  
I call it magic when I'm with you  
And I just got broken, broken into two  
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you  
  
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Call it magic, cut me into two  
And with all your magic, I disappear from view  
And I can't get over, can't get over you  
Still, I call it magic, such a precious truth  
  
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
No I don't, it's true  
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't  
Want anybody else but you  
  
Wanna fall, I fall so far  
I wanna fall, fall so hard  
And I call it magic  
And I call it true  
Call it magic  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
And if you were to ask me  
After all that we've been through  
"Still believe in magic?"  
Well yes, I do  
Oh yes, I do  
Oh yes, I do  
Oh yes, I do  
Of course I do
