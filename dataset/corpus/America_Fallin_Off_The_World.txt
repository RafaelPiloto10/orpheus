Found on perspective.  
Each time I call you I feel my heart beat  
I want to be there walkin' up your street  
It doesn't matter how far I travel  
Crossin' the ocean, the golden gravel  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you  
Tomorrow's headline, read all about it  
They caught the big one and I don't doubt it  
Across the country they're paintin' stories  
About our failures, about our glories  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you  
All of those screams of each other must share in the fight  
Nobody knows where their clear spirit goes in the night  
Out of the country it seems so easy  
To keep believin' our dream of fiji  
Your image lingers, a faded picture  
Your past erased by untold elixir  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you  
All of those screams of each other must share in the fight  
Nobody knows where their clear spirit goes in the night  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world
