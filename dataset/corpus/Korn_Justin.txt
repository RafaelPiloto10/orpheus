Fuck all that bullshit!  
You watch me play.  
I look away.  
Your lights turn bright.  
You found the light.  
Take, up in space.  
You and I.  
Take, up in space.  
You and I.  
  
You're gonna die!  
What made me whine?  
I wish I hadn't drank.  
Inside your soul escapes.  
  
Take, up in space.  
You and I.  
Take, up in space.  
You and I.  
  
Cry, into me.  
Hold me something alright  
The kids that die listening to me.  
You are alive!  
  
Take, up in space.  
You and I stay  
Take, up in space.  
You and I.  
Take, up in space.  
You and I.
