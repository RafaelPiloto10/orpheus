Be Careful, It's My Heart  
Bing Crosby  
Words and music by Irving Berlin  
-From the musical "Holiday Inn"  
Sweetheart of mine, I've sent you a valentine.  
Sweetheart of mine, it's more than a valentine.  
Be careful, it's my heart.  
It's not my watch you're holding, it's my heart.  
It's not the note I sent you that you quickly burned.  
It's not the book I lent you that you never returned.  
Remember it's my heart.  
The heart with which so willingly I part.  
It's yours to take to keep or break,  
But please, before you start,  
Be careful, it's my heart.  
From: Gloria "Montcomags"
