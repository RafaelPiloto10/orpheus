Everybody thought this was  
  
Going to be one more freakshow  
  
Everybody thought this was going  
  
To be one more of those jokes  
  
  
  
Chorus:  
  
It's another world  
  
It's a wild world  
  
It's another world  
  
It's a wild world  
  
  
  
My generation's not going to see  
  
Year two thousand fifteen  
  
I live out at sea to save  
  
My life from the H.I.V.  
  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
No one knows what's going on  
  
Cause the world is on fire  
  
The word is out the people are  
  
Down and we're on the run  
  
Is it justice from heaven,  
  
Or sent from hell  
  
The world is on fire babe  
  
Something is going on  
  
And I'm really scared  
  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Everybody thought this was  
  
Going to be one more freakshow  
  
Everybody thought this was going  
  
To be one more of those jokes  
  
  
  
Rub our face into the dirt  
  
Til the fire is over  
  
I've been to the edge and  
  
There I stood 'n' looked down  
  
Living in a world  
  
We never made  
  
But is it too late now?  
  
Something is going on  
  
And I'm really scared  
  
  
  
Chorus
