My love  
Paints the desert sky  
My love  
Walks the hundredth mile  
  
My love  
Has an angel's smile  
My love  
My love  
Want to lose my mind inside your head  
  
My love  
Is a purifier  
My love  
Is my one desire  
  
My love  
Always walks the earth  
My love  
My love  
  
Want to lose my mind inside your bed  
Want to lose it  
Want to lose it  
Want to lose myself in your bed  
  
Yeah!
