Sherry can you come out tonight  
(Come,come, come out tonight)  
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)  
Sherry can you come out tonight  
  
(Why don't you come out) To my twist party  
(Come out) Where the bright moon shines  
(Come out) We'll dance the night away  
I'm gonna make you mine  
  
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)  
Sherry can you come out tonight  
(Come, come, come out tonight)  
  
You better ask your Mama (Sherry baby)  
Tell her everything is alright  
  
(Why don't you come out) With your red dress on  
(Come out) Mmm you look so fine  
(Comeout) Move it nice and easy  
Girl, you make me lose my mind
