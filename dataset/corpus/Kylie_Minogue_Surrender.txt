Come on come one  
Ooh yeah  
Ooh oh  
Come to me  
  
And I'll surrender my love to you  
Give in to your dreams  
And remember my love is true  
Come, we'll explore  
Forbidden passions together  
  
Oh baby  
I surrender my love to you (surrender)  
Oh baby  
Just remember my love is true (surrender)  
  
Just remember, just remember  
Time is right to be together  
My love with you (surrender)  
Not just for one night but forever (surrender)  
  
Come, take my hand  
Let me show you everything  
  
Oh baby  
I surrender my love to you (surrender)  
Oh baby  
Just remember my love is true (surrender)  
  
Oh, hold me close  
And we can ride together  
Oh, you and I lust to love  
Magic moments forever  
  
Come to me  
Come come come to me (surrender)  
Come to me  
Come come come to me  
  
(Surrender my love surrender)  
Oh baby

Oh baby  
Just remember my love is true (surrender)
