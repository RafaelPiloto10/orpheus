My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe  
  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I give for you  
My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything  
My heart I can't control, you ruin my very soul  
My hopes, my prayers, my schemes  
You are my everything, but it's only make believe  
  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe
