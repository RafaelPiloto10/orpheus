You were lonely and you needed a friend  
And he was there at the right time with the right smile  
Just a shoulder to lean on  
Someone to tell you it'll all work out alright  
  
Don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
Don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
You can look at him the way you did me  
And hold him close say you're never letting go  
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself  
But you ain't fooling me  
  
So don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back  
And don't take my pictures off a' the wall  
Oh, did you hear me?  
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back  
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life  
And just give me one more chance  
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right  
  
Cause I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely  
But hoping you could be strong  
But could you look at me straight  
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?  
  
So don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
Well he's gonna try to make it work for you  
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this  
But whatever you do  
Think about me and don't be fooled by his kiss  
  
And don't let him steal your heart away  
Please, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back  
And don't take my pictures off a' your wall  
Oh, did you hear me?  
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back  
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life  
And just give me one more chance  
I'll show you I'm right  
You know I'm right  
  
You were lonely and you needed a friend  
And he was there at the right time with the right smile  
Just a shoulder to lean on  
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be alright  
But he's no good for you  
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this  
And whatever you do  
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss
