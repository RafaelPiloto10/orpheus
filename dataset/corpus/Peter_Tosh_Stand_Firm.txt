Live clean  
Let your works be seen  
Stand firm  
Or you gonna feed worm  
[Chorus:]  
One baldhead tell me say  
This here baldhead tell me say  
Put one me clothes and come with him  
And mek we go to church Sunday  
Soul seekers I say  
Jacket and tie come tell me say  
Clean clothes come tell me say  
If me come with him  
And go to church this Sunday  
Soul seekers I say  
Chorus  
This here one come tell I say  
Another one come tell I say  
If you want to be saved son  
Got to go in a grave son  
Pack of bullshit  
That is bullshit I say  
The other one come tell I say  
If you want to be in the light son  
You've got to love Jesus Christ son  
That is fantasy  
Whole pack of ignorance I say  
Chorus  
Then the parson tell I say  
If I want to be pure within  
I've got to come confess my sins  
Another pirate I say  
Chorus  
This here one come tell I say  
Do you think it is wised  
That I should get baptized  
But when I realized  
It was the devil in disguise  
This here one come tell I say  
Another one come tell I say  
To be in the light  
Got to take Jesus Christ  
You're talkin' like gladness  
But that is madness I say  
Chorus
