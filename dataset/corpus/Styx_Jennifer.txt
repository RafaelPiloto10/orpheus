Jennifer  
She drinks her sherry wine  
She keeps her lady's love for me all the time  
She's seventeen, barely old enough to cry  
A child in her father's eyes  
A woman every night  
  
Her love,  
Gives me the power  
Her dreams carry me on  
Jennifer, so inviting  
That I sing  
  
Jennifer  
She took me by surprise  
She told me that she's much too young to keep me satisfied  
Jennifer, ah so delicate and shy  
A child in her mother's eyes but  
A woman every night  
  
Her love,  
Gives me the power  
Her dreams carry me on  
Jennifer, so inviting  
That I sing
