Hate, lust, soul, rage  
You're so full of hate, you're so full of lust  
You're so full of soul, you're so full of rage  
Spirit of the age  
Here comes the voodoo king, here comes a powerful man  
My face on every front page, my plans for everyone  
I reason your existence, that is what I want to be  
Your whore and your messiah if you believe in me  
I'm not a true creator, I'm just a cheap reflection  
I'm the impersonator of anyone's conception  
But if you read my lips just on your own behalf  
I'll be a remedy not just an epitaph  
You're so full of hate, you need a vacation  
So full of lust, you need liberation  
You need damnation, you need salvation  
You're so full of hate  
Spirit of the age  
Here comes the new religion of everything you are  
My sword is your conviction, my voice your media  
I'm here to justify you, that's what I want to do  
I don't believe in visions but I believe in you  
Here comes the voodoo king, here comes a powerful man  
My face on every front page, my plans for everyone  
I'm here to satisfy you, that's what I want to be  
Your whore and your messiah if you believe in me  
You're so full of crime, you wipe out a nation  
So full of sex, you're a sensation  
You need damnation, you need salvation  
You're so full of fear  
You're so full of hate, you need a vacation  
So full of lust, you need liberation  
You need damnation, you need salvation  
You're so full of hate  
Spirit of the age
