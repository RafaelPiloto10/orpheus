Jump back, tell a friend  
Ooh, la, la, la  
Ooh, la, la, la  
Ooh, la, la, la  
I want a movie moment  
We're so in love it hurts  
And I'd be the main attraction  
Everybody's favorite girl  
Wanna be in Gucci dresses  
I know you like that style  
Symphony of stars to serenade us  
I'm giving you my smile  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
I'm gonna be here  
So cover me  
Run into you in slow motion  
Thunder claps and pouring rain  
The world is falling down around us  
We didn't notice anyway  
Wanna be in Gucci dresses  
I know you like that style  
Symphony of stars to serenade us  
I'm giving you my smile  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
I'm gonna be here  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
My love is for real  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
I'm gonna be here  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
My love is for real
