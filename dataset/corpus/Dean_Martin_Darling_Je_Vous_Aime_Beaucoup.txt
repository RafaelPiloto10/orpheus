Darling, je vous aime beaucoup  
Je ne sais pas what you do  
You know you've completely  
Stolen my heart  
  
Morning, noon and nighttime too  
Toujours, wondering what to do  
That's the way I've felt  
Right from the start  
  
Ah, Cherie  
My love for you is tres, tres fort  
Wish my French were good enough  
I'd tell you so much more  
  
But I hope that you compree  
All the things you mean to me  
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup  
I love you, yes I do  
  
Wish my French were good enough  
I'd tell you so much more  
But I hope that you compree  
All the things you mean to me  
  
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup  
I love you, yes I do
