Hey baby, it's beginning to feel  
Like we've been spinning our wheels  
Hangin' round this town too long  
Why don't we catch a ride  
Sail away on the outbound tide  
It's time that we be movin' on  
Let's catch the next dream outta here  
Close our eyes and disappear  
We'll say so long and we'll be gone  
On the next dream outta here  
Were as free as the night is young  
To go as far as our hearts can run  
Let's set our sights on paradise  
Throw caution to the wind  
And never look back again  
We'll ride our love on through the night  
Chorus  
We'll say so long  
And we'll be gone  
On the next dream outta here  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
Just close your eyes  
And we can ride  
Oooohhhoawhooo  
On the next dream  
On the next dream outta here  
We can ride  
Oooohhhoawhooo
