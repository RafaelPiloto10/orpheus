Scream until you like it  
  
Come on in! ha ha ha  
  
Come on in, no this ain't no dream  
Better hold on tight things ain't what they seem, no no no  
Don't be afraid if your heart's burning ready to go  
Well I love it when I scare you so  
From your head down to your oh!  
  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
Get ready to rock  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
  
I'm sending out little boys to play  
You know a trick like that could really make my day ha ha ha  
My little killers are ready to take you away  
Well, I love it when I scare ya so  
From your head down to your oh!  
  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
Get ready to rock  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
  
Come on in, no this ain't no dream  
Better hold on tight things ain't what they seem, no no no  
Don't be afraid if your heart's burning ready to go  
Well I love it when I scare you so  
From your head down to your oh!  
  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it  
Get ready to rock  
Scream until ya like it  
Never gonna stop  
Scream until ya like it
