If you're down and confused  
And you don't remember who you're talkin' to  
Concentration slip away  
'Cause your baby is so far away.  
  
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you can't be with the one you love  
Love the one you're with  
  
Love the one you're with  
Don't be angry, don't be sad,  
Don't sit cryin' over good things you've had,  
There's a girl right next to you  
  
And she's just waiting for something you do.  
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you can't be with the one you love  
  
Love the one you're with  
Love the one you're with  
Turn your heartache right into joy  
She's a girl, you're a boy,  
  
Get it together make it nice  
Ain't gonna need anymore advice.  
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
  
And if you can't be with the one you love  
Love the one you're with  
Love the one you're with
