If God had long hair  
And a goatee,  
And if his eyes looked pretty glazed...  
If He looked spaced out  
Would you buy his story?  
Would you believe he had an eye infection?  
And yeah, yeah, God he looks baked  
And yeah, yeah, God He smells good,  
And yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah...  
What if God smoked cannabis?  
Hit the bung like some of us?  
Drove a tie-dyed microbus,  
And he subscribed to Rolling Stone?  
When God made this place,  
In the beginning,  
Did He plant any seeds?  
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve,  
So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake  
Was always offering?  
And yeah, yeah... God rolls great,  
And yeah, yeah, God he smells good,  
And yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah...  
What if God smoked cannabis?  
Do you suppose he had a buzz  
When he made the platypus  
When he created earth, our home?  
Does He like Pearl Jam or the Stones?  
And do you think He rolls His own  
Up there in heaven on the throne?  
And when the saints go marching home,  
Does he just sit and smoke a bone
