The mother of all that is evil  
Her lips are poisonous venom  
Wicked temptress knows how to please  
The priestess roars, "Get down on your knees"  
The rite of the praying mantis  
Kiss the bones of enchantress  
Spellbound searching through the night  
A howling man surrenders the fight  
One look in her lusting eyes  
Savage fear in you will rise  
Teeth of terror sinking in  
The bite of the she-wolf  
My desires of flesh obey me  
The lioness will enslave me  
Another heart beat my own  
The sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned  
Beware what stalks you in the night  
Beware the she-wolf and her bite  
Her mystic lips tell only lies  
Her hidden will to kill in disguise
