Cause I get allot of that(I get allot of that)  
Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that(if you get a lot of that) I
get allot of that  
Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Let's talk about hate cause I get allot of that  
Talk about money cause I get allot of that  
(I get allot of that, I get allot of that, I get allot of that,)  
Cause I get allot of that  
  
This can't be it man this shit is stress full  
Is that what it is I'm just successful,  
Maybe I'm to good to hood low down no good  
I just keep shit real just like you should,  
Twist my fingers throw up my hood  
Let's get this money I know I would  
I know that's right but still we do wrong  
J-bo got 30 but still we moved on  
Get them clamps out  
Get my groove on  
I stay iced out  
Get my cool on  
Best be cool homes  
Get my goon on  
I'll bust them to homes  
Get my lose on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say young fell off yeah the boy done lost it  
Been porting all my life baby I'm just exhausted  
I take a Gatorade break to get everything straight  
Now I'm sitting here like how much Gatorade make  
How much money would it take to make some mo money  
Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo from me  
I sold millions made them millions  
But still yaw doubt me what's this with out me  
Can't be that bad still got my trap swag  
And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag  
Money in trash bags  
I call that garbage  
20 thousand a trash bag  
It looks like garbage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get allot of that allot of this  
I need allot of it  
Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it  
That money be Ludacris  
It just might shock you  
If you can't find Chaka then my right hands keep it  
Look I am simply on of the best  
Can't even lie i can't vouch for the depressed  
Just like zip-lock they get killed in the plastic  
Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic  
I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic  
When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic  
They say that I'm difficult even different  
Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference  
  
[Chorus]
