Sylvie  
I'm so hot'n dry  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Can't you hear,  
Can't you hear me crying?  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
Sylvie says she loves me  
But I believe she lies  
She hasn't been to see me  
Since the last day in july  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
I'm so hot'n dry  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Can't you hear  
Can't you hear me crying  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
She brought me a little coffee  
She brought me a little tea  
Well, she brought me nearly every damned thing  
But she didn't bring the jailhouse key  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
I'm so hot'n dry  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Little drink of water  
Wouldn't statisfy me  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
Took a look ayonder  
What is that I see?  
Well I thought it was little Sylvie  
Hopprunning there for me  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
I'm so hot and dry  
Sylvie  
Sylvie  
Can't you hear  
Can't you hear me crying?  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Bring me little water out  
Bring me little water, Sylvie  
Every little once in a while  
Every little once in a while  
Every  
Little once  
In a while  
Sylvie
