Sain y niwl,  
Gaunt y goydwig fwsog,  
Gwenithfaen, cen y coed, a'r lleuad,  
Un gway f'adenydd I dapestri bywyd  
  
Light shines bright beyond all the cities of gold  
On a road of bird song and chocolate shops  
Of buskers, jugglers, innkeeper's welcoming call  
The sound of mist, smell of moss-grown woods  
  
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns  
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild  
Weaving my world into tapestry of life  
Its fire, golden, in my Walden  
  
I will taste the manna in every tree  
Liquid honey and wine from the distant hills  
An early morning green wood concerto  
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice  
  
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns  
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild  
Weaving my world into a tapestry of life  
It's fire, golden, in my Walden  
  
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns  
Flying higher, higher, higher into the wild  
Weaving my world into a tapestry of life  
It's fire, golden, in my Walden  
  
Weaving my wings from many colored yarns  
Flying higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher,
higher  
  
I do not wish to evade the world  
Yet I will forever build my own  
  
Forever build my own  
Forever my home
