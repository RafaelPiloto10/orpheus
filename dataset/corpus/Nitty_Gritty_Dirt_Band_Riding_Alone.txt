Well, she saved him from whiskey,  
Was his constant companion.  
You'd see them out riding at dawn.  
  
She gave him his reasons  
To shoulder the seasons,  
But now when you see him  
He's riding alone.  
  
She lay down beside him  
To touch him and guide him,  
Turn 'round his head  
On the darkest of days.  
  
He still sits beside her,  
Remembers her smiling  
And whisper to him  
That old song he would play.  
  
Please lay down beside me,  
I love you.  
  
Never wanted to bid this adieu.  
No red river ever ran deeper  
Than an old cowboy love,  
Than an old cowboy love that runs true.
