Oh you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's a makin' a list checkin' in twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping he knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake  
  
Oh you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and a little toy drums  
A root a toot toot and a rum a tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo  
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
The kids and girls in boyland will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree

So you better watch out you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm tellin' you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Yeah Santa Claus is comin' to town Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' Santa Claus is comin'  
Santa Claus is comin' Santa Claus is comin'
