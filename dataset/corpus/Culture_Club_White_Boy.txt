Black boys employ Selassie  
We kiss, we define  
White hands, white hearts  
The gender  
How can I make you mine  
  
Take me to God  
In a world of blank kisses  
Who breaks the colors  
I know what this is  
A one man show  
That's how we know  
That's how we know  
Your white does the blood flow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your white dance like an enemy  
Your white dance like an enemy  
Your white dance like an enemy  
  
White boys fall out  
In a whirl of decisions  
Show me what is  
Then show me what isn't  
A heart too slow  
That's how we know  
That's how we know  
Your white does the blood flow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're so white  
You're so white  
White boy [Repeat: x6]  
  
White boy dance  
Do something sweet  
Like pull my heart  
Like use your feet  
Like steal some culture  
Let's fake this dance  
A white boy kiss  
A white boy chance  
Don't take me over  
Abuse my heart  
When I change color, I'm here, stop, start  
  
Hey devil kiss me  
I'm taking chances  
Not faking my culture  
The rhythm it dances  
I love your wisdom  
I love your mind  
White boys are babies (not my kind)  
This lust in fashion  
That's my sin  
By falling out  
We're falling in  
Now I'm broken  
Watch it flow  
I'm taking over  
Can't let go (falling out with the bad boys)
