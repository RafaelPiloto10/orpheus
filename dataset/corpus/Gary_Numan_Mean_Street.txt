My friends have  
Been demoted to  
Stay  
Second class  
  
Someone tells me  
Reliable  
Big brother will  
Never last  
  
Seems like I  
Outgrew my station  
Sweet young boys turning green  
This is for your information  
  
Mean Street I'd love to see you cry  
Mean Street I'd love to see you die  
Mean Street I really don't know why  
Mean Street you let me down  
  
Look at him  
Taking all our glory  
Let's kick him out  
  
'Who will say?'  
'Don't look at me'  
'He'll find out in a roundabout way'  
  
We don't owe him anything  
We don't need him anymore  
Drop him cold now spread the lies  
No-one even said goodbye
