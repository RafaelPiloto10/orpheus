Did you ever get the feeling that you were all alone  
And no one ever knew you and you never had a home  
And the lights and the colors do their best to distract you  
Fuck you. I don't even know why I like you  
It's all a blur [x2]  
Like a picture,it's all a blur  
You don't know what you're missing  
You don't know what you're missing  
I've been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But it's impossible to watch you fade away  
Did you ever stop believing after all was said and done?  
When you turned to your friends but they were long gone  
And the sky and the snapshots remind you  
I trust you and I'm always going to miss you  
It's all a blur, it's all a blur  
Like a picture  
Reminds me who you were  
[Repeat Chorus]  
Every time I see you look at me  
I see those distant eyes and your looks are fading  
Every time you're next to me  
I want to talk and feel and act like we used to  
Cause everybody knows and everybody cares  
Until they're walking in my shoes  
And now I know  
It's you that I cannot lose  
It's all a blur  
And I owe you  
You can take it all  
When I call, pick up the phone like you used to  
It's all a blur  
Like a picture  
It's all a blur  
You're just a blur!  
I've been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But it's impossible to watch you fade away  
Trying, dying so hard  
I've been denying that I'm not scarred  
I've been crying, lying so far  
But it's impossible to fill this space  
Impossible to take your place  
Impossible to watch you fade away  
Watch you fade away [x3]
