Everybody got somebody  
Trying to make you feel real bad  
Ain't' none of their business  
Talking behind your back  
Be strong in yourself  
Stand up, walk away  
Nobody gives a damn for a  
Single thing you say  
  
I'm singing  
Stay on top, never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top, never go under  
Hold on tight  
Here comes the thunder  
  
Hide money in your pocket  
Be nobody's fool  
Always think of number one  
That's my golden rule  
Take care of business  
Go for it with the best  
Be strong enough to take it  
Ain't no need to rest  
  
I'm singing  
Stay on top, never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top, never go under  
Hold on tight  
Watch out for the thunder  
  
Bad times make you cry  
But the good times get you high  
  
I can't stand it  
I can't stand it no more  
  
Somebody, everybody  
Trying to make you feel real bad  
Ain't' nobody's business  
Talking behind your back  
Be strong in yourself  
Stand up, walk away  
Nobody's gonna listen  
To a single word you say  
  
Stay on top, never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top, never go under  
Hold on tight  
Look out for the thunder  
  
Stay on top  
You've got to stay on top  
Stand up and sing it  
Stay on top  
Take care of business  
Stay on top
