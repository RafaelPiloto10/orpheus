In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia  
Down in the dark of the Cumberland Mine  
There's blood on the coal and the miners lie  
In the roads that never saw sun nor sky.  
In the roads that never saw sun nor sky.  
  
In the town of Springhill, you don't sleep easy  
Often the earth will tremble and roar  
When the earth is restless, miners die  
Bone and blood is the price of coal.  
Bone and blood is the price of coal.  
  
In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia  
Late in the year of fifty-eight  
Day still comes and the sun still shines  
(But it's) Dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine.  
(But it's) Dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine.  
  
Down at the coal face, miners working  
Rattle of the belt and the cutter's blade  
Rumble of the rock and the walls closed round  
(The) Living and the dead men two miles down.  
(The) Living and the dead men two miles down.  
  
Twelve men lay two miles from the pit shaft  
Twelve men lay in the dark and sang  
Long hot days in the miners tomb  
(It was) Three feet high and a hundred long.  
(It was) Three feet high and a hundred long.  
  
Three days past and the lamps gave out  
And Caleb Rushton got up and and said  
There?s no more water, or light, or bread  
(So we'll) Live on song and hope instead.  
(So we'll) Live on song and hope instead.  
  
Listen for the shouts of the barefaced miners  
Listen through the rubble for a rescue team  
Six hundred feet of coal and slag  
Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam.  
Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam.  
  
Eight days passes and some were rescued  
Leaving the dead to lie alone  
Through all their lives they dug their grave  
Two miles of earth for a marking stone.  
Two miles of earth for a marking stone.
