Well your CD collection looks shiny and costly.  
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?  
And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket?  
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket?  
  
Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs  
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.  
And how much did you pay for your rock'n'roll t shirt  
That proves you were there  
  
That you heard of them first?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
  
Ah, tell me.  
How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar,  
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?  
And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar,  
  
One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?  
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?  
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.  
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?  
  
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.  
Aging black leather and hospital bills,  
Tattoo removal and dozens of pills.  
Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments,  
  
But rock on completely with some brand new components.  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?  
  
Excess ain't rebellion.  
You're drinking what they're selling.  
Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them.  
Your chaos won't convert them.  
  
They're so happy to rebuild it.  
You'll never really kill it.  
Yeah, excess ain't rebellion.  
You're drinking what they're selling.  
  
Excess ain't rebellion.  
You're drinking,  
You're drinking,  
You're drinking what they're selling.
