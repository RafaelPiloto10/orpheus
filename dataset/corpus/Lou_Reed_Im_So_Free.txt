Yes I am mother nature's son  
And I'm the only one  
I do what I want and I want what I see  
Huh, could only happen to me  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Oh, please, Saint Germaine  
I have come this way  
Do you remember the shape I was in  
I had horns that bent  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Do you remember the silver walks  
You used to shiver and I used to talk  
Then we went down to Times Square  
And ever since I've been hanging around there  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Yes I am mother nature's son  
And I'm the only one  
I do what I want and I want what I see  
Could only happen to me  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Early in the morning, I'm so free  
Late in the evening, I'm so free  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free  
When I feel good, I'm so free  
When it's in the morning, I'm so free  
When it's in the evening, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
Feel so good, now, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Feel so good, now, I'm so free  
Feel little nice, I'm so free  
Feel little down, now, I'm so free  
You're so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free
