The things that I love  
I hold dear to my heart  
They are borrowed and  
Not mine at all  
Jesus only let me use them  
To brighten my life  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then  
Show me where you brought me from and  
Where I could have been  
Just remember I'm a human and human's forget  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
Nothing good have I done  
To deserve God's own Son  
I'm not worthy of the scars  
In His hands  
Yet he chose the road to Calvary  
To die in my stead  
Why He loved me I can't understand  
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then  
Show me where you brought me from and  
Where I could have been  
Just remember I'm a human and human's forget  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
Just remember I'm a human and human's forget  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord
