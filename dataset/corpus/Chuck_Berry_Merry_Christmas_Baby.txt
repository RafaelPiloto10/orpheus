Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice  
Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice  
Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas, now I'm living in paradise  
Well, I'm feelin', mighty fine, I got good music on my radio  
Well, I feel so fine, I got good music on my radio  
Yes, I want to hug and kiss you baby  
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe.  
  
Santa came down the chimney, 'bout a half past three  
Left all these pretty presents that you see before me  
Merry Christmas baby, you really been good to me.  
  
I will always love you baby  
Now I'm happy as I can be.
