You won't regret falling, the bruises you get falling, will all fade away  
Don't analyse falling, don't try being wise, falling  
Forget all your plans, they're out of your hands  
You're falling, falling, falling  
  
Blindly you go falling, the last one to know you're falling, you suddenly see  
There's no way to fight falling, no rescue in sight, you're falling  
You let love inside and hope she'll abide, you're falling, falling, falling  
  
The world that you face is some other planet in space  
You taste something new every moment  
It thrills you, fills you, you're falling  
  
I have to defend falling, 'cause if you should end falling  
I hope you'll be free to spend time with me  
Falling, falling, falling, just falling, falling, falling  
Falling, falling, falling
