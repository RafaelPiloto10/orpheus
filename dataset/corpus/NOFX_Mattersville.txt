There's a place where some of us choose to live  
A gated community cops can't come in  
A neighborhood for punks over the hill  
We're spendin' our golden years in Mattersville  
  
We can do whatever we want whenever we please  
There's always a keg of beer and a block of cheese  
We got charams, pinball, asteroids, space invaders and missile command  
  
We will grow old together we will play bridge and Texas hold 'em  
Duane and Stevie Cab they still skateboard  
But most of us lawn bowl and shuffleboard  
We may be getting ripe but we ain't bored  
  
We got a blackboard with some rules and laws  
Hefe's got an 18 car garage  
Most of the cars are smashed but so is Spike  
Twice a week on karaoke night  
  
Eric Melvin lives next door to me  
Limo and the Locknecks head security  
At the end of my cul de sac  
Davey Havoc's house is painted black  
  
We will grow old and fatter  
We got our ville nothing  
Else matters Trashy, Mod,  
And Kath are staying up  
  
Nathan, Matt and Dad  
Are passing out when  
California cracks  
We're all goin' down
