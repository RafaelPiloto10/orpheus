Hey, you wit the ass  
You wit the ass  
Come here  
Wassup  
  
What's your name girl  
Who you come wit  
I'm with Snoop Dogg  
And my whole click  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
A nigga need a shot a that  
And I know where they got it at  
Damn girl you gotta lotta that  
Why don't'cha let a real nigga goin' and handle that  
  
Look at you girl, light brown, ass round  
Feel like a nigga chasin' down a rebound  
It's bouncin' like a basketball  
If you got no ass at all  
Sorry girl but you won't make the casting call  
Skinny bitches need to find that nutritious  
Shit that makes yo ass so thick and delicious  
Is it the food or is it the water  
That make your daughter show what momma taught her  
  
Come here, let me whisper in your ear  
Tell you all that bullshit that you want to hear  
You'll probably hate my fuckin' guts in a year  
But right about now, you like a niggas style, huh?  
How I talk, how I smell, how I smile  
How I faint, how I fuck, how I growl  
Fuck with me, you get your meat and your vegetables  
Fuck with him, you get a fuckin' metro sexual  
You want a man stronger than you  
Not a motherfucker in the mirror longer than you  
Break a nail and his punk ass lookin' for glue  
You want a nigga with a hard dick lookin' at you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You came up there lookin' all cute and stuff  
You and yo home girl, a pimp couldn't get enough  
You talk that shit, like you wasn't up there just to fuck  
But guess what, now bitch you with us  
Yeah have a sip, go take a puff  
Go and split another blunt, now roll it up  
What's yo name, a nigga love how you came  
You just in need of some game  
And I got that good thing  
Yeah it's a west side hood thing  
Let you party all day and hit you with that ding-a-lang  
I got that good shit lollipop  
And once I get up in ya, I make that body rock  
You's a thick little bad bitch, walk with a switch  
All you need now is some gangsta dick  
It's the Big Bowwizow, you know I'm on the prizow  
Doggie Shizow to make your kitty cat meow  
Big beak, freak-a-leak, fuck some sleep  
And don't tell me that I'm in to deep  
OK, alright,  
West side baby girl, we do it all night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do yo thing girl, fuck what they lookin' at  
Shake it for me mami, work that pussy cat  
Do yo thing girl, fuck what they lookin' at  
Shake it for me mami, work that pussy cat  
Put it on me girl, what the fuck you scared of  
We just in the club actin' like we makin' love  
I know you full a liquor, put it on my zippa  
Drop it down now, and throw it on a nigga  
  
[Chorus]
