The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrows, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be....  
  
[RZA]  
I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shinin  
My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds  
That be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin  
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin  
ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious  
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless  
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases  
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces  
  
[Break]  
  
The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions  
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection  
Who gives you all and never ask more of you  
The faithful companion that fights every war with you  
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical  
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle  
A mission impossible, purely philosophical  
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital  
  
[Break]  
  
And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil  
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil  
Building a home for themselves and storing food  
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon  
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child  
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile  
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh  
Meaning life has no partnership with death  
  
[Break]  
  
Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us  
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce  
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings  
And eventually pledge their allegiance  
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth  
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties  
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies  
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Trying to harness the wind  
ALLAH's the father from without and within  
On Christ return, who will announce him?  
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?  
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?  
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?  
  
[Sample]  
  
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrow, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be mental  
The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful  
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance  
Avoid the enemy's strong points
