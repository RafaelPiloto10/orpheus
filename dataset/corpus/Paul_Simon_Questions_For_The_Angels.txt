A pilgrim on a pilgrimage  
Walked across the Brooklyn Bridge  
His sneakers torn  
In the hour when the homeless move their cardboard blankets  
And the new day is born  
  
Folded in his backpack pocket  
The questions that he copied from his heart  
Who am I in this lonely world?  
And where will I make my bed tonight?  
When twilight turns to dark  
  
Questions for the angels  
Who believes in angels?  
Fools do  
Fools and pilgrims all over the world  
  
If you shop for love in a bargain store  
And you don't get what you are bargain for  
Can you get your money back?  
If an empty train in a railway station  
Calls you to its destination  
Can you choose another track?  
  
Will I wake up from these violent dreams?  
With my hair as white as the morning moon?  
  
Questions for the angels  
Who believes in angels?  
I do  
Fools and pilgrims all over the world  
  
Downtown Brooklyn  
The pilgrim is passing a billboard  
And catches his eyes  
It's Jay-Z  
He's got a kid on each knee  
He is wearing clothes that he wants us to try  
  
If every human on the planet  
And all the buildings on it  
Should disappear  
Would a zebra grazing in the African Savannah  
Care enough to share one zebra tear?  
  
Questions for the angels
