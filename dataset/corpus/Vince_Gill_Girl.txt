Girl, you can trust me with your heart  
We've got a chance for a brand new start  
Part of your past was so cold and dark  
Girl, you can trust me with your heart  
Girl, I will never turn away  
Give you my word I will always stay  
I promise to honor and obey  
Girl, I will never turn away  
Let's throw caution to the wind  
Take what comes around the bend  
Girl, you will never hurt again  
It's the safest place you've ever been  
Girl, I'm asking for your hand  
Down on my knees with this golden band  
I swear, I will be a gentle man  
Girl, I'm asking for your hand  
Let's throw caution to the wind  
Take what comes around the bend  
Girl, you will never hurt again  
It's the safest place you've ever been  
Let's throw caution to the wind  
Take what comes around the bend  
Girl, you will never hurt again  
It's the safest place you've ever been  
I swear, I will be a faithful man  
Girl, you can trust me till the end
