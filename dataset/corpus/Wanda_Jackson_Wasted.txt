Wasted lonely nights wasted times I cry  
Wasted a love so true I've wasted all the love I had for you  
Wasted a lovin' heart my hands were tied right from the start  
Your carefree heart will never see just what this wasted love has done to me  
  
It's made me cry it's made me lonely it makes me sad why love's disarrayed  
Wasted years and years wasted tears and tears  
Wasted love that was to be now all I have is wasted memory  
  
It's made me cry...
