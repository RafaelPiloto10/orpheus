Ever since the day I met you  
I feel like I'm walking on air  
And lately I'm convinced it's no coincidence  
I run into into you everywhere  
  
And though I've heard your love is taken  
I gotta believe what's in your eyes  
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time  
And we got together one of these nights?  
  
[Chorus]  
Got my heart set on you  
You're everything I've ever wanted  
Got my heart set on you  
Can't be anything but love  
Baby, I'm bettin' on it  
  
I don't want to give you the wrong impression  
I'm not the kind who rushes in  
But, baby, every time I see you, before I even leave you  
I can hardly wait to see you again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mean to be coming on strong  
Or taking everything for granted  
But love is a thing that just comes along  
You don't understand how it got out of hand  
But you're in it right from the start  
  
[Chorus]
