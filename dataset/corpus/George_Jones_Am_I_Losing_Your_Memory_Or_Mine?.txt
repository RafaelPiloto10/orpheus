Did I wake up this mornin' thinkin' of you  
Am I losin' your memory or mine?  
Do I remember makin' coffee for two  
Am I losin' your memory or mine?  
  
I know that you're gone and I'm almost alone  
We're just about over it this time  
Hon. am I losing your memory or mine?  
  
I've misplaced my favorite picture of you  
Am I losing your memory or mine?  
Was it accidental or did I really want to  
Am I losing your memory or mine?  
  
I don't know myself but memory is late  
For they both had a long uphill climb  
Oh, am I losing your memory or mine?  
  
Am I comin' or going, am I doin' all right  
Am I gainin' or fallin' behind  
I'm beginnin' to wonder if I ever loved you  
And am I losing your memory or mine?  
  
I'll get over you, oh, but I really don't want to  
But I'm losing your memory or mine?
