Now I have nothing, so God give me strength,  
'cause I'm weak anyway,  
And if I'm strong, I might still break.  
  
And I don't have anything to share  
That I won't throw away into the air.  
That song is sung out.  
This bell is rung out.  
  
He was the light that I'd bless.  
He took my last chance of happiness.  
So God give me strength.  
God give me strength.  
  
I can't hold on to him.  
God give me strength.  
When the phone doesn't ring  
And I'm lost in imagining  
Everything that kind of love is worth  
As I tumble back down to the earth.  
  
That song is sung out.  
This bell is rung out.  
He was the light that I'd bless.  
He took my last chance of happiness.  
So God give me strength.  
  
God, if he'd grant me his indulgence and decline,  
I might as well wipe him from my memory.  
Fracture the spell as he becomes my enemy.  
And maybe I was washed out  
Like a lip print on a shirt.  
See, I'm only human, I want him to hurt.  
I want him, I want him to hurt.  
  
Since I lost the power to pretend  
That there could ever be a happy ending.  
That song is sung out.  
This bell is rung out.  
  
He was the light that I'd bless.  
He took my last chance of happiness.  
So God give me strength.  
God give me strength.  
  
Oooooooh. Oooooh.  
Wipe him from my memory.  
Oooh. I got to him wipe him from my memory.  
Mmmm. Ooooooooh.
