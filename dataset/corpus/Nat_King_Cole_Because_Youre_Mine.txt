Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down  
My love, and envies me because you're mine  
Because you're mine because you're mine  
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody  
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine  
I only know for as long as I may live  
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me  
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear  
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause  
Because you're mine! because you're mine!  
  
Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down  
My love, and envies me because you're mine  
Because you're mine because you're mine  
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody  
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine  
I only know for as long as I may live  
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me  
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear  
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause
