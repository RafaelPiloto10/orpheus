No I'll never look back in anger  
No I'll never find me an answer  
You promised me you'd keep in touch  
I read your letter and it hurt me so much  
I said I'd never never be angry with you  
  
I don't want to feel like a stranger no  
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger  
I read your letter so many times  
I got your meaning between the lines  
I said I'd never never be angry with you  
  
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her  
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her  
My bodies aching can't sleep at night  
I'm too exhausted to start a fight  
And if I see her with another guy  
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love her  
Love her love her love her  
  
Come on baby let's get together  
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever  
I'm trying hard to stay away  
What made you change  
What did I say  
Ooh I need your loving tonight  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight  
Hit me  
  
Ooh I need your loving tonight  
  
No I'll never look back in anger  
No I'll never find me an answer  
Can't be no warning how could I guess  
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving tonight
