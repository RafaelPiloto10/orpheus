Time to get up  
Make a move  
Put the brain in gear  
Cut the groove  
Moving slow  
With a smiling face  
Never look like you want it  
'Til it's right in your face  
  
I'm the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah I'm the hustler  
Everybody knows my name  
  
Well I can get all around you  
While I think you stand still  
The way you tell me you won't  
Let's me know that you will  
Last thing you tell them  
Is what you came here for  
They're never going to find out  
'Til you way out the door  
'cause I'm the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah I'm the hustler  
Everybody knows my name  
  
You got to love the work you do  
How long it takes  
Ain't important to you  
Don't care what's in it  
Loving every minute  
Every minute, every hour  
Every second of the day  
Little by little  
I see it coming my way  
  
I'm the hustler  
Playing my favorite game  
Yeah I'm the hustler  
Everybody knows my name
