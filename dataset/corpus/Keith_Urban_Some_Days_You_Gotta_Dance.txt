It was about five til' five on Friday  
We were all getting ready to go  
And the boss man started screaming  
And his veins began to show  
He said "You and you come with me  
'Cause you're gonna have to stay"  
My heart was thumping I was jumping  
I had to get away  
  
[Chorus]  
Some days you gotta dance  
Live it up when you get the chacne  
When the world doesn't make no sense  
And you're feeling just a little too tense  
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
  
Well I was talking with my baby  
Over a small glass of tea  
When she asked a loaded question  
She said "How do you feel about me?"  
My mind was racin' I was pacin'  
But the words just would'nt come  
And there was only one thing left to do  
I feel it coming on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some days you gotta dance  
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
