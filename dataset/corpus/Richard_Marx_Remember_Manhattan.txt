Nothing worth a damn can be sifted through the brain  
Sense don't make the man but you insist on being sane  
Don't take time to think or you're done before you start  
There's no missing link cause it's right there in your heart  
  
Take a closer look, there's an answer not a question  
In that May December line  
You'll bite a bigger hook  
Than the one you want to leave behind  
  
Remember Manhattan  
Woody wasn't wrong  
Remember Manhattan  
Before you say so long  
  
How you gonna tell if it stands the test of time  
There's no wishing well that comes true without the dime  
It's common curse that the grass is always greener  
No matter what you have  
But nothing could be worse  
Than to try to reproduce the past  
  
Remember Manhattan  
Woody wasn't wrong  
Remember Manhattan  
Before you say so long  
Remember Manhattan  
What did Woody say  
He said, remember Manhattan  
Before you walk away  
  
Lose your common sense  
'Cause you may not get the chance again.
