The full moon's glowing  
Blood red in the sky  
It hangs like fire  
On this winter's night  
I sit on feelings  
That hang in suspense  
Nothing in my life makes sense  
A question mark hangs with the stars up above  
As I'm driving home to the one that I love  
Sometimes I can't see the trees for the wood  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight  
The moonlight changes  
From red into white  
It sits on treetops  
Asleep for the night  
I see the signpost  
The road slowly bends  
Nothing in my life makes sense  
A flashing tail light speeds across the sky  
My head's cooking trouble as thoughts seem to fry  
The last temptation was misunderstood  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight  
I'm faced with the ultimate truth  
What if I see that things don't improve  
I know they could  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
The sun is rising  
There's mist all around  
She sleeps beside me  
And I feel so proud  
Am I in heaven  
With her by my side  
This is how love feels tonight  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight
