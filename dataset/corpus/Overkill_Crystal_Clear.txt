Fingernails, that pierce your tender flesh  
And a silent scream of your new faith profess  
I am a piece of eternal satisfaction  
I am the serpent wrapped around your feet  
  
Deep inside your burning  
Virgin Ear  
Oh to stop the yearning, now  
Crystal Clear  
  
Blind and staked you to a belly crawl  
And set to take, embrace your final fall  
I am the guide to the new temptation, fallout  
I am a breath of polluted air you breath  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep inside your burning  
Virgin Ear  
Oh to stop the yearning, now  
Deep inside you're learning  
To face your fear  
Floating, moaning, turning  
Crystal Clear  
  
Innocence has fallen  
At the feet of the need  
Lust has taken over  
Watch it feed  
Blessed into temptation  
In the beholder's eye  
Offered on the altar  
On high  
Are you here for the calling  
Are you here to abide  
Have you come from the falling  
Deep inside  
  
[Chorus]
