Well my fraulein done told me  
When I was in goosesteps.  
She said I would gas them  
And now I'm a big man  
Filling up autos  
That beep at me often  
I drop what I'm doing  
And wait on them cheerfullv  
Some choose the big pump  
And other's the small  
It's a small small world  
And I hear 'dem autos call  
Well I'm a big time pumper  
And I pump'em full of my gas  
And if you give me static  
I'll tell ya blow it up your ass  
My station is pretty  
I keep it in top shape  
The customers dig me  
'cause I got the answers  
To all of their auto needs  
I fix 'em up often  
And relieve their tension  
'cause no one wants an auto  
That threatens to lose it  
The auto's come crawlin'  
Into my station  
They beep at me always  
I stop what I'm doing  
And greet them with smiles  
I call "fill 'er up?"  
They yell back "one dollar"  
I wipe all the dead bugs  
And dirt off their windshield  
And connect my big hose  
Up to their gas tank  
The gas hums as it enters  
And fulls up their empty tank  
I do two at a time now  
I've developed a technique  
My timing is very good  
If not always precise  
I give them a fair deal  
They drive off satisfied  
We need each other's business  
Without which we could not survive  
We like to trade money-  
Because it means honor,  
Not like those people  
Who are sick and can't touch it  
Because they're unhealthy,  
They leave me cold.  
I help who I can help  
And feel nothing for those who  
Don't come to my station  
For I'll only tow those who  
Show me their honor  
I can't help evervbody  
And I'm not my brother's keeper  
We huddle together  
And those who come to me  
We huddle together  
And despite the weather  
We find strength in our circle  
I'm very important  
To the big and the little guy  
We all need each other  
To keep ourselves going  
Their auto's all need me  
My pump's need their empty tanks and  
If the good lord is willing  
We shall be here to the end  
Pumping-each-other
