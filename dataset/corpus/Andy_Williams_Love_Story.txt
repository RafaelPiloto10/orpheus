Where do I begin  
To tell the story  
Of how great a love can be  
The sweet love story  
That is older than the sea  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me  
Where do I start  
  
With her first hello  
She gave new meaning  
To this empty world of mine  
There'll never be  
Another love, another time  
She came into my life  
And made the living fine  
She fills my heart  
  
She fills my heart  
With very special things  
With angel songs  
With wild imaginings  
She fills my soul  
With so much love  
That anywhere I go  
I'm never lonely  
With her along who could be lonely  
I reach for her hand  
It's always there  
  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there
