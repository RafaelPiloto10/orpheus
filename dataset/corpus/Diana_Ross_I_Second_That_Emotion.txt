Maybe you wanna give me kisses sweet  
But only for one night and no repeat  
And maybe you'll go away and never call, hey  
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all  
  
Oh little girl, in that case I don't want no part  
Cause I know that, that will break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like loving me and you got the notion  
I second that emotion, said, if you feel like giving me  
A lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion  
  
Maybe you think that love would tie you down  
And you don't have the time to hang around  
Or maybe you think that love was made for fools  
And so it makes you wise to break the rules  
  
Oh little girl, in that case I don't, I don't want no part  
That would only break my heart  
Ooh, if you feel like lovin' me if you got the notion  
I second that emotion, said, if you feel like givin' me  
A lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion  
  
Ooh, then in that case, I don't want no part  
I do believe that, that would only break my heart  
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me if you got the notion  
I second that emotion, said, if you feel like givin' me  
A lifetime of devotion, I second that emotion
