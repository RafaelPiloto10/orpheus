Well, baby our love was born the moment that we met  
But early in the morning, the grass is always wet  
So, just like the dewdrops, our love would fade away  
But how was I to know it couldn't last a day  
  
But now there's no use crying  
There's no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying, there's no use crying over spilled milk  
  
I know just what went wrong, the cards I didn't play  
If my game was strong, she'd still be mine today  
But losing ain't my name, although I not the same  
I ain't gonna be no fool, put myuself to shame  
  
'Cause there's no use crying  
There's no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying, there's no use crying over spilled milk  
  
We're all washed up it's true, the rain came all to soon  
But I'll find someone new, this won't be my ruin  
And if I play it smart, on a brand new start  
I know just how to hold on, to my new found heart  
  
And then there's no use crying  
There's no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying, there's no use crying over spilled milk  
Spilled milk, yeah, spilled milk
