It was the mortal passion  
The flame that lit the fire  
The beauty of the starlight  
Brought the cruelty of desire  
  
A lover's link was broken  
Another's vengeful plan  
Was contrived through jealous hatred  
For a cross of God and man  
  
"I hope it will turn out so but I can't help  
Being afraid  
Perception is hindered by lust  
To be sure of the choice you have made."  
  
"Grant me this request, please  
Just promise me your word  
Attest to the mighty river  
Let the truth be heard!"  
  
She asked to see the power  
His realm of life and love  
His godly immortality  
The thunder roared above  
  
Her words were so quickly spoken  
Lest he stop her from the deed  
  
"I gave you my word, now my love  
Your grim request I shall heed!"  
Leaving his maiden  
He rose to the sky  
  
Returning in splendors  
To earth he did fly  
Subject to presence  
Too brilliant to face  
Another had killed passion's grace
