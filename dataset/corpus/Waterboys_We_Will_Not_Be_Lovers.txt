You just stepped into the main track  
climbed down off the fence  
Words are your weapon  
lies are your defense  
I know what you want  
and I see what you see  
You're looking for somebody  
but he isn't me  
Find yourself another  
because we will not be lovers  
How your eyes are like tortures  
and your presence is bliss  
I never knew time  
could speed and zip like this  
The touch of your flesh  
is tough to resist  
Planets collide, collide  
at the smack of your kiss  
But you can kiss your brother  
because we will not be lovers  
Now you're pulling down curtains  
You've been sparking old flames  
You've been causing disturbance  
crying for shame  
You've been Knocking on doors  
You've been abusing my name  
You've been casting up doubt  
you've been throwing your blame  
But you can throw it at your mother  
we will not be lovers  
Now the world's full of trouble  
everybody's scared  
The landlords are frowning  
cupboards are bare  
People are scrambling  
like dogs for a share  
It's cruel and its hard  
but it nothing compared to  
what we do to each other  
to each other  
We will not be lovers!  
we will not be lovers, no  
We will not be lovers, no
