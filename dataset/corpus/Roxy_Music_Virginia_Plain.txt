Make me a deal and make it straight  
All signed and sealed, I'll take it  
To Robert E. Lee I'll show it  
I hope and pray he don't blow it 'cause  
We've been around a long time just try try try tryin' to  
Make the big time  
  
Take me on a roller coaster  
Take me for an airplane ride  
Take me for a six days wonder but don't you  
Don't you throw my pride aside besides  
What's real and make believe  
Baby Jane's in Acapulco We are flyin' down to Rio  
Throw me a line I'm sinking fast  
Clutching at straws can't make it  
Havana sound we're trying hard edge the hipster jiving  
Last picture shows down the drive-in  
You're so sheer you're so chic  
Teenage rebel of the week  
Flavours of the mountain steamline  
Midnight blue casino floors  
Dance the cha-cha through till sunrise  
Open up exclusive doors oh wow!  
  
Just like flamingos look the same  
So me and you, just we two got to search for something new  
Far beyond the pale horizon  
Some place near the desert strand  
Where my Studebaker takes me  
That's where I'll make my stand but wait  
Can't you see that Holzer mane?  
What's her name Virginia Plain
