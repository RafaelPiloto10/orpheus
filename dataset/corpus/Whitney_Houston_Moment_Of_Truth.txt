We've been playing games with our emotions  
Let's get what we feel out in the open  
Wanting you is all I do  
Boy I know you want me too  
Don't you think it's time we proved  
What we've been feeling  
  
[Chorus]  
This is our moment of truth  
Either we win or we lose this love  
It's just the way that we feel  
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough  
Let out your feelings tonight  
Cause oh, I know that I want you  
It's all up to me and you  
And the moment of truth  
  
Far too many times a heart gets broken  
Just because three words are never spoken  
We can't let that bother us  
Not when we're so much in love  
I could never get enough of saying I love you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wanting you is all I do  
Boy, I know you want me, too  
Don't you think it's time we proved  
What we've been feeling  
  
[Chorus]
