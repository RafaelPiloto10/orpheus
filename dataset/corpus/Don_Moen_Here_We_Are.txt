[Chorus]  
  
Here we are lifting our hands to You  
Here we are, giving You thanks for all You do  
As we praise, and worship Your holy name  
You are here, dwelling within our praise.  
  
For every answered prayer  
For always being there  
For love that hears us when we call  
For arms that lift us when we fall  
Oh You have always been, right beside us  
Leading us all along the way  
And we made it through (we made it through)  
Because of You  
  
[Chorus]  
And here we are  
  
For days we cannot see (for days we cannot see)  
For all that yet to be (so much is yet to be)  
The trials we may have to face  
When we'll be leaning on your grace  
It will be your strength, that safe's us  
Your love that makes us strong  
And through it all (through it all)  
We'll sing this song  
  
Here we are lifting our hands to You  
Here we are, giving You thanks for all You do  
As we praise, and worship Your holy name  
You are here (yes You are) dwelling within our praise (x2)
