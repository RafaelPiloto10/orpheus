Lost in twilight, the memories  
Precious moments, you and me  
We've been old friends, all through the years  
Picture postcards, sharing tears  
  
What's in our hearts, there's never time, to say  
Need you tonight, lover don't fade away  
I've seen your city lights  
As I walk away  
Why can't this night...go on forever  
  
Without love, we won't survive  
Run together, we rule the night  
Tell me secrets, oh that make you cry  
Where's the laughter, we gotta try  
  
What's in our hearts, there's never time to say  
Need you tonight, lover don't fade away  
Like a photograph  
That time won't erase  
Why can't this night...go on forever  
Go on forever and ever...ever and ever
