We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating  
We are searchers of the truth, every man's a boy deep down  
Gotta say it how you mean it, there ain't no easy way  
  
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm  
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born  
To the very last day when the curtains are drawn  
We are children of the world, asking every question why  
From arrival to survival, just to make it worth the waiting  
We are faces in the night, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, there ain t no easy way  
  
In the back of your mind there is always a mark  
There's a wandering solo alone in the dark  
You can keep it forever or tear it apart  
  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changing my life, changing your life, keeps us all anticipating  
  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm  
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born  
Till the very last day when the curtains are drawn  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating  
  
We are children of the world, watching every day go by  
Changes my life, changes your life, keeps us all anticipating
