There's a story  
I would like to tell  
My problem is  
Its one you know too well  
Its one you know too well  
  
Miss Suzy lee  
The one I'm speaking of  
The question is  
Is she the one I love?  
Is she the one I love?  
Alright  
Is she the one I love?  
Is she the one I love?  
  
She sent me flowers  
With her tears burned inside  
And you know what I'd do?  
I would run and hide  
I would run and hide  
  
And the paper  
On it was my name  
With the question  
Do you feel the same?  
Do you feel the same  
Alright  
  
To end this tale  
The one I'm speaking of  
I wish I had an answer but I just don't know  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?
