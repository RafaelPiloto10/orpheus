I'm two shots shy of a 40 ounce quart  
A hand in the pocket and a hand in your shorts  
Shoot me with two and don't be slow  
You only got one good way to go  
And get naked, buck naked  
Buck naked, it's the only way to go  
Twenty six chicks, all tied in a knot  
Ain't all good, but it's what we got  
So get naked, buck naked  
Let me see you naked, it's the only way to go  
Get naked just  
Buck, buck  
I was feelin' so fine and things were lookin' better  
My baby said, "Maybe" and I said I'd let her  
Get naked, buck naked  
Let's get naked, it's the only way to go  
Get naked, everybody get naked  
Buck naked, it's the onliest way to go  
Get naked, get naked, get buck naked, yeah
