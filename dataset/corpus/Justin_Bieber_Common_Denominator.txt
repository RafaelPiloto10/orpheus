Just a fraction of your love  
Fills the air  
And I fall in love with you  
All over again, woo woo woo  
You're the light that feeds the sun  
In my world  
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl  
Out of all the things in life that I could fear  
The only thing that would hurt me,  
Is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation  
You understand what I'm sayin'?  
Girl, without you I'm lost  
Can't face this compass at heart  
Between me and love,  
You're the common denominator  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Common denominator  
Oh, yeah, woa  
  
Before you're love was low  
Playing girls was my high  
We chase the game that would put  
My cot in the side, aye  
When broken hearts rise up to say,  
Love is a lie  
You and I would stand to be love's reply  
  
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah  
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't imagine life without your touch  
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up  
And to all the heart aching  
Jealous females hatin'  
Imma hold it down for you, you  
You, woah, oh, woah  
You're the common denominator  
Oh yeah woah  
  
I don't wanna go back  
I don't want to go back  
To just being one half of the equation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a fraction of your love fills the air  
And I fall in love with you all over again
