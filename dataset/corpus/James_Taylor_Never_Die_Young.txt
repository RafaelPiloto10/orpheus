We were ring-around-the-rosy children  
They were circles around the sun  
Never give up, never slow down  
Never grow old, never ever die young  
  
Synchronized with the rising moon  
Even with the evening star  
They were true love written in stone  
They were never alone, they were never that far apart  
  
And we who couldn't bear to believe they might make it  
We got to close our eyes  
Cut up our losses into doable doses  
Ration our tears and sighs  
  
You could see them on the street on a Saturday night  
Everyone used to run them down  
They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight  
Not enough tough for this town  
  
We couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole  
No, it didn't seem to rattle at all  
They were glued together body and soul  
That much more with their backs up against the wall  
  
Oh, hold them up, hold them up  
Never do let them fall  
Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin  
That names us and claims us and shames us all  
  
I guess it had to happen someday soon  
Wasn't nothing to hold them down  
They would rise from among us like a big baloon  
Take the sky, forsake the ground  
  
Oh, yes, other hearts were broken  
Yeah, other dreams ran dry  
But our golden ones sail on, sail on  
To another land beneath another sky
