When all goodbyes  
Are said and done  
And nighttime finds you home  
Are you all right  
To spend a night  
Of being all alone?  
And do you hide  
Between the lines  
Of conversations past?  
A wall of words  
A heart unheard  
That hides behind a mask?  
I'm raining on the inside  
My heart wells up with tears that start to pour  
I'm raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  
When friends who care  
Can't be there  
To ease away my pain  
And peace of mind  
It's hard to find  
Like sunlight in the rain  
God sees my heart  
The deepest part  
Inside this lonely me  
And reachin' in  
His love begins  
To heal the heart in me  
I'm raining on the inside  
Oh, my heart wells up with tears that start to pour  
I'm raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  
Sometimes we're raining on the inside  
And our hearts well up with tears that start to pour  
But when we're raining on the inside  
Let his cries of love break through  
Know that he loves you, once more  
Sometimes I'm raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more
