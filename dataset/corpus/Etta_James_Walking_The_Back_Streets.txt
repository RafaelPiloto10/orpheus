You know my baby told me not so very long ago  
He said, "I don't love you, baby  
And you got to, you got to let me go"  
And that was too much, too much for me  
That's why I walked the back streets and cry  
  
You know it hurts me so bad  
To hear my baby say  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
  
He said another reason that makes me wanna leave  
You ain't got enough of nothin' to keep me, keep me ?  
That was too much, oh, too much for me  
That's why I walked the back streets, the back street and cry  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh, it hurts me, it hurts me so bad  
Oh, to hear my baby  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
  
He said, "You're a good woman, Etta  
To treat me like you do"  
He said, "You ain't done nothin' to me  
I just can't stay here with you"  
  
I stood and watch my baby as far as I could see  
You know the men started runnin'  
After waiving, waiving goodbye to me  
That was too much, too much for me  
That's why I walked the back streets and cry  
Oh yeah  
  
You know it hurts me, it hurts me so bad  
Oh, to hear my baby  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
Hear and say goodbye  
  
You know it hurts me so bad  
To hear my baby say goodbye  
That's why I walked the back streets  
The back streets and cry  
  
Oh, I said it hurts me, it hurts me so bad  
Hear my baby say, so long  
Oh, it hurts me, hurts me, hurts me so bad  
Hear my baby say, hear my baby say goodbye  
  
Oh baby, oh, oh, it hurts me so bad  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
That why I walked the back streets  
That why I walked the back streets and cry  
Oh, that why I walked the back streets and cry  
Cry, cry
