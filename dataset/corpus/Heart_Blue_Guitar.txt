Young girl feeling pretty old  
Young girl in the band  
Rolling into another town  
Living the best they can  
Across the street, a music store  
She gotta find a brand new axe  
And there he was, that blue guitar  
He was staring her right back, staring her right back  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
She made herself a local scene  
And man that axe could sing and scream  
Crying for a big breakthrough  
Only small time local news  
Just about to pack it in  
Mr. Money Biz rolled in  
Paid the way and broke the band  
A living one night stand, living one night stand  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Take this platinum, take this gold  
Burn too hot, it turns you cold  
Nothin' left to hold on to  
But that guitar was always true, that man was always true  
She held him close and he felt just fine  
He warmed her up, she know he was just right  
Together they cut right through the night  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire  
Like touching fire  
Like holding desire
