Santa's stressed out as the holiday season draws near  
He's been doing the same job now going on two thousand years  
He's got pains in his brain and chimney scars cover his buns  
He hates to admit it, but Xmas is more work than fun  
  
He needs a vacation from bad decorations and snow  
Mr. Claus has a has escape plans, a secret that only he knows  
Beaches and palm trees appear night and day in his dreams  
A break from his wife, half-frozen in life  
The elves and that damn reindeer team  
  
Ho, ho, ho and a bottle of rum  
Santa's run off to the Caribbean  
He thinks about boat drinks and fun in the sun]  
Ho, ho, ho and a bottle of rhum  
  
Plastic creations and crass exploitations aren't good  
He wants to go back to simple toys made out of wood  
Just for the weekend he's like to be Peter Pan  
Get out of his long johns and dance with a sword in the sand  
  
Ho, ho, ho and a bottle of rhum  
Snata's off to the Caribbean  
Marimbas, calimbas, he's playing steel drums  
Ho, ho, ho and a bottle of rhum  
  
Ho, ho, ho and a bottle of rhum  
Santa's off to the Caribbean  
A week in the tropics and he'll be alright  
Sporting a tan as he rides out of sight  
  
Merry Christmas to all and to all good night
