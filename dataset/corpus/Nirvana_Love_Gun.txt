I really love you baby  
I love what you've got  
Let's get together, we can  
Get hot  
No more tomorrow, baby  
Time is today  
Girl, I can make you feel  
Okay  
  
No place for hidin' baby  
No place to run  
You pull the trigger of my  
Love gun, love gun  
Love gun, love gun  
  
You can't forget me baby  
Don't try to lie  
You'll never leave me, mama  
So don't try  
I'll be a gambler, baby  
Lay down the bet  
We get together, mama  
You'll sweat  
  
No place for hidin' baby  
No place to run  
You pull the trigger of my  
Love gun, love gun (repeated several times)
