All I want to say to you  
Oh yeah!  
  
I was unfeeling  
When you discovered me  
Give me a reason  
To not deny my needs  
I was unwilling  
To give my love away  
But you decided  
To give yours anyway  
  
Oh I can't express  
The feeling I posses for you baby  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't define  
Unspeakable  
  
Mm, oh yeah  
  
Never thought I needed  
Someone to call my own  
But now that you've got me  
Don't ever let me go  
You leave me unwanting  
Your silence every need  
Nothing is missing  
No love is so complete  
  
Oh I can't express  
The feeling I posses for you baby  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't define  
Unspeakable  
  
Never had this feeling  
That brings me to my knees  
You helped me to recover  
What's been eluding me  
You're a sensation  
That makes my love run free  
And now I'm speechless  
It's all so clear to me  
  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable  
All I want to say to you  
Words can't describe it  
All I want to say to you is na na na na  
Unspeakable
