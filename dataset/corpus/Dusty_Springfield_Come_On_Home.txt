The springfields  
  
Don't stand there wailing " got no place to go"  
Come on home  
You look at me like that and I can't say no  
Come on home  
  
Well, I know you done me wrong  
And I know I should be strong  
But, I cried the whole night long  
So, come on home  
Come on home  
  
Tell me baby, must you be so cruel?  
Come on home  
You treat me just like I'm some kind of fool  
Come on home  
  
Well, I know you let me down  
I was glad when you left town  
But, you're good to have around  
So, come on home  
  
Don't run away now  
Come on home  
You got your way now  
Come on home  
A-hear what I say now  
Come on home  
Come on home  
  
When you smile at me well I feel so good  
Come on home  
I can't be mad at you like I know I should  
Come on home  
Well you took me for a ride  
And I thought my love had died  
Still I need you by my side  
So come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home  
  
Yeah, when you smile at me well I feel so good  
Come on home  
I can't be mad at you a-like I know I should  
Come on home  
Well, you took me for a ride  
And I thought my love had died  
Still, I need you by my side  
So, come on home  
Said yes  
Come on home  
Sit down  
Come on home  
Come on home
