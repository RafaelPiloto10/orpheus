We are worlds we are bodies  
Empires of dirt and grace  
Silhouettes and reflections  
Caught in his holy flame  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Beneath our skin  
A new creation  
The night is done  
Our chains are broken  
Our time has come  
The wait is over  
The King is here  
And his name is Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
This is love and it's God's to heal the broken  
This is love bleeding life into the grave  
Hear the sound as our hearts cry out forever  
Singing hallelujah  
Breathing in a brand new [world?], oh  
  
We are shadows and portraits  
Empires of life and clay  
Images of our maker  
Sinners called out as saints  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
[Chorus]x2  
  
[Bridge]  
No eye has seen  
No ear has heard  
No mind conceived  
What heaven holds  
But here and now  
Let earth be found  
With all our crowns upon your name  
  
[Long instrumental break]  
  
[Bridge]
