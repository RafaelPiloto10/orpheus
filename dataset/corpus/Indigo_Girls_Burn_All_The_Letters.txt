I am sorry that I set my sights  
On the things I read  
Something meant for your husband  
Maybe you left it under the bed  
  
Once upon a love those words blew free and secret  
The pages lay around  
Drifted to the hands of the publisher  
And the greedy generations on down  
  
Burn all the letters  
(Someone is always watching)  
The government's on the phone  
(Whether openly or secretly)  
Burn all the letters  
(Now breathe life)  
Send them on  
(Into your story)  
To a safer home  
(I said burn it to secrecy)  
Burn all the letters  
Brand them in you before you go  
Soldiers are coming to plunder  
But there are some things they will never know  
  
We made our love out of dignity  
Dug our nails in the dirt  
(Hung our towel soaked souls out on the line)  
Hung our towel soaked souls out on the line  
We loved so hard that it hurt  
  
To ease my pain I took a pen and paper  
Incarnate came the bleeding  
Send it back before the public eye  
Perverts it in the reading  
  
And burn all the letters  
(Someone is always watching)  
Ah the government's on the phone  
(Whether openly or secretly)  
Burn all the letters  
(Now breathe life)  
Send them on back  
(Into your story)  
To a safer home  
(I said burn it to secrecy)  
Burn all the letters  
Brand them in you before you go  
The soldiers coming to plunder  
But there are some things they will never know  
  
Burn all the letters  
Ah the government's on the phone  
On the phone  
Burn all the letters  
(All the letters)  
Send them on to a safer home  
(Send them on to a safer home)  
Burn all the letters  
To you  
And you to  
To me  
Coming to take what they can  
They cannot read  
What they cannot see  
  
Mmm
