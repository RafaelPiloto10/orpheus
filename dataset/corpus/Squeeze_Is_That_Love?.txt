You've left my ring by the soap,  
Now is that love?  
You cleaned me out you could say broke,  
Now is that love?  
The better better better it gets  
The more these girls forget  
That that is love.  
  
You won't get dressed you walk about,  
Now is that, is that  
A teasing glance has pushed me out,  
Now is that, is that  
The tougher tougher tougher it gets  
The more my lips frequent  
Now that is love.  
  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
  
You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,  
Now is that love  
My assets froze while yours have dropped,  
Now is that, is that  
It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise  
That more or less survived  
Now that is love.  
  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
  
You've made my bed, the finger points  
Now is that, is that love  
The more you more you more you cool down  
The easier love is found  
Now that is love.
