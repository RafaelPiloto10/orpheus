Ask the sky above and ask the earth below  
Why I'm so in love and why I love you so  
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear  
Just why dear I'm yours  
When you went away you left a glowing spark  
Trying to be gay is whistling in the dark  
I am only what you make me  
Come take me, I'm yours how happy  
I would be to beg or borrow or sorrow with you  
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through  
If we drift apart then I'll be lost alone  
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you I'm yours  
If we drift apart then I'll be left alone  
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you I'm yours
