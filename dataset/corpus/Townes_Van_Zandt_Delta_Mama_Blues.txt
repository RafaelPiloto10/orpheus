Come away with me,  
My little delta boy  
I want to be your delta mama for awhile  
And if you stay you'll see  
that I bring you lots of joy  
I turn those little teardrops to a smile  
  
Well, if you're blue don't cry  
Just wander right downtown  
You can find your delta mama waitin' there  
Well, I thought you knew that I  
Would never let you down  
I can ease your mind and take away your cares  
  
Come away with me,  
My little delta boy  
I want to be your delta mama for awhile  
And if you stay you'll see  
That I bring you lots of joy  
I turn those little teardrops to a smile  
  
Well, if the grass goes brown  
Don't you hang your head too low  
Well, there ain't no need for you to sit and pine  
If you'll just ask around  
I'm sure someone will know  
Just exactly what it takes to get you back to feelin' fine  
  
Well, if you don't know by now  
What I've been tryin' so hard to say  
Well my delta boy I'm afraid you're up to tight  
But you take it slow and somehow  
You come meandering out my way  
And I'll take you in my arms and make it right  
  
Ah, come away with me,  
My little delta boy  
I want to be your delta mama for awhile  
And if you stay you'll see  
That I bring you lots of joy  
I turn those little teardrops to a smile
