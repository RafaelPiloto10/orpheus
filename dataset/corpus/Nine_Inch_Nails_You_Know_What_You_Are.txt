I try to slip myself through, try to get to the other side  
I have to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide  
For a little bit of time, even, maybe, it worked okay?  
Just long enough to really make it hurt  
When they figured me out and it all just rotted away  
  
Don't you fucking know what you are? (x3)  
(go on, get back to where you belong)  
  
You better take a good look cause I'm full of shit  
With every bit my heart and I tried to believe in it  
You can push it all out, you can try to pretend  
But you can't change anything, you can't change anything in the end  
  
Don't you fucking know what you are? (x3)  
(go on, get back to where you belong)  
  
Don't you fucking know what you are...?  
  
Remember where you came from?  
Remember what you are?  
  
Don't you fucking know what you are?  
Go on, get back to where you belong...
