Aiyyo you niggaz done ate long enough  
G-Unit! Ohh!  
  
[Chorus]  
AYYY, I'm the clean up man!  
It ain't too many niggaz that can do it like I can  
When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'  
Motherfucker they yellin, get 'em Buck!!  
Grindin' grindin', I can make it happen  
Cause I'm, grindin' grindin', I ain't only rappin'  
Man I'm, grindin' grindin', you know who to call  
I be, grindin' grindin', this is for my dawgs  
  
What's goin' on with the Unit these days? (let 'em know)  
Well I'ma tell you e'rybody gettin' paid  
And I hear you niggaz talkin', prayin' on our downfall  
Took a couple losses, still we some outlaws  
Ya bitch still lovin' my swag  
We let you niggaz eat, why the fuck is you mad?  
I never left the streets, I really ran to 'em  
And since I know they watchin' me I let my man do 'em  
Money, a house and a bad bitch  
Way 'fore the rap game man I had this (niggaz know)  
You don't know about bein' broke  
Standin' on the block sellin' fiends soap  
Holla at me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's sip the 'gnac for a minute  
Shawty you feelin' this then put your back in it (hey!)  
I'm back in it in an all-black fitted  
In an all-black tinted-up drop top Bentley  
Like, ayyy! You know what it is (yeah!)  
I got my own jewelry baby, this ain't none of his (okay!)  
Just holla when you need me  
Show a nigga love when you see me  
I can carry the weight, fifty just put it on my shoulders  
G-Unit is the gang, I'm a motherfuckin' soldier  
They thought it was over, he let me out the cage (hey!)  
So now they got me standin on this goddamn stage, like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before I leave let me put this on your brain  
If rap stop today, I still do my thang  
I bought a Benz way before I bought me a chain  
Took my momma out the Bricks and bought a car in her name  
Paid my nigga Head bond just to get him on the streets  
Hope if I get locked up niggaz do it for me  
Keep the project lights on, payin' e'rybody bills  
All my homies dead, I'm takin' care of e'rybody kids  
And I got this, you can count on me  
To come through, when the home team down by three  
I'm gon' shoot, and even if a nigga did miss  
I bet you next quarter I'll be back in this bitch, like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, why'know niggaz out there  
Nah nah, hold on  
Why'know some niggaz out there  
Mighta thought the Unit was over or some shit  
You niggaz is losin' your fuckin' minds man, ha ha  
Aiyyo man I got this shit right now, ya mean?  
Get the fuck out my lane, yeah  
Why'know, that's why that nigga fifty  
That's why he got his feet kicked up right now  
Ha ha, Sha Money I got you nigga  
Straight up, so, oh yo  
I'm expectin' to be at the awards this year!  
Yeah
