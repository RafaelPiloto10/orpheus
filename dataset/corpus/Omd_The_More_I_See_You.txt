The more I see you  
The more I want you  
Somehow this feeling  
Just grows and grows  
With every sigh I become  
More mad about you  
More lost without you  
And so it goes  
Can you imagine  
How much I love you  
The more I see you  
As years go by  
I know the only one for me  
Can only be you  
My arms won't free you  
And my heart won't try  
  
Each time I look at you  
Is like the first time  
Each time you're near me  
The thrill is new  
And there is not a single thing I wouldn't do for  
The rare delight of the sight of you  
And there is not one single thing  
I wouldn't do for  
The rare delight of the sight of you  
And the more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
And the more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
The more I see you  
Everyday
