Glass house, that once was mine , the sun will shine in on me  
You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me  
I remember yesterday , turn my tears to laugher  
Then you left and like a stray, I came running after  
  
I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying  
I remember all the words you were softly saying  
  
Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane  
It's ours , my love , until the day we say auf wiedersehen
