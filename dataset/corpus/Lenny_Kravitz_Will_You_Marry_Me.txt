I want to do this thing  
I don't want no drama mama  
It's love I bring  
  
Wait a minute  
You're out of sight  
Girl I wanna give it to you  
Let's make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my life and my passion  
That never goes out of fashion  
I want to know  
Will you marry me  
  
Hey baby  
Will you wear my ring  
You're a queen and I've been waiting  
To be a king  
Baby, baby  
Let's keep it tight  
If you want to get right to it  
Could be tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
Come on baby  
Keep it tight  
I know its right  
I wanna have you always in my life  
Hit it  
Oh yeah  
No I like that  
Do that one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are my favorite attraction  
You give me real satisfaction  
I want to know  
Will you marry me  
  
You are my life and my passion  
That never goes out of fashion  
I want to know will you marry me
