If I ever feel the light again shining down on me,  
I don't have to tell you what a welcome it will be.  
I felt the light before but I let it slip away,  
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day.  
  
It's not the spotlight, it's not the cam'ra light,  
It's not the street lights of some old street of dreams.  
It ain't the moonlight, not even the sunlight,  
But I've seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean.  
  
Some times I try to tell myself the light was never real,  
Just a fantasy that used to be, the way I used to feel.  
But you and I know better, even though it's been so long,  
If your memory really serves you well, you'll never tell me no wrong.  
  
It's not the spotlight, it's not the cam'ra light,  
It's not the streetlights of some old street of dreams.  
It ain't the moonlight, not even the sunlight,  
But I've seen it shining in your eyes you know what I mean.  
  
So if I ever feel the light again shining down on me,  
I don't have to tell you what a welcome it would be.  
I felt the light before but I let it slip away,  
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day.  
  
It's not the spotlight, it's not the cam'ra light,  
It's not the streetlights of some old street of dreams.  
It ain't the moonlight, not even the sunlight,  
But I've seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean.
