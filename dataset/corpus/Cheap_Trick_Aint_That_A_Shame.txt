You made me cry when you said good-bye.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.  
  
You broke my heart, now we're apart.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.  
  
Ah, yes you are,  
Farewell, good-bye, although I'll cry.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.  
  
Ah!  
You made me cry when you said good-bye.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.
