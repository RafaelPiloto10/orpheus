Go against the ways and experience pain  
Leading a life which one might call insane  
Bathe in the blood of the one you killed  
Slaughter to survive, your needs are fulfilled  
  
Using horrid waste  
Some of them will taste  
Removing deadly disease  
With such primitive ease  
  
Cannibals practicing the art of butchery  
Emotions don't exist, pain you can't resist  
  
Primitive ways  
  
Conducting ceremonies to meet the ancient ones  
While having an outer body experience  
Celebrate the kill of the day  
Then walk among the guts of the fallen prey  
  
Using horrid waste  
Some of them will taste  
Removing deadly disease  
With such primitive ease  
  
Cannibals practicing the art of butchery  
Emotions don't exist, pain you can't resist
