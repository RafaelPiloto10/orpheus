The streets here are empty, all the people went home  
Well, I was just wondering if you're alone  
So how you've been lately? I hear you're a little down  
And do you think maybe I could come around?  
  
[Chorus]  
I could be someone you need  
Wrap you in blankets on dark winter nights  
Be your best confidante, pay the right compliment  
I could be someone you need  
  
We had coffee on 3rd Street and talked for a time  
I still have your letter, I know every line  
I hope this ain't coming from way out of the blue  
'Cause I got to thinking and I thought of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You need someone there when the world isn't fair  
Or it's all just too good to be true  
Someone to care for you, issue a dare to you  
When the moment comes you need to fly, fly  
  
[Chorus]
