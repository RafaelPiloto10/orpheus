Is it so hard to believe our hearts  
Are made to be broken by love  
That in constant dying lies  
The beauty of it all  
My darling won't you feel  
The sweet heaven in  
Our endless cry  
  
Oh at least you could try  
For this one last time  
  
Ever amazed how bright are the flames  
We are burning in  
Ever smiled at the tragedies  
We hold inside  
My darling won't you cherish  
The fear of life that keeps  
You and me so alive  
  
Oh at least you could trust  
For this one last time  
It could be alright  
For this one last time  
  
Oh at least you could trust  
(and we just will be closer)  
For this one last time  
(let me fall into your arms)  
It could be alright  
(don't let us grow colder)  
For this one last time  
(let me close to your heart)  
  
Oh at least you could trust  
(and before it's over)  
For this one last time  
(and let me fall into your arms)  
It could be alright  
(before it's all over)  
For this one last time  
(let me close to your heart)
