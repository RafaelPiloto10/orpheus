All twinklin' lee  
Can't see the right roads when the streets are paved  
The old slave men might grind slow  
But it grinds fine, yeah  
  
African herbsman, why linger on?  
Just concentrate, 'cause heaven lives on  
Retired slave men will look with a scorn  
With a transplanted heart (yes, how quick they had to part)  
(how quick they had to part)  
  
The remembrance of today  
Is the sad feelin' of tomorrow  
(how quick) Oh (part), oh yeah  
  
African herbsman, seize your time  
I'm takin' illusion on the edge of my mind  
I'm takin' losers down through my life  
Down through my life, yeah (yes, how quick they had to part)  
(how quick they had to part)  
  
Dideh part, yes, they part  
In remembrance of today  
(how quick they had to part)  
  
African herbsman, why linger on?  
Just concentrate, 'cause your heaven lives on  
Greet-I-eth slave men will look with a scorn  
With a transplanted heart, yes, how (quick they have to part)  
(how quick they have to part)  
  
In remembrance of today  
Brings sad feelings of tomorrow  
(Yes, how quick they have to) Lead me on, oh, Lord, I pray to you  
  
(African herbsman) (African herbsman)  
African, African herbsman
