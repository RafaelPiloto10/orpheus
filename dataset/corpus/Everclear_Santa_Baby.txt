Santa baby, just slip a guitar under the tree for me  
Been an awful good boy  
Santa baby, hurry down the chimney tonight  
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue  
Yeah, I'll wait up for you dear  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the girlies that I haven't kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you'd check off my christmas list  
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot  
I've been an angel all year  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa cutie, one little thing that I need, the deed  
To a platinum mine  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Come and trim my christmas tree  
With some decorations bought at tiffany's  
I really do believe in you  
Let's see if you believe in me too  
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring  
Yeah, I don't mean on the phone  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex, and checks  
Sign your x on the line  
Santa baby, now hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the girlies that I could've kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you'd check off my christmas list  
Santa baby, forgot to mention just one little thing, a ring  
I don't mean on the phone  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
