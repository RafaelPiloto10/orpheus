Day by day I'm lost for words to say  
I try and speak but the words won't come  
You and I should take these wings and fly  
It's time to ring every bell and beat on every drum  
  
Cause our love can take us where we've never been  
And our love can build this world again  
Build this world  
  
What we need is just a little love and we'll succeed  
The time has come for everyone to know  
That you and I we're all the reasons why  
He taught the birds to sing and made the flowers grow  
  
And our love can take us where we've never been  
And our love can build this world again  
Build this world  
  
The time has come for everyone to know  
He taught the birds to sing and made the flowers grow  
  
And our love can take us where we've never been  
And our love can build this world again  
Build this world  
  
Day by day I'm lost for words to say  
I try and speak but the words won't come  
  
So you and I should take these wings and fly  
It's time to ring every bell and beat on every drum  
Tell the world about it  
  
Our love can take us where we've never been  
And our love can build this world again  
Build this world
