Twenty-one years and you answer the call  
Hollywood screams from your bedroom wall  
You can't get away from the thrill of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye-bye baby  
Get me out of here I'm done  
A girl gone crazy  
You ain't foolin' anyone  
  
You can't sing can't dance  
Can't fit in your pants  
You're a bad actress  
You can't run can't walk gotta learn how to talk  
You're a bad actress  
  
Come on down and walk the moonlit mile  
You've got the perfect teeth  
You've got the perfect smile  
You do it all wrong but you do it in style  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't sing can't dance  
Can't fit in your pants  
You're a bad actress  
You can't run can't walk gotta learn how to talk  
You're a bad actress  
  
You can't read can't write gotta learn how to fight  
You're a bad actress  
You're too cold too old and the story's been told bout  
The bad actress  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't sing can't dance  
Can't fit in your pants  
You're a bad actress  
  
You can't run can't walk gotta learn how to talk  
You're a bad actress  
  
You can't read can't write gotta learn how to fight  
You're a bad actress  
  
You're too cold too old and the story's been told bout  
The the bad actress  
  
Oh Yeah  
Bad actress  
Oh  
Bad actress  
No good  
Bad actress  
Too bad  
  
Ah what's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this?
