Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting apart from the laughter and the cheer  
While scenes from the past rise before me just watching the bubbles in my beer  
A vision of someone who loved me brings along silent tears to my eyes  
Oh I know that my life has been a failure just watching the bubbles in my beer  
  
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled a road paved with heartaches and tears  
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted while watching the bubbles in my beer  
As I think of the heart that I've broken and the chances I know have passed me
by  
And the dreams that I've made now are empty as empty as the bubbles in my beer
