My oh my it's a miracle  
Good morning love  
Rise and shine  
It's a beautiful day  
And I feel fine  
Come watch the sun light the sky  
And sip a coffee you and I  
Won't you give us a kiss now  
Perchance a little more  
No don't mind that witch  
Peeking out next door  
I feel like a lark sitting high up a tree  
What's just another day to one man  
Is a miracle to me  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(a miracle to me)  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(it's a miracle)  
All the whinning all the worry  
All the fast friends and the fury  
Oh dear lord  
All the madness that used to move me  
Simply don't behoove me  
No more  
Yeah let it rain let is shine  
If I got you I got mine  
Oh well hello sweet sanity  
I'm alive and I'm smilling  
And that's a miracle to me  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(a miracle to me)  
My oh my it's a miracle  
Now good morning love  
And how are you  
Does your old man seem  
A bit too chearful to be true  
Excuse me if I shed a little tear joyfully  
But when your hand's in my hand  
Yeah when a woman really loves a man  
It's a miracle to me  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(a miracle to me)  
My oh my it's a miracle  
(it's a miracle)  
I'm ten miles high it's a miracle  
(I'm ten miles high it's a miracle)  
Look at my life it's a miracle  
(it's a miracle)
