I was down for the count  
Feeling like I've come to the end  
Nothing really mattered  
Nothing left for me to mean, ooh  
  
And then you came  
And I still couldn't see  
Till you tore down every wall in me  
How you healed me with your patience  
If it's all I ever do  
I'll never stop loving you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe  
And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it  
I'm in love and it's all because of you  
I was fading but you pulled me through  
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die  
And there ain't no doubt about it  
It's love and I have found it  
Feel the beat again, stronger than before  
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more  
  
I was in a place full of pain  
With a broken down heart in despair  
He took away my feelings  
And made it hard for me to care, oh  
But then you crashed through the door, to my soul  
Put back all the pieces and made me home  
I was living in the past, oh no  
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whatever you want me to  
I'm gonna see you through  
All that I ever do  
Never stop loving you  
  
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe  
And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it  
I'm in love and it's all because of you  
I was fading but you pulled me through  
Fading but you pulled me through  
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die  
And there ain't no doubt about it  
There's just no doubt  
Feel the beat again, stronger than before  
I wanna give you my heart until it beats no more
