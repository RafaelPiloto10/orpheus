Sit by the river's edge, and watch the water flow,  
Sunlight that touched your face, and told you not to go.  
Where, oh where, you search your heart - how much do you need?  
All the things that take you far away from being alone.  
Stay where your fellowship have watched you hide inside,  
Don't you alarm the path where danger's arrows fly.  
Places everywhere that seem to have no other days,  
Calling out from what could only still be all alone.  
  
Rain falls into your life, and leisure steals away,  
Love and wishes floating down under today.  
  
Sit by the river's edge, and watch the water flow,  
Sunlight that touched your face, and told you not to go.  
Where, oh where, you ask yourself - how much do you need?  
All the things that take you far away from being alone.
