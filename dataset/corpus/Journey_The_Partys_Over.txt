You never call me up  
When I'm alone at night.  
What can this poor boy do,  
When he's hopelessly in love with you?  
So I will tell you now  
This love is fallin' down.  
Just what more can I do,  
When I'm hopelessly in love with you?  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love with you.  
  
  
So I will tell you this,  
Our love is in a fix.  
Just what more can I do.  
When I'm hopelessly in love with you?  
  
  
You never call me up  
When I'm alone at night.  
What can this poor boy do,  
When he's hopelessly in love with you?  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
I'm hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Oh, bye-bye, baby  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
Oo, the party's over,  
I have gone away.
