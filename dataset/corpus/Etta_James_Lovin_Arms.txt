If you could see me now.  
The one who said that she?d rather roam  
The one that said she?d rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment I could really make you mine  
Just for awhile turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain  
Take any comfort that I can  
Looking back and hoping for a freedom from my chains  
And Lie in your loving arms again  
  
If you could hear me now  
Singing somewhere through the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight  
If you could only hear me now  
  
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain  
Take any comfort that I can  
Looking back and hoping for a freedom of my chains  
And Lie in your loving arms again  
  
I can almost feel your loving arms again  
I can almost feel your loving arms again
