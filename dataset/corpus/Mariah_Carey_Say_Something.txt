Ft. Snoop Dogg  
  
I am over here  
Looking at you  
You are over there  
Watching me too  
Both painting pictures of how we'll kiss and hug  
  
So what we gon' do  
(So what you gon' do, what you gon' do)  
Tell me why we're standing here  
Moments splashing here and there  
You got my mind blown  
And baby, I'm ready to go  
  
But uh...  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me  
  
(Let's make it)  
Hot as you can stand it  
Something like volcanic  
You and me seems organic  
Just like the stars in the planet  
Yeah, we are  
So what you gon' do  
(So what you gon' do, what you gon' do)  
  
Tell me why we're still in here  
There is nothing for us to hear  
I could tell with my eyes closed  
Now baby, I'm ready to go  
  
But uh...  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me  
  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me baby  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me  
  
Everytime I fall through  
Want me to speak on the word or two  
It's the D-O-double-G  
And I do it so lovingly  
Digging the track to the Neptune  
Spending your time in the westgrove  
Now get bug wide  
Shhh, don't make a sound  
I'll take you, lay you down  
Make your body go round and round  
Do you want to?  
Won't say you want, I know you do  
Most girls play shy  
It won't hurt until you give it a try(Uhuh)  
I know you like my smile  
Dig my span  
Big, bad, wide  
  
But uh...  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me  
  
But uh...  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me
