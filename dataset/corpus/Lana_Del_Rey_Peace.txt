You have a right  
To live your life  
Like no one else does  
Like no one else might  
  
If you have visions  
Come on and live them out  
  
All you need  
Is some peace while you are here  
Just let go  
Until you are home, dear  
  
I had a dream  
When I was young  
I dreamt our lives were  
Going to be fine  
  
We were always  
Waiting to live  
  
All you need  
Is some peace while you are here  
Just let go  
Of it all, dear  
  
You have a choice  
To hear the noise  
Or hear the sweet sound  
Of your sweet voice  
  
I know I've heard it  
I heard it in my sleep  
  
All you need  
Is some peace while you are here  
Just let go  
Don't say no, dear  
  
Wake up each night  
At the same time  
Pull up the blinds  
And look outside  
  
And in the orange light  
The fog is rising  
  
This is life  
This tonight  
Peace in the quiet  
Happiness  
Is the sky
