Long ago when he was young and restless  
Suddenly Daddy saw the beckoning finger of fate  
  
Don't make fun of Daddy's voice  
Because he can't help it  
When he was a teenage boy  
Something got stuck in his throat  
  
When you are young you crave affection  
And it can come from the strangest direction  
  
Don't make fun of Daddy's voice  
Because he can't help it  
When he was teenage boy  
Something got stuck in his throat  
  
Don't make fun of Daddy's voice  
Because he can't help it  
When he was teenage boy  
Something got stuck in his throat

No te divertes con Papi  
No te divertes con Papi  
No te divertes con Papi  
No te divertes con Papi  
No te divertes con Papi  
No te divertes con Papi  
No te divertes con Papi
