(Stewart, Le Mesurier)  
  
On a boulevard in Paris  
I met a good old friend of mine  
"Come on over to my place  
Bring yourself and a bottle of wine"  
So I put on my leathers  
And I tried to look my best  
But I was apprehensive  
I noticed I was the only guest  
It was then I witnessed  
Something I'd never seen  
Some satisfaction  
Dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone  
Listen  
  
There's a white house in Georgia  
Down the Mason-Dixon line  
They got Kentucky Derby winners there  
They got a Lear jet parked outside  
Yeah but every Friday weekend  
When the big tom cat's away  
You'll find the plantation shakin'  
By the butler and the upstairs maid  
Don't need no money, diamonds or cadillacs  
To get all the satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone  
  
Don't you worry  
'bout the problems of the human race  
Get some satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone baby  
Listen to this  
At a hot spot in Texas  
On an endless Friday night  
I was listenin' to Waylon and Willie  
When a cowgirl passed my sights  
And I took a look in the mirror  
To make sure that my head was screwed on  
I was feeling rejected  
But I wasn't going home  
In a moment of a rash decision  
I threw myself right on the floor  
I did a backflip and somersault  
Yeah, the crowd called for more  
So if you're tired of watching  
Being left on the shelf  
Get your satisfaction dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone, dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone, dancin' alone  
Dancin' alone baby
