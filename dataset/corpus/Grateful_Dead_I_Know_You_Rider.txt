Well I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone  
Well I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone  
You gonna miss your mama from rolling in your arms  
  
Well I know my baby he's bound to love me some  
Well I know my baby he's bound to love me some  
He throws his arms around me like a circle round the sun  
  
Well I laid down and I tried to take my rest  
I laid down and I tried to take my rest  
but my mind it just kept wandering like some wild geese in the west  
  
I'm going down the road where I get better care  
I'm going down the road where I get better care  
I believe I'll go babe, I just don't feel welcome here  
  
Just as sure as the bird fly in the sky above  
Just as sure as the bird fly in the sky above  
Life ain't worth living if you ain't with the man you love  
  
The sun's gonna shine in my back door some day  
The sun's gonna shine in my back door some day  
The wind's gonna rise and blow my blues away  
  
To love you baby, it's easy as falling off a log  
To love you baby, it's easy as falling off a log  
Wanna be your baby but I sure won't be your dog
