I could tell you the story of a vagabond  
A playboy of the western world  
One day by chance he came upon  
A fair young maid, a country girl  
  
He told her that he loved her  
And he took all of her silver  
He told her that he needed her too  
He said "Hey baby, you got eyes of blue"  
But he was a vagabond  
  
Blue eyes, oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
The kind of eyes that say "I do" eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
  
He roamed around the cities  
Searching for his fortune and fame  
No lady ever got to know his name  
Shame, but that was his game  
  
Gave a girl a baby boy  
He said "This child is my pride and joy"  
"I'm busy running wild and free"  
"Make sure he grows up like me"  
And I'm a vagabond  
  
Blue eyes, oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
The kind of eyes that say "I do" eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
  
Oh I could tell you a story of a vagabond  
He was a playboy of the western world  
He wore an earring in his left ear  
You see his father he was a gypsy  
  
You just might meet him upon the highway  
Pretty fine dancer too  
But he's leave you blue, he'd leave  
He'd leave you woman
