Awake to the sound of emptiness.  
Alone in a room that is filled with the darkest of light.  
I was told there was nothing beyond here.  
How do I know what side I'm on?  
Breathe!  
A captive with nothing but the thoughts increasing,  
Worsening I don't belong here  
But I cant find my exit.  
This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down  
Where they go to hunt me down, they hunt me down  
  
Weigh out the options  
Pave the narrow  
I know what you're thinking  
Come on man I swear you can do this  
Come on man I swear you can do this  
I break free from this room they built for me  
I break free from this room they built for me  
  
This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down  
Where they go to hunt me down, they hunt me down  
  
I tore out my lying eyes  
So they locked me up  
I tore out my lying eyes  
So they locked me up  
Preying on the innocent
