(Feat. Billy Ray Cyrus)  
  
There's a song that's inside of my soul  
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again  
I'm awake and in the infinite cold  
But You sing to me over and over and over again  
  
So I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope  
  
You sing to me of the song of the stars  
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again  
When it feels like my dreams are so far  
You sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again  
  
And I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope  
  
I give You my empathy, I'm giving You all of me  
I want Your symphony singing in all that I am  
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back  
  
And I lay my head back down  
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours  
I pray to be only Yours, I pray to be only Yours  
I know You're my only hope
