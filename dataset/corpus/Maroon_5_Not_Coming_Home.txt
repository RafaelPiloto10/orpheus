When you refuse me  
You confuse me  
What makes you think I'll let you in again  
Think again, my friend  
Go on, misuse me and abuse me  
I'll come out stronger in the end  
  
And does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
And does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
I'll bet it hurts so bad  
To see the strength that I have shown  
  
[Chorus]  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
You do not know how much this hurts me  
To say these things that I don't want to say  
But I have to say them anyway  
I would do anything to end your suffering  
But you would rather walk away  
  
And does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
And does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
I'll bet it hurts so bad  
To see the strength that I have shown  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
And does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
And does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
  
Does it make you sad  
To find yourself alone  
Does it make you mad  
To find that I have grown  
Bet it hurts so bad  
To see the strength that I have shown  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home  
  
When you answer the door, pick up the phone  
You won't find me cause I'm not coming home
