It's not a place, it's a yearning  
It's not a race, it's a journey  
It's not an act, it's attraction  
It's not a style, it's an action  
  
It's a dream for the waking  
It's a flower touched by flame  
It's a gift for the giving  
It's a power with a hundred names  
  
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Maybe time is bird in flight  
Endlessly mocking  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
It's a hand, that rocks the cradle  
It's a motion, that swings the sky  
It's method on the edge of madness  
It's a balance on the edge of a knife  
It's a smile on the edge of sadness  
It's a dance on the edge of life  
  
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Maybe time is bird in flight  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
(Endlessly rocking, endlessly rocking)  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking
