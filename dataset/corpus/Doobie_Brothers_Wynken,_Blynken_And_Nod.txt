Wynken and Blynken and Nod one night  
Sailed off in a wooden shoe  
Sailed in a river of  
Crystal light into a sea of dew  
  
Now where are you going  
And what do you (A)wish  
The old moon asked of the three  
Well, we're going out fishing  
For herring fish that live in the  
Beautiful sea  
  
Nets of Silver and  
Gold have we said  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod  
  
The old moon laughed andsang  
A song  
As they rocked in their wooden  
Shoe  
And the wind that sped them all  
Night long ruffled the waves of dew  
  
Well the little stars were the  
Herring fish that lived  
In the beautiful sea  
Now cast your nets wherever  
You wish never afeared are we  
So sang the stars to the  
Fisherman three:  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod  
  
All night long their nets they  
Threw to the stars and  
The twinkling foam  
Then down from the skies came  
The wooden shoe bringing  
The fisherman home  
  
Twas all so pretty a sight  
It seemed as if it could not be  
And some folks thought it was  
A dream they dreamed  
Of sailingthe beautiful sea  
But I shall name you the  
Fisherman three:  
Wynken, Blynken and Nod  
  
Now Wynken and Blynken are  
Two little eyes and Nod is a  
Little head  
And the wooden shoe that  
Sailed the sky is a wee one's  
Trundle bed  
So close your eyes while  
Mother sings of the beautiful  
Sights that be  
And you will see wonderful  
Things as you rock on the misty sea  
Where the old moon rocks  
The fisherman three  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod
