First the good news  
It's gonna feel very nice  
Then the bad news  
You gotta pay a heavy price  
Rip tide,we slide we ride on a deep forbidden sea  
Under we go-so slow  
And you're hanging onto me  
And I say  
Oh oh one more addiction in my world  
Oh one more connection to let go  
Oh floating down the river  
out of sight forever (from my world)  
It's the only thing I know how to do  
I reject you  
But I can't follow through  
I'd forget you  
Bud you'd end up tappin' on my back door  
Somehow I lost myself  
In a tunnel long and black  
Somewhere,at the end,I pretend  
There's a way of turning back  
(Chorus)  
Take a breath  
Let it out  
All the things you frown about are meaningless of course,unless you're  
doing this for real I guess  
I meant to to but  
I don't know what  
Is in the way and could I say  
It's you in bet  
I won't forget  
Maybe I'm not ready yet  
(Chorus)
