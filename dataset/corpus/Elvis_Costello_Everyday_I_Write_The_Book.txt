Don't tell me you don't know what love is  
When you're old enough to know better  
When you find strange hands in your sweater  
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote  
I'm a man with a mission on two or three editions.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book.  
Chapter One: We didn't really get along.  
Chapter Two: I think I fell in love with you.  
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three  
  
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four  
Five and Six.  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
The way you walk  
The way you talk and try to kiss me  
And laugh in four or five paragraphs.  
All your compliments and your cutting remarks  
Are captured here in my quotation marks.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday I write the book.  
Don't tell me you don't know the difference  
Between a lover and a fighter.  
With my pen and my electric typewriter  
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal  
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book.  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book...
