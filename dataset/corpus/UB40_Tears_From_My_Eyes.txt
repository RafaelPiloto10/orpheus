Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
  
I've done everything one man can do, girl  
Said every word one man can say  
The thing that we had has gone astray, girl  
I'm missing you from day to day.  
  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.
