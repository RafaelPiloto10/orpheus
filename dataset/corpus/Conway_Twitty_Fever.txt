Never know how much I love you,  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me,  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear.  
  
You give me fever - when you kiss me,  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever - in the morning,  
Fever all through the night.  
  
Sun lights up the daytime,  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name,  
Because you know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever - when you kiss me,  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever - in the morning,  
Fever all through the night.  
  
Now listen to me baby  
And hear every word I say  
No one can love you like I do  
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way  
  
You give me fever - when you kiss me,  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever - in the morning,  
Fever all through the night.  
  
Well, now you've heard my story,  
Here's the point that I have made:  
Chicks were born to give you fever,  
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
They give you fever - yeah, when you kiss them,  
Fever when you live and learn  
Fever - till you sizzle,  
What a lovely way to burn.  
  
What a lovely way to burn.  
What a lovely way to burn...
