Darling, there is one thing I must tell you, you must know  
It's so hard to say the words I feel  
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long  
It's time to stop pretending things are real  
  
'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind  
And I just don't know what's right or wrong  
To take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do  
A chance I might wake up and find you gone  
  
Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue  
Any private flame could be a lie  
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you  
But I know I'll only make you cry  
  
A thief can only steal from you  
He cannot break your heart  
He can never touch the precious things inside  
Someone like you should surely be  
  
Miles and miles away from me  
Then you'd never care how much I lied  
So try to understand the pain  
It takes so long when I explain  
Please don't you forget how much I lied  
How much I lied
