There's a red cloud hanging over us  
And it's so big and it's gonna burst  
All you people with your heads in the ground  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
  
And they're no good and they're everywhere  
Try to tell you, but you just don't care  
Try to hear you but you don't make a sound  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
Hey brother, where you bound?  
  
And you don't know what they're gonna do  
And you don't know how they feel  
And you don't know what they're tellin' you  
Is it a lie or is it real  
And the next thing that you know is  
That they walk out on the deal  
  
And the message that they're giving you  
Is the same old alibi  
If you don't quite see their point of view  
Then they treat you like a spy  
And the phone rings and you disappear  
In the middle of the night  
  
Can't you see they're on the move  
Don't know what you're trying to prove  
But you sit there oh so cool  
Like they never broke no rules  
  
And the cat flies and the crow walks  
And the ghost dies and the sow talks  
And they tell us that they'll be good as gold  
Be...'lieve nothing that you're told  
Hey brother, where's your soul?  
  
Make a move in one direction  
Try to make some compromise  
But they greet you with rejection  
Makin' out you're tellin' lies  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Better get down from the sky  
  
For the sake of all that's holy  
Listen good to what I say  
I can feel them all around me  
They could be here any day  
But you act like you don't know me  
Why d' you look at me that way  
  
If there's one thing that is clear  
We gotta get away from here  
We've gotta leave this place  
It's just a hopeless case  
Ain't no one else to blame  
We're gonna lose this game  
  
Hey brother get off my back  
I gotta tell you, you're way off the track  
They got a hatred deep down inside  
Ain't gonna let them take me alive  
  
I'm gonna burn them down, just wait and see  
Ain't gonna let them walk over me  
Boy you ain't got no heart and soul  
And your mind is weak and your blood's runnin' cold  
  
You better move, you better hide  
They're gettin' in, they're gettin' inside  
If you get caught you better know  
They're gonna reap, you're gonna sow  
  
Don't be a fool, we gotta go  
Ain't no place safe for us to stay  
We better move on, we better move on
