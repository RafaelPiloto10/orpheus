All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
  
Take my lips  
I want to loose them  
Take my arms  
I'll never use them  
  
[Chorus]  
Your goodbye  
Left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on, dear, without you  
  
You took the part  
That once was my heart  
So why not take all of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You took the part  
That once was my heart  
So why not take all of me
