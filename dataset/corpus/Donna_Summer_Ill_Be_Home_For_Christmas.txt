I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place that I love  
Even more than I usually do  
  
And although I know  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
And I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
And I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
If only in my dreams
