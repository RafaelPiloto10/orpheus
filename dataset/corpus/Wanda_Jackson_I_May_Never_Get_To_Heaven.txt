I walked with you and talked with you and held your loving hand  
We loved awhile I lived awhile and thought that fate had it planned  
Then someone stole my angel and I lost what I loved most  
I may never get to heaven but I once came mighty close  
I may never play a golden harp or spread celestial wings  
Or walk a golden staircase while the distant chorus sings  
Oh but I once held your sweet love and felt your tender touch  
I may never get to heaven but I didn't miss it much  
I may never get to heaven but I didn't miss it much
