You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you got  
You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you got  
  
'Cause if you think nobody wants it  
Just throw it away and you will see  
Someone will have it before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, they will  
  
Listen fellas, you know, it's not all the time  
That a man can have a good woman  
A woman that he can call his very own  
A woman who'll stay right there at home  
And mind the children while he's gone to work  
  
A woman who'll have his dinner cooked  
When he comes home  
Where some men make mistakes is when they go out  
And stay because they feel that no other man  
Wants his woman but him, but listen  
  
If you think no other man wants her  
Just throw her away and you will see  
Some man will have her before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, he will  
  
Ha, ha, listen girls, this goes for you, too  
Because you know I've seen so many women  
Who've had so many good men in life  
  
Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin  
Men who would go to work everyday and bring home  
Their hard earned pay  
Men who would give their women anything that their  
Little heart desired  
  
Where some women make mistakes  
Is when their men go out and let 'em play  
They would stay because they felt that no other  
Woman wanted him but her, listen  
  
If you think that no other woman wants him  
Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see  
Some woman will have your man before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, you will, yes, you will
