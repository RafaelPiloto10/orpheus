She's got a suitcase packed in the trunk, trunk, trunk  
She's got a see you later song that went bump, bump, bump  
She's got a hurtin heavy heart goin' thump, thump, thump  
She's leaving  
She's got a bucket of tears goin' drop, drip, drop  
And that ring on her finger is comin' off, off, off  
She's got a boyfriend yelling to stop, stop, stop  
She's leaving  
  
Should have done this, should have done that  
Should have seen it comin', guess you don't see nothing when you're runnin'
'round  
She's history, wrapped in a memory,  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that will never be  
She's leaving (she's leaving now)  
  
She left your dreams in the washing machine, chine, chine  
Now she's a red light turning to green, green, green  
She's a goner if you know what I mean, mean, mean  
She's leaving  
  
Should have done this, should have done that  
Should have seen it comin', guess you don't see nothing when you're runnin'
'round  
She's history, wrapped in a memory,  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that'll never be  
She's leaving  
Oh no, she's leaving  
  
Look at her go down right over your road,  
Sayin' to herself shoulda done this a long time ago  
  
Should have done this, should have done that  
Should have seen it comin', guess you don't see nothing when you're runnin'
'round  
She's history, wrapped in a memory,  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that will never be  
She's, she's, she's leaving!  
She's leaving  
  
She's got a suitcase packed in the trunk, trunk, trunk  
She's got a see you later song that went bump, bump, bump  
She's got a hurtin heavy heart that went thump, thump, thump  
She's leaving (She's leaving)  
She's got a bucket of tears goin' drop, drip, drop  
And that ring on her finger is comin' off, off, off  
She's got a boyfriend yelling to stop, stop, stop  
She's leaving  
She's leaving man  
  
Look at her go down right over your road  
She's leaving, she's leaving, leaving
