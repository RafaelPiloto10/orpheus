Everyday in the week I'm in a different city  
If I stay too long people try to pull me down  
They talk about me like a dog  
Talkin' about the clothes I wear  
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square  
  
Hey!  
And that's why  
You can't hold me down  
I don't want to be down I gotta move on  
Ah  
  
Stone free to do what I please  
Stone free to ride the breeze  
Stone free I can't stay  
I got to got to got to get away right now  
  
Alright  
Listen to this baby  
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage  
But they don't realize it's so easy to break  
But sometimes I get a ha  
Feel my heart kind of runnin' hot  
That's when I've got to move before I get caught  
  
Hey that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down  
I don't want to be tied down  
I gotta be free  
Owh!  
  
I said  
Stone free to do what I please  
Stone free to ride the breeze  
Stone free I can't stay  
Got to got to got to get away  
Yeah ow!  
Tear me loose baby  
  
Yeah! Owh!  
Stone free to ride on the breeze  
Stone free to do what I please  
Stone free I can't stay  
Stone free I got to I got to get away  
Stone free I'm gone baby, right now, don't try to hold me back  
Stone free go on down the highway  
Stone free I got to, got to, got to  
Stone free bye bye baby
