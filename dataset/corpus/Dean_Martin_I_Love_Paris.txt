Every time I look down on this timeless town  
Whether blue or gray be the sky  
Whether loud be her cheers or where soft be her tears  
More and more do I realize  
I love Paris in the springtime  
I love Paris in the fall  
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles  
Ooh, I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles  
I love Paris every moment  
Every moment of the year  
I love Paris  
Why oh why do I love Paris  
Because my love is so near  
Oh, I love Paris every moment  
Every moment of the year  
I love Paris  
My oh my do I love Paris  
Because my love is near  
Love is near  
Love is near  
Ah, Paris
