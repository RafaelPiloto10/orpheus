You could flap you wings a thousand miles away  
Butterfly  
A laughing salesman sings  
His world so far away  
Butterfly  
  
Butterfly (repeat)  
  
You could take the storm away forever every day  
'Cause you're mine  
And I don't know what to say  
You could let my smile disappear for a year  
'Cause you're mine  
That's the only way I like it to be  
  
Butterfly (repeat)  
  
Now we get to the best part  
It happens all the time, telling me all your lies  
You get your kicks from seeing me on the floor  
Tied to your bed  
Tied to the things you said  
Butterfly coming back  
Butterfly coming back  
  
Butterfly
