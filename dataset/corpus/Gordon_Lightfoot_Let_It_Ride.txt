These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you  
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true  
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun  
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find  
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind  
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind  
I just let it ride  
I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night  
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight  
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground  
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found  
He just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots  
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops  
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot  
They just let it ride  
One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by  
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried  
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light  
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night  
They just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal  
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all  
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon  
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride
