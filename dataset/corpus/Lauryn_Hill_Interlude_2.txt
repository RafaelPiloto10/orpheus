Can I get some of that tea, some of that tea. I know I sound rhaspy but that's  
Hey, I used to go on tour ya know, and I'd be a prisoner, I used to be a  
Prisoner on tour cause I would go on tour and tour your'e supposed to enjoy
and  
Have a good time but I'd be this prisoner in the hotel you know drinkin' tea  
And ya know tellin' children ya know mommy has to sleep cause I wanted to  
Maintain this ya know emmaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic, ya  
Know reality is sometimes I stay up late and this is what I sound like when I  
Wake up the next day, and ya know its a voice ya know and to me the the more I  
Uh focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message,  
Because when I am I used to be so ya know oh my god if I sound ya know harsh  
And rhaspy I can't go out there, that's a lie ya know I just sound like a  
Singer with a lot of stuff in her throat.  
  
So, I told the people at MTV that they gotta like me better if not then people  
Are gonna keep on sayin' who's that boy on stage. Who's that little boy. OK,  
We're just finishing tune up, OK...
