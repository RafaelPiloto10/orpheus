I'm a big fuckin' dick  
I'm a pain in your ass  
I drink all your beer  
I'll eat the last slice  
I'll give you charley horses  
I'll pull your shorts down at the beach  
I always need a ride  
Nobody likes me  
  
My name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I spit when I talk  
I swear in front of your mother  
I throw shit at the movies  
I wear tight pants  
I ask you to buy an extra Yankee ticket  
And then I don't show  
I tell you I saw your girlfriend  
Fucking two guys at a party  
  
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I'll piss on your toilet seat and tell your dad you got stoned  
I'll borrow your jacket and never think of returning it  
  
Polychronopolous  
Pansy  
Pussy  
Shit for brains  
Douchebag  
  
I'll leave your gate open  
So your dog runs away  
I'll make fun of your pimple  
Then I'll grab your sister's ass  
  
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
And I don't care  
And I don't give a shit  
  
I'll break your brother's stereo  
And then tell him it was you  
You think you're better than me  
Well you're fucking wrong  
  
Everybody knows I'm Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
Deal with it
