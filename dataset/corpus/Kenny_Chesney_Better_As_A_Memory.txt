I move on like a sinner's prayer  
Letting go like a levee breaks  
Walk away as if I don't care  
Learn to shoulder my mistakes  
I'm built to fade like your favorite song  
I get reckless when there's no need  
Laugh as your stories ramble on  
Break my heart but it won't bleed  
My only friends are pirates, it's just who I am  
I'm better as a memory than as your man  
  
I'm never sure when the truth won't do  
I'm pretty good on a lonely night  
I move on the way a storm blows through  
I never stay, but then again, I might  
I struggle sometimes to find the words  
Always sure until I doubt  
Walk a line until it blurs  
Build the walls too high to climb out  
I'm honest to a fault, it's just who I am  
I'm better as a memory than as your man  
  
I see you lean in, you're bound to fall  
I don't wanna be that mistake  
I'm just a dreamer, nothing more  
You should know it before it gets too late  
  
'Cause good-bye's are like a roulette wheel  
You never know where they're gonna land  
First you're spinning, then you're standing still  
Left holding a losing hand  
One day you're gonna find someone  
Right away, you'll know it's true  
That all of your seeking's done  
Was just a part of the passing through  
Right there in that moment  
You'll finally understand  
That I was better as a memory than as your man  
Better as a memory than as your man
