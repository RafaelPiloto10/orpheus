Chorus  
Our Father which art in heaven, in heaven  
Hallowed be Thy name  
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done  
On earth as it is in heaven  
  
Verse  
Give us this day  
Our daily bread  
And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors  
  
Bridge  
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  
  
Vamp  
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory  
Forever and ever, Amen, Amen (2x)  
Forever and ever (3x)  
  
Ending  
Amen
