There goes the siren that warns of the air raid  
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak  
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne  
Got to get up for the coming attack.  
  
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines  
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste  
Gathering speed as we head down the runway  
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.  
  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again.  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving.  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.  
  
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers  
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away  
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them  
Move to their blindsides and firing again.  
  
Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us  
Ten ME-109's out of the sun  
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them  
Heading straight for them I press down my guns  
  
Rolling, turning, diving  
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live,  
Aces high.
