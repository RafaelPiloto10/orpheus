Mm--"Is she really going out with him?  
"Well, there she is, Let's ask her"  
"Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?"  
"Mm-hm"  
"Gee, it must be great riding with him"  
"Is he picking you up after school today?"  
"Mm-mm"  
"By the way, where did you meet him?"  
  
"I met him at the candy store  
He turned around and smiled at me  
You get the picture  
"Yes, we see"  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
My folks were always putting him down  
They said he came from the wrong side of town  
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad  
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
One day my dad said find someone new  
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through  
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry  
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack  
  
Do do  
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye  
The tears were beginning to show  
As he drove away on that rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,  
I'll never know Look out! Look out! Look out!  
  
I felt so helpless, what could I do  
Remembering all the things we'd been through?  
In school they all stop and stare  
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care  
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack  
  
Ooh, the leader of the pack now he's gone  
the leader of the pack now he's gone  
the leader of the pack now he's gone
