I'm doing very well  
I can block out the present and the past now  
I know by now you think I should have  
Straightened myself out - Thank you, drop dead!  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can barely describe  
There is no love in modern life  
  
I'm doing very well  
It's a miracle I even made it this far  
The motion of taxis excites me  
When you peel it back and bite me  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can barely describe  
There is no hope in modern life  
  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can't fight  
No true friends in modern life  
  
Diazepam that's valium, Temazepam, Lithium, HRT, ECT  
How long must I stay on this stuff?  
Don't give me anymore  
Don't give me anymore  
Don't give me anymore  
Please don't give me anymore  
Don't give anymore  
Don't give anymore  
You swore you would not give anymore  
Don't give anymore, don't give anymore...  
  
You swore, you swore, you swore  
You swore you would not give anymore  
Give anymore, give anymore, give anymore...
