I'm not a cry baby  
I'm the cry baby  
A caterpillar that got stuck  
Mr. Moth come quick with any luck  
A long walk to a dark house  
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart  
I've got your body doing alright  
Hate me baby, maybe I'm a piece of art  
  
Oh, my friends all lie and say  
They only want the best wishes for me  
Oh, three, two, one  
We go live  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, baby you're a classic  
Like a little black dress  
You're a faded moon  
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)  
Whoa, whoa  
And oh, baby you're a classic  
Like a little black dress  
But you'll be faded soon  
Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)  
Whoa, whoa  
  
I can make your heart slow  
I can feel the weather in my bones  
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like  
Your pupils they're big  
They're rolling like dice  
They say they only want the best wishes for me  
(They only want the best for me)  
Oh, three, two, one  
We go live  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Not the boy I was  
The boy I am is just venting, venting  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
  
Not the boy I was  
The boy I am is just venting, venting  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city  
  
They say they only want the best wishes for me  
(They only want the best for me)  
Oh, three, two, one  
We go live  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa, whoa
