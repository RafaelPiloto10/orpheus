What does it mean when you have nothing to say,  
When the memmories and contant thoguhts wont go away.  
There's something about you that I can't let go  
But if we never meet there's nothing to show.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
You talk to everyone except me.  
How do you expect this thing to be?  
I don't want to say good-bye  
Because you've reailed me in so fast,  
Befor I was tought how.  
  
I go mornings and nights thinking about how it could have been,  
But the pain inside didn't want to give in. And somehow I the tears seem to
fade away.  
Thinking to myself maby one day...  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
Nomater what happens to our love  
I'll always remember your touch,  
And the way you talk  
Ohh, the way you walk.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.
