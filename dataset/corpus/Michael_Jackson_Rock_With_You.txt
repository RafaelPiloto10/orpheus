Girl, close your eyes  
Let that rhythm get into you  
Don't try to fight it  
There ain't nothing that you can do  
Relax your mind  
Lay back and groove with mine  
You gotta feel that heat  
And we can ride the boogie  
Share that beat of love  
  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Dance you into day (sunlight)  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Rock the night away  
  
Out on the floor  
There ain't nobody there but us  
Girl when you dance  
There's a magic that must be love  
Just take it slow  
Cause we got so far to go  
You gotta feel that heat  
And we can ride the boogie  
Share that beat of love  
  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Dance you into day (sunlight)  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Rock the night away  
  
And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah)  
You know that love survives  
So we can rock forever, on  
  
I want to rock with you  
I want to groove with you  
  
I want to rock (all night) with you girl (sunlight)  
Rock with you, rock with you girl (yeah) (all night)  
Dance the night away  
  
I want to rock with you (yeah) (all night)  
Rock you into day (sunlight)  
I want to rock with you (all night)  
Rock the night away  
  
Feel the heat feel the heat  
Rock you into day (sunlight)  
I want to rock-rock the night away.
