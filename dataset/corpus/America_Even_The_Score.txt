I stayed up all night long  
Drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout you  
Is there anything left at all  
Is there anything that I can do  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
I don't know how to even the score with you, with you  
Starin' hard at that big front door  
Is it time now to find my shoes  
It ain't the loss of love no more  
I'm just tryin' hard to live with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, with you  
With you, with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Is love a question, who's weak, who's strong  
I can't see it, where's a compromise  
It's so confusin' where this thing has gone  
It's gotta stop, you've gotta realize  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  
I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you
