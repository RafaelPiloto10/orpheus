I'm driving through the night  
I'm driving through the rain  
The engine roars I'm on my way  
Away from Mr. Pain  
  
My eyes keep seeing what  
My mind wants to forget  
Those sequences they  
Rock 'n' Roll inside my head  
  
Over and over and over again  
I concentrate harder and harder and then  
You are just an image  
(that I can't see)  
  
You are not for real  
You turn into a picture of somebody  
Someone I don't know  
Someone I don't feel  
  
(just an)  
The wolves cry out tonight  
I see your broken line  
The sun will rise without  
  
A love without a smile  
I always think about  
The way you had to leave  
I close my eyes  
  
'Cause I was with you  
By that time  
Faster and faster and faster-ahead  
As if you were waiting  
  
For my down the way  
I have never seen you  
Lying on a floor  
Crying needing more  
(just an)
