(Rita Macneil)  
  
Weary the travellers that carry the Babe  
Long is the journey the wise men will make  
While out through the darkness there shines a bright light  
And into the morning the world will rejoice  
  
Listen to the drummer boy, beating on the drum  
Shepherds gather closer to wait for the dawn  
And off in the distance the Child that is born  
Is sleeping softly in the peace of the morn  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now the bells ring, now the bells ring  
The goods news has come  
The message is clear now  
The world is reborn  
  
Now hear the children singing His praise  
All of the world will remember this day  
While all through the ages,  
This story has been told  
And down through the pages the miracle unfolds  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now hear the children, singing His praise  
(Praise to the Child that is born)  
All of the world will remember this day  
(On this Christmas Day morn)  
While all through the ages, this story has been told  
And down through the pages the miracle unfolds  
  
[Chorus 2x]
