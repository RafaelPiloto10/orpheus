If you're looking for me  
You'll find me resting in the shade  
Of the mountains and trees  
Beneath the cool summer breeze  
And I don't mind if you stay  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
People talking to me  
Someone saying that I'm not the same  
That's not so easy to be  
But when I'll learn to be free  
I wonder if I'll miss the pain  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
All I want you to know  
Is that I love you so much  
I can hardly stand it  
When everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone  
Everybody's alone
