Are you sure you want to hear more  
What if I ain't worth the while  
Not the style you'd be looking for  
If I'm sweet tonight  
Things look different in the morning light  
I'm jealous and I'm proud  
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Would I be the one you seek  
Mild and meek like the girl next door  
Don't you realize  
I may be an angel in disguise  
It's lonely to be free  
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
I don't believe in fairy-tales  
Sweet nothings in my ear  
But I do believe in sympathy  
That's me, you see  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Won't you have a drink with me  
Just to see you're not really sore  
I can't help my ways  
I'm just not the girl to hide my face  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
There's a special love  
Like an eagle flying with a dove  
I'll find it in the end  
If I keep on searching, but until then  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me
