Let's take the final step and get married cause a true love is all I'm looking
for  
  
Well I hope someday that I'll make you a million  
  
Cause right now all that I can give you is my heart  
  
But I've got two arms that were made just to hold you tight  
  
And a real love to keep you satisfied  
  
And I've got two lips that are just for kissing yours goodnight  
  
And these two eyes that will never see you cry  
  
I'd like to give you diamond rings from the start  
  
But right now all that I can give you is my heart  
  
Your love can't be bought for any price I know  
  
Though I'd give anything to call you mine  
  
But thank God you want me for just what I am  
  
Cause right now all that I can give you is my heart  
  
Right now all that I can give you is my heart
