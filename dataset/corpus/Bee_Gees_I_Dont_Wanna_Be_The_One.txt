It's too late to turn back now  
There ain't no space back there  
And how did I begin to lose my self control  
How did I begin to lose my self control  
  
There ain't a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be the one  
Remember it was only fun  
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end  
I don't want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend  
  
There ain't a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend  
You know as well as I know you're my only friend  
You're my only friend  
My only friend  
My only friend
