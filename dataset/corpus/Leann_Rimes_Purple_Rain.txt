I never meant to cause you any sorrow  
I never meant to cause you any pain  
I only wanted to one time see you laughing  
I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain  
  
Purple rain purple rain  
Purple rain purple rain  
Purple rain purple rain  
I only wanted to see you in the purple rain  
  
I never wanted to be your weekend lover  
I only wanted to be some kind of friend  
Baby I could never steal you from another  
It's such a shame our friendship had to end  
  
Purple rain purple rain  
Purple rain purple rain  
Purple rain purple rain  
I only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey I know, I know times are changing  
It's time we all reach out for something new  
That means you to  
You say you want a leader  
But you can't seem to make up your mind  
I think you better close it  
And let me guide you to the purple rain  
  
Purple rain purple rain  
Purple rain purple rain  
  
If you know what I'm singing about up here  
C'mon raise your hand  
  
Purple rain purple rain  
  
I only want to see you  
Only want to see you  
In the purple rain
