Somebody calls me on the phone.  
Say hey-hey is Dee-Dee home.  
You want to take a walk.  
You want to go cop.  
You want to go get some Chinese Rock.  
  
I'm livin' on a Chinese Rock.  
All my best things are in hock.  
I'm livin' on a Chinese rock.  
Everything is in the pawn shop.  
  
The plaster fallin' of the wall.  
My girlfriend cryin' in the shower  
Stall.  
It's hot as a bitch.  
I should've been rich.  
But I'm just diggin' a Chinese ditch.
