Nobody feels any pain,  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain.  
Ev'rybody knows  
That baby's got new clothes,  
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls.  
  
She takes just like a woman,  
She makes love just like a woman,  
And she aches just like a woman.  
But she breaks just like a little girl.  
  
Queen Mary, she's my friend,  
Oh I believe that I'll go see her again.  
Nobody has to guess  
That baby can't be blessed  
Till she finds out she's like all the rest,  
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls.  
  
She aches just like a woman, yes she does  
She takes just like a woman, yes she does  
She makes love just like a woman, yes she does  
But she breaks just like a little girl.  
  
It was raining from the first  
And I was dying there of thirst,  
So I came in here.  
And your long time curse a' hurts,  
But you know honey what's worse  
Is this pain in here,  
I can't stay in here,  
Ain't it clear.  
  
Oh I just don't fit,  
I believe that it's time for us to quit.  
When we meet again  
And introduced as friends  
Please don't let on  
That you knew me when  
I was hungry and it was your world.  
  
You fake just like a woman, yes she does  
And make love just like a woman, yes she does  
Then you ache just like a woman, yes she does  
But you break just just like a little girl, break like a girl  
  
Oo, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Just like a woman, woman, woman.
