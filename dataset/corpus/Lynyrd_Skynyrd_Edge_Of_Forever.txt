I hear the rumors flyin'  
About a head on crash  
At the stroke of midnight  
When centuries clash  
Some gonna party  
Some gonna kneel and pray  
  
Well you can quote the bible  
Bribe the devil  
But there's gonna be some hell to pay  
  
We were young and innocent  
Thought this day would never come  
And tomorrow seems a million miles away  
  
Let's look each other in the eyes  
And realize it could be time  
To set aside our anger  
And know we're all the same  
  
Take my hand  
We gonna cross the line  
To a brand new day on the end of time  
We're gonna rise as one and fall together  
Out here on the ledge  
Standin' on the edge, of forever  
  
From the silence I hear the thunder roll  
Words of the prophets echo in my soul  
One salvation in this world to me  
I know in my heart if we love each other  
We can face what's meant to be  
  
We were young and innocent  
Thought this day would never come  
And tomorrow seems a million miles away  
  
Now there's power in the wrong hands  
A madman in a foreign land  
If we don't get our senses  
It's all gonna slip away  
  
Take my hand  
We gonna cross the line  
To a brand new day on the end of time  
We're gonna rise as one and fall together  
Out here on the ledge  
Standin' on the edge, of forever  
  
Take my hand  
We're gonna cross the line  
To a brand new day on the end of time  
We're gonna rise as one and fall together  
Out here on the ledge  
Standin' on the edge  
Out here on the ledge  
Dancin' on the edge, forever  
Oh, oh forever, oh forever
