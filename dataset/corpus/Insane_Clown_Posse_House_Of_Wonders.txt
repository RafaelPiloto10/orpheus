So there you are you're sittin' there just kinda chillin'  
A richie boy you look a little bit like Dylan  
The 90210 bitch with the funny hair  
So I'm gonna change a few things around here and there  
Start with your eyes I pluck 'em both out your head  
And pull your balls out your sack and stick 'em there instead  
Then I snap off your toes and stick 'em in your nose  
And pull the hair out your head until your skull shows  
You're almost ready, gotta fix you for the show tonight  
But your lips, man, to me, they just don't look right  
They could be a little fatter, even more  
So fuckin' fat that your lip is draggin' on the floor  
Tie your tongue into a knot and stretch it out  
And tack a sign on it, tellin' what you're all about  
Set you up, 'cause now you're ready, so open up the door  
'cause at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Carnival thrills  
Carnival shows  
Carnival excites you  
Carnival kills  
(Ah, oh, ah, oh)  
Another freak show for the jugga-lugga-lo  
  
So there you are, come on in, chickie, wow! Ain't you a pretty?  
I think I'll start with the silicone that's in your titty  
I'll pull it out and put it in your forehead and cheek  
So now, you look like the elephant bitch freak  
Don't try to run, chickie-poo, I'm just gettin' started  
I'll beat your head in with a brick until you're half-retarded  
Remember that ugly girl you laughed at at the prom?  
Don't try to laugh now, bitch, you look like her mom  
You came to do the starin', but it's you they're starin' at  
I'll stuff you full of chili-cheese dogs to make you fat  
Then I'll stretch your fuckin' lips and stick 'em in your ear  
So all that evil shit you talk, only you can hear  
I shave you bald, and glue your titty on the top  
And then I spit on your nipple until you drop  
Hey! Almost ready? Jump steady, open the door  
Cause at the House of Wonders, you're the freak show  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Oh, oh, oh my God [Repeat: x2]  
Oh my God"  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
