I don't want to be in your company,  
I don't need you take care of me,  
Let me long, let me long, let me long, won't you let me be,  
'Cause all I want in this world is to say I'm a man as we,  
  
People talk about the way i look,  
I think that all the things they say have got enough to write a book,  
But don't they know, don't they know, don't they know, it's a waste of breath  
'Cause I don't want to be like them I just want to be myself  
Woke up !  
  
Don't try and push your ??? trust my way,  
'Cause baby I lose my soul and that's where is gonna stay  
You try to put them down on the ground, anywhere, that you choose  
Get your kids from your fist 'cause baby this time, you gonna lose  
Woke up !
