You can look at the menu, but you just can't eat  
You can feel the cushion, but you can't have a seat  
You can dip your foot in the pool, but you can't have a swim  
You can feel the punishment, but you can't commit the sin  
  
And you want her, and she wants you  
We want everyone  
And you want her and she wants you  
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame  
You can build a mansion, but you just can't live in it  
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win  
Some break the rules, and let you cut the cost  
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost  
  
You can see the summit but you can't reach it  
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit  
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain  
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain  
  
No one ever is to blame, No one ever is to blame
