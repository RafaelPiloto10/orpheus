Pretty soon we were takin' it serious  
Me and you underneath a mysterious spell  
Nothin' I could do and it suddenly felt like a bolt out of hell  
I'm tellin' you  
To the sound of the beat I was hanging on  
Like a powerful truth, it was banging on me  
Wouldn't let me go  
Like a shot in the dark she was hot like a spark  
I only know  
Neither one of us trying to hold it down  
Neither one of us taking the middle ground  
Wasn't how to make sense we were thinkin' of  
Just the two of us bent on delirious love  
Me and you being spent on delirious love  
Like a ride on a rocket it took us up  
Didn't want it to stop and it shook us up good  
We were moving fast  
Just ahead of the law  
We were beggin' for more  
And what a blast  
Comin' round to a new kind of view of it  
Never did it before we were doin' it now  
And I gotta say it was easy to give  
Was a reason to live another day  
Neither one of us stopping to figure out  
What the roll and the rockin' was all about  
All we knew was that we couldn't get enough  
You and me in the heat of delirious love  
Makin' time to the beat of delirious love  
I can feel it  
I can feel it  
I can feel it  
  
Come down had a new kind of view of it  
Wouldn't do it before we were doin' it now  
And I gotta say it was easy to give  
Was a reason to live another day  
Neither one of us stoppin' to figure out  
What the roll and the rockin' was all about  
All we knew was that we couldn't get enough  
You and me in the heat of delirious love  
Makin' time to the beat of delirious love  
You and me gettin' sweet on delirious love
