White Christmas and I'm blue  
Like fireworks with no fuse  
Christmas without you  
  
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning  
The pages of memories of time spent with you  
Old christmas songs we knew and used to make love to  
Make it hard to get used to  
Christmas without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Christmas without you  
White christmas and I'm blue  
I love you I miss you  
So sad but so true  
Christmas without you  
  
Like a mystery with no clues  
Like fireworks with no fuse  
Christmas without you  
  
The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow  
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas eve  
The most joyous christmas if luck could be with us  
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me  
  
[Chorus 2x]
