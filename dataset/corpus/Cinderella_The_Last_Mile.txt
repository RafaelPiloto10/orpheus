Oh  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Me and Billy boy and old lady Jane  
We hitched a ride took a fast movin' train  
got to the top with our heads spinnin' round  
You never know just what you got until it's comin' back  
  
Down on the farm in the Mississippi shade  
The folks down there they told me  
Take it day by day  
  
And walk the last mile (before I sleep)  
It'll be awhile (before I get my peace)  
Last Mile (I walk slowly)  
The last mile (I can rest my feet)  
  
I got a long way to go before I reach the light of day  
Monkey's on my back I gotta find a better way  
Same ole story never get just what you want  
The more you get the more you want  
so tell me to and get picked up  
I guess I've always been a traveling man  
'Cause when I'm movin' I can make a stand yeah, yeah  
  
And walk the last mile (before I sleep)  
It'll be awhile (before I get my peace)  
Last Mile (I walk slowly)  
The last mile (I can rest my feet)  
  
Don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been  
Look around me everybody's trying to win  
  
And walk the last mile (before I sleep)  
It'll be awhile (before I get my peace)  
Last Mile (I walk slowly)  
The last mile (I can rest my feet)
