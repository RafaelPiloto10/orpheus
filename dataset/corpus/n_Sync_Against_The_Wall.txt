I was just doin my thing hanging out at the spot  
You know the place we go The music's John blaze hot  
And everybody was feeling the dj  
Over there I saw a beautiful lady  
Back It up and the disco ball came down  
The beat gets slow and you know what happens now  
Dim the lights she's looking my way  
What more do I have to say  
  
She took my hand and never said a word at all  
She starting grinding shorty had me up against the  
Wall  
I see you bouncing now you know that I don't care at  
All  
She took me hand now she had me up against the wall  
We don't, we don't care at all  
  
It's almost 2 o'clock time to make my move  
  
We let two hours fly and then I'm goin home  
I gotta have ya more good to go I gotta have ya on  
The dance floor  
Looking for me I'll be down here baby all you need  
One more dance and our friends are all around  
The beat gets slow and you know what happens now  
Dim the lights she's looking my way  
What more do I have to say  
  
Chorus3x  
  
You know we don't care at all now let me see ya bump  
Up against the wall till end
