As little children  
We would dream of Christmas morn  
Of all the gifts and toys  
We knew we'd find  
But we never realized  
A baby born one blessed night  
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives  
  
CHORUS:  
We were the reason  
That He gave His life  
We were the reason  
That He suffered and died  
To a world that was lost  
He gave all He could give  
To show us the reason to live  
  
As the years went by  
We learned more about gifts  
The giving of ourselves  
And what that means  
On a dark and cloudy day  
A man hung crying in the rain  
All because of love, all because of love  
I've finally found the reason for living  
It's in giving every part of my heart to Him  
In all that I do every word that I say  
I'll be giving my all just for Him, for Him  
He is my reason to live
