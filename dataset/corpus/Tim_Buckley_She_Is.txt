She is the day that gives me time to live and ???? love my life.  
Till night comes on with sundown scythe to end the puzzle pantomime.  
She is a day of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.  
  
She is the bridge on which I wait to watch the river 'neath me flow.  
All spinning, surging far below  
???? ???? ?????  
She is a bridge of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.  
  
She is the air I breathe ?????  
Awake, asleep in ??? calm.  
A wind to wash my lifted palm,  
A sky that calls me out to dance.  
She is the air of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.  
  
She is the smile that keeps me warm with matchless laughter, eyes ablaze.  
A mischief mystery she plays upon the flute of early morn.  
She is a smile of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.
