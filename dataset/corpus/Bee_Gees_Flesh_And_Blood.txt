I'm not that someone who's got what you want.  
I can do nothing but watch what you do.  
You just want someone to kiss you good night,  
But lips are never enough to get you through.  
You stole my nights and you got your way,  
Now you got me dying inside, oh baby.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say.  
Pick up the pieces of my life  
Into the night of day.  
  
How do you break this heart of steel.  
Nobody ever could.  
Open the pages of my life.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
I'll be your saviour but baby I swear  
I'm not living my life over you.  
Some satisfaction you get if you dare  
But is it ever enough to get you through?  
You stole my mind and you watch me fall.  
Now you leave the scene of the crime, oh no.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
When you're gone,  
You'll be leaving behind  
A broken man with something to hide.  
Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity,  
You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say (ooh),  
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day (ooh).  
How do you break this heart of steel?  
Nobody ever could (ooh).  
Open the pages of my life,  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Gone are the days that came and went.  
Houses are made of wood (ooh).  
Live in a world of sand and stone.  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.
