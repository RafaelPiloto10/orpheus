Now that we're alone.  
No more hide and seek.  
You are the highest dream to me.  
And as you softly sleep  
then I can tell you what it means.  
  
Locked in my arms like lovers lie,  
I will not let you slip away.  
Is this the summer of them all.  
Is this my night of nights  
that you came to stay.  
  
Here you are, owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
if you promise to believe  
that it's you I'm living for  
and I could not love you more.  
  
Seasons may come and seasons go  
but these are the truest words I know.  
Face to face, eye to eye.  
This is the summer of of our lives.  
One love that cannot die.  
  
Here you are, owner of my soul,  
never let you say goodbye.  
And there is something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last, we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside.  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that I could not love you more.  
  
Here you are (you are), owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last (at last), we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside (ah).  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that it's you I'm living for  
that it's you I'm living for  
and I could not love you more.
