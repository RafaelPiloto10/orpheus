I do my best  
To find some kind of glow  
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now  
From the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
Yeah, we see that fire  
From the streets of Babylon  
To the road that we've been on now  
The kaleidoscope claims another  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in color (color)  
Today feels like no other (other)  
And the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in motion (motion)  
And just when I could run this race no more  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
This is life in color  
  
You've seen my worst  
Yet you see some hope in me  
The black and white sets us free  
Like the queen to the rook  
Your decision is a sure thing  
Honey yeah, a sure thing  
No wonder I feel  
Like I'm missing a heavy load  
But no matter what daylight brings to us  
We all know  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in color (color)  
Today feels like no other (other)  
And the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in motion (motion)  
And just when I could run this race no more  
The sun bursts, clouds break  
This is life in color  
This is life in color  
  
This is life in color  
Today feels like no other  
And the darkest grays  
The sun bursts, cloud breaks  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
Well this is life in motion (motion)  
Just when I could run this race no more  
The sun bursts, cloud breaks  
This is life in color  
This is life in color
