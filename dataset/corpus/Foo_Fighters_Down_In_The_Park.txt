Down in the park where the machmen meet  
The machine and play kill by numbers  
Down in the park with a friend called five  
I was in a car crash or was it the war  
But I never been quite the same  
Little white lies like I was there  
  
Come to tom-tom's the place to eat  
Like it was built in one day  
You can wath the humans trying to run  
Oh look, there's a rape machine  
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way  
Wouldn't believe the things they do  
  
Down in the park  
Where the chant is death, death, death  
Til' sun cries morning  
Down in the park with friends of mine  
We are not lovers, we are not romantics  
We are here to serve  
Different face but the words never change
