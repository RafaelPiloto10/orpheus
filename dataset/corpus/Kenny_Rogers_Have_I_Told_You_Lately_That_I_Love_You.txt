Have I told you lately that I love you  
Have I told you there's no one else above you  
Fill my heart with gladness  
Take away all my sadness  
Ease my troubles that's what you do.  
  
For the morning sun and all its glory  
Greets the day with hope and comfort too  
You fill my life with laughter  
Take it away and make it better  
Ease my troubles that's what you do.  
There's a love lost you found  
And it's yours and it's mine  
Like the sun, and at the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray  
To the one, oh, to the one.
