Maybe far away or maybe real nearby  
He maybe pouring her coffee  
She maybe straightenin' his tie  
Maybe in a house all hidden by a hill  
She's sittin' playin' piano  
He's sittin' payin' the bills  
  
Betcha they're young  
Betcha they're smart  
Bet they're collecting like ashtrays and art  
Betcha they're good why shouldn't they be  
Their one mistake was givin' up me  
  
So maybe now it's time  
And maybe when I'm wake  
They'll be there calling me baby, maybe  
  
Betcha he reads  
Betcha she sews  
Maybe she's made me a closet of clothes  
Maybe they're straight as straight as a line  
Don't really care as long as they're mine  
  
So maybe now this prayer  
The last one of it's kind  
Won't you please and get your baby  
Maybe...
