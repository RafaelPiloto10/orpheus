Feelin' better, now that we're through  
Feelin' better, 'cause I'm over you  
I learned my lesson, it left a scar  
Now I see how you really are  
  
[Chorus]  
You're no good, you're no good  
You're no good, baby you're no good  
I'm gonna say it again  
You're no good, you're no good  
You're no good, baby you're no good  
  
I broke her heart, it's gentle and true  
Yes I broke her heart, over someone like you  
I'll beg his forgiveness, on bended knee  
I wouldn't blame him, if he says to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Forget me, it's over)  
  
You're no good, you're no good  
You're no good, baby you're no good  
  
Baby, oh baby, you're no good  
You're no good, you're no good  
  
[Choruse]  
  
I'm tellin' you now baby  
That I'm going my way  
Forget about you baby  
I'm on my way
