Mrs. Blaileen - she was a sixth grade teacher  
And she controlled the children  
By using humiliation.  
The target always seemed to be Donny.  
  
He was a bit slower than the others.  
When he was quite young  
His mother died at the kitchen table  
While choking on some food.  
  
The fashion of the day  
Was bleach and tied Levi's.  
Donny decided to make some,  
But he didn't know to rinse them.  
  
So he came to school a reekin'.  
Bleach stenched filled the classroom.  
Mrs. Blaileen began to chastise.  
She made him feel like an asshole  
  
Two feet small.  
Oh what a lonely boy.  
Don and Ronald  
They always stuck together  
  
For they were a bit different than the others  
And they were as tight as brothers  
Then Ronald moved away.  
Now Steven  
  
He was year or two younger  
And he really thought he was something.  
He liked to harass other children  
Or anyone he found outnumbered.  
  
Alone Don walks from fishing.  
Steven and his friend they stop him.  
They took his hat and they taunt him,  
Pimp-slap him with a newspaper.  
  
Don lunged forward with his fish knife  
Then ran all the way home weeping.  
He gave his knife to his father and  
Said I think I hurt Steve.  
Oh what a lonely boy.
