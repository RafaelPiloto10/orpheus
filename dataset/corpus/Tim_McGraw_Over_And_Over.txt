'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
Yeah,I can't shake it, no  
  
I can't wait to see you  
want to see if you still got that  
Look in your eye  
That one you had for me  
Before we said our goodbyes  
And it's a shame that we  
Gotta spend our time  
Being mad about the same things  
Over and over again  
About the same thing  
Over and over again  
  
Oh but I think she's leaving on  
And she's leaving here  
And I don't know what else to do  
(Can't go on not loving you)  
  
'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no  
  
I remember the day you left  
I remember the last breath  
You took right in front of me  
When you said that you would leave  
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you  
Or say anything  
But I see clearly now  
And this choice I made keeps  
Playing in my head  
Over and over again  
It play in my head  
Over and over again  
  
Oh but I think she's leaving on  
And she's leaving here  
And I don't know what else to do  
(Can't go on not loving you)  
  
'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no  
  
Now that I realize  
That I'm going down  
From all this pain you  
Put me through  
Every time I close my eyes  
I lock it down  
Oh, I can't go on not loving you  
  
Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no  
  
'Cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I can't keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah, cause it's all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I can't take it  
I can't shake it, no
