No one can stop me know  
I'm like a human dynamo  
Live wired and chargin' out with power  
This time I won't hold back  
I'm rarin' to get up and go  
Fuelled up and growin' by the hour  
  
Look out  
I'm blastin' through the lines  
Alive and kickin'  
Watch out  
I'm young and lethal  
I'm goin' from here until eternity  
  
I'm feelin' reckless  
Way outa hand, a real survivor  
Reckless  
Comin' at gale force ten  
  
Around me I feel the shock waves,  
Building for the energy  
A force field no one can break through  
Solid as rock no wonder  
I am indestructible  
First placed in everything I do  
  
Look out  
I'm blastin' through the lines  
Alive and kickin'  
Watch out  
I'm young and lethal  
I'm goin' from here until eternity  
  
I'm feelin' reckless  
Way outa hand, a real survivor  
Reckless  
Comin' at gale force ten  
  
Radioactive  
I'm shootin' through the atmosphere  
Takin' off  
I'm headin' like a rocket through the stratosphere.  
  
Look out  
I'm blastin' through the lines  
Alive and kickin'  
Watch out  
I'm young and lethal  
I'm goin' from here until eternity  
  
I'm feelin' reckless  
Way outa hand, a real survivor  
Reckless  
Comin' at gale force ten  
I'm feelin' reckless  
Way outa hand, a real survivor  
Reckless  
Comin' at gale force  
Comin' at gale force ten  
I'm feelin' reckless  
Way outa hand, a real survivor  
Reckless  
Comin' at gale force  
Comin' at gale force ten
