They were attacked by surprise  
In the middle of the night  
They didn't stand a single chance  
A single chance to fight  
After the battle they gathered around the king  
And they had never seen that man so sad  
  
"I'm tiding out to get those men  
Who hurt my people bad, so bad"  
  
The king will return  
With gold in his hand  
The castle will burn  
In the enemy land  
And he will save our people  
  
When two springs had passed a messenger  
Came down the track  
He said that he had heard great news  
"The king is coming back"  
Oh the time he was gone  
They suffered bad in misery  
They didn't know the way  
  
Everyone was shouting  
Save our kingdom now  
  
They suffered bad in pain  
The time he was away  
But maybe now they could survive  
Now they could survive  
  
When the king came down the hill  
To his people and his land  
There were many tears  
That touched the ground  
And made marks in the sand  
Yes now they could start all over again  
And live in peace throughout time  
  
Everyone was shouting  
When the king came down the hill  
  
The king is returning with gold in his hand  
The castle is burning  
In the enemy land  
The king is
