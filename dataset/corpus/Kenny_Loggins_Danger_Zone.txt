Revvin' up your engine  
Listen to her howlin' roar  
Metal under tension  
Beggin' you to touch and go  
  
Highway to the danger zone  
Ride into the danger zone  
  
Headin' into twilight  
Spreadin' out her wings tonight  
She got you jumpin' off the track  
And shovin' into overdrive  
  
Highway to the danger zone  
I'll take you  
Ridin' into the danger zone  
  
You'll never say hello to you  
Until you get it on the red line overload  
You'll never know what you can do  
Until you get it up as high as you can go  
  
Out along the edges  
Always where I burn to be  
The further on the edge  
The hotter the intensity  
  
Highway to the danger zone  
Gonna take you  
Right into the danger zone  
  
Highway to the danger zone
