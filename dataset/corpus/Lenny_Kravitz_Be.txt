Lord what's the matter  
Am I lost  
This life's a disaster, what is the cause  
Am I a junkie, what is my fate  
Or am I a flunkie who doesn't relate  
Or am I a child so full of hate  
  
Am I a doctor or even a priest  
Or am I a rapist who needs a release  
A psychotic prancer  
Times Square dancer  
The mind can see as long as you'll be  
For real with yourself  
And you'll forever be  
  
Lord what's the matter am I insane  
This life's an illusion that's all it remains  
Are you listening, are you boss  
Am I gonna make it up on that cross  
Believe in Your name and  
You'll forever be
