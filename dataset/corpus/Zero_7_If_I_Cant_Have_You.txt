Have you ever wondered  
If it smarts when you've hurt and ignored  
Oh, the sort that goes away  
Even though I waited for you  
Oh, how I adore you  
  
You never saw my face  
I traced your path each day  
We could be always together  
  
Now I watch you bleed  
You had all I need  
How I love you so  
Now we'll never know  
If I can't have you  
  
I even did the research  
Went to work, learned to flirt  
Wore a skirt and faced dirt  
And, ah, still you didn't notice  
You never focused on me  
  
You never saw my face  
I traced your path each day  
You never lifted your eyes to me, ah  
  
Now I watch you bleed  
You had all I need  
How I love you so  
Now we'll never know  
If I can't have you  
  
If I can't have you  
If I can't have you  
If I can't have you
