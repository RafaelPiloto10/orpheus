[Verse:]  
Don't think  
Sorry's easily said  
Don't try  
Turning tables instead  
You've taken lots of chances before  
But I ain't gonna give anymore  
Don't ask me  
That's how it goes  
Cause part of me knows what you're thinking  
Don't say  
Words you're gonna regret  
Don't let  
Fire rush to your head  
I've heard the accusation before  
And I ain't gonna take anymore  
Believe me  
The sun in your eyes  
Made some of the lies worth believing  
  
[Chorus 1]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't leave  
False illusions behind  
Don't cry  
I ain't changing my mind  
So find another fool like before  
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing  
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind  
  
[Chorus 3 -Final]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind
