I'm holding the key  
I need no license to ride  
Dad said that I'm alright  
  
The engine's still warm  
She'd been waiting for me in the barn  
Gonna make me feel,  
Gonna make me feel alright  
  
Well I'm bouncin' in my seat  
I try to remember where all the levers are  
I've got enough fuel this time  
I've got enough fuel this time to remember  
  
The engine's still warm  
She's been waiting for me in the barn  
Gonna let me feel, gonna help me feel  
  
Well I'm bouncin' in my seat  
I try to remember where all the levers are  
I've got enough fuel this time  
I've got enough fuel this time to remember  
  
Enter the Earth  
We're scratching our play on the growth of the moon  
Mom said, that I'm alright
