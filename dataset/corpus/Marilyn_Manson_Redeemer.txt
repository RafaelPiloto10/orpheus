The hunger inside given to me,  
Makes me what I am.  
Always it is calling me,  
For the blood of man.  
  
They say I cannot be this,  
I am jaded.  
Hiding from the day,  
I can't bare it,  
Cannot tame the hunger in me  
  
Oh, I say I did it,  
Always searching,  
You can't fuck with me.  
So instead you'll taste my pain.  
  
The hunger inside given to me,  
Makes me feel alive.  
Always out stalking prey,  
In the dark I hide.  
Feeling, falling, hating,  
Feel like I am fading, hating life.  
  
They say I cannot be this,  
I am jaded.  
Hiding from the day.  
I can't bare it,  
I cannot tame the hunger in me  
  
Oh, I say I did it  
Always searching,  
You can't fuck with fate.  
So instead you'll taste my pain.  
  
You say your life I'm taking,  
Always bothering me.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I'm failing, always smothering me  
  
You look down on me,  
Hey what you see,  
Take this gift from me.  
You will soon be me.  
  
Nothing seems exciting,  
Always the same hiding  
  
It's haunting me.  
It's haunting me.  
It's haunting me.  
It's haunting me.  
  
It's haunting me
