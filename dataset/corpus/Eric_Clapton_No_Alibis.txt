I beg your pardon, hello darlin'  
This is me you're talkin' to  
Sit down and tell me about it  
You don't have to shout it at me  
Tell me what you really want to do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't give me no alibis  
No untrue stories you're trying to justify  
Don't want no alibis  
Just another reason for another lie  
  
Mountain gets steeper  
The hole you dig gets deeper  
You better stop and climb out  
'Cause I'm trying to give it all to you  
Baby I can see right through you  
Sometimes you lose what it's all about  
  
Don't give me no alibis  
Can't go through life trying to justify  
Don't want no alibis  
Just another reason for another lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mountain gets steeper  
The hole you dig is getting deeper  
Better reach out and pull yourself out  
Nobody ever gonna love you the way that I love you  
And I never want to see you doin' without  
  
[Chorus: x2]
