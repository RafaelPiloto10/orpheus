Sometimes I wonder  
If I'd ever make it through  
Through this world  
without having in you  
I just wouldn't have a clue  
Cause sometimes it seems  
Like this world's closing in on me  
And there's no way of breaking free  
And then I see you reach for me  
Sometimes I want to give up  
want to give in  
I want to quit the fight  
And then I see you baby  
And everything's alright  
Everything's alright  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light  
Oh I see it shining  
right through the rain  
When I see you smile  
Baby when I see you smile at me  
Oh yeah  
Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do  
What the touch of your hand can do  
It's like nothing that I ever knew  
Hey  
And when the rain is falling  
I don't feel it  
Cause you're here with me now  
I want to ask you baby  
It's all I'll ever need  
All I'll ever need  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light  
Oh I see it shining  
right through the rain  
When I see you smile baby  
Baby when I see you smile at me  
Sometimes I want to give up  
I want to give in  
I want to quit the fight  
Then one look at you baby  
And everything's alright  
Hey everything's alright  
It's alright  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light  
Oh I see it shining  
right through the rain  
Yeah  
When I see you smile  
Yeah I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything now  
When I see you smile  
Oh yeah  
Baby when I see you smile  
Smile at me
