Whats hannin'?  
It's Gucci!  
Aye Keyshia  
I'm feelin' this girl man  
But she ain't right ya know  
What I'm talkin' bout?  
Take one (take one)  
Ooh (Gucci!)  
I can do bad by myself know  
What I mean? for real  
Okay, action goin' in  
  
Rap game paid me, trap game made me  
We used to be good friends now she can't stand me  
Her man ain't G her man  
Ain't me her man can't be what her man can't be  
My jewelery game fridgy white watch blizzard  
Crocodile lizard pinky ring ignorant,  
I'm careful who I step too when I step too  
And if I choose first she choose me then she special  
Long walks all night dog I can help her bless her  
Show her how to be successful kiss her Gucci her up finesse her  
Sudden valley cook up second of the extra  
Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact  
Dumb sets long stacks I can make her come back  
  
[Chorus]  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
  
I'm a bad boy but still there's so much good in me  
You can take me out the hood the hood is still in me  
I needa girl to feel herself but can still feel me  
Just let me be ya only choice no need for plan B!  
My love life is malnutrition's you my vitamin C  
Stay down like Hillary and I can be ya billy  
I'll buy ya jada pinky pinkies I'm the biggest willy  
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playin' Frisby  
I can do it by myself but I'd be very lonely  
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homie  
So if you sick and tired of bein' sick and tired call me  
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci! (Gucci!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't no need in arguin' about it  
If you wanna leave then just be bout it  
There's no sense in blamin' me and me blamin' you  
There's no reason to be untrue everything  
I got I work hard for everyday I work hard to  
Make more I can do bad all by myself  
I ain't tryna play love games cause I can do bad baby  
  
[Chorus]
