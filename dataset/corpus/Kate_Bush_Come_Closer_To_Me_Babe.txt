Come closer to me, babe,  
And the night will come much closer, too.  
Can't you see the light  
Drawing pictures nearer in the skies?  
  
What is it that you whisper  
When you close your eyes?  
Come closer to me, babe.  
Is it me it's all about?  
And who is it that you're always  
Calling in your sleep?  
Who is Sylvia?  
  
Goodnight, baby. Please  
Come on home,  
Come on home,  
Come on home soon.  
Goodnight, baby, X4  
  
Come closer to me now,  
For I know there's something you must tell me.  
When slumber slips between your lips  
Will the secrets ooze out easily?  
  
What is it that you whisper  
When you close your eyes?  
Come closer to me, babe.  
Is it me it's all about?  
And who is it that you're always  
Calling in your sleep?  
Who is Sylvia?  
  
Goodnight, baby. Please  
Come on home, X2  
Come on home soon.  
Goodnight, baby, X4
