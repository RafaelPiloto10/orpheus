Well tonight I'm gonna wear my dancin' shoes  
'Cause I heard the word and I heard the news  
There's a gal in town she's packin' 'em in  
If you've seen her once, you'll see her again  
  
She's got a red hot dynamite band  
They're burnin' down another one-night stand  
Headlinin' double shows  
Everybody go see Sally Rose  
  
She sure knows how to rock the crowd  
Rocks 'em slow rocks 'em loud  
So you better move fast 'cause tickets are tight  
If you want to see Sally Rose pick it tonight
