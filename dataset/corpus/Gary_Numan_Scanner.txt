I would take your place  
If your world fell down  
I would take your pain  
And leave a smile  
For you  
  
If you feel a kiss  
When your dreams are dark  
And a voice guides you home  
When you are lost  
That was me  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]  
  
I will keep you warm  
And I'll wipe your tears away  
I'm a shadow  
Watching over you  
All my life  
  
I would die for you  
I would give the world to you  
And I'd sell my soul to keep you safe  
I love you  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]  
  
And when God comes for me  
I won't go far  
Like a smile in your heart  
I won't be far away  
  
If you're afraid and need to find me  
I'll be here with you  
And when you dream and hear me calling  
You'll see me again  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]
