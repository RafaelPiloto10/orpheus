There in my darkest hour, somehow you knew what I felt  
And just in the nick of time you saved me from myself  
Didn't know I could cut through my defenses  
And see through the mask  
I figured you must want something from me, but you never asked  
I just had to call and you were always there  
I think you must have been the answer to my prayer  
  
With you I've got nothing to hide  
My heart is starting to pound  
Now the walls are tumbling down  
  
I wish I could find the words that linger just out of reach  
I see myself in your eyes and lose my power of speech  
I am someone now that I don't recognize  
It took someone like you to shatter my disguise  
  
Now I've got nothing to hide  
My heart's remembering to pound  
I can feel the walls coming down  
I've got nothing to hide  
All that I needed was you around  
Now the walls are tumbling down  
  
Head in the sky, feeling just like some kind of lovesick child  
I finally pulled through, and I owe it to you, don't want to keep it inside  
  
I am someone now that I don't recognize  
Oh I'm healing, I'm believing, you made me realize
