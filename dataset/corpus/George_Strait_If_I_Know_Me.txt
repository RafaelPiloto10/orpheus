We both said some things I know we never meant,  
And when I slammed the door tonight you wondered where I went.  
If I know you, you're probably wonderin' what to do.  
You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good, if I know you.  
  
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.  
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.  
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,  
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.  
  
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart,  
Forgettin' if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart.  
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said.  
Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed.  
  
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.  
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.  
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,  
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.  
  
If I know me, and I know me.
