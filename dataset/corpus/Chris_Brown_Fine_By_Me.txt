[Verse 1]  
She doesn't call before midnight, if at all  
Oh, she never stays to watch the night turn to day  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want  
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight  
But you just use me baby, anyway you want  
I wish you were mine but  
  
[Chorus]  
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off  
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down  
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around  
She only loves me cause I put it down  
And it's fine by me  
And it's fine by me  
  
[Verse 2]  
She's like the wind, she comes and goes and again  
All of my friends think I'm a fool, silly them  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want  
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight  
But you just use me baby, anyway you want  
I wish you were mine but  
  
[Chorus]  
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off  
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down  
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around  
She only loves me cause I put it down  
And it's fine by me  
And it's fine by me  
  
[Bridge]  
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care  
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off  
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down  
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around  
She only loves me cause I put it down  
You a freak, and it's fine by me  
You a freak, and it's fine by me  
And it's fine by me  
And it's fine by me  
And it's fine by me
