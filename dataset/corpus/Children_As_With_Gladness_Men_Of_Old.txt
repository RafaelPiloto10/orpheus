As with gladness men of old  
Did the guiding star behold  
As with joy they hailed it's light  
Leading onward, beaming bright  
So most gracious God may we  
Evermore be led by Thee  
  
As with joyful steps they sped  
To that lowly manger bed  
There to bend the knee before  
Him whom heav'n and earth adore  
So may we with willing feet  
Ever seek Thy mercy seat  
  
As they offered gifts most rare  
At that manger rude and bare  
So may we with holy joy  
Pure and free from sin's alloy  
All our costliest treasures bring  
Christ to Thee, our heav'nly King  
  
Holy Jesus ev'ry day  
Keep us in the narrow way  
And when earthly things are past  
Bring our ransomed souls at last  
Where they need no star to guide  
Where no clouds Thy glory hide
