Snowy days and frosty night, everything looks cold and white  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe  
  
Christmas day will soon be here, and everybody's full of cheer  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear  
  
Well, I've waited all year long and nore the year is almost gone  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, hangin' 'round the mistletoe  
  
But if that's what I've gotta do just to get a kiss from you  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear  
  
Christmas is a special time to give and to receive  
For every little kiss you give me I will give you three  
  
You ain't gonna miss one kiss, that's one thing you'll never miss  
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe waitin' for you dear  
  
Well, I've had my eyes on you for a long, long time  
So, I'm asking Santa please, make that pretty girl mine  
  
Waited till I'm cold and blue just to get a kiss from you  
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear  
  
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear
