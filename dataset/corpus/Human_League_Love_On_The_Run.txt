I was wondering  
All the time that I was waiting  
When would I rise  
From the years that I'd been hating  
For the first time  
Living seemed to mean so much to me  
Like the day time  
Shining from the night that used to be  
  
Just when it seemed like  
My chances all had gone  
I found a reason  
To fight to carry on  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back in fun  
But take what you want  
Love on the run  
Life hates a loser  
Look what you've done  
Hold up your head  
Love on the run  
  
So the page turned  
Someone there to read my history  
Understanding  
Always wants to see the best in me  
For the future  
Looking just a little like a dream  
Warm and hazy  
Living everyday but more extreme  
  
Just when it seemed like  
My chances all had gone  
I found a reason  
To fight to carry on  
  
Look what you've done  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back in fun  
Write your own story  
Love on the run  
Life hates a loser  
Look what you've done  
Revel in glory  
Love on the run  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back in fun  
But take what you want  
Love on the run  
Life hates a loser  
Look what you've done  
Hold up your head  
Love on the run  
  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Love on the run  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back in fun  
Write your own story  
Love on the run  
Life hates a loser  
Look what you've done  
Revel in glory  
Love on the run
