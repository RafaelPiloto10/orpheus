Well I know there's a reason  
And I know there's a rhyme  
We were meant to be together  
And that's why,  
We can roll with the punches  
We can stroll hand in hand  
And when I say it's forever  
You understand  
  
[Chorus]  
That you're always in my heart,  
You're always on my mind  
But when it all becomes too much,  
You're never far behind  
And there's no one that comes close to you  
Could ever take your place  
'Cause only you can love me this way  
  
I could have turned a different corner  
I could have gone another place  
Then I'd of never had this feeling  
That I feel today, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
  
Only you can love me this way.
