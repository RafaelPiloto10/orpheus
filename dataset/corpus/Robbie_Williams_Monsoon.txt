I've sung some songs that were lame  
I've slept with girls on the game  
I've got my Catholic shame  
Lord I'm in purgatory  
Basically it's all come-on talk for me  
  
I wasn't me when we met  
You haven't lost my respect  
I'm here to serve and protect  
What shape of insanity  
Keeps leading you back to me?  
  
So put your hands across the water  
Mushroom  
Monsoon  
Come soon  
  
Don't want to piss on your parade  
I'm here to make money and get laid  
Yeah I'm a star but I'll fade  
If you ain't sticking your knives in me  
You will be eventually  
  
To all you Sharons and Michelles  
With all your tales to sell  
Save your meat money well  
I'm glad that spending a night with me  
Guaranteed you celebrity.  
  
And I can't talk in a crowd  
When I'm alone I'm too loud  
You're done, your daddy's proud  
Thank you for keeping me company  
You've all been so nice to me  
  
So put your hands across the water  
Mushroom  
Monsoon  
Come soon  
  
Oh Lord  
I feel  
Nothing  
I know much smarter men  
Never got this far  
  
I got too many regrets  
I've smoked too many cigarettes  
I've had more blondes than brunettes  
I'm not expecting your sympathy  
But it's all been too much for me  
  
So put your hands across the water  
Mushroom  
Monsoon  
Come soon
