All set ready to go, but little does he know  
He ain't comin' back no more  
All set ready to fly, into that deep blue sky  
Like so many times before  
  
Now the tower's callin', there's no reply  
And there's nothin' they can do  
Now the night is fallin' before they eyes  
Still no one's comin' through, callin'  
  
Somewhere out in time, God knows what's on his mind  
Is there a reason for his doubt  
Somehow unaware just like he didn't care  
There must be ways of gettin' out  
  
Not the tower's callin', there's no reply
