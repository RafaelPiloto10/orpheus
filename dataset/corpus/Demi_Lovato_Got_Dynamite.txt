I can't take your hand  
And lead you to the water  
I can't make you feel  
What you don't feel but you know you wanna  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me  
  
Underneath the surface  
There so much you need to know  
And you might feel like your drowning  
And that's what I need to let go  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls  
Kick senseless my defenses  
Tell me what your gonna do  
I need you to light the fuse  
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
  
Got dynamite?  
  
I can't paint this picture  
Just so you can hang it  
  
I can't wait  
For you to understand  
If you just don't get it  
  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me  
Underneath the surface  
There is so much you need to know  
And you might feel like your drowning  
But that's what I need to let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the walls come crashing down  
I hope you're standing right in front of me  
Where my past lies all around  
Cause all you need to save me is to intervene  
And make the walls come crashing down  
  
Got dynamite!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got dynamite  
I got dynamite
