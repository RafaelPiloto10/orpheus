Snow covered rooftops  
Lights on the trees  
The sound of singing  
I hear down  
Every street  
  
Families  
Have gathered  
From miles away  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
  
You see that old tree  
Down Cotton Lane  
Those lights  
Keep shining  
It's always the same  
  
We hear  
The church bells  
Ring out to say  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
  
Swing the lights  
And hang  
The stockings  
Decorate  
With green and red  
Made the cookies  
For old Santa  
Made a runway  
For his sled  
  
Singing carols  
On a sleigh ride  
Gather 'round  
The manger scene  
Open presents  
Read the letter  
And together  
We will sing  
  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
Joy to the world  
For every nation  
For every boy  
And girl  
  
Let's light a candle  
For peace we pray  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
It's Christmas day  
It's Christmas day  
  
Let's light a candle  
For peace we pray  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day
