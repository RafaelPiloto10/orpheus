La da da  
I just came here to chill  
We been kickin' it for quite some time  
Lots of private parties where we're winding down  
Tonight I'm in a different mood  
Just want to get close to you  
No RSVP necessary  
Tonight it's me and you, girl  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
I just came here to chill  
You're a special lady  
The world can see  
Nobody makes a room shine  
Like you and me  
You always know just what to wear  
Nails just right, lovely hair  
No need to put your makeup on  
I'm not Mr. Big, ?cause tonight I'm just [incomprehensible]  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill  
I don't mind a little champagne  
But no private chefs or restaurants  
Just a little home cookin' on the spot, yeah  
No invitations with our names  
No shakin' hands with all the you-know-who's  
My focus is on you  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
See I, I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
See I, I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill  
No Escalades parked in the valet  
Parked in the valet  
No red-eye flights, I'm stayin' in LA  
No movie stars with fancy cars  
No backstage passes to the latest show  
Tell R. Kelly we ain't coming no  
No relatives, no friends we know  
?Cause I just came here to chill  
Didn't bring my diamonds  
You don't have to put a dress on  
I just came here to chill  
There'll be no other VIP  
The party's only you and me  
See I, I just came here to chill
