After the first embrace from you my senses knew  
The look of love was in your eyes  
And after we first make love  
Our senses tingle to the touch  
Oh, how we hypnotize  
  
Oh, to get the feeling on and on  
Oh, just to get the feeling  
  
Holding you closer in my arms we drift to heaven  
Bringing in the morning light  
And after all is said and done there's only us  
We can make it right  
  
So, our love will carry on and on  
Now our love will be free, be free  
  
And when we play, love don't delay, I hear you now  
For what was then, is what is now, anyhow  
As I became a guest of love's tune here again  
We'll carry on together like today  
  
After the first embrace from you I want you too  
After the first embrace from you I want you too
