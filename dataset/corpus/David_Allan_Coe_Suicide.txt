Standing in the bathroom with a gun in my hand  
Pulling on the trigger just as fast as I can  
I can hear her scream as she reaches for the lover beside her  
Married by the Bible, she was only sixteen  
  
I was fresh from prison trying to follow my dream  
Who'd ever thought I'd be the judge and the jury that tried her?  
Blood splattered all over the wall  
The gun still smoking as I watch it fall  
  
I run through the door while the sirens blow out on the highway  
Maybe they'll catch me and maybe they won't  
It really doesn't matter I just had to do things my way  
Yeah, yeah, I might just commit suicide, yeah, yeah  
  
He's the only man that I trusted with my life  
I can't understand why he ran off with my wife  
Now that they're dead what's gonna happen to the baby?  
The state will have to raise her just the way they did me  
  
Her mother wanted freedom and I just set her free  
She should have never let me see that she was no longer a lady  
She called out my name just before she died  
She swore she loved me and I almost cried  
  
With trembling hands I reached out and tried to save her  
Cheating is something I can understand  
But not when it's cheating with my best friend  
She betrayed the love and the baby I gave her
