Every year along about this time it all goes dry  
Nothing round for love or money that'll get you high.  
Henry got pissed off and he run to Mexico  
See if he could come back holdin' 29 keys of Gold.  
Now the road to Acapulco is very hard indeed  
And it isn't any better if you haven't any weed.  
Henry struggled to hold it straight on twisty mountain roads  
Fifty people waitin' back in hopes for Henry's load.  
Chorus:  
Now he's rolling down the mountain goin' fast, fast, fast  
And if he blows it this one's going to be his last  
Run to Acapulco to turn the Golden Key  
Henry keeps the brakes on for this corner if you please.  
Henry got to Mexico and he turned his truck around  
Talkin' with the man who has it growin' from the ground  
Henry tasted, he got wasted, couldn't even see  
How he's going to drive like that it's not clear to me.  
Chorus  
Sunday afternoon, Tihajuana is a lovely town  
Bullfight brings the tourist in, their money flowing down  
Border guards are much too busy there at 5 o'clock  
Henry truckin' right on through, he hardly even stopped.  
Chorus
