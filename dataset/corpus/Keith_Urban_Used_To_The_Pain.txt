And so I wrote this song for you  
I think I know just what you're going through  
Did you believe you'd never change?  
Nothin' ever stays the same  
  
I know it's hard holdin' on  
Even harder trying to let it go  
And so you're frozen like a stone  
But you are not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Every step I take  
I get a little less afraid  
Of giving in to love, love  
Let it out  
Believe me when I say  
It gets better every day  
Once you get used to the pain  
  
What you hide inside I see  
There's a scar that's always gonna be  
There's a past in everyone  
You can't undo  
You can't outrun  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Once you get used to the pain
