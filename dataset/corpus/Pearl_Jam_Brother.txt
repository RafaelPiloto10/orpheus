You should be happy with what you got,  
You should be hard to be a brother,  
You should be happy with what we give you  
  
Hand over my face.  
I am related to my enemy.  
My house on fire,  
And my big brother come put the blame on me.  
  
He's a-pushin', I'm being pushed from above.  
Oh, and a brother, back to back to back,  
Better back off of him.  
  
You should not question at all his authority  
  
Use a flag as a bandage.  
Stick 'em up, show us your pocket hypocrisy.  
In the closet, my pleasures  
'Cause my big brother don't want to just let me be  
  
Oh, and I'm pushin', oh if I could get above,  
Oh, and a brother back to back back,  
Keep your back off.  
Oh, and I'm pushin', I'm being pushed from above.  
Oh, and a brother, back to back to back,  
Better back off of him  
  
Face down, brother,  
Face down [Repeat: x3]  
  
In my mind there's a clearing.  
Black clouds flow through gray still skies.  
And the birds don't even whisper.  
I'm flying out, I'm flying,  
  
Back to back back, better back off,  
Back to back to back, a better, better, better,  
Back to back to back, back to back back, brother,  
Face down, brother,  
Face down,  
Face down, brother,  
Face down, almost, fired,  
Face down, I got a gun,  
Face down,  
I got a gun, I got a gun,  
Face down, I got a gun,  
Face down  
  
Fuck it, I'm just gonna go home, turn on the fuckin' TV,  
Watch the nightly news and drink a beer,  
Like I could even change the world, yeah right
