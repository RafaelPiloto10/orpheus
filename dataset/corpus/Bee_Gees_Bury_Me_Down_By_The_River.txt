I wasn't born in the morning, no  
I must have been born in the night  
I've done my load and I'll carry my load  
And all I own is my life  
  
I wasn't born to be lucky,  
Cause luck had no future with me  
I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song  
and stand beneath the hanging tree  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Let all the towns people see  
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay my head  
Just put me down and set me free  
  
I wasn't born as a rich man, no  
A rich man I never, I never could be  
I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song  
And stand beneath the hanging tree (Everybody sing now)  
  
Bury me down by the river, lord no  
Let all the towns people see, see  
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay, lay my head  
Just put me down and set me free  
(I want to hear everybody sing)  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Let all the towns, let all the towns people see  
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, let met lay, let me lay my head along  
Just put me down and set me free (set me free)
