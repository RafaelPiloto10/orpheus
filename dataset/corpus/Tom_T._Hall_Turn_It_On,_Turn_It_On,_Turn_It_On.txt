Johnny got up one mornin' he went down to the company store  
Got him a big box of bullets to fit into his 44  
The storeman said son are you gonna work you know you owe me too much to stop  
John said I got a little working to do but I ain't goin' by your clock  
  
People said John was a slacker cause he wouldn't fight in their war  
A man wasn't much if he wouldn't fight back in nineteen forty and four  
The doctor said John was just too sick to go  
But the people said that he was a coward  
  
And one of the men makin' fun of him was a feller named a Milton Howard  
Milton was down at the Cold Spring a drinkin' from a Mason jar  
He said John you better get yourself to work you gonna fool around till you
get fired  
John blew the dust from his old 44 put two holes in Milton's head  
  
When Johnny walked off to get some more shootin' done  
That old Cold Spring was a runnin' with red  
Next guy he met was a Steagall boy and the boy had a hammer in his hand  
John said son you should've built yourself a box  
  
'Cause you're aheaded for the Promised Land  
Steagall fell down to his knees to pray and he cried Lord Johnny please don't
shoot  
Before he got half way to sayin' amen well old John shot him out of his boots  
  
Word went out through the County that old John had lost his head  
The people were running and screaming there were seven of 'em layin' there
dead  
Johnny hid out in a farmhouse he had satisfaction in his eyes  
He said I know they're coming to get me boys but they ain't a gonna take me
alive  
  
People gathered round that old farmhouse was the relatives of all them dead  
Now John said if the sheriff comes through that door I'm gonna fill him plum
full of lead  
The sheriff kicked down that old farmhouse door but old John's gun would not
shoot  
Johnny just smiled at the sheriff and said the Lord must think a lot of you  
  
They took old John to the jailhouse he entered in a guilty plea  
The judge said death in the electric chair cause it's murder in the first
degree  
John's last meal was a lot of fried chicken cold beans and a baby squash  
He ate every bite that they brought him then he smiled and said I thank you
all a lot  
  
They put old John in the electric chair they shaved his ankles and his head  
The preacher said son you got something to say in a minute you're a gonna be
dead  
John said I ain't no coward and the people know that I won't run  
Then Johnny smiled up at the warden and said turn it on turn it on turn it on
