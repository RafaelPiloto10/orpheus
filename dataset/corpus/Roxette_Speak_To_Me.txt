Speak to me with tenderness  
Speak to me with gracefulness  
Speak to me with happiness and love  
  
Speak to me in loneliness  
Speak to me in bitterness  
Speak to me in faithlessness with love  
  
You want to hide when you're alone  
Where do you run to when you're on your own?  
You're looking to find some peace of mind  
But nothing's in sight at the end of the line, oh no  
  
Speak to me in emptiness  
Speak to me in failed success  
Speak to me in speechlessness with love  
  
You want to hide when you're alone  
Where do you run to when everything's gone?  
You're looking to find a good thing in life  
But nothing's in sight at the end of the line  
  
So where do you hide when you're alone?  
Where do you run to when you're on your own?  
That dream in the dark just sank like a stone  
That voice in your heart,  
It won't come to the phone,  
It never comes  
  
Speak to me with tenderness  
Speak to me with gracefulness  
Speak to me with happiness and love  
  
Speak to me in loneliness  
Speak to me in bitterness  
Speak to me in faithlessness with love  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
With love
