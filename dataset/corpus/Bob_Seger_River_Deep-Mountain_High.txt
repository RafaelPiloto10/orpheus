When I was a little girl, I had a rag-doll  
The only doll I've ever owned.  
Now I love you just the way I love that rag-doll,  
But only now the love has grown.  
  
And it get's stronger everyway...  
And It get's deeper let me say...  
And It get's higher day by day...  
(corus)  
Ah, do I love you my oh my?  
River deep - Mountain High.  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  
And If I lost you would I cry?  
Oh, Baby.  
Baby. Baby. Baby.  
  
When you where a young boy did you have a puppy?  
That alway's followed you around.  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy.  
No I'll never let you down  
And it goes on and on, like a river flows,  
And it gets sweeter, heaven knows,  
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows.  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And, I love you baby like a robin loves to sing.  
Oh I love you baby like a school boy loves his pie.  
Oh I love you honey rivers deep mountains high.
