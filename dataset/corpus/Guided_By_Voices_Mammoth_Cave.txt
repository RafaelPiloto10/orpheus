Got my flashlight  
Two by four  
Necessary precaution  
Plants at the entrance  
Flies at the exit  
Way down deep  
In the darkest hole  
Lost my way  
Lost my soul  
You can dig my grave  
In Mammoth Cave  
I would of brought a sharp object, yeah  
But they've taken mine all away  
All away  
I pretended I wasn't scared  
Something fucking stinks in here  
Like a sump pump in a sewer  
What the hell was I thinking?  
Way down deep  
In the darkest hole  
Lost my way  
Lost my soul  
You can dig my grave  
You can dig me a hole  
In the Mammoth Cave  
Mammoth Cave.
