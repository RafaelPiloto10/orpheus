[Verse:]  
Whatever it takes, whatever Your will Lord  
Whatever Your purpose for me I'll do  
It's not about me, it's not about my will  
It's all about living my life for You  
You desire more of me, I desire You  
Lord, Your love has set me free  
I will live for You  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every chance I get, I will praise You  
Oh, praise Your name  
Every day I will live to glorify  
Every chance I get  
  
[Tag]  
All I want Lord, all I'm living for, is to know You more  
Every chance I get  
  
[Ending]  
Every chance I get
