So, so loud  
Wait, but I don't realize.  
How? why? legs  
Broke. the pain between her thighs.  
I see your pretty face,  
Smashed against the bathroom floor!  
What a disgrace!  
Who do I feel sorry for?  
Skin, so cold.  
  
How could someone steal a life?  
Save, the blame.  
Wait, I got some shit to say.  
I see your pretty face,  
Smashed against the bathroom floor!  
What a disgrace!  
Who do I feel sorry for?  
Smashed and raped!  
Not again. this is a real crime.  
What a pretty face.  
Who do I feel sorry for?  
  
Rape! something  
Now! rips my  
Heart! and takes  
My! soul I  
Wait! too late  
Now! I feel  
Raped! inside  
Death! my soul away  
Away  
  
I see your pretty face,  
Smashed against the bathroom floor!  
What a disgrace!  
Who do I feel sorry for?  
Smashed and raped!  
Not again. this is a real crime.  
What a pretty face.  
Who do I feel sorry for
