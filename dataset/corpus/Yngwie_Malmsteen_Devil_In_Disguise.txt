Don't ever try to fool me  
Cause I can see right through you  
It's in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
Hold me, feel me  
Wound and heal me  
Mend this broken heart  
Though you're near me  
You can't hear me  
But you tear my soul apart  
I can't beat you  
Can't defeat you  
You just make me cry inside  
Don't even try to fool me  
Cause I can see right through you  
It's in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
My rage is growing stronger  
And I can't wait no longer  
It's in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
Never learning  
Vengeance is burning  
Deep inside your mind  
Time will come to  
When I'll make you  
Stumbling like blind leading the blind
