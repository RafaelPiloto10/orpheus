A little girl, a little small for her age  
A little too slow for the field day race  
Momma's waiting at the finish line  
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes  
She says, "You did just fine honey, that's okay  
Sometimes life's just that way  
You're gonna lose the race from time to time  
But you're always gonna find  
  
You can't lose me  
Bet your life  
I am here and I will always be  
Just a wish away  
Wherever you go  
No matter how far  
My love is where you are  
You won't be lost if you believe  
You can't lose me"  
  
Momma use to say "Girl it won't be long  
'Til it's time to go out on your own  
Chase your dreams find your place in life  
I know you'll do just fine"  
When that day finally came  
There were things she needed to but could not say  
So I whispered softly as I wiped  
The tears from Momma's eyes  
  
"You can't lose me  
Bet your life  
I am here and I will always be  
Just a wish away  
Wherever I go  
No matter how far  
My love is where you are  
You won't be lost if you believe  
You can't lose me"
