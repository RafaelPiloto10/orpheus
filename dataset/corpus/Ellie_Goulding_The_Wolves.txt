Some day my pain,  
Some day my pain,  
Will mark you.  
  
Harness your blame,  
Harness your blame,  
And walk through.  
  
With the wild wolves around you,  
In the morning I'll call you  
Send it farther on.  
  
Solace my game,  
Solace my game  
It stars you.  
  
Swing wide your crane,  
Swing wide your crane  
And run me through.  
  
And the story's all over you  
In the morning I'll call you  
Can't you find a clue when  
Your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue.  
  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
Don't bother me.  
What might have been lost  
Don't bother me  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain.
