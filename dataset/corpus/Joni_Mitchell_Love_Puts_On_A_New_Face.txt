He said "You think you're a lady  
But I know you're a woman  
We are as young as the night"  
I said "No telephones ringing  
No company coming  
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight"  
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon  
What a pocket of heavenly grace  
But in France they say  
Everyday  
Love puts on a new face  
Love has many faces  
  
About a month or so later he said  
"Why can't you be happy  
You make me feel helpless when you get this way"  
I said "I'm up to my neck in alligators  
Jaws gnashing at me  
Each one trying to pull a piece away"  
Darling, you can't slay these beasts of prey  
Some bad dreams even love can't erase  
But in France they say  
Everyday  
Love puts on a new face  
Love has many faces  
  
He said "I wish you were with me here  
The leaves are electric  
They burn on the river bank  
Countless heatless flames"  
I said "Send me some pictures then  
And I'll paint pyrotechnic  
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again  
I miss your touch and your lips so much  
I long for our next embrace"  
But in France they say  
Everyday  
Love puts on a new face  
Love puts on a new face  
Love has many faces  
Many many faces
