Sometimes when I just can't sleep  
And you're on my mind and I'm hurting deep  
At night, at night when the sun goes down  
And the lights turn on and you're not around.  
  
  
I've been this way before  
But it wasn't real  
But this time I'm sure  
It's the way I feel  
  
  
I dream when I call your name  
And I'm in a place that I can't explain  
  
  
And everything you see  
I can't conceal  
It's the way that it is  
It's the way I feel  
This time I'm sure  
It's the way I feel  
  
  
I've been this way before  
But it wasn't real  
This time I'm sure  
It's the way that I feel  
This time I'm sure  
It's the way I feel
