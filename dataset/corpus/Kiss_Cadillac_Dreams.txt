When I was seventeen, found out just what it means  
If you can get it free, it just ain't worth a damn  
When I heard the preacher say, don't throw your life away  
I got that message, and I wrote it on the wall  
I don't want anybody tellin' me lies, no, I don't want your diamond ring  
Cause you ain't got my size  
  
I want money, money, that's what I need,  
I got Cadillac dreams, please mister don'tcha take it from me  
Give me money, money, more than I need, I got Cadillac dreams waitin' on me  
Cadillac dreams, Cadillac dreams  
  
When I had the young boy blues, I paid some young boy dues  
I learned the hard way, there's a heartbreak every day  
Stone cold reality came crashing down on me  
Well life was hard on me, but I still don't give a damn  
When I was seventeen I was an angry young man  
But I won't let just anybody tell me who I am  
  
I just want money, money, that's all I need  
I got Cadillac dreams, hey mister don'tcha take it from me  
Give me money, money, more than I need, these Cadillac dreams are waitin' on
me  
Didn't have the time of day, till this dream was born  
You can't take that away, you can't take that away from me  
  
When I was seventeen, there was this beauty queen  
Checked in a one room suite, the back seat of my car  
When you want all the best things money can buy  
You gotta reach down inside of you, to reach up to the sky  
  
Yeah, I want money, money, that's all I need  
I got Cadillac dreams, hey mister you can't take that from me  
I want money, money, more than I need, I got Cadillac dreams waitin' on me  
Money, money, that's what I need  
We're drivin' in my Chevy with my Cadillac dreams  
Someday, one day, just you and me  
We'll ride inside these Cadillac dreams
