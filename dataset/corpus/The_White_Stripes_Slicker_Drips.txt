You're lookin' at me  
Nowhere to go  
What they're sayin'  
I just don't know  
A floor below me  
Ceiling above  
And I'm in the middle  
With nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Yeah  
Well lookin' at me  
Nowhere to go  
Know what they're sayin'  
I just [don't know?]  
A floor below me  
A ceiling up above  
And I'm in the middle  
With nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
