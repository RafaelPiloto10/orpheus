Some Want To Think Hope Is Lost See Me Stand Alone  
I Can't Do What Others May Want Then I'll Have No Home  
  
So For Now Wave Good-bye And Leave Your Hands Held High  
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night  
So For Now Wave Good-bye Leave Your Hands Held High  
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night  
  
And The Wind Will Bear My Cry To All Who Hope To Fly  
Hear This Song Of Courage Ride Into The Night  
  
Battles Are Fought By Those With The Courage To Believe  
They Are Won By Those Who Find The Heart  
Find A Heart To Share  
This Heart That Fills The Soul Will Point The Way To Victory  
If There's A Fight Then I'll Be There I'll Be There  
  
So For Now Wave Good-bye, Leave Your Hands Held High  
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night  
And The Wind Will Bear My Cry To All Who Hope To Fly  
Lift Your Wings Up High My Friend Fearless To The End  
So For Now Wave Good-bye, Leave Your Hands Held High  
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night
