In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear  
And what insane and silly things we do.  
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear,  
As I recall it, you were in it, too.  
  
I had the craziest dream, last night, yes I did  
I never dreamed it could be  
Yet there you were, in love with me  
  
I found your lips close to mine, so I kissed them  
And you didn't mind it at all  
When I'm awake, such a break never happens  
How long can I guy go on dreaming  
  
If there's a chance that you care  
Then, please, say that you do baby  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true
