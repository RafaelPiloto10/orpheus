When I picked you up for our first date baby  
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were drivin' me crazy  
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing  
Is they were looking at me.  
  
I held open the car door for you then you climbed  
Inside and slid on over  
To the other side, I thought my, oh my  
  
[Chorus]  
Sweet thing  
The moon is high and the night is young  
Come on and meet me  
In the backyard under the Cottonwood tree  
It's a good thing and I'm wishing  
C'mon sweet thing  
Won't you climb on out of your window  
While the world is sleeping  
You know I need you  
And there's no way I'll be leaving  
'Till we're kissing on the porch swing  
Oh my little sweet thing  
  
Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow  
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow  
Uncle Jake's Mustang, its his favorite car  
And so I can't stay long  
  
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo  
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little  
More time, is that such a crime?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh my sweet thing  
Sweet thing, sweet thing  
  
Oh my sweet thing  
The moon is high and the night is young  
Come on and meet me  
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree  
It's a good thing and tell me I'm not dreaming  
C'mon sweet thing  
Won't you climb on out of your window  
While the world is sleeping  
Cause you know I need you  
And there's no way I'll be leaving  
'Till we're kissing on the porch swing  
Oh my little sweet thing  
  
Oh c'mon sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing  
  
Yeah, c'mon now a little now  
Do do do do do do do do do do do  
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are  
Do do do do do do do do do do do
