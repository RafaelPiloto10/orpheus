Baby, we can talk all night  
But that ain't gettin' us nowhere  
I told you everything I possibly can  
There's nothing left inside of here  
  
And maybe you can cry all night  
But that'll never change the way I feel  
The snow is really piling up outside  
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here  
  
I poured it on, and I poured it out  
I tried to show you just how much I care  
I'm tired of words, and I'm too hoarse to shout  
But you've been cold to me so long  
I'm crying icicles instead of tears  
  
And all I can do is keep on telling you  
I want you, I need you  
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
  
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach  
You'll never drill for oil on a city street  
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks  
But there ain't no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom  
Of a cracker jack box  
  
I can't lie, I can't tell you something I'm not  
No matter how I try  
I'll never be able to give you something  
Something that I just haven't got  
  
There's only one girl that I'll ever love  
And that was so many years ago  
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart  
She never loved me back  
Oh, I know  
I remember how she left me on a stormy night  
She kissed me and got out of our bed  
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door  
She packed her bags and turned right away  
  
And she kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
She just kept telling me  
I want you, I need you  
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
  
I want you, I need you  
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you  
Now don't be sad  
'Cause two out of three ain't bad  
  
Baby, we can talk all night  
But that ain't getting us nowhere
