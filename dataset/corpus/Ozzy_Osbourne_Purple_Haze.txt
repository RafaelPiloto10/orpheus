Purple Haze all in my brain  
Lately things don't seem the same  
Acting funny but I don't know why  
Excuse me while i kiss the sky  
Purple haze all around  
Don't know if I'm coming up or down  
Am i happy or in misery  
What ever it is that girl put a spell on me  
Help me Help me  
Oh i don't know  
Purple haze all in my eyes  
Don't know if it's day or night  
You've got me blowin,blowin my mind  
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time  
Who knows?  
Help me  
Oh yeah  
Come on know  
Tell me  
Tell me
