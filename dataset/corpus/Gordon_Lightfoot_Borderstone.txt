The night is as black as the coal dust on the tracks  
Up to the east day is dawning  
From time to time I get women on my mind  
I'm a son of a gun  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
  
The train that I'm on is a hundred boxcars long  
So I don't sleep through to the morning  
That's some chilly wind in this gondola I'm in  
I wish I had a glass of beer  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
  
The boardinghouse reach is a thing no school can teach you  
I confess I've been outfumbled  
And the sound of the beans boiling through the evergreens  
Sure do please a hungry man  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
  
The sound of the wheels rebounds across the fields  
I'm a name with no number  
And so I guess I'd be drifting more or less  
But still it's not meant to be  
  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight  
Borderstone, Borderstone gonna cross your line tonight  
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
