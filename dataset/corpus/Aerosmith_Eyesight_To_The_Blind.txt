Well, well, well, well  
  
You were talking about your woman.

You were talking about your woman.  
I wish to god, man, that you could see mine.  
Every time my little girl start to lovin',  
She bring eyesight to the blind.  
  
Lord, her daddy must have been a millionaire, cause I could tell by the way
she walked.  
Her daddy must have been a millionaire, cause I could tell by the way she
walked.  
Every time she start to lovin',  
The deaf and dumb begin to talk.  
Yeah, you know what they say.  
  
I remember one Friday morning,  
We was lying down across your bed.  
Man in the back room was dying, eyes were sad, and I stroked his head and I
said Lordy ain't she pretty, and the whole state knows she's fine.  
And every, every, every time she start to lovin', she bring eyesight to the
blind  
  
What a woman I got here.  
Lean on me baby, lean on me.  
  
Yes, I declare she's pretty, and the whole state knows she's fine.  
Man, I declare she's pretty, lordy, lordy, I declare she's fine.  
  
Every, every, every, every time she starts to lovin', she bring eyesight to
the blind.
