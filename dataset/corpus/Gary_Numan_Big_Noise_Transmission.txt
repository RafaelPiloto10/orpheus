Did I ever tell you what happened before?  
I was walking in the shadow of my death  
Did I ever tell you what happened before?  
I was hiding from the big lie  
Did I ever tell you what happened before?  
I was followed by the vision of my god  
Did I ever tell you what happened before?  
I was hiding in a dead soul

Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out
