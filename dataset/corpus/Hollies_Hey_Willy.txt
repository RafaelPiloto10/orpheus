[Chorus]  
Hey Willy your mother calls you Billy  
Your father calls you silly  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
Hey baby you're dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You don't care  
What they say about your hair  
Cause the bad man's smiling  
Every time he sees you comin' yeah  
  
Willy is the singer in a rock'n'roll band  
Every time he shows his face  
Put away your  
  
Oh yeah Willy's gonna show them now  
No no no no Willy's gonna go somehow  
  
My name's Willy gonna turn on the lights  
Playing rock'n'roll music to early early night  
Can't stop dancing to the rhythm in your feet  
Listen to the drummer Yeah listen to the beat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey baby you're dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You don't care  
What they say about your hair  
Cause the bad man's smiling  
Every time he sees you comin' yeah  
  
[Chorus]
