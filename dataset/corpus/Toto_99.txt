99  
I've been waiting so long  
Oh, 99  
Where did we go wrong  
Oh, 99  
I love you  
  
99  
I keep breaking your heart  
Oh, 99  
How can we be apart  
Oh, 99  
I love you  
  
I never thought it would happen  
I feel quite the same  
I don't want to hurt you anymore  
I never knew it would work out  
No one to blame  
You know I love you 99  
  
99  
You keep holding my hand  
Oh, 99  
They don't know who I am  
  
99  
I can't take it no more  
Oh, 99  
Oh we were so sure  
Oh, 99  
I love you
