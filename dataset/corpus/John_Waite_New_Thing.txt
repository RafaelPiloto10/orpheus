There's something in you... child  
A mystery that I can't define  
But it blows my mind  
I'm walking on air... with you  
A kite in the sky  
Without a care  
It's something we share  
And all of these clues  
Lead me to you  
Hey!... I'm so surprised  
Everything that fills my eyes  
Is about you and this new thing  
Hey! Is it really true  
Everything I say and do  
Is about you and this new thing... lo'  
And if I feel blue... child  
I come to you so free and so wild  
And I feel fine  
The little things you do... I find  
Here in my eyes, my heart and my mind  
Your sexy smile  
Your sense of style  
Your kiss!  
Hey!... I'm so surprised  
Everything that fills my eyes  
Is about you and this new thing  
Hey! Is it really true  
Everything I say and do  
Is about you  
Hey!... It fells so good  
I never thought I ever would  
Find a new thing  
Such a new thing  
Hey!... One and one make two  
So everything I say and do is about you  
And this new thing... love  
And this new thing... Love
