He's a giver, he'll give her  
The kind of attention that she's never known  
He's a helper, he'll help her  
To open the doors that she can't on her own  
He's a lover, he'll love her  
In ways that she never has been loved before  
And he's a getter, he'll get her  
By gettin her into the world she's been hungerin' for  
'cause he's a taker, he'll take her  
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to  
He'll take his time before takin' advantage  
Takin' her easy and slow  
And after he's taken the body and soul  
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted  
Then he'll take off and leave her  
Takin' all of her pride as he goes  
Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her ...  
He's a charmer, and he'll charm her  
With money and manners that I never learned  
He's a leader, and he'll lead her  
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn  
He's a talker, he'll talk her  
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long  
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her  
The way that I never  
And damned if he won't do her wrong  
'cause he's a taker, he'll take her  
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to  
He'll take his time before takin' advantage  
Takin' her easy and slow  
And after he's taken the body and soul  
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted  
Then he'll take off and leave her  
Takin' all of her pride as he goes  
Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her ...
