If it wasn't for your mercy  
If it wasn't for your love  
If it wasn't for your kindness  
How could I stand?  
If it wasn't for your cleansing  
If it wasn't for your blood  
If it wasn't for your goodness  
How could I stand?  
Yet I find myself again  
Where even angels fear to tread  
Where I would never dare to come  
But for the cleansing of your blood  
With you there is forgiveness  
And therefore you are feared  
Jesus it's your loving kindness  
That brings me to my knees  
And I find myself again  
Where even angels fear to tread  
Where I would never dare to come  
But for the cleansing of your blood  
In the beauty of your holiness  
Here in the beauty of your holiness  
X2
