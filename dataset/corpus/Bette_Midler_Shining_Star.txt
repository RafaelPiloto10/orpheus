Honey, you are my shining star.  
Don't you go away.  
I wanna be right here where you are  
Until my dying day. Yes I do.  
  
So many have tried,  
Tried to find a love like yours and mine. Ohhh-whoa.  
But don't they realize how you hypnotize?  
Make me love you more each time. Ohhh-whoa.  
  
Honey, I'll never leave you lonely, yeah.  
Give my love to you only, yeah.  
To you only, to you only.  
  
Oh honey, you are my shining star.  
Don't you go away.  
Yeah, I wanna be right here where you are  
Until my dying day. Yeah.  
  
It feels so good  
When we're lying next to each other,  
Lost in love, lost in love,  
Drifting along on a cloud of love.  
  
Ooh, baby when we touch I love you so much.  
You're all I ever dreamed of. Ohhh-whoa.  
Hone, I'll never leave you lonely, yeah.  
Mmm, give my love to you only, yeah.  
To you only, to you only.  
  
Oh honey, you, you are, you are my shining star.  
Don't you go away, no.  
I wanna be right here where you are  
Until my dying day. Mmmm.  
  
It feels so good, it feels so good  
When we're lying here  
Lost in love, lost in love, lost in love, lost in love.  
Oh baby, when we touch I love you so much.  
You, you're all I ever dreamed of.  
  
In spite of all we know, how little we know.  
In spite of all they say, how little we see.  
I only know, you and me together forever.  
You are my shining star, mmm, yes you are.  
Shine on, shine on. Keep on shining on.  
Shine on, shine on. Keep on shining on
