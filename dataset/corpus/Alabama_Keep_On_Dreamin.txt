Words and Music by Jeff Cook and Richard Scott  
I am so happy with you in my arms.  
Honey, don't you ever leave.  
Lay back and love me and tellme you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me.  
  
Your hair is so soft and your eyes are so brown.  
Your body's warm here next to me.  
You be my woman and I'll be your man, and your love is all I'll ever need.  
  
It took so long for me to find you.  
I've been lonely for so long. Lonely.  
You came into me life to love me.  
Now my loneliness is gone.  
  
You can't improve on perfection.  
And you are perfect for me.  
Cast your love in my direction,  
and I know that you will see.  
  
I am so happy with you in my arms.  
Honey, don't you ever leave.  
Lay back and love and tell me you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me  
  
Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me.  
  
Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me.
