Open up the Bacardi  
Feeling so hot tamale

Purple taking me higher  
I'm lifted and I like it  
Boy, you got me inspired  
Baby, come and get it  
If you're really feelin' me  
  
Cause it's my night  
No stress, no fights  
I'm leavin' it all behind  
No tears, no time to cry  
Just makin' the most of life  
  
Everybody is livin' it up  
All the fellas keep lookin' at us (cause)  
Me and my girls on the floor like what  
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut

A cause for celebration
