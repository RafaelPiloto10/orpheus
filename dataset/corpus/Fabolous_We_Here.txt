[Intro: Fabolous]  
Sometimes I just look em in the eyes and say, we here  
  
[Hook: T-Pain]  
Take the good, the bad, all we had  
We here, we here, we here, we here  
We laugh, we cry, we gon' defy  
We here, we here, we here, we here (Put em up)  
Yeah we here, we here we here, we here we here  
We here, we here we here, we here we here  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Always in attendence, even when I'm absent  
Haters see you present, try to leave a nigga absent  
Fishes on my ride, kleenex golds, that's in the cabinet  
Shorty in my ride but she should be in a pageant  
Hello this is Erica, should be miss America  
We be in them foreign cars that make you miss America  
Probably wasn't meant to be, fuck it though, we here  
How I feel mentally? Don't stay broke, repair  
Make they note, [?] year, ain't no turnin' me down  
I'm turnt up, we turnt up  
Take it to another level, even when you at the top  
That's that Kobe system, we going over the top  
  
[Hook: T-Pain]  
  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
We here forever though, y'all here for never though  
Hating is beneath me, I say that's the Devil yo  
Condo at the top, one floor down from heaven yo  
All got our own cars, we ridin' together though  
Shout out DJ Khaled, we the best currently  
Money ain't shit, respect is the best currency (niiice)  
Now you can cash that around the world  
And you could flash that around a girl  
  
[Pre-Hook: Fabolous]  
When you down, you can't go but one place  
And that's up, and that's up, and that's up, and that's up  
I done lost and got back, but we here and we like  
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up  
  
[Hook: T-Pain]  
  
[Bridge: T-Pain] (x2)  
You gon' be good, I'm gon' make sure of that  
And I'm gon' be there where I should be at  
You got me, whenever, whatever, whoever, I'm ready for you  
You got me, however, now or never, baby I can't ignore ya
