The day they covered us in the dirt  
Like stars in the ground  
That will grow into dead flowers  
The day they covered us in the dirt  
Like stars in the ground  
That will grow into dead flowers  
Your body's on me  
  
Like sleepless spiders  
Your touch is so empty  
Your touch is so empty  
Your bodies on me like  
  
Sleepless spiders  
Your touch is so empty  
Your touch is so empty  
Your touch is so empty  
Your touch is so empty  
  
I've been running  
From the bloodless  
For fear of exile  
For all of my sorceries  
That shun the light  
That shun the light  
  
I've been running  
From the bloodless  
For fear of exile  
For all of my sorceries  
That shun the light  
That shun the light  
  
The day they covered us in the dirt  
Like scars in the ground  
That will grow into dead flowers  
  
The day they covered us in the dirt  
Like scars in the ground  
That will grow into dead flowers  
  
I've been running  
From the bloodless  
For fear of exile  
For all of my sorceries  
That shun the light  
That shun the light  
  
I've been running  
From the bloodless  
For fear of exile  
For all of my sorceries  
That shun the light  
That shun the light  
  
I've been running  
From the bloodless  
For fear of exile  
For all of my sorceries  
That shun the light  
That shun the light  
  
I've been running  
From the bloodless  
For fear of exile  
For all of my sorceries  
That shun the light  
That shun the light  
  
Light  
Light  
Light  
Light
