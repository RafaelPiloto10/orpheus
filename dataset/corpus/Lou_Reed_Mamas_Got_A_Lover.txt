Mama's got a lover  
A painter I am told  
She's getting out of real estate  
For the art scene down in old Soho  
Art scene down in old Soho  
  
Mama's got a lover  
He owns a gallery  
She says he likes collages  
But the money's in graffiti  
Money's in graffiti  
  
[Chorus]  
Mama's got a lover  
I met him yesterday  
She says she hopes I like him  
Maybe I'll send him a card on father's day  
Father's day  
  
Mama's got a lover  
They're backing a film  
It's about a working mother  
Who gives birth to black and white Siamese twins  
Black and white Siamese twins  
  
Mama's got a lover  
He's got something to say  
He says he's into dirt and rot  
The essence of "urban decay"  
"Urban decay"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama's got a lover  
I met him yesterday  
She's starting a new chapter  
I wish she was on the last page  
The last page  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama's got a lover (mama's got a lover)  
Mama's got a lover (mama's got a lover), oh  
Mama's got a lover (mama's got a lover)  
My mama's got a lover (mama's got a lover)  
  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)  
(Mama's got a lover)
