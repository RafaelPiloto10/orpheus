Tell me how you feel when you're all alone no one to say  
I love you and you feel all your hope is gone  
Try to call your best friend.  
But he's not there, so you wind up feeling empty like no one cares  
  
My brother don't you worry storms don't last always  
There's a man from glory full of mercy and grace  
  
He'll pick you up he'll hold your hand he'll ease your pain  
so you can smile again good God Almighty  
  
Tell me how you feel when you're all alone  
No one to say I love you and you feel all your hope is gone  
Try to call your best friend but he's not there  
So you wind up feeling empty like no one cares  
  
My brother don't you worry storms don't last always  
There's a man from glory full of mercy and grace  
  
Keep your head up smile again  
keep your head up smile again
