[Chorus]  
If you're ever lonely you can call on me  
I'll be here for you all you've got to do is call  
I'm always waiting here for you  
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
For so many years I have been your friend  
And we've through everything time and time again  
But I want you to know that I still believe in you  
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
You've gotta keep trying even though the road gets hard  
You've gotta keep going on even though he broke your heart  
And if you ever need a friend I will be here for you  
All you've got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
[Chorus]
