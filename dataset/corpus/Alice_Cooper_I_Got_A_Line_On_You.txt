Well, I got to tell you something that'll go right to your head

I got my eye on you babe, on your velvet skin  
I want to put my hands were they've never been  
Get real hot in the midnight steam  
Soaking in the rain in my favorite dream  
Your lips are red, the moon is blue  
I only ask you once what you want to do  
Gonna touch you babe 'til the night is through  
Look out honey, got a line on you  
The winter's almost over, the summer she's coming on strong.  
I want to love you, love you, love you, love you all year long
