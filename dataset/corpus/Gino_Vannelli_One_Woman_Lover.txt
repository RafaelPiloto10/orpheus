Talk about my p's and q's and ladies I know  
I never cared for parties with a ten woman show  
I'm a one woman lover I'm a gentleman  
I don't need no other cause it's that I am  
Darlin' my dear I'm a whole man for you  
Well laugh about my tea's for two's and ladies I've kissed  
I've never charished harems don't make love to no list  
I'm a one woman lover I'm a regular ham  
I don't need no other cause it's that I am  
Darlin' madame I was born berserk for you  
Talk about my birds and bees and babies I've known  
I've never cared for free's for three's let's do it alone  
I'm a one woman lover I'm a gentleman  
I don't need no other cause it's that I am  
Darlin' my dear let us reant one night for two  
Ooooo yea.
