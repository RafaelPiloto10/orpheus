Gonna scrape the trouble off my boots!  
  
As they were dancing in the evening  
And the light shone through the trees  
This girl my eye was following  
Asked the band to play her a beat  
  
Singin' she'd do that long time jerk  
She hit me where it hurts  
Ohhh your heart  
Now my heart will burst  
Oh no  
  
Ah, but it took me back to that wonderland  
I witnessed long ago  
Babbling words of preachers  
Sayin'- "Don't bury me no more"  
  
Ohh...  
  
And I've forgotten how to worry  
And I don't know how to run  
Against the odds I realize  
This struggle could be won!  
  
We dance  
  
Long time jerk  
She did it to me first  
Ohhh my heart  
With that long time jerk  
  
Ah! Say..... Do that long time jerk.  
  
Bring on those tapes from the past  
They make you look better in a mirror  
Feel that long time jerkin'  
Between the taker and the giver  
  
Feel that...  
  
Long time jerk  
She hit me where it hurts  
Oh I felt my heart  
Now my heart will burst  
  
I've forgotten how to worry  
And I don't know how to run  
Against the odds I realize  
This struggle could be fun!  
  
Oh, through lanes and streets and houses  
And reversing rush of time  
She made me re-invent the world  
Before inventing time  
(Before inventing time)  
  
Long time jerk  
Oh, she hit me where it hurts  
Ohhhhh my heart  
Long time jerk  
  
Long, long, long, long, long  
Long time  
Long time jerk
