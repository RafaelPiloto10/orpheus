Oh hello  
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe  
Hung by his pretty white neck  
Some eighteen months ago  
I travelled to a mystical time zone  
And I missed my bed  
And I soon came home  
  
They said :  
"There's too much caffeine  
In your bloodstream  
And a lack of real spice  
In your life"  
  
I said :  
"Leave me alone  
Because I'm alright, dad  
Surprised to still  
Be on my own..."  
  
Oh, but don't mention love  
I'd hate the strain of the pain again  
A rush and a push and the land that  
We stand on is ours  
It has been before  
So it shall be again  
And people who are uglier than you and I  
They take what they need, and just leave  
  
Oh, but don't mention love  
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again  
A rush and a push and the land that  
We stand on is ours  
It has been before  
So why can't it be now?  
And people who are weaker than you or I  
They take what they want from life  
  
Oh, but don't mention love  
No - no, don't mention love!  
A rush and a push and the land that  
We stand on is ours  
Your youth may be gone  
But you're still a young man  
So phone me, phone me, phone me  
So phone me, phone me, phone me  
  
Oh, I think I'm in love  
Oh, I think I'm in love  
Oh, I think I'm in love (think I'm in love)  
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv  
Oh...
