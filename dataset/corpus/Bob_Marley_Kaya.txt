Wake up and turn I loose [Repeat: x3]  
For the rain is falling  
  
Got to have kaya now [Repeat: x3]  
For the rain is falling  
  
I'm so high, I even touch the sky  
Above the falling rain  
I feel so good in my neighborhood, so  
Here I come again  
  
Got to have kaya now [Repeat: x3]  
For the rain is falling

Cause I have some kaya now  
  
I feel so high, I even touch the sky  
Above the falling rain  
I feel so good in my neighborhood, so  
Here I come again  
  
Got to have kaya now  
Got to have kaya now

For the rain is falling
