Dear lord are you there  
Listening to my little prayer  
I don't know exactly what to say  
I've been told that you love me  
Anywhere I call you help me if I thought  
I should let it have it you way  
What I guess I'm trying to say  
Is I need you in my life  
'Cause I know I'm tired of living in the past  
I would like to take chance on a change deep inside  
I believe that this is one that going to last.  
So here is  
  
[Chorus]  
Here is my heart(my heart)  
It's been broken  
Its been woulden  
But I give it al to you if you were love me(if you were love me.. yeah hey)  
Here's my life  
If you want it  
You can have it  
I will give it all to you because you love me  
Love is everything I need  
  
Dear child  
I'm right here  
Trough your worries,trough you fairs  
I've been waiting for you to call my name  
All you know that I here you if you turn to me and trust my brothers to  
You will never feel the same  
Well I'm standing here to say that you need me in your life  
'Cause I know that you can't make it on your own(on your own)  
If you were take chance,let me change you deep inside  
I promise you will never be alone  
So here is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
you can turn to me and know that I will always stand by  
I gave it all for you so can have that gentle peace inside  
I will follow you cause I believe en everything you are  
I am you father ,you are my savior  
And in the matters of the heart  
I am taking yours,and you are taking mine  
  
[Chorus]
