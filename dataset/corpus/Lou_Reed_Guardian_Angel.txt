I have a guardian angel  
I keep him in my head  
And when I'm afraid and alone  
I call him to my bed  
  
I have a guardian angel  
Who keeps bad things from me  
The only way to ruin it would be for me not to trust me  
The only way to ruin it would be for me not to trust me  
I have a guardian angel  
Who's often saved my life  
  
Through malevolent storms and crystal drums  
The angel on my right  
Has lifted me up and set me down  
Always showing me what's right  
And if my instinct proved me wrong  
The angel set it right  
And if my instinct proved me wrong  
The angel set it right  
  
I have a guardian angel  
I keep him in my head  
And when I'm having nightmares  
He shows me dreams instead  
  
I have a ring  
I have a dress  
I have an empty shell  
By the books below tea cups  
I've kept a kind of hell  
By the books below tea cups  
I've kept a kind of hell  
  
Panic and anxiety so often in my head  
But I had a guardian angel  
Who took care of me instead  
The champagne cork, the nightlight owl  
A raven and a duck  
The seed of pining parents  
And your despairing love  
The seed of pining parents  
And your despairing love  
  
Love and luck both having charmed lives  
Can change all things about  
I had a guardian angel  
That's what this is all about  
  
I have a guardian angel  
I keep him in my head  
And when I thought I was alone  
He saved my life instead  
And when I thought I was alone  
He saved my life instead
