I went walking through the red light  
Through the dark night, in the winter  
Pretty girls in the window  
Pretty girls staring back at me  
I went walking cross the St. Charles  
To the Argyle downtown  
Met my friends in the back there  
You know we always have a really good time  
  
And I feel so alive  
And I feel so free  
Always listening to our favorite songs  
They play them all night long  
They play them all night long  
  
I woke up with a girly  
Way too early. Oh my head!  
I went walkin' to the newsstand  
All the suits staring back at me  
  
I went walking down Main Street  
Down to South Beach, Oh I crawled  
I went looking for the bee sting  
  
And I feel so alive  
And I feel so free  
Always listening to our favorite songs  
They play them all night long  
They play them all night long  
  
At the end of the world  
At the end of the world  
Will I see you again  
At the end of the world  
Take me home  
All the way
