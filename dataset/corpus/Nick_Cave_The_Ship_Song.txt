Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Come loose your dogs upon me  
And let your hair hang down  
You are a little mystery to me  
Every time you come around  
  
We talk about it all night long  
We define our moral ground  
But when I crawl into your arms  
Everything comes tumbling down  
  
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Your face has fallen sad now  
For you know the time is nigh  
When I must remove your wings  
And you, you must try to fly  
  
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Come loose your dogs upon me  
And let your hair hang down  
You are a little mystery to me  
Every time you come around
