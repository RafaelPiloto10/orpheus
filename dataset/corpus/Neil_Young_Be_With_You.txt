Crossin' the river in a big old boat,  
With a dollar bill in my hand.  
Gonna go fishin' in the afternoon,  
Got a simple plan.  
Oh yeah, baby.  
  
I got to hold on,  
I got to be strong,  
I got to live long,  
And be with you.  
  
Lonely nights and lonely days,  
When I'm not with you.  
Learned to trust and I learned to give,  
Found a love that's true.  
Oh yeah, baby.  
  
I got to hold on,  
I got to be strong,  
I got to live long,  
And be with you.  
  
Girl it shouldn't be too hard,  
To live with you.  
It's really not complicated,  
Until I get the blues.  
  
Come on over and sit right down,  
Let me take your hand,  
I got a love gonna fill you up,  
Take you to the promised land.  
Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah.  
  
I got to hold on,  
I got to be strong,  
I got to live long,  
And be with you.  
  
Be with you baby,  
Be with you baby,  
I got to be with you babe.  
Be with you baby, oh alright.  
  
Lonely nights, lonely days,  
When I'm not with you babe.  
Learned to trust and I learned to give,  
Found a love that's true, babe.  
Oh yeah, baby.  
  
I got to hold on now,  
Got to be strong now,  
To be with you.  
Be with you baby,  
Be with you baby.
