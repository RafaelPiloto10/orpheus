Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dust  
When up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lost  
He was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breed  
Saw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read  
  
[Chorus:]  
The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole  
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go  
  
Why aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal  
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal  
  
Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone  
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home  
They never caught me  
  
Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home  
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal  
All want me for their own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room  
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon
