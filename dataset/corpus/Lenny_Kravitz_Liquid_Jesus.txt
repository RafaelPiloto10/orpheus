Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
  
I feel something coming over me  
You and I were meant to be lovers  
I've been praying  
For the day that you would come to set me free  
It's finally over  
You have released me, baby  
Now we can fall in love and be reborn  
For all the world to see  
  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
  
I want to spend all eternity  
Loving you my darling  
It would be ecstasy  
Pure emotion  
Harmonic sounds  
Tasting all the life in all it's majesty  
  
If you want it  
I wanna give it baby  
I wanna give you something that  
You only thought was fantasy  
  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
  
Oh, no, no, no, no,  
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
If you want it  
I want to give it, baby  
I wanna give you something that  
You only thought was fantasy  
  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
Wash me over, wash me down  
I wanna get saved, baby  
Ooh liquid Jesus  
  
Oh no no  
Wash me over, wash me down
