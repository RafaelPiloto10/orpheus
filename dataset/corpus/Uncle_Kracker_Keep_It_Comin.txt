I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it,  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
  
Ain't it great to be alive  
Ain't it great to breathe  
Ain't it great to have hit songs hidden up my sleeves  
I ain't silly and my songs ain't cute  
I don't fly like a bird I just shine for loot, uh!  
You can believe I ain't close to done  
You talk hits, you've never been close to one  
  
You ain't supposed to run, you can tell them I said that  
Quick from the get, you know my hearts where my heads at  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
  
I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it,  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
  
Spent the last six months sittin' out in the cold  
You know I cried for help but I got put on hold  
We dropped double wide and you thought it would fold  
It wasn't lookin' good, but now your uncle went gold  
  
Sold five hundred thou like plow  
Pushed one million everybody went how?  
Now I'm two plus, sittin' two plush  
I dare your punk ass to ask me what?  
I sold the farm and bought it right back  
I was sittin' in the red but now I'm back in the black, uh!  
  
I'm in tact went from broke to plastic  
All my hoopties turned into classics  
I've outlasted singin' yes yes y'all  
Got em' all kinda hopin' I'll return their calls  
And just when you thought that there was nothin' to see  
You heard me comin' around the corner hummin', follow me  
And here I am, I'm live and direct  
I'm makin' everybody wonder what I'm gonna do next  
I don't flex because that's not my style  
I'll be singin' what I'm bringin' baby all the while and I  
  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it  
  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh
