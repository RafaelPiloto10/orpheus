We'll redesign  
Where we combine  
To be divine  
Love in us  
  
Give me the sign  
View these confines  
We start to shine  
Love in us  
  
Closer and closer  
And closer  
To you now  
Never enough  
  
Closer and closer  
You pull me  
Give me more  
Soft and slow  
  
We are breathing the same  
We are moving the same  
And we were  
And we are  
  
We're free-designed  
Become aligned  
We are combined  
Love in us  
  
Closer and closer  
And closer  
To you now  
Never enough  
  
Closer and closer  
You pull me  
Give me more  
Soft and slow
