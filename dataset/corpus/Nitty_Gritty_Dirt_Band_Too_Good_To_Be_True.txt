She's a young one  
Hard to find  
Can't be shaken  
Or handed a line  
Her eyes are loaded  
Point at you  
With a look  
That's too good to be true  
  
She takes your daydreams  
No concern  
All your night times  
You toss and you turn  
So independent  
Never alone  
She's a jewel  
That's much too hot to be worn  
  
She's a lovely, lovely girl  
High, lookin' down  
Upon her world  
Well I'll take a chance  
And play the fool  
But I know  
She's just too good to be true  
  
She's a young one  
Vanity's child  
Cosmopolitan  
Queen of the night  
So I'll catch her in the morning  
Sweet rendezvous  
But I know  
That girl's too good to be true  
  
She's a lovely, lovely girl  
High, in her lovely, lovely world  
Wooh, I'll take the chance  
And play the fool  
I know that girl's too beautiful  
She's too good to be true  
Much too good to be true  
She's too good to be true  
Woohoh, too good to be true  
Too good to be true  
Too good to be true  
Too good to be true  
Girl's too good to be true
