So you'll be an Austrian nobleman  
Commissioning a symphony in see  
Which defies all earthly descriptions  
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C  
  
With money you squeeze from the peasants  
To your nephew you can give it as a present  
This magnificent symphony in see  
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C  
  
Completely filling the palace concert hall  
It's warm and golden like an oven that's wide open  
It has a melody both happy and sad  
Built on victorious known triads  
  
You enter the room with great caution  
Though no-one in the hall is even watching  
They are transfixed, they are forgetting just to breathe  
They are so taken by your symphony in C  
  
You are sitting there thinking your thoughts  
They are not about what is but what is not  
You are sitting there breathing in your breath  
You are seldom breathing life but mostly death  
  
So you'll be an Austrian nobleman  
Commissioning a symphony in C  
Which defies all earthly descriptions  
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C
