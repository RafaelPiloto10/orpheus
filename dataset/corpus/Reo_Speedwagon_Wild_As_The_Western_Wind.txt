Outlaw running from the law but he's  
Got nowhere to run to  
Big law he broke it and ran faster  
Than the lightning bolt  
Chasing down the golden sun, running away  
From the blue  
He ran with no direction in mind, just  
Running like a crazy colt  
  
And he's gonna run let the four winds slap his face  
He's gonna fly, let the sky be his guide  
He's gonna lie beneath a blanket of stars  
He's gonna run, wild as the western wind  
  
Bad lands are sheltering him, maybe Dakota's  
His home  
Red man's become his friend, when no one else  
Would have him  
There's an Indian woman who keeps him from  
Being alone  
She stands tall by his side, but the law's  
Got him out on a limb
