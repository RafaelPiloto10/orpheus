I had a '56 t-bird  
Then i was king of the highway  
Trying to make it look fast and easy  
And dreamin' of doin' it my way  
Let's put the top down baby  
Feel the wind in our hair  
  
We were too young to know better  
And too cool to care  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Rock and roll on the radio  
Let's turn it up and get down  
  
Convertible dreams running wild in the streets  
In the all time american town  
When you played the thrill queen, baby  
I heard the jazz of joy  
You were every girl in the world  
But i wasn't every boy  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Memory pink and charcoal grey  
Are the clours i painted this song  
You were 19 and perfect, baby  
But no one stays perfect too long  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride
