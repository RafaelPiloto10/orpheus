You have eyes that lead me on  
And a body that shows me death  
Your lips look like they were made  
For something else, but they just suck my breath  
I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed  
And I know you're not just what you say to me  
And I'm not the only moment you're made of  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're so sudden and sweet on your legs, knockin' knees  
Head's blown clean off, your mouth paid off  
Fuck me till we know it's unsafe  
And we'll paint over the evidence  
  
Want you wanting me  
Want what I see in your eyes  
So give me something to be scared of  
Don't give me something to satisfy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed  
And I know you're not just what you say to me  
And I'm not the only moment you're made of  
  
[Chorus x 2]
