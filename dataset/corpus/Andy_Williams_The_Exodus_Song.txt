This land is mine  
God gave this land to me  
This brave and ancient land to me  
And when the morning sun  
Reveals her hills and plains  
Then I see a land  
Where children can run free  
So take my hand  
And walk this land with me  
And walk this lovely land with me  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
Tho' I am just a man  
When you are by my side  
With the help of God  
I know I can be strong  
  
To make this land our home  
If I must fight, I'll fight  
To make this land our own  
Until I die, this land is mine
