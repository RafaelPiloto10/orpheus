Alice Cooper - Guilty  
Just tried to have fun  
Raise hell and then some  
I'm a dirt talkin', beer drinkin' woman chasing minister's son  
  
Slap on the makeup  
Blast out the music  
Wake up the neighbors with a roar  
like a teenage heavy metal elephant gun.  
  
If you call that Guilty,..  
Then that's what I am  
I'm Guilty,..I'm Guilty!  
  
Like driving too fast  
Love going too far  
It seems the law's on my ass every time  
I stick it out of the door  
  
If you call that guilty,  
Then that's what I am!  
I'm guilty,..I'm guilty  
  
Bad boy on a summer night  
When the heat makes me mean and I want to fight  
Put my pedal on the metal and I do what I want to do  
Bad girls make me feel all right  
  
When it's hot and they start screamin' in the night  
Golly Gee, it's wrong to be,..  
so guilty! (I'm guilty)  
  
My conscience is on vacation  
In acute degeneration  
Willpower has sunk to an all time low  
  
If you call that guilty.,.  
Well then I guess I am..  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I'm guilty,..I'm guilty!  
  
I'm guilty,..and I don't care,..  
I'm guilty, and I think I've been framed anyway,...
