On the morning of her wedding day  
When no one was awake  
She drove across the border  
Leaving all the yellow roses on her wedding cake  
Her mother's tears, her breakfast order  
  
She's gone, gone, gone  
  
There is a moment, a chip in time  
When leaving home is the lesser crime  
When your eyes are blind with tears  
But your heart can see  
Another life, another galaxy  
  
That night her dreams are storm-tossed as a willow  
She hears the clouds  
She sees the eye of a hurricane  
As it sweeps across her island pillow  
  
But she's gone, gone, gone  
  
There is a moment, a chip in time  
When leaving home is the lesser crime  
When your eyes are blind with tears  
But your heart can see  
Another life, another galaxy
