Wake up to the sunlight with your windows open  
Don't hold in your anger or leave things unspoken  
Wear your red dress use your good dishes  
Make a big mess and make lots of wishes  
Have what you want, but want what you have  
And don't spend you life looking back  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
So go to the ballgames and go to the ballet  
And go see your folks more than just on the holidays  
Kiss all your children Dance with your wife  
Tell your husband you love him every night  
Don't run from the truth cause you can't get away  
Oh no  
Just face it and you'll be ok  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
Where ever you are and wherever you've been  
Now is a time to begin  
  
So give to the needy and Pray for the grieving  
Even when you don't think that you can  
Cause all that you do is bound to come back to you  
So think of your fellow man  
And make peace with God and Make peace with yourself  
Oh yeah  
Cause in the end there's nobody else  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live
