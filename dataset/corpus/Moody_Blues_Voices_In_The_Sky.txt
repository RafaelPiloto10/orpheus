Won't you take me back to school?  
I need to learn the golden rule  
Won't you lay it on the line?  
I need to hear it just one more time  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
Each and every heart it seems  
Is bounded by a world of dreams  
Each and every rising sun  
Is greeted by a lonely one  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
'Cause out on the ocean of life my love  
There a so many storms we must rise above  
Can you hear the spirit calling, as it's carried across the waves?  
You're already falling it's calling you back to face the music  
And the song that is coming through  
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you  
  
My a promise take a vow  
And trust your feelings it easy now  
Understand the voice within  
And feel a change already beginning  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight? Tonight?  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
And how many words have I got to say?  
And how many times will it be this way?  
With your arms around the future and your back up against the past  
You're already falling it's calling you on to face the music  
And the song that is coming through  
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you  
  
Each and every heart it seems  
Is bounded by a world of dreams  
Each and every rising sun  
Is greeted by, a lonely, lonely one  
  
Won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
(Repeat)
