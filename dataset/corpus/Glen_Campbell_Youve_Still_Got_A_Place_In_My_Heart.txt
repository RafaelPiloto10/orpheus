If the one you'd think is true ever turns his back on you  
You've still got a place in my heart  
If every road you take proves you made a big mistake  
Baby you've still got a place in my heart  
  
If I'm a fool to pray that you'll return some day  
Well then I'll know of million fools that love has made that way  
If the years should make you cry don't go on and live a lie  
Baby you've still got a place in my heart  
  
If the years should make you cry...
