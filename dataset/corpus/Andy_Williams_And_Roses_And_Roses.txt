Words and Music by Ray Gilbert and Dorival Caymmi  
  
Every day I sent another present  
Just to let her know how very much I care  
I wrote a little love note with each present  
But it didn't seem to get me anywhere  
  
My poor worried heart was almost certain  
That this love affair would never be  
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and  
From that moment she belonged to me  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank you for saying what I couldn't say  
Oh, what a wonderful way to tell her "I love you" each day  
With roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
(Roses and roses and roses and roses of love)  
  
Fade  
Roses and roses and roses and roses of love
