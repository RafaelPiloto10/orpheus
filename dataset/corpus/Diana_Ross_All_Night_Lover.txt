Ooh, I was created for you  
So glad that I've waited for you  
All night lover  
Use your magic power  
You can thrill me  
All night lover  
Thrill me by the hour  
Every time you hold me  
You just about control me  
For so long, so strong  
I'm gettin' weaker  
Each night with you  
Is like a beginning  
Ooh, renew me, do me  
Send that lovin' feelin' right through me  
All night lover  
You light the fire  
All night lover  
Lovin' never tires  
I don't wanna sleep now  
I got too much to keep now  
I dream, my dream  
When I'm wide awake  
I can't believe the way you move me  
You shake me, you take me  
You don't know how happy you make me  
Ooh, I was created for you  
So glad that I've waited for you  
More and more you, I adore you  
All night lover  
Use your magic power  
You can thrill me  
All night lover  
Thrill me by the hour  
Every time you hold me  
You just about control me  
Ooh, renew me, do me  
Send that lovin' feelin' right through me  
All night lover, oh, you light the fire  
Baby, baby, all night lover  
Thrill me by the hour  
You can thrill me  
All night lover  
Use your magic power  
I can't believe  
All night lover  
You can thrill me  
All night lover  
You can move me  
You can groove me  
All night lover  
Use your magic power  
Oh, stroke my fire  
All night lover
