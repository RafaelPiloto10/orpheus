Silent night surrounding me  
On the shore of wistful sea  
A kindest heart made me believe  
The world as I wish it to be  
  
Wind in the wheat  
Kiss by a hearth  
Little hideaways for a lonely heart  
  
Cast away in beauty's gloom  
The good in me, the child within  
A cruelest heart made me forget  
The world as I wish it to be  
  
Home inside but lost for life  
Human heart longing for love  
Slave to the toil, this mortal coil  
The strife, the suffering, the void  
  
Wind in the wheat  
Kiss by a hearth  
A dead calm winter morn,  
Morning birds, and a smile of a stranger  
  
Frozen moments in time  
Little hideaways, the marrow of life  
Little hideaways for a lonely heart  
  
Wind in the wheat  
Kiss by a hearth  
Little hideaways for a lonely heart  
  
Silent night surrounding me  
On the shore of wistful sea  
A kindest heart made me believe  
The world as I wish it to be.
