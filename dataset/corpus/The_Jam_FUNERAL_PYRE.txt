Down in amongst the streets tonight  
Books will burn, people laugh and cry in their turmoil  
(Turmoil turns rejoiceful)  
Shed your fears and lose your guilt  
Tonight we burn responsibility in the fire  
We'll watch the flames grow higher!  
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home  
And as I was standing by the edge  
I could see the faces of those led pissing themselves laughing  
(And the flames grew)  
Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said  
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger  
We feast on flesh and drink on blood  
Live by fear and despise love in a crises  
(What with today's high prices)  
Bring some paper and bring some wood  
Bring what's left of all your love for the fire  
We'll watch the flames grow higher!  
But if you get too burnt - you can't come back home  
And as I was standing by the edge  
I could see the faces of those led pissing themselves laughing  
(And the flames grew)  
Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said  
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger  
In the funeral pyre  
We'll watch the flames grow higher  
But if you get too burnt - you can't come back home  
(Well I feel so old, when I feel so young  
Well I just can't grow up to meet the demands)
