If I had money  
Tell you what I'd do  
I'd go downtown  
Buy a Mercury or two  
  
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Oh I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
  
Well, I had me a girl  
Stole her from a friend  
Friend got lucky  
Stole her back again  
  
Cause she thought he had a Mercury  
Oh she thought he had a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
C'mon!!  
  
Well, hey now mama  
Lookin' so fine  
Cruisin' round  
In your Mercury 69  
  
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Ooo, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
  
My girl went out  
Didn't stay long  
Bought herself a Mercury  
And cruised it on home  
  
Cause she know I have a Mercury  
Oh she know I have a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
  
Well, hey now mama  
Lookin' so fine  
Cruisin' round  
In your Mercury 69  
  
I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
Ooo, I'm crazy 'bout a Mercury  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down the road  
I'm gonna buy me a Mercury  
Cruise it up and down

And I'm gonna buy me some  
Mercury!! Yeah
