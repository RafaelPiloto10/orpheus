Natalie:  
Mozart was crazy  
Flat fucking crazy.  
Bat-shit, I hear,  
But his music's not crazy,  
It's balanced, it's nimble,  
It's crystalline clear.  
  
There's harmony, logic  
You listen to these,  
You don't hear his doubts  
Or his debts or disease.  
You scan through the score  
And put fingers on keys  
And you play...  
And everything else goes away.  
Everything else goes away.  
  
And you play 'til it's perfect,  
You play 'til you ache,  
You play 'til the strings  
Or you fingernails break.  
So you'll rock that recital  
And get into Yale,  
So you won't feel so sick  
And you won't look so pale,  
'Cause you've got your full ride  
And your early admit  
So you're done with this school  
And all of this shit,  
And you graduate early,  
You're gone as of May  
And there's nothing your  
Paranoid parents can say...  
  
And you know that it's just  
A sonata away...  
And you play...  
And you play...  
And everything else goes away.  
Everything else goes away.  
Everything else goes away.
