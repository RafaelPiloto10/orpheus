You don't know  
What's in store  
But you know what you're here for  
Close your eyes  
Lay yourself beside me  
Ohh  
Hold tight  
For this ride  
We don't need no protection  
Come on love  
We don't need attention  
  
Open your hand  
Take a glass  
Don't be scared  
I'm right here  
Even though  
You don't roll  
Trust me girl  
You wanna be high for this  
  
Take it off  
You want it off  
'Cause I know  
What you're feeling  
It's okay,  
Girl I feel it too  
  
Let it beat  
Baby breathe  
I swear I'm right here  
We'll be good  
I promise, we'll be so good  
Ehh  
  
Open your hand  
Take a glass  
Don't be scared  
I'm right here  
Even though  
You don't roll  
Trust me girl  
You wanna be high for this  
  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this yeahh ey oh  
You wanna be high for this
