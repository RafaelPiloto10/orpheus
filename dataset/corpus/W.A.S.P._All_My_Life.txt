[Jesse to self] All my life  
Lost in a dream  
Through my eyes  
A world no one sees  
  
All my life  
No place for me  
Through me eyes  
A child no one needs  
  
I can't take it no more  
Can't take it no more  
What spirits come from my soul  
  
Can't wait any more  
Can't hate any more  
Last steps to freedom I go  
  
Can't take it no more  
Forsaken for sure  
My wishing well's  
For washing the lost  
  
Can't wait anymore  
My pain is too much  
No one hears me  
There ain't no love  
  
No shame no more  
No blame for sure  
My wishing well is  
Calling me home  
  
[Jesse to Sister Sadie , His mother , Judah and The Disciples] Please don't
touch me  
Please don't touch me  
Please don't fuck me  
Please don't touch me  
Please don't touch me
