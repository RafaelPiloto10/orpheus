Get on the rollercoaster  
The fair's in town today  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
  
So get on the helter skelter  
Bowl into the fray  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
  
You fade in-out  
You fade in-out  
Without a doubt  
I don't see no shine  
  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow we'll be castaway  
Coming in-out of nowhere  
Singin' rhapsody  
  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to want to be  
Sitting upside a high chair  
The devil's refugee  
  
Is gonna be blinded by the light  
That follows me  
She fade in-out  
She fade in-out  
  
Without a doubt  
I don't see no shine  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow she'll be castaway  
  
We fade in-out  
We fade in-out  
Without a doubt  
I don't see no shine  
  
Today is just a daydream  
Tomorrow we'll be castaway  
Get on the rollercoaster  
The fair's in town today  
  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
Get on the helter skelter  
Step into the fray  
  
You've gotta be  
Bad enough to beat the brave  
You're fading out  
You're fading out
