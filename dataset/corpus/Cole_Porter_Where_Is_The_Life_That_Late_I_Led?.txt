Since I reached the charming age of puberty  
And began to think of feminine curls  
Like a show that's typically Shuberty  
I have always had a multitude of girls  
But now that a married man at last am I  
How aware of my dear departed past am I  
Where is the life that late I led?  
Where is it now? Totally dead!  
Where is the fun I used to find?  
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!  
A married life may all be well  
But raising an heir could never compare  
With raising a bit of hell  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I...  
In dear Milano, where are you Momo?  
Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo  
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?  
Still peddling your pizza in the streets-a Toremina  
And in Firenze, where are you Alice?  
Still there in your pretty itty-bitty pity palace  
And sweet Lucretia, so young and gay  
What scandalous doings in the ruins of Pompeii  
Where is the life that late I led?  
Where is it now? Totally dead!  
Where is the fun I used to find?  
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!  
The marriage game is quite all right  
Yes during the day it's easy to play  
But oh what a bore at night  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I...  
Where is Rebecca? My Becky-wecky-oh  
Could still she be cruising that amusing Pontevecchio?  
Where is Fedora, the wild virago?  
It's lucky I missed her gangster sister from Chicago  
Where is Venetia, who loved to chat so?  
Could still she be drinking in her stinking pink palazzo?  
And lovely Lisa, where are you Lisa?  
You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza  
Where is the life that late I led?  
Where is it now? Totally dead!  
Where is the fun I used to find?  
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!  
I've oft been told of nuptial bliss  
But what do you do at quarter to two  
With only a shrew to kiss?  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I led
