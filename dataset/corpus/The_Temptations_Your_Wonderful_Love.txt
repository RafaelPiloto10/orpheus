Just for your  
Wonderful love  
Wonderful love  
I'd give anything  
In this whole wide world  
Just believe in me  
Please have a little faith in me  
Darling I'll never  
I'll never let you down  
Now that I have  
  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
  
Darling darling darling darling  
Im so happy  
But I cant tell my friends that  
You're my girl  
Im so proud  
Yes so proud  
I just wanna fall on my knees and cry  
Cry out loud  
That I have  
  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love
