Mother 's first look to the eyes of a child  
Casts the die of destiny  
It's a perfect life she gives to you  
Not to lose so innocently  
Leading the way, she rises above  
Unexpected adversity  
I hear her calling, keeper of the light  
The words of warning, thunder in the night  
I hear her calling, guarding what is right  
I see her waiting, keeper of the light  
  
A silhouette on the skyline, a symbol of your liberty  
Protecting time that's passing by  
Mother knows, never lies  
A better life the children will see  
A world of change, full of hope and sympathy  
  
I hear her calling, keeper of the light  
The words of warning, thunder in the night  
I hear her calling, guarding what is right  
I see her waiting, keeper of the light  
  
Repeat
