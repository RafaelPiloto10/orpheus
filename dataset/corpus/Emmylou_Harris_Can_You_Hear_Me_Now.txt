O the walls are closin' in I can feel it in my bones  
Like water risin' up to my chin  
Another long night to be alone  
I could go out on the town  
Talk too much and laugh too loud  
If I'm already on my way down  
I might as well just work the crowd  
  
Can you hear me now  
O the stories I could tell  
Sometimes I really hit my stride  
We make our own Heaven and our own Hell  
Tryin' to get across to the other side  
But everyday ends up the same  
One step up, two steps back  
Like some old silent movie frame  
Zoom in close, then fade to black  
  
Can you hear me now  
How did the load get to be  
so heavy I used to wear my trouble like a crown  
A bad flood's poundin' on the levee  
And I'm gonna need some help  
To hold my ground  
  
But I'm sinkin' like a stone  
To where in solitude this life I'll spend  
In the coldest place I've ever known  
I'm here just waitin' until the end I send up my S.O.S.  
A message in a bottle set out to sea It just reads
