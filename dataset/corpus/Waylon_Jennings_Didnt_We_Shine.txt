Hello, it's good to see you  
Just how long has it been  
I've often wondered what I'd say  
If we ever met again  
If I'd try just being clever  
Or pretend not to remember  
But it's funny how you've lingered  
On my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Didn't we shine  
Didn't we shine  
Didn't we share and care  
And lay our hearts on the line  
Maybe it wasn't meant to last  
Till the end of time  
Oh, but while it did  
Didn't we shine  
  
I still have some blue days  
That I could do without  
And when I have my blue days  
You're all I think about  
But I've long ago forgiven you  
For what you did or didn't do  
Now all I can recall  
Are the happy times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Was it my imagination  
Or didn't we shine
