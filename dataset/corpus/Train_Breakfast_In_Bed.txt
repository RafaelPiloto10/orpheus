California, dancin' in the ocean  
How I love you  
Better wear some lotion  
Sun is always shinin'  
No one compares to you  
  
Sittin' here baby  
Young and like a flower  
How I want you  
Gimme just an hour  
You seem like an angel  
No one compares to you  
  
You're the best book I ever read  
You're the smartest thing I ever said  
You're breakfast in bed  
  
When in no way  
You can do me more ways  
Than any other  
You treat me like you love me  
Like a mother loves her baby  
Baby do I do it for you  
Oh, 'cause all I ever wanted baby  
Baby was to do it for you  
  
You're the best dream in my head  
You're my calm thought when I see red  
You're better than punk rock red  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed  
  
Wanna please you  
Wanna Japanese you  
How I need you  
Dress you up and feed you  
Love you like a daddy loves his baby  
Baby do it for me  
  
You're the fastest race I ever led  
You're the finest bride I'll ever wed  
You're the skin I never wanna shed  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed  
You're breakfast in bed
