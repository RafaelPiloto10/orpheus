We used to be frightened and scared to try  
Of things we don't really understand why  
We laugh for a moment and start to cry  
We were crazy  
  
Now that the end is already here  
We reminisce 'bout old yells and cheers  
Even if our last hurrahs were never clear  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Farewell to you, my friends  
We'll see each other again  
Don't cry 'cause it's not the end of everything  
I may be miles away  
But here is where my heart will stay  
With you  
My friends, with you  
  
Yesterday's treasure, today is here  
Tomorrow on its way, the sky is clear  
Thank you for the memories  
Of all the laughter and tears  
  
And not to mention our doubts and our fears  
The hypertension we gave to our peers  
It's really funny to look back  
After all of these years  
  
Farewell to you, my friends  
We'll see each other again  
Don't cry 'cause it's not the end of everything  
I may be miles away  
But here is where my heart will stay  
With you  
My friends, with you  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
  
Farewell to you, my friends  
We'll see each other again  
Don't worry 'cause it's not the end of everything  
I may be oceans away  
But here is where my heart will stay  
With you  
My friends, with you  
With you, my friends  
With only you
