Well I saw a young man by a telephone  
He was sitting alone in the rain  
I said hey young man what you doing there  
And he said sir I'm going insane  
He said sir I'm going insane  
  
You see I love an American beauty  
But nobody here understands  
Then he looked to the sky with resentment in his eyes  
And said Lord why am I in Japan  
Oh Lord why am I in Japan  
  
Then he told me a story about yesterday  
When he walked in the search of a friend  
But nobody came to his rescue  
And he came to his bitter end  
  
He pulled me close and said they all stopped and stared  
As I walked down the street all alone  
Nobody knew my name  
Nobody knew my name  
  
I said young man I know where you're going  
And young man I know where you've been  
For I've been in this land for a lifetime it seems  
And I'm never to come back again  
No I'm never to come back again  
  
So I turned and I gave him my blessing  
And I left him alone in the rain  
But I had to just stop and laugh at myself  
Still nobody knows my name  
  
Nobody knows my name  
  
Still nobody knows my name  
Nobody knows my name  
Nobody knows my name  
My name, yeah yeah
