You remind a little of a man  
You even resemble his picture  
Oh violins will playing  
On your grave  
  
I saw your crying  
I caught you lieing  
I know you cheated  
Inside you're laughing  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
No sympathy  
For your symphony of lieing  
  
Violins  
They'll be playing playing  
On your grave  
They'll be playing playing  
  
Tell those invited  
Tell those invited  
Our kids was playing  
The band is silent  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
No sympathy  
For your symphony of lieing  
  
Violins  
They'll be playing playing  
On your grave  
They'll be playing playing  
Violins  
They'll be playing playing  
On your grave  
They'll keep playing playing  
  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
I know you cheated  
Inside your laughing  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
So sympathy  
For your symphony of lieing  
You got me running  
You got me hiding  
I know you're lieing  
You got me running  
You got me  
You got me  
You really got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You really got me
