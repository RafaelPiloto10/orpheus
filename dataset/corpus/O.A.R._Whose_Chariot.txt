A pattern sunrise, swept  
Along the way a sunrise.  
And under these overpasses,  
A towering mountain does rise.  
Don't cross the river not over there,  
There'll be a mystery revealed,  
And I bet you dare.  
And if I am to seek this place you can see,  
Who's chariot to follow so I, can be free?  
  
At night the stars cry,  
I gaze upon a lake of backyard,  
And under these overpasses,  
A towering mountain does lie.  
Don't cross the river not over there,  
There'll be a mystery revealed,  
That were meant to share.  
So if I am to seek this place you can see,  
Who's chariot to follow so I, can be free?  
  
Oh No, here we are again.  
Oh No, here we are again.  
  
My momma told me,  
"Don't go 'cross that river,  
Because you might not make it back,  
The beast gonna eat your heart."  
She said, "Don't go out there,  
Stay upon your track.  
This money has torn my family apart,  
And I cannot buy it back."  
So of course I built my boat,  
And I was half upon my way.  
When I got to the other side,  
The water came rushing down,  
Washed me away.  
  
Who's Chariot? Who's Chariot? Who's Chariot?  
Chariot? Who's Chariot? Whose Chariot?  
Chariot? Chariot? Who's Chariot?  
Chariot? Chariot?  
  
Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?  
Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?  
Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?  
Who's Chariot? Take me home!  
Take me home.  
  
Oh No, said I'm out that door again,  
I left my house, my money,  
And my dearest friend.  
I'm not going back jack.  
I cross the river got a little  
Bit of business that I'm doing today.  
You didn't feel me,  
You can't really see no good,  
I made my life out a stack of wood.  
I've been moving cross the river today,  
But Who's Chariot?  
Take me home! Take me home.  
  
Whose chariot? Take me home.  
Hallaluyah! Coming home.  
Chariot, gotta, where will you take me.  
Chariot will ya, will ya take me.  
Chariot will ya, will ya take me.  
Oh Chariot would ya pick me up, take me.  
Oh Chariot, gotta, oh will you take me!  
Chariot just pick me up and take me!  
Oh Chariot, come and get me.  
Who's Chariot? Take me home!  
Take me home.
