We stumble in a tangled web  
Decaying friendships almost died  
And hide behind a mask of lies  
We twist and turn and we avoid  
All hope and salvage now devoid  
I see the truth behind your eyes  
So take all this noise to your brain  
And send it back again  
I'll bare the cost shed my skin call  
You up and then...  
I'll say the words out loud  
  
You could resurrect a thousand  
Words to deceive me more and more  
A thousand words will give the  
Reasons why I don't need you  
Anymore  
  
Time manipulates your heart,  
Preconceptions torn apart  
Begin to doubt my state of mind  
But I won't go down on what I said  
I won't retract convictions read  
I may perplex, but I'm not blind  
So take all this noise to your brain  
Send it back again  
I'll bear the cost shed my skin,  
Call you up and then  
I'll say the words out loud  
  
You could resurrect a thousand  
Words to deceive me more and more  
A thousand words will give the  
Reasons why I don't need  
You anymore  
  
I'll say the words out loud. I'll say  
A thousand words or more  
Manipulation. Fabricaton.  
Conversation. Annihalation.  
I'll say a thousand words or more  
Domination. Frustration. Elevation.  
Procreation.  
I'll say a thousand words our more  
  
You could resurrect a thousand  
Words to deceive me more and more  
A thousand words will give the  
Reasons why I don't need you anymore
