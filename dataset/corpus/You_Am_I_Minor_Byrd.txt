At my nan's I wasn't thinking  
over boiled beans and chicken  
Something cool fell in my juice cup  
sudden I could lie and make stuff up  
Is that why  
my future's so bright?  
So strap in and go  
the backyard rock show  
When all city folk got southern  
paint my face up with my brother  
Uncle choked and started shaking  
over whiskey, eggs and bacon  
Is that why  
our nights look so bright?  
So strap in and go  
Backyard rock show.
