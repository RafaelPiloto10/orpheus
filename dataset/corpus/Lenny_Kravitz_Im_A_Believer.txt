I got to let it, got to let it, got to let it go  
I got to live so I can enjoy the show  
The only element that's in the way is me  
So love it if you feel it and let it be, let it be  
  
Yeah!  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
No time to stay  
Life is moving much too fast  
Before we know it what we're doin'  
That will be the past  
And if we only knew how much time left we got to live  
We'd stop right, turn around  
And start again, start again  
Start again, start again  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
We got to live this last moment, baby  
Let's take it to the top  
This is our moment  
And has been right here before  
Come on and join me on a trip  
We'll explore this  
  
So come on baby  
Let's be on our way  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer
