There's a light in the darkness  
Though the night black as my skin  
There's a light burning bright showing me the way  
But I know where I've been  
  
There's a cry in distance  
It's a voice that comes from deep within  
There's a cry asking why  
I pray the answer's up ahead yeah  
'cause I know where I've been  
  
There's a road we've been travellin'  
Lost so many on the way  
But the riches will be plenty  
With the price, the price we had to pay  
There's a dream in the future  
  
There's a struggle that we have yet to win  
And there's pride in my heart  
'cause I know where I'm going, yes I do  
And I know where I've been, yeah  
  
There's a road that we must travel  
There's a promise that we must make  
Oh the riches will be plenty  
Oh the dream in the future  
Oh the struggle we must win  
Use that pride in our heart  
To lift us up  
Lord knows i know  
Where I've been
