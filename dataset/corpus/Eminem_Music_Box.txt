Yo, yeah girl,  
Can you hear that? It's playing our song  
Are you sleepy? Take a nap  
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?  
  
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep  
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep  
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep  
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat  
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet  
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street  
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet  
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek  
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham  
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam  
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey  
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am  
  
[Chorus]  
(My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My music box)  
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)  
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)  
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)  
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)  
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)  
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)  
  
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross  
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose  
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose  
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know  
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around  
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds  
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out  
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out  
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?  
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house  
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box  
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked  
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts  
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts  
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark  
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's  
Neck like a pixie stick  
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,  
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in  
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'  
The mortician of love, sent from above,  
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become  
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb  
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns  
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder  
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her  
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her  
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her  
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her  
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha  
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya  
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula  
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her  
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her  
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera  
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela  
  
[Chorus]
