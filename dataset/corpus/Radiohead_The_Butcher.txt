Beauty will destroy your mind  
Spare the gory details  
Give them gift wrap for the man with everything  
  
Though I lived a lonely life  
I was confused  
I'm butcher  
Feel nothing  
As it closes up my arms  
The position of the worms  
Up, up, through my heart  
Into my brain  
  
I'm the big slack basic combination  
Cut out  
Chop, liver on the block  
My heart still pumping  
My heart still pumping  
  
He's a warrior, warrior  
He's a little bitch coming out of him  
He's a warrior, warrior  
He's a little bitch coming out of him  
Coming out of him
