On the front page of the paper  
Speeding window of a train  
On a billboard on a highway  
It always looks the same  
A smile out of nowhere,  
Stops me in my tracks  
Can't believe that after all this time  
You still have that kind of impact  
  
Everywhere I turn I see your face  
Proving that a fool's love never fades  
In my mind your image is forever burned  
I keep trying not to stare but your always there  
Everywhere I turn  
  
In a steamed up cafe window  
I spell out your name  
I watch people run across the street  
Through the pouring rain  
There you are again so easy to find  
Under the umbrella in another woman's eyes  
  
Well I thought I'd suffered long enough for you babe  
And my mind would let go of the pain, any day  
But it don't work that way....
