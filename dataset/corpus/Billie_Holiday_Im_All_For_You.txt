Let our friends say what they want to say  
If I'm wrong I'll be the one to pay  
No matter if it's true  
You'll find that I'm all for you  
  
Let the cards predict we'll drift apart  
And the stars forfeit of broken heart  
No matter it they do  
You'll find that I'm all for you  
  
I only know come what may  
You'll always find me by your side  
I may be a fool  
Time alone will decide  
  
Let them all say that it's just a game  
And I'm sure to lose  
But just the same no matter if I do  
You'll find that I'm all for you
