I was walking down the street  
With my old friend luke  
And the strangest thing we saw  
There was a flash like dynamite  
And we fell down to the floor  
And as we looked up this weird dude stood  
I guess he was standing about four feet five  
With a nonchalance and a joie de vivre  
His face was grinning from side to side  
  
Chorus  
Well he said button up and tighten your lip  
Keep a check on what you say  
Those crazy words you fling from your mouth  
Are going to bounce back on you some day  
  
Now several years pass  
I thought nothing more  
It was down to a nine to five grind  
I was shuffling round to my old friend's house  
I had party on my mind  
While chatting this chick  
A guerilla muscled in  
A brace of henchmen right behind  
My blood boiled hard  
I'll give you a piece of my mind  
And this guy appeared by my side  
Don't you know what he said  
  
Chorus  
  
I was walking down the street with my old friend luke  
We were getting into a bit of a heavy scene  
He say yes and I say no  
He say what do you mean  
I pulled my piece and he pulled his  
We stared each other right in the eye  
There was a flash like dynamite  
And this guy appeared by our side  
  
Chorus
