Look at you, baby  
Standing in the shadows  
Wondering what I'm doing here  
Wishing something would happen  
Maybe I could disappear  
She walks in with that look in her eye  
Somehow she doesn't even have to try  
Just kick off your shoes, get on the floor  
This is what we came here for  
Oh, you've got to break it down  
You've got to get it out  
Just get on the floor  
Everybody wonders when they look at you  
Everybody wonders what you're gonna do  
You got it all wrapped up, you do  
Everybody wonders when they look at, look at you  
Look at you, baby, look at you, baby  
In the middle of the dance floor  
Lights shinin' in my face  
Twistin', shoutin' there was no doubt  
People dancing all over the place  
Out of the corner of my eye she said  
Why don't you come and give it a try?  
Get on the floor  
Just kick off your shoes  
You ain't got a thing to lose  
Oh, you've got to break it down  
It's time to get it out  
Just get on the floor  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Oh, whoa, whoa, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Look at you, look at you, baby  
Oh, whoa, whoa, baby  
I was standing in the shadows  
Wondering what I'm doing here  
Wishin' something would happen  
So that I could disappear  
She breaks the silence with a move of her hips  
You better hang on  
Don't want to lose your grip  
Kick off your shoes  
Get on the floor  
This is what we're waiting for  
Oh, you've got to break it down  
You've got to get it out  
Just get on the floor
