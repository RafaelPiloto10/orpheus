I've got a song that it is my mind  
My little love who is never unkind  
"I'm a poet and I'm better off dead"  
These are the words she said  
Down by the breadline, pickin' up dough  
Hand me the guitar, there I'll go  
I would rather make a living instead  
Instead of bein' in the red  
My little love from the world outside  
Helpin' me keep, turnin' the tide  
Come and meet me by the neon light  
And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright  
I'll do anything you see fit, my little love  
My little love movin' in my soul  
My little love who will never turn cold  
It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved  
It doesn't matter if I ain't behaved  
My little love you been on my side  
Helpin' me keep, turnin' the tide  
Havin' a hard time livin' right now  
Havin' a fine time showin' you how  
My little love from the world out there  
Helpin' me keep, a-doin' my share  
Come and meet me by the neon light  
And I'm hopin' you will make it alright  
I'll do anything you see fit, my little love  
I've got a song that it is my mind  
My little love who is never unkind  
"I'm a poet and I'm better off dead"  
These are the words she said  
Down by the breadline, pickin' up dough  
Hand me the guitar, there I'll go  
It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved  
It don't matter if I ain't behaved  
I got a light that is in my soul  
I got a love that'll never turn cold  
Come and meet me by the neon tonight  
And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright  
I'll do anything you see fit, my little love  
I'll do anything you see fit, my little love
