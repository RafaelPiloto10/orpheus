Funeral held for the depression of man  
Holds the key to his own death  
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived  
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck  
  
Sifting away the debris of hated life  
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine  
Seeking life beyond your perishment  
Repeating words echoing through your mind  
  
Chanting lines of blind witchery  
To save yourself from extinction  
Wanting to die is your reason to live  
New life born from the oppressed  
  
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air  
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall  
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near  
Fatality, reality, you await the final call  
  
My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it  
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity  
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth  
Come and die with me forever  
Share insanity  
  
Do you want to die!  
  
The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies  
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind  
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality  
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death
