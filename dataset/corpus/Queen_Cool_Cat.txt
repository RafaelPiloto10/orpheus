Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
You're taking all the sunshine away  
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)  
'Cause you're a cool cat  
Tapping on the toe with a new hat  
Ooh just cruising  
Driving along like the swing king  
Feeling the beat of my heart, huh!  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
  
Ooh you're a cool cat  
Coming on strong with all the chit chat  
Ooh you're alright  
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight  
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah!  
  
Ooh you used to be a mean kid  
Ooh making such a deal of life  
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting  
To really hit the big time  
But did it happen? Happen, no!  
You're speeding too fast, slow down  
Slow down, you'd better slow down, slow down  
  
You really know how to set the mood  
And you really get inside the groove  
Cool cat tapping on the toe with a new hat  
Ooh just cruising  
Driving along like the swing king  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah!  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Can you feel it?  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Ooh feeling, feeling, feeling  
Feeling every feeling.
