When I get home, I'm gunna clean up my house  
When I get home, I'm gunna kick out that mouse  
When I get home, I'm gunna put things in order  
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna make that call  
When I get home, I'm gunna talk it through  
When I get home, I'm gunna straighten it out  
but right now, right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna give up the booze  
When I get home, I'm gunna get me some food  
When I get home, I'm gunna quit them drugs  
but right now, right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna call my mother  
When I get home, I'm gunna cook her some dinner  
When I get home, I'm gunna invite my brothers  
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna see my little boy  
When I get home, I'm buy him a little toy  
When I get home, he's gunna jump for joy  
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna unpack my bags  
When I get home, I'm gunna waash these dirty rags  
When I get home, I'm gunna pack 'em up again  
but I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go right back roaming.
