We go down  
To a foriegn land  
Dive through the clouds  
You hold the guiding light in your hands  
This must be all that there is  
Times don't come much more beautiful  
You can show me places that my eyes have never seen  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
You could be my angel who just  
Walks out of a dream  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
I have all faith in you  
And these tenderest moments (these tenderest moments)  
We circle low  
Embrace the night as she draws us in  
A holy shroud  
A veil to hide our tenderest moments  
This must be all that there is  
Times don't come much more beautiful  
You can show me places that my eyes have never seen  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
You could be my angel who just  
Walks out of a dream  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
I have all faith in you  
And these tenderest moments (these tenderest moments)
