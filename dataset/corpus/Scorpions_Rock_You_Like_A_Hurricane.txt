It's early morning, the sun comes out  
Last night was shaky and pretty loud  
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin  
So what is wrong with a night of sin?  
  
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell  
So give her inches and feed her well  
More days to come, new places to go  
I've got to leave, it's time for the show  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
My body is burning, it starts to shout  
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud  
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose  
Just have to make it with someone I choose  
  
The night is calling, I have to go  
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show  
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win  
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Are you ready, baby?)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Come on, come on, baby)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
It's early morning, the sun comes out  
Last night was shaky and pretty loud  
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin  
So what is wrong with a night of sin?

Rock you like a hurricane (Are you ready, baby?)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Come on, come on, come on, come on)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane
