I think you might like to hear something from us  
Stand up  
Put your hands up  
Come on get up  
  
Kid Rock's in the house yo, Ready to pick up  
The tempo and you know so I will fo somewhat unconventional  
But comprehendible  
I'm the presentable good lookin  
  
The Mello Yellow young fellow and I'm cookin  
Heatin' the house up just like a hot late  
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate  
You didn't think in a blink I'd stnd here  
  
Now your in fear and stand clear  
You can't come near this hot sylin  
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin  
Aso the perfect lyric announcer  
  
On the set with a cold forty ouncer  
Ready to glide from sid to side  
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride  
  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
  
N-NNow yes I'm new  
But before I'm threw  
Your gonna see I paddle my own canoe  
'Cause I'm solo  
  
A young pro on the go  
Close to an angel  
But I wear no Halo  
I just shake, create, and never act fake  
  
And I learned to dislike and not hate  
Because hatred leads to an uproar  
Violence is on thing I am not here for  
I'm just here flat out  
  
And to blow the roof  
Kick some watts and that's what I inted to do  
Pump it up like an air comb presser  
Teach to each like a wise professor  
  
No job I strive to reach high  
Make the girls in the house all sigh  
And I'll glide from side to side  
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride  
  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
  
Appied, Step in Stride you bet I do  
Get you hig like a bottle of German Brew  
Comin clean  
New on the scene  
  
Makin girls scream  
I you know what I mean  
'Cause they dream ofme to rock the place  
And put a big smile upon their face  
  
Any girl of any race  
But they have to like the bass  
And that's the rep I've earned and kept on te set  
Workin up a sweat  
  
No Jive Kid Rock uprrivd  
And I Step in Stride  
  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
