Bluebells of scotland : to nat the cat, minnie and alec  
O where tell me where has your heelin' laddie gone?  
O where tell me where has your heelin' laddie gone?  
He's gone wi' streamin' banners where noble deeds are done  
And it's oh in my heart that I wish him safely hame  
O what lassie what does your heelin' laddie wear?  
O what lassie what does your heelin' laddie wear?  
A scarlett coat and bonnet wi' bonnie yellow hair  
And there's none in the world can wi' my sweet love compare  
Oh what tell me what if your heelin' lad be slain  
Oh what tell me what if your heelin' lad be slain  
O no true love will be his guard  
And bring him safe again  
O my heart would break if my heelin' lad be slain  
O what will you claim for your constancy tae him?  
O what will you claim for your constancy tae him?  
I'll claim a priest tae wed us and a clerk tae say amen  
And I'll ne'er part again from my bonnie heelin' man
