Mr. Worldwide  
Let's celebrate  
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4,  
I just wanna celebrate  
I just wanna celebrate  
Tonight we're making history  
I just wanna celebrate  
  
We've been around the world, say ain't so  
Work hard, play hard, all day long  
All the continents get jealous over me  
You can see me 3D overseas  
If you know me then you know where to find me  
Off to the Bahamas with a bad one behind me  
Now live it up, live it up, live it up  
Baby pick it up, pick it up, pick it up  
And we gon'  
Boom boom around the world  
Boom boom no kidding girl  
Boom boom That's the way we like to play  
We gon'  
Boom boom around the world  
Boom boom no kidding girl  
Boom boom That's the way we like to play  
  
[Chorus:]  
I just wanna celebrate  
I just wanna celebrate  
Tonight we're making history  
I just wanna celebrate  
  
I've been patientely waiting for you to shake and shake it  
Make it or take it  
The point is who made it  
Courted by the game, call us Tom Brady  
And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies  
But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name is Equator  
All around the globe, matter fact see your later  
They're great, They great at war, world dominators  
And we're also some smooth operators, and we gon'  
  
Boom boom around the world  
Boom boom no kidding girl  
Boom boom That's the way we like to play  
We gon'  
Boom boom around the world  
Boom boom no kidding girl  
Boom boom That's the way we like to play  
  
[Chorus:]  
I just wanna celebrate  
I just wanna celebrate  
Tonight we're making history  
I just wanna celebrate  
  
[Bridge:]  
Live it up (live it up) don't let life live you (live you)  
It's a good time, so we give you (give you)  
Now live it up, live it up, live it up  
What you wanna do?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I just wanna celebrate  
I just wanna celebrate  
Tonight we're making history  
I just wanna celebrate  
  
Turn it up  
Let's celebrate  
Turn it up  
Let's celebrate
