Love Is On The Line  
  
Love Is On The Line  
  
  
I love the way you move me,  
But baby you move me too fast  
I dig it when you hold me,  
But I want to be sure it will last  
I smile when you are with me,  
Even when you hold my hand  
So good I can't believe it,  
But I want you to understand  
  
A woman needs a little space to contemplate,  
And it always seems to me  
That good things come to those who wait.  
  
Love is on the line  
Time is on our side  
Want it to be right,  
Want it to be mine,  
Love is on the line.  
  
You tell me what you're feeling,  
Keeping me up with the score,  
You give me all I need, I couldn't ask for more.  
  
A woman needs a little space to contemplate,  
And it always seems to me  
That good things come to those who wait.  
  
Love is on the line  
Time is on our side  
Want it to be right,  
Want it to be mine,  
Love is on the line.  
  
You could be the one forever,  
I'd be happy ever more,  
But if we're to be together Baby, I got to be sure.  
  
A woman needs some space to contemplate,  
And it always seems to me  
That good things , good things, good things...  
  
Love is on the line  
Time is on our side  
Want it to be right,  
Want it to be mine,  
Love is on the line  
  
  
Love is on the line...
