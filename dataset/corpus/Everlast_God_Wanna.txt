I said God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
Come on, bounce, rock, skate  
Tune in, drop out, de-motivate  
Renegotiate for the proper rate  
Somethin' to push weight, have to go up state  
And fuckin' jailbait is statutory rape  
And don't you never get your ass caught on tape  
This ain't New York, there ain't no escape  
And Superman's just another pimp in a cape  
And even if both your eyes come up snake  
It's time to get wise, rise and cut the cake  
It don't take much for the Earth to quake  
So watch what you clutch when you on the tape  
I'm tryna tell you  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
I don't know where I'm going, I hardly know where I've been  
The only thing I know for sure, the party's bout to begin, you got it  
Thousand angels dancing, all on the head of a pin  
Some people live in righteousness, and some people live in sin, you got it  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
Everybody jump in Lord, everybody jump in  
Everybody jump in Lord, everybody jump in, you got it  
Yo I'm a pimp, I'm a thief, I'm a killer, I'm a dealer  
I'm a Holy man preacher, I'm a teacher, I'm a healer  
I'm a mover, I'm a shaker, I'm a giver, I'm a taker  
I'm a long time bonafide big money maker  
I'm a winner, I'm a loser, I'm a begger, I'm a choser  
I'm a thug, I'm a poser, I'm a chronic drug user  
I've been rapping, I've been mixing, I'm fact and then I'm fiction  
I'm a walkin' talkin' livin' breathin' contradiction  
I'm working for my God but I'm playing with the devil  
Don't act like you can see me cause I'm on another level  
I'm a mic burner, not a trick turner  
I'll act like Ike Turner, then I'll treat you like Tina  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to wear my skin  
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it  
God want to fill my heart, the devil want to take my soul  
Gotti got a broken heart, party's gotten out of control, you got it  
The party's gotten out of control, y'all  
The party's gotten out of control  
The party's gotten out of control, y'all  
The party's gotten out of control, you got it
