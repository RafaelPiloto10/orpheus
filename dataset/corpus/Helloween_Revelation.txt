Now we chase the end of time  
Afraid what we will find  
Once again since Jesus Christ  
The stars look down on mankind  
  
Revelation  
Overcome creation  
False illusions  
Fade and die  
Whatever we awaited  
Charity and hatred  
Whatever we awaited  
Will arise  
It's revelation  
Revelation  
  
Power and prosperity  
It won't be like before  
Name, rank and authority  
Not counting anymore  
  
Revelation  
Overcome creation  
False illusions  
Fade and die  
Whatever we awaited  
Charity and hatred  
Whatever we awaited  
Will arise  
It's revelation  
Revelation  
  
Bemoan your words  
Bemoan your deeds  
Repent your thoughts of lies  
Attain your sword  
Attain your shield  
Defend the sense of life  
Bemoan your hate  
Repent your greed  
Improve your rotten seed  
  
Pray for the child  
Though born just by a fraud and a whore  
Pray for the child  
Who won't know what it's crying for  
  
Revelation  
Overcome creation  
False illusions  
Fade and die  
Whatever we awaited  
Charity and hatred  
Whatever we awaited  
Will arise  
It's revelation  
Revelation
