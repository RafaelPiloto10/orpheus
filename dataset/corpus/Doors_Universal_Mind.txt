I was doing time  
In the universal mind  
I was feeling fine  
I was turning keys  
I was setting people free  
I was doing all right  
Then you came along  
With a suitcase and a song  
Turned my head around  
Now I'm so alone  
Just looking for a home  
In every place I see  
  
I'm the freedom man  
I'm the freedom man  
I'm the freedom man  
That's how lucky I am
