You were standin' and I was thinkin'  
Of all the time that I spend hangin' around  
Situation could only get better  
I got closer to see what I found  
In the mornin', movin' easy  
Everything seems so right  
But when the night comes, I've been dreamin'  
Dreamin' 'bout leavin' you one more time  
  
Girl, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right  
  
Mmm, no, I won't tell you  
That you're the only one for me  
And I'd be a liar if I promised  
I could give you every single thing you ever need  
  
You gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right  
  
Yeah, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right, mmm  
  
Lookin' back now seems so easy  
You were the best thing ever happened to me  
I can't complain  
It was worth every minute we had  
  
'Cause, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right  
  
Yeah, you gave me good love  
But it ain't quite right
