I've been thinking about you  
And the pain you can't break through  
I can't give you the answers  
But I believe in you  
  
Don't tell me you given up  
No don't tell me your truth  
  
Every vision and dream  
All the lives you've seen  
It's all, it's all inside  
Like the light in the sky  
Shines through your eyes  
It's all, it's all inside  
  
You could wait for an angel  
You could wait for the stars to fall  
All you want is a miracle  
But you don't need it at all
