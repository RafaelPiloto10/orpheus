When I am gone I hope that you'll stay  
Keep me close in memory  
You can move on  
With your promise of new  
I'll be right here waiting for you  
  
Don't forget me my love  
My love  
I won't forget you my love  
My love  
  
To the end of the world  
There and back  
Until the end of time  
No one can stop me  
If they tried  
The darkest days  
The darkest nights  
I won't stop until the  
Day I die  
Until the end of the world  
My love  
To the end of time  
  
Eternity is so beautifully cold  
I wonder if angels ever feel old  
I'm lost in your eyes  
I'm stranded at sea  
You know you're everything to me  
  
Don't forget me my love  
My love  
I won't forget you my love  
My love  
  
To the end of the world  
And back  
Until the end of time  
No one can stop me  
If they tried  
The darkest days  
The darkest nights  
I won't stop until the  
Day I die  
Until the end of the world  
My love  
To the end of...  
  
Don't be afraid when  
Everything fades to gray  
No, don't be afraid  
I need all you're love  
I need all of your pain  
  
Don't forget me my love  
(My love)  
My love  
(My love)  
I won't forget you my love  
My love  
  
To the end of the world  
There and back  
Until the end of time  
No one can stop me  
If they tried  
The darkest days  
The darkest nights  
I won't stop until the  
Day I die  
(Until the day I die)  
Until the end of the world  
My love  
Until the end of time  
(Until the end of world)  
(My love)  
(My love)  
(Till the end of world)  
(My love)  
(My love)
