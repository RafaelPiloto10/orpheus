(Chorus)  
That's what your friends will do  
That's what they will do  
  
They will come with great pretense  
To gain your confidence  
They'll take you round the bend  
And fry you in the end  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
They will look right inna you eyes  
And tell you the wickedest lies  
Make you promises  
But never accomplishes  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
They will dress up inna you clothes  
  
And punch you inna you nose  
Dress up inna you shoes  
And still carry false news  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
They will know that you in jail  
And never try to get you bail  
And know that you in trouble  
And try to make it double  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
They will steal you only goat  
And then them cutting throat  
If you ever robbed  
Woulda come back for you car
