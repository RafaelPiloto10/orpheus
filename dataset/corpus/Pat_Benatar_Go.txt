You say you'll always be there  
But I know you won't  
You say you love me, you swear  
But I know you don't  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go  
  
You say I got it all wrong  
That everything's changed  
But I know where I belong  
It's far, far away  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go  
  
Pick yourself up, get yourself moving  
Don't turn around, just keep on going  
There's nothing you can say  
To change my mind today  
There's only one thing left to do  
I guess you'll have to go  
You say you're a different man  
But you know that's a lie  
The truth is gonna set you  
Free and so am I  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go
