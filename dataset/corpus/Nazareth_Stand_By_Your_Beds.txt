I'm gonna keep it in the family  
Gotta straighten my face  
Want to keep it in the family  
Savin' my disgrace  
Like a tick-a time bomb inside a'me  
Been to the mount, seen the other side  
Money back, number one, guaranteed  
Sole-satisfied  
  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
  
Everybody celebrate, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
Easy access, easy led, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
  
Why 'know its nothin' new I'm telling you  
Its always been around  
Its the home made milkshake  
Apple pies 'n' lemonade  
Never turned down  
  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
  
Everybody celebrate, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
Easy access, easy led, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
  
Everybody celebrate, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
Easy access, easy led, stand by your beds  
By your beds
