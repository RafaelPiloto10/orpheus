Burn away my virtues  
May there be just you in me  
  
Lord write me into your great story  
Lord write me into your great song  
Take all I have  
It's for your glory  
One day all else will be gone  
  
Give me grace to follow  
Only you can lead me home  
  
Lord write me into your great story  
Lord write me into your great song  
Take all I have  
It's for your glory  
One day all else will be gone  
One day all else will be gone  
  
Your name be glorified  
Your name be glorified  
Your name be glorified  
Your name be glorified  
  
Lord write me into your great story  
Lord write me into your great song  
Take all I have  
It's for your glory  
One day all else will be gone  
  
Lord write me into your great story  
Lord write me into your great song  
Take all I have  
It's for your glory  
One day all else will be gone  
One day all else will be gone  
  
Your name be glorified  
Your name be glorified
