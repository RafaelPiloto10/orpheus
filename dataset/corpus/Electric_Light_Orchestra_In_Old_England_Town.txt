Down, down, you can see them all  
Rising gaily to the top  
Keep on rising babe you know you got a long drop  
You better cling cos it's the done thing  
  
Down, down, at the policemans ball  
They're all dancing in a line  
Keep on gruntin boys you know you're doin fine  
Come quickly i've been strangled  
  
Down, down, at the military  
They're all marching round and round  
Keep them boots shined and that still upper lip down  
Ablution revolution  
  
Down, down, at the launching pad  
Giant phallus stands erect  
Ten thousand tons of waste throb then eject  
Look out space, we're gonna change our place  
  
Down, down, in old england town  
There was air and now there's smoke  
Let's build more cars and drive away before we choke  
Suddenly it's always night time  
  
Down, down, at that nice trade fair  
All the money gone astray  
Let's inflate this price and float away  
Just you and me and everyone...
