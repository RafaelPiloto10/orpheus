She calls me up  
And says baby it's a lonely ol' night  
I don't know  
I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time  
Nobody told us  
It was gonna work out this way no no no no no no  
I guess they knew  
We'd work it out in our own way  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a lonely ol' night  
Can I put my arms around you?  
It's a lonely ol nigh  
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you  
  
Radio playin' softly  
Some singer's sad sad song  
He's singing about  
Standing in the shadows of love  
I guess it feels awfully alone  
She says I know exactly what he means  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And it's a sad sad sad sad feeling  
When you're living on those in betweens  
(But it's ok)  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a lonely ol' night  
Can I put my arms around you?  
It's a lonely ol nigh  
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you  
  
She calls me baby  
She calls everybody baby  
It's a lonely ol' night  
But ain't they all?  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a lonely ol' night  
Can I put my arms around you?  
It's a lonely ol nigh  
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you  
  
Girl like me and you  
Yeah like me and you
