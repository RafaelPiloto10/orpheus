You better look out  
You're not living in a bad dream now  
Open your eyes  
You'll survive another day somehow  
  
After the night  
There's a morning and a clear blue sky  
You can be sure  
You can make it and I'll tell you why  
  
You're walking in your sleep  
Hey that's all right  
But don't you spend the whole night  
Uptight  
I'm here to lend a hand  
Hey don't you understand  
  
One chance is for taking  
One heart is for breaking  
One love is for making  
Lovers and friends  
  
One game is for playing  
One prayer is for praying  
One day is for staying  
Lovers and friends  
Lovers and friends  
  
You better wake up  
Cause every day you waste is time gone by  
Up on your feet  
You can take it but you gotta try  
  
After the night  
There's a morning and a clear blue sky  
You can be sure  
You can make it and I'll tell you why  
  
You're walking in your sleep  
Hey that's all right  
But don't you spend the whole night  
Uptight  
I'm here to lend a hand  
Hey don't you understand  
  
One chance is for taking  
One heart is for breaking  
One love is for making  
Lovers and friends  
  
One game is for playing  
One prayer is for praying  
One day is for staying  
Lovers and friends  
(Repeat from 'one chance' to end)
