Been sittin' alone thinkin' bout the past  
Another lonely night, another empty glass  
This path I'm walking always seems to lead nowhere  
I wonder how much you think of me  
How we used to laugh, how we used to be  
It seems like freedom has never had a man so scared  
  
Times might change, love it comes and goes  
How I wish I could have shown you how deep for you my love goes  
And I know this might seem crazy, I would end my life for you  
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you  
Hey I'd do it for you  
  
I wonder how much you think of me  
It hurts to think the past is all that you can see  
Now it seems like freedom is better then the love we shared  
  
Times they change, love it comes and goes  
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes  
And I know this might sound crazy, I would end my life for you  
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you  
Yeah, I'd do it for you  
  
Listen to me  
I wonder how long it takes to see  
There's nothing more I want than you here with me  
Freedom's been knocking, but I refuse to let her in  
  
Times they change, love it comes and goes  
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes  
And I know this might sound crazy, I would end my life for you  
You know I want to come back home and care for you  
And baby I'd do anything for you  
I'd do anything, for you
