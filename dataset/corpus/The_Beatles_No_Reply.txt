This happened once before  
When I came to your door  
No reply  
They said it wasn't you  
But I saw you peep through  
Your window  
I saw the light  
I saw the light  
I know that you saw me  
'Cause I looked up to see  
Your face  
  
I tried to telephone  
They said you were not home  
That's a lie  
'Cause I know where you've been  
And I saw you walk in  
Your door  
I nearly died  
I nearly died  
'Cause you walked hand in hand  
With another man  
In my place  
  
If I were you, I'd realize that I  
Love you more than any other guy  
And I'll forgive the lies that I  
Heard before, when you gave me no reply  
  
I tried to telephone  
They said you were not home  
That's a lie  
'Cause I know where you've been  
And I saw you walk in  
Your door  
I nearly died  
I nearly died  
'Cause you walked hand in hand  
With another man  
In my place  
No reply  
No reply
