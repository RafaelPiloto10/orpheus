You know there isn't anything  
Anything I wouldn't do  
You know there isn't anyone  
Anyone who loves me like you  
Holdin' you close and feelin' your heart beat inside  
It's just like a miracle  
And you're makin' me feel so glad I'm alive  
And in every way I'm gonna thank you  
You know there isn't anything  
Anything I couldn't be  
You know there isn't anyone  
Anyone to keep you from me  
If you're caught in a storm or lost out at sea  
Searchin' for that miracle  
I would soften the wind  
And calm the angry sea  
To bring you home to me  
So if they built up an army  
To take you from me  
Just like a miracle  
I would fly like an eagle  
And carry you so far away in my fantasy  
You know there isn't anything  
Anything I wouldn't do  
Oh no, no, oh  
You know there isn't anything  
Anything I wouldn't do  
Oh no, no, oh
