Now it's ready or not  
Boy, you better come on strong  
Give it all you've got  
'Cause they'll really turn the pressure on  
And you find it strange  
But it's so insane  
  
When you know ya don't believe that  
You're part of their game  
The bell rings and you come out  
Fightin' just the same, yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah  
It's alright, welcome to the world  
It's alright, welcome to the world  
It's alright, welcome to the world  
Yeah  
  
  
In the marketplace  
Nobody's foolin' around  
And ya keep the pace  
Or they tell ya, buddy, please step down  
  
  
There may be a smile  
Or a shake of the hand  
But it's policy to take you  
Anyway they can  
And it's everybody lookin' out  
For number one, understand  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
  
It's alright, welcome to the world
