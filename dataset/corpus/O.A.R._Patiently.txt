Patiently,  
You slipped away from me.  
It's not alright  
You couldn't put up no fight.  
  
But patiently,  
The well ran dry.  
You needed more water,  
You needed more.  
  
But patiently,  
You slipped away from me.  
Oh, God I want you back.  
Oh, God I miss you my friend,  
Oh so patiently  
  
Patiently,  
I went home that night  
And I sat down to write.  
But I couldn't think of anything to write that night.  
  
Patiently, you took it all with you.  
The sun, the moon, the stars  
Are nothin without you.  
But patiently,  
  
You slipped away  
Oh, God we want you back.  
Oh, God we miss you our friend,  
Oh so patiently.  
  
You fell into silence,  
I hate all this silence.  
It leaves me patient.  
And this patience has breeded such violence.  
Oh I hate all this violence.  
Oh, God we miss you our friend,  
But so patiently.  
  
I will never forget it,  
As long as I live,  
The feel that went through the bar,  
You're not there.  
  
Pick up the phone,  
They told me you were gone.  
I wish I wish I was dreaming,  
But I'm wide awake.  
  
When we got to her house,  
Everybody was there.  
Amazes me how you can bring us all together.  
Patience, you leave me here.  
  
How can you expect me to thrive?  
Patiently, oh I wait fot you.  
There's not life unless you're alive.  
This patience, this patience, this patience  
  
Is silence.  
This patience, this silence, oh this silence.  
We love you our friend, wait so patiently.
