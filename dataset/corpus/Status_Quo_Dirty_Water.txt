Oh, oh, oh, oh  
The water's getting deep  
And I can't swim  
Because it's dirty dirty water  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Many's the times I've asked you to say  
Why do you feel so bad day to day  
Could it be you're wrong  
To push yourself along  
I say it's not a guess  
You make yourself a mess  
And get yourself in deeper water  
  
Why do you think it's all wrong for you  
Maybe it's in some things that you do  
Baby it's allright  
To stay out ev'ry night  
If I could change your mind  
I'd bring you back in line  
To do the things you really oughta  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
The water's getting deep  
And I can't swim  
And if I could then I'd come in  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
The water's getting deep  
And I can't swim  
Because it's dirty dirty water  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, why do you think it's all wrong for you  
Maybe it's in some things that you do  
Baby it's allright  
To stay out ev'ry night  
If I could change your mind  
I'd bring you back in line  
To do the things you really oughta  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
The water's getting deep  
And I can't swim  
If I could then I'd come in  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
The water's getting deep  
And I can't swim  
Because it's dirty dirty water  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
The water's getting deep  
And I can't swim  
Because it's dirty dirty water
