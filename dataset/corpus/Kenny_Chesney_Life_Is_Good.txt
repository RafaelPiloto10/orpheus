Darlin' if you think back  
To the heartbroken past  
Before we found each other  
It's so amazing, it's almost crazy  
What a difference lookin' through the eyes of love  
  
Life is good, the grass is green  
The good Lord smilin' on you and me  
Gonna knock on wood  
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look  
You love me like no one could  
Life is good  
  
People stop me on the street, thinkin' I'm the old me  
Talkin' about the bad old days  
But ever since you came along  
Them old blues are long gone  
I break into a grin and all I can say is  
  
Life is good, the grass is green  
The good Lord smilin' on you and me  
Gonna knock on wood  
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look  
You love me like no one could  
Life is good  
  
Someday girl, this old world will try to beat you up  
Let em bring it on, cause every time we touch  
  
Life is good, the grass is green  
The good Lord smilin' on you and me  
Gonna knock on wood  
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look  
You love me like no one could  
Life is good  
  
Life is good, the grass is green  
The good Lord smilin' on you and me  
Gonna knock on wood  
Sweet sunshine everywhere I look  
You love me like no one could  
Life is good  
Life is good
