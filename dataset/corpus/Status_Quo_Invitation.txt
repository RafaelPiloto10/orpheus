I got an invitation from a girl I used to know back home  
It was an invitation asking me to telephone  
She said, it's getting lonely here  
And I've been gone for close a year  
I took the first flight out to meet the girl I used to know back home  
  
She met me off the flight, a million dollars in her long red gown  
With a man in a black hat just to drive us back to town  
Now the faces all look the same  
And all the places have the same old names  
But in a year you've changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
Yes, in a year you've changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
  
Maybe it's true that I go on and on and on  
Maybe it's true that I'm the lonely one alone  
What can I say to you, what can I say to you?  
Yes, in a year you've changed just like the girl I used to know back home  
  
It took another year before I started getting itchy toes  
And then I had to leave, but that's the way the story goes  
Well I reckon if she'd made me stay  
I'd never live to see another day  
I took the first flight out and left the girl I used to know back home  
  
Maybe it's true that I go on and on and on  
Maybe it's true that I'm the lonely one alone  
What can I say to you, what can I say to you?  
I took the first flight out and left the girl I used to know back home  
Back home, I left the girl back home  
I left the girl back home  
I left the girl back home
