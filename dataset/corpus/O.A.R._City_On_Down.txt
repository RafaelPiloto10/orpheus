Well, in the end my friend,  
We will all be together again  
Clutching onto my hand,  
In a valley we'll stand,  
Just living again  
And in a while we'll smile,  
March on another mile  
On hallowed hills, attached to  
The land we'll be still  
  
No one's ever gonna say a thing  
And we'll be together, together again  
Taking off to the city on down  
Just a while ago my soul was confused,  
Amused at what it did not know  
  
Days went by,  
And amusement cried,  
I decide to let  
My soul fly on by itself,  
Pick happiness up and  
Bring it back to the shelf  
We'll be okay one day,  
In a valley we will stay  
  
No more moving on  
I knew it was right here all along  
Won't have to hold your crown,  
No more looking around  
Just holding you tight in the city on down  
Just a while ago my soul was confused,  
Amused at what it did not know  
  
But days went by and amusement cried  
I decide it's time, I got to move on now  
But I was so scared  
I was frightened,  
Somewhat enlightened  
So I changed shoes  
  
Now I walk through a valley of color  
Much better than the other  
Way I did not know,  
But now we can be united  
Miracle, miracle sighted,  
And I'm pulling it in  
I know by now we can all walk together  
At a regular speed  
  
Do you dare to be excited,  
Are you somewhat delighted?  
Are you aware somewhat delighted?  
At what you did not know  
Let's take it to the city on down
