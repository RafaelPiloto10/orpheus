Seldom seen  
A scarecrow's dream  
I hang in the hopes of replacement  
Castles tall  
I built them all  
But I dream that I'm trapped in  
The basement.  
  
And if you ever hear me calling out  
And if you've been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and  
Make-believe  
I can be found.  
  
Plans I've made  
A masquerade  
Fading in fear of the coming day  
Heroes' tales  
Like nightingales  
Wrestle the wind as they run away.  
  
And if you ever hear them calling out  
And if you've been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and make-  
Believe  
I can be found.  
  
Garden gate  
An empty plate  
Waiting for someone to come and fill  
Scarecrow's dreams  
Like frozen streams  
Thirst for the fall  
But they're running still.  
  
And if you ever hear me calling out  
And if you've been by paupers crowned  
Between the worlds of men and  
Make-believe  
I can be found.
