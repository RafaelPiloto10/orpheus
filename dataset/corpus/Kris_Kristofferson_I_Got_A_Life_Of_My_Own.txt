I said I got a life of my own  
I've got a life of my own  
  
I said, don't try to make me a part of no plan  
Take me or leave me alone  
Freedom's a feeling that few understand  
And i got a life of my own  
I said i ought to know where to sow my own seeds  
And when i oughta leave it alone  
Trouble's an old friend that i didn't need then  
And i had a wife of my own.  
  
I said I got a life of my own  
I've got a life of my own  
  
I caught a beer bottle flat in the face  
It laid me back to the bone  
Hate is a flavor that's ugly to taste  
I had a knife of my own  
  
Now they leave me alone and alive by myself  
Lost in the steel and the stone  
Hopin' for heaven and headin' for hell  
I've got a life of my own  
  
I said I got a life of my own  
I've got a life of my own
