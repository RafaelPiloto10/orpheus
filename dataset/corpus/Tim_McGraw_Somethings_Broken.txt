Think something's broken then again nothin's smokin'  
Or shakin' or chokin' like my ol' truck  
But I think something's broken  
And I think it's worth notin'  
It started about the time  
She got all packed up  
  
Could be my ego, could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin' eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasn't jokin'  
  
Think something's broken  
'Cause I'm just layin' round hopin'  
That maybe any moment  
I'll get on track  
But I think something's broken  
All locked up or frozen cause I can't go forward  
And I sure can't go back  
  
Could be my ego, could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin' eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasn't jokin'  
  
Think it's my heart  
Comin' eye to eye  
With the truth  
She wasn't jokin'  
  
I know something's broken  
I Just started smokin'  
And shakin'and chokin'  
Like my old truck
