Mama went to sleep one night and never woke up  
Daddy cried a tear into her old coffee cup  
Now all he wants to do is drink the hurt all the way  
But if mama was here I know what mama would say  
  
Carry on  
Carry on  
What don't kill us makes us strong  
Carry on  
  
Little sister's husband ran off with her best friend  
Left her and the babies all alone again  
It hurts to know the hurt that she's goin' through  
But I know that she'll do what she's gotta do  
  
Carry on  
Carry on  
What don't kill us makes us strong  
Carry on  
  
Nobody ever said that life was gonna be fair  
You're never gonna get no where by runnin' scared  
If you look down deep inside you'll find the faith  
To make you strong oh carry on  
  
I tried to walk the sunny side of the street  
Don't let no shadows tangle up my feet  
There ain't no troubles that we can't rise above  
With a hand full of faith and a heart full of love  
  
Carry on  
Carry on  
What don't kill us makes us strong  
Carry on  
Carry on  
What don't kill us makes us strong  
Carry on  
Carry on  
Carry on  
Carry on
