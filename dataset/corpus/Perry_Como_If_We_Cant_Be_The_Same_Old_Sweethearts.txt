We'll just be the same old friends  
If we can't be the same old sweethearts  
Then we'll just be the same old friends  
For I want someone like you just to tell my troubles to  
My happiness on you, it all depends  
  
For I've known you too long to forget you  
And my old dream of love never ends  
Though I know you can't be mine  
We will meet from time to time  
And we'll just be the same old friends  
  
For I've known you too long to forget you  
And my old dream of love never ends  
Though I know you can't be mine  
We will meet from time to time  
And we'll just be the same old friends
