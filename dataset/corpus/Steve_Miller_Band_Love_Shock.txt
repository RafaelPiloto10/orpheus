Meet me at the station about a quarter past five  
That's about the time that I come alive, yeah  
Don't make sense if it ain't the real thing why'all  
Nothing but the real thing makes my bell ring  
  
Love me baby, won't you love me please  
You got me down here on my knees, yeah  
I'm so glad that I'm still alive  
Come on baby, won't you make me feel good now  
  
Come on baby now don't be too slow  
Now I'm in a hurry, you know I got to go  
Don't make sense if you don't know how to move  
I'm a natural born lover, I was born in a groove, yeah  
Oooh  
  
It's Jumpin' Jack Flash on the drums
