That Novenber night, looking up into the sky.  
You said "Hey wish that was me up there  
It's the biggest rocket I could find  
And it's holding the night in its arms  
If for only a moment.  
I can't see the look in its eyes  
But I'm sure it must be laughing."  
But it seemed to me the saddest thing I'd ever seen  
And I thought you were crazy wishing such a thing.  
  
I saw only a stick on fire  
Alone on its journey  
Home to the quickening ground  
With no one there to catch it.  
  
I put on my pointed hat  
And my black and silver suit  
And I check my gunpowder pack  
And I strap the stick on my back  
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge  
Nobody seemed to see me  
Then with the fuse in my hand  
And now shooting into the night  
And still as a rocket  
I land in the river.  
  
Was it me said you were crazy?  
I put on my cloudiest suit  
Size 5 lightening boots too  
'Coz I am a rocket  
On fire  
Look at me go with my tail on fire  
With my tail on fire  
On fire  
Hey, look at me go, look at me
