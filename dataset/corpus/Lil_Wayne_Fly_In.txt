So they ask me  
Young boy  
What you gonna do the second time around  
How you goin' come back  
I tried told them  
I come back like thirty two  
I jump back like thirty three (ugh)  
  
Hit me!  
That's nothin'  
This is Tha Carter Two people  
This is Tha Carter Two people (hey)  
  
They call me Mr. Carter I kissed the daughter  
Of the deads forehead I killed the father  
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater  
I will put them body on chill like glaciers  
Gracias I'm crazy yes it's obvious  
Going against me is atheist  
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust  
I ain't sniffin' I'm just pitchin' ya honor I ain't snitchin' ya honor  
Hate bitch niggas bitches with power  
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter  
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard  
Put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles  
I remember being young tryin' to hustle my dough  
Tryin' to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap  
Tryin' to tell you fool you chump that my mack ain't broke  
You ain't tryin' to see how far that black back lane go  
No, call me Pacman you ghosts is blue  
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue  
Jewelry, usually I'm a hooligan for the money  
Yeah I'm eatin' but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh  
Make harm in the bomb you in public  
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothin'  
Look it's mornin' no yawnin' or nothin'  
I ain't sleepin' I'm up tryin' to take a nigga lunch  
You gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts  
Then shake a nigga shorts and we takin' what we want  
I'm so 5-0-4 you got to kill me here  
If you ever lookin' for me bitch I will be here  
Cash Money is an army Navy Seal me here  
Lot of niggas ran from it but I'll still be here  
No chrome on the continental I'm so fundamental  
Crack the phill' crack the roof and roll up the window  
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home  
That's why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song  
You leapin' at a dog a dog wit no bark  
Just a bite like an old shark  
And all you bitch niggas no paw  
I'm talkin' bout stunna  
He like keep ya door he got ya whole winters  
Sunshine's on the king and sets on the prince  
I met the Birdman and I been shinin' ever since like that (that, that, that)
