There was a time when hunger was mine,you'd walk the line.  
You sowed the seed, your making us need,your watching us bleed,you bastard!  
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,  
You helped me keep the wolves from the door,  
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!  
We always felt you were a better friend,with your iches and your smiles,  
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,  
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!  
Parasite!  
Parasite!  
Life was a ball and you took it all,  
We took a fall,  
You were the doubt  
You won't bail us out,there's no use to shout,Your dying!  
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,  
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,  
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!  
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,  
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,  
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!  
Parasite!  
A toffee for the kiddies,sugar and spice,  
Just wait a minute fella,your anything but nice!  
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,  
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,  
You filled our heads so full of,Lies,  
[Repeat]  
Parasite!  
Parasite!  
Parasite!  
Parasite!
