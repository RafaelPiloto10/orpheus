Life we talk of death  
Each breath come closer to out.  
Of this I'm not afraid  
Though I don't know what it's all about  
  
I don't know!  
I don't know!  
  
Decisions that we make,  
The chances that we take,  
Blindness we can't fake.  
Thought I knew but now I know what it's like,  
  
To be alone!  
I know!  
  
I remember here!  
Thought it was a dream!  
I never thought I'd come to this.  
Living with the fear,  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought it'd end like this!  
  
Falling with no end  
Into what I've only done to me.  
With messages to send,  
Out of what I've only done to me.  
  
Falling with no  
Calling with no  
Crawling to the end.  
  
I remember here!  
Thought it was a dream!  
I never thought I'd come to this.  
I remember here!  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought it'd end like this!  
  
Falling with no end  
Into what I've only done to me.  
With messages to send,  
Out of what I've only done to me.  
  
I remember here!  
Thought it was a dream!  
I never thought I'd come to this.  
Living with the fear,  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought it'd end like this!  
  
Falling with no  
Calling with no  
Crawling to the end.  
  
Falling with no  
Calling with no  
Crawling to the end.  
  
I remember here!  
Thought it was a dream!  
I never thought I'd come to this.  
Living with the fear,  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought it'd end like this!  
  
I remember here!  
Thought it was a dream!  
I never thought I'd come to this.  
Living with the fear,  
Now I know what it means  
I never thought it'd end like this!  
  
I remember here!
