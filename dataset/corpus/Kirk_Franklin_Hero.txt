The heavens were silent  
The earth weeped in pain  
Nations were trembling and hope never came  
A Terror filled the air  
And it wouldn't go away  
We needed a hero to come and save  
  
Famine and hunger,  
Disease in the land  
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand  
Creation waits through the darkness we pray  
Tell me where is the hero to come and save  
  
Through the nails  
Through the thorns  
From the hill to the grave  
Was a voice in the distance the lamb that was slain  
My soul had no song and my debt I couldn't pay  
When I needed a hero you came and you saved  
  
To the homeless  
The widow  
The fatherless son  
To the sick and the broken alone with no one  
Lift up you head your hope is on the way  
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day  
  
When the curtain had closed  
And it felt like the end  
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin  
Even though men deny  
You're the only sacrifice  
That loved us enough you loved us so much Lord  
That you gave your life see you saved my life  
  
Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed  
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged  
Every wrong is erased, Jesus  
You are my hero you came and you saved the day  
  
When the curtain had closed  
And it felt like the end  
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin  
Even though men deny  
You're the only sacrifice  
That loved us enough you love us so much Lord  
That you gave your life see you saved my life  
  
Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed  
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged  
Every wrong is erased, Jesus  
You are my hero you came and you saved  
You are my hero you came and you saved  
You are my hero you came and saved the day  
  
You saved you saved the day  
You saved you saved the day  
  
You are my hero you came and you saved the day
