Tonight it's on  
Play my song  
It's a celebration  
I worked a long week  
And now there is no hesitation  
I need a drink or two  
Make that a few  
I ain't waiting  
Yes, yes I'm gone  
And you know I got no time for wasting  
  
Gonna forget my troubles  
'Cause it's a special night  
Not going to stress on nothing  
I'm feeling quite alright  
If it's your birthday baby  
I'm going to grant your wish  
This is a private party  
VIP in this bitch  
  
I'm a prima donna  
I can rule the world  
Don't care who's around me  
I can fool the world  
So hand's up  
Catch this feeling  
There's no stopping this  
Right now in this moment  
I can rule the world  
  
So ladies,  
Pop, pop, pop  
Throw it up  
Make it  
Pop, pop, pop  
Turn it up, speakers  
Pop, pop, pop  
'Til I'm drunk, bottles  
Pop, pop, pop  
(Take it back to the verse right now)  
  
A little fun  
Never killed, never hurt nobody  
So grab a glass, and raise it up  
Baby work your body  
Ain't nothing wrong, just go on  
If you're feeling naughty  
Yes, yes I'm grown  
And I don't need a judgment on me  
  
Gonna forget my troubles  
'Cause it's a special night  
Not going to stress on nothing  
I'm feeling quite alright  
If it's your birthday baby  
I'm going to grant your wish  
This is a private party  
VIP in this bitch  
  
I'm a prima donna  
I can rule the world  
Don't care who's around me  
I can fool the world  
So hand's up  
Catch this feeling  
There's no stopping this  
Right now in this moment  
I can rule the world  
  
So ladies,  
Pop, pop, pop  
Throw it up  
Make it  
Pop, pop, pop  
Turn it up, speakers  
Pop, pop, pop  
'Til I'm drunk, bottles  
Pop, pop, pop  
  
Whoa  
I'm a prima donna, I'm a  
A Prima donna, I  
I'm a prima donna, I'm  
I'm a Prima donna, I  
I'm a prima donna, I'm a  
Prima donna, I'm
