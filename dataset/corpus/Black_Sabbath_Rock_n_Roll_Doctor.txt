Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and it's hang ups  
Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He's gonna blow me away  
  
He makes me happy when I'm feeling down  
Take away my worry takes away my frown  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
  
If you wanna feel groovy, give the doctor a call, yeah  
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
Oh, right away
