Blackout in London  
Just slippin' slide  
Blackout in London  
I'm just about to lose my mind  
  
Big time in Paris  
Time's gonna fly  
Big time in Paris  
It's c'est la vie for me tonight  
  
Here I go  
To take the one and only road I know  
In my life  
Here I go  
Another place to bare my heart and soul  
Restless nights  
  
Hot shot in Dallas  
A wild horse to ride  
Hot shot in Dallas  
I don't know how but I survived  
  
Rock hard in Rio  
Pure sex and crime  
Rock hard in Rio  
It's just too much to take tonight  
  
Here I go  
To take the one and only road I know  
In my life  
Here I go  
Another place to bare my heart and soul  
Restless nights  
  
Restless nights  
Restless nights  
  
Red hot in Moscow  
Turn back the tide  
Red hot in Moscow  
The eagle rocks the bear tonight  
  
Die hard in Tokyo  
Lexington nights  
Die hard in Tokyo  
I barely made it out alive  
  
Here I go  
To take the one and only road I know  
In my life  
Here I go  
  
Another place to bare my heart and soul  
Restless nights
