That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track  
Means your true lovin' Daddy ain't commin' back  
Because I'm Movin' On  
I'll soon be gone  
You where flying too high for my little old sky  
So I'm Movin' On  
  
That big loud whistle as it blew and blew  
Said hello to the Southland we're commin' to you  
When we're Movin' On  
O' here my song  
You had to laugh at me so I've set you free  
And I'm Movin' On  
  
Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me  
Cause I got a pretty Momma in Tennessee  
Keep movin' me on  
Keep rollin' on  
So shovel the coal let this rattle a rollin'  
Keep movin' me on  
  
Mr. Engineer, take that throttle in hand  
This rattle is the fastest in the Southern land  
Keep movin' me on  
Keep rollin' on  
Your gonna ease my mind put me there on time  
And keep rollin' on  
  
I've told you baby from time to time  
But you just wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind  
Now I'm Movin' On  
I'm rollin' on  
You broken your vow and it's all over now  
So I'm Movin' On  
  
You switched your engine  
Now I ain't got time for a trifling woman on my main line  
Because I'm Movin' On  
You done your Daddy wrong  
I warned you twice now you can settle the price  
Because I'm Movin' On  
  
But someday Baby when you've had your play  
Your gonna want your Daddy but your Daddy will say  
Keep movin' on  
You stayed away too long  
I'm through with you too bad your blue  
Keep movin' on
