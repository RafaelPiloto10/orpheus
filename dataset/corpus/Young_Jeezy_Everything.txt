[Boosie]  
Put that on momma my daddy everything I love  
For everything I rap

Nigga whole click, Iphones  
Nigga, get your shine on  
Used to whip it up now zip it up  
Now it's the microphone  
No man alive can't stop my shine, its the hustle man  
I want it bad cause Bad Ass came from nothing man  
Shining on em' grinding on em' bout what I'm talking bout  
If I show your bitch my house, she gone take my dick and floss  
Show after show I'm getting dough

I'm M J round my way and Louisiana is mine! (Nigga)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Don't you before I ma man about his business  
Draw a line right where the family is  
Never cross it, be the boss it  
Love it down till I've have exhausted it  
Other dudes they pursue with their clown seeing  
I knelled down on the real and I pray with you  
And never want for much I make due for us  
Believe me I stand on my word  
  
Yeah whats happening oh OK  
I put that on everything  
One thing about it know  
That makes me better  
Your nigga ain't seeing me  
Whats up

Put that on everything, everything  
  
[Repeats]  
Put it all the line
