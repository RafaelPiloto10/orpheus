[Verse:]  
  
Yesterday has gone  
A new have come  
We're living for your name  
Everything we have  
And everything we are  
Will glorify your name  
  
(Refrain)  
  
Cause we are devoted to you  
We are devoted to make a change  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Let your love abide in us  
And let it shine for all the world to see  
God we will live for you  
And we will stand for truth  
We are devoted to you  
Devoted to you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
Yesterday has gone  
A new have come  
We're living for your name

We are devoted to you  
We are devoted to you
