My sweeet lady Jane  
When I see you again  
Your servant am I  
And will humbly remain  
Just heed this plea, my love  
On bended knee my love  
I pledge myself to lady Jane  
  
My dear lady Anne  
I've done what I can  
I must take my leave  
For promised am I  
The play is run, my love  
Your time has come, my love  
I pledge my soul to lady Jane  
  
Oh, my sweet Marie  
I wait at your cue  
The sands have run out  
For your lady and me  
When love is high, my love  
Wedlock is nigh, my love  
Life is secure with lady Jane
