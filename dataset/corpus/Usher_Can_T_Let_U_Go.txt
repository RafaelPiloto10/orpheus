Yo, shit  
I'm sick of this man  
I can't even take no more  
'Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much  
  
And you know what I'm sayin'  
You don't even understand what this is doin' to me  
Everytime I try to get away  
  
I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin'  
I just can't let you go  
I never ever want to hurt you  
I just wanna to love ya  
I just wanna to sex ya up  
  
Want to give you everything you need  
Things you want, just lay down  
Let me love ya all night long  
I don't wanna to leave ya, I just wanna to keep ya  
  
When they saw me, they saw you  
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl  
That's how I felt, every time I thought it was right  
It went left  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time and time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go  
  
(This ain't funny man, you know what man  
You ain't even got to wait till in the mornin' man  
You can get out of here at night man  
Ah-yo clear, go rap, go shit, get out of here )  
  
Baby you not gonna like me  
But you not gonna fight me  
You can walk away and say  
I never gave you everything you want, thing you need  
  
All we ever do is argue all night long  
I don't want to leave you, see you  
With another brother lovin ya sayin'  
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl  
  
That's how I feel  
When you think everything is real  
But it really ain't  
We used to love and party  
  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
So much love and hurt  
  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time to time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go  
We used to love and party  
  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
So much love and hurt  
  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time to time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go  
  
[JD]  
Got me walkin' around ready to snap  
Got me walkin' around lookin for somebody to slap  
Got me goin', goin', with no pause (?)  
Got me up in Cartier every day just cause  
Got me arguin' about little stuff  
  
She don't call lil' stuff  
When it get a little rough,  
We me kiss and make up  
She want to say what she want to, I don't play that  
She want to constantly bring up shit from way back  
  
Got me thinkin' about her while I'm watchin' a flick  
Got me dippin through traffic tryin' to get home quick  
Got me talkin' to myself "I'm hatin' this"  
Got me wantin' to wild out like I'm Jadakiss  
Got me in a place I never thought I would see  
Got me not wantin' to stay, and not wantin' to leave  
Got me happy  
Got me confused  
Got me wishin' I could get it how I used to  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time to time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I don't want you no more  
But I can't let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate, people screaming it won't work  
Time to time I say I'm gonna leave  
But I can't let you go
