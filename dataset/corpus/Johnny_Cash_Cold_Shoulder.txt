Well, it's plain to see you're givin' me a cold shoulder  
You put a chill on every thrill with a cold shoulder  
All the time I wait around to get a little squeeze  
But nothin' ever happens 'cause she just stand there and freeze  
  
It ain't polite to waste moonlight on a cold shoulder  
It isn't smart to give my heart a cold shoulder  
I need your love to warm me through and through  
But I always get a cold shoulder from you  
  
All the time I wait around to get a little squeeze  
But nothing ever happens 'cause she just stand there and freeze  
  
It ain't polite to waste moonlight on a cold shoulder  
It isn't smart to give my heart a cold shoulder  
I need your love to warm me through and through  
But I always get a cold shoulder from you
