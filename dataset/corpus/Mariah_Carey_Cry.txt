Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry  
Maybe I didn't leave much  
Between us, That day  
And maybe I shouldn't have told you  
I loved you, Played the game  
And now I understand  
Wish I could have you back  
And kiss you so and feel your hands on me  
Till we both break down  
Till we both break down  
Till we both break down  
And cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
And maybe I didn't give you Your space back then  
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer  
But I was seduced by you  
And I didn't know enough truly to enchanted to disregard the words you said  
To make me yours  
Need to hold you til we both  
Till we both break down  
(Break down)  
Till we both breakdown  
(I should have known you were tired of me)  
Till we both break down  
Till we both break down and cry  
  
Oh my love  
Imprudently I left every cell in me  
So naked  
Somewhere at the core of you  
Blasts us off  
I just need you to win boy  
Till we both breakdown  
I'm just saying  
Till we both break down  
Might as well tell the truth about the battle  
Till we both break down  
Yes I, guess it's selfish of me to just expect I'm entitled to heaven  
Till we both break down  
But tonight, all I wanna do is hold you tight  
Till we both break down  
And cry, cry, cry, cry  
Till we both break down  
And cry  
Till we both break down  
And cry
