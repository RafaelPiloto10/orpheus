I'm only half a man  
When I'm not by your side  
I try to make a plan  
And I don't try to hide  
So come on over closer to me  
And everything will be just like it should be  
Why don't you help me  
Please don't stand on your pride  
I feel so empty  
Why don't you let me inside  
So come on over closer to me  
And everything will be just like it should be  
You (you, you, you)  
Set my soul on fire  
You (you, you, you)  
Fill me with desire  
When ever I'm near you  
I'm only half a man  
When I'm not by your side  
I try to make a plan  
And I don't try to hide  
So come on over closer to me  
And everything will be just like it should be
