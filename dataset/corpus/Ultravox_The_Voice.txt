Native these words seem to me  
All speech directed to me  
I've heard them once before  
I know that feeling  
Stranger emotions in mind  
Changing the contours I find  
I've seen them once before  
Someone cries to me  
Chorus:  
O O O O  
The look and the sound of the voice  
O O O O  
They try, they try  
O O O O  
The shape and the power of the voice  
O O O O  
In strong low tones  
Forceful and twisting again  
Wasting the perfect remains  
I've felt it once before  
Slipping over me  
(Chorus)  
Sweetly the voices decay  
Draw on the lines that they say  
I'd lost it once before  
Now it cries to me  
(Chorus)
