I don't want to be, what you want me to be  
So when I call, you just yelling at me  
I'm sorry its my fault, its over  
  
[chorus: x2]  
Now what do you keep calling there for  
Its over, its over  
  
(its over)  
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling  
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled  
I don't wanna be what you want me to be  
So when I call you're just yelling at me  
(I'm sorry it's my fault)  
Oh and the clothes I brought you can still wear  
Did you store the cards and teddy bears  
See there I go again sticking my nose  
(I'm sorry it's my fault)  
  
[chorus: x2]  
  
(It's over)  
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough  
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful  
You know we used to talk about our future  
(It ain't just all my fault)(I know, I know we used to talk about it babe)  
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall  
The way we stand in the rain and we would ball (we would cry)  
Just say goodbye to the walks and talks and the dogs in the park  
(And it ain't just all my fault)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Kayne West]  
(It's over)  
We lost a four leaf clover  
Don't ask my shorty be over  
News flash shorty we over  
We like def jam and Hova  
We like Bobby and Whitney  
Except without the kiddies  
Just like Pamela Anderson's career  
Except without the tittes  
We had some good times didn't we  
I know I won't forget that  
But we had some bad times and  
That's time I wish I could get back  
But I love you I can't let go  
Now I just I just don't know  
You been around me long enough  
To know that now it's over.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(It's over) it's nothing we can do with it  
So you might as well forget it (it's over)  
Like we never ever did it (it's over) [Repeat: x4]
