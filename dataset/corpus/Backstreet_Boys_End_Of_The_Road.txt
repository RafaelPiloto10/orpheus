(Spoken:)  
Girl you know  
We belong together  
I have no time for  
You to be playing  
With my heart like this  
You'll be mine forever  
Baby, you just see  
  
We belong together  
And you that I'm right  
Why do you play  
With my heart,  
Why do you play  
With my mind?  
  
Said we'd be forever  
Said it'd never die  
How could you love me  
And leave me  
And never say goodbye?  
  
When I can't sleep at night  
Without holding you tight  
Girl, each time I try  
I just break down and cry  
Pain in my head oh  
I'd rather be dead  
Spinnin' around and around  
  
CHORUS:  
Although we've come to  
The end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  
Come to the  
End of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  
  
Girl, I know you  
Really love me,  
You just don't realise  
You've never  
Been there before  
It's only your first time  
  
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm  
Maybe you'll try  
We should be  
Happy together  
Forever, you and I  
  
Can you love me again  
Like you loved me before  
This time I want you  
To love me much more  
This time instead  
Just come to my bed  
And baby just  
Don't let me  
Don't let me down  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
(Spoken:)  
Girl I'm here for you  
All those times of night  
When you just hurt me  
And just run out  
With that other fella  
Baby I knew about it  
I just didn't care  
You just don't understand  
How much I love you do you?  
I'm here for you  
  
I'm not out to go out and  
Cheat on you all night  
Just like you did baby  
But that's all right  
Hey, I love you anyway  
And I'm still gonna  
Be here for you  
Till my dying day baby  
Right now, I'm just in  
So much pain baby  
'Cause you just won't  
Come back to me  
Will you?  
Just come back to me  
  
(Lonely)  
Yes baby my  
Heart is lonely  
(Lonely)  
My heart hurts baby  
(Lonely)  
Yes I feel pain too  
Baby please  
  
This time instead  
Just come to my bed  
And baby just  
Don't let me go  
  
Repeat chorus twice
