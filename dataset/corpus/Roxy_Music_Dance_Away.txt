Yesterday, well it seemed so cool  
When I walked you home, kissed goodnight  
I said "it's love" you said "all right"  
It's funny how I could never cry  
Until tonight and you pass by  
Hand in hand with another guy  
You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying?  
Dance away the heartache  
Dance away the tears  
Dance away  
  
Loneliness is a crowded room  
Full of open hearts turned to stone  
All together all alone  
All at once my whole world had changed  
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall  
Let the strobe light up them all  
I close my eyes and dance till dawn  
Dance away  
  
Now I know I must walk the line  
Until I find an open door  
There was I, many times a fool  
I hope and pray, but not too much  
Out of reach is out of touch  
All the way is far enough  
Dance away
