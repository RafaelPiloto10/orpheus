If I fell in love you,  
Would you understand me dear,  
Love is weird.  
I coloured you a valentine,  
Struggled just to stay inside the lines,  
I loose my mind.  
  
I really can't believe  
I lost myself again  
  
Looking for something crazy  
Beautiful nothing  
Now I'm talking in circles again  
Never no baby are you hungry  
Oh wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful cause I am  
  
I wrote a song about your eyes,  
Ate a slice of cherry pie,  
I cried all night.  
On a bench inside the park,  
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark,  
I'll never stop.  
  
I really can't believe  
I lost myself again  
  
Looking for something crazy  
Beautiful nothing  
Now I'm talking in circles again  
Never no baby are you hungry  
Oh wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful cause I am  
  
Baby take me for a ride  
Baby get a little high  
In a place we've never been  
Time is nothing but a line  
We leave everything behind  
It be so wonderful  
Wonderful  
  
Looking for something crazy  
Beautiful nothing  
Now I'm talking in circles again  
Never no baby are you hungry  
Oh wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful cause I am  
Wonderful I am  
You know wonderful I am  
Wonderful I am  
Wonderful I'm
