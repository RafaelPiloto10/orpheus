One day as I was walking  
Through an airport corridor  
I saw a comely goth girl  
With tattoos on her form  
She gazed up with her pretty white face  
And shone her eyes on me  
She shined my shoes and then I knew  
That I would spellbound be  
  
Her hair was not the shiniest  
Her skin was not like silk  
But she had a way of looking  
That made me want to milk  
As I sat high above her  
Her cleavage I could see  
I contemplated both of them  
That's how she spellbound me  
  
She wore black on her clothing  
And she wore black on her boots  
Lt was Lollapalooza day  
But she didn't like he groups  
I got lost in her pale skin  
And wanted to stay down  
But I had someone waiting  
So I left spellbound  
  
So if you're dark and lovely  
And you see me passing by  
A smile I'd appreciate  
And a little bit of crime  
I haven' got a dollar  
And I haven't got a crown  
I wander lost across this earth  
I'm just spellbound
