Kid what changed your mood  
You've gone all sad so I feel sad too  
I think I know some things we never outgrow  
You think it's wrong  
I can tell you do  
How can I explain  
When you don't want me to  
  
Kid my only kid  
You look so small you've gone so quiet  
I know you know what I'm about  
I won't deny it  
But you forgive though you don't understand  
You've turned your head  
You've dropped by hand  
  
All my sorrow, all my blues  
All my sorrow  
  
Shut the light, go away  
Full of grace, you cover your face  
  
Kid gracious kid  
Your eyes are blue but you won't cry  
I know angry tears are too dear  
You won't let them go
