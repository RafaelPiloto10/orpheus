The rooms were so much colder then  
My father was a soldier then  
The times were very hard  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
I smoked my first cigarette at ten  
And for boys I had a bad yen  
I had quite a ball  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
When I was young it was more important  
Pain more painful, the laughter much louder, yeah  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
I met my first love at thirteen  
He was brown, and I was pretty green  
I learned quite a lot  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
When I was young it was more important  
Pain more painful, the laughter much louder, yeah  
When I was young  
  
My faith was so much stronger then  
I believed in fellow men  
I was so much older then  
When I was young  
When I was young  
When I was young
