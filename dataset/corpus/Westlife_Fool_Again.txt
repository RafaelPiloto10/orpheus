Baby, I know the story,  
I've seen the picture,  
It's written all over your face  
Tell me, what's the secret that you've been hiding?  
And who's gonna take my place?  
I should have seen it coming,  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway, I guess it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't believe that I'm a fool again  
I thought this love would never end,  
How was I to know?  
You never told me  
Can't believe that I'm a fool again,  
And I who thought you were my friend,  
How was I to know?  
You never told me  
  
Baby, you should've called me,  
When you were lonely,  
When you needed me to be there  
Sadly, you never gave me  
Too many chances to show you  
How much I care  
Ooh, should have seen it coming,  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway, I guess it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
About the pain and the tears  
Ooh, If I could,  
I would, turn back the time  
Ooh yeah I should have seen it coming  
I should have read the signs  
Anyway, I guess it's over  
  
[Chorus]
