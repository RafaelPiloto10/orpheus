Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam  
Sunbeams are never made like me  
  
Don't expect me to cry,  
For all the reasons you had to die  
Don't ever ask your love of me  
  
Don't expect me to cry  
Don't expect me to lie  
Don't expect me to die for me  
  
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam  
Sunbeams are never made like me  
  
Don't expect me to cry,  
For all the reasons you had to die  
Don't ever ask your love of me  
  
Don't expect me to cry  
Don't expect me to lie  
Don't expect me to die for me  
  
Don't expect me to cry  
Don't expect me to lie  
Don't expect me to die for me  
  
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam  
Sunbeams are never made like me  
Don't expect me to cry,  
For all the reasons you had to die  
Don't ever ask your love of me  
  
Don't expect me to cry  
Don't expect me to lie  
Don't expect me to die  
Don't expect me to cry  
Don't expect me to lie  
Don't expect me to die for me
