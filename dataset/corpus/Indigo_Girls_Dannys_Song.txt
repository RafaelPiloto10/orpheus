People smile and tell me Im a lucky one  
Weve just begun  
I think Im gonna have a son  
And he will be like he and me as free as a dove  
Conceived in love  
The sun is gonna shine above  
  
Even though we aint got money  
Well Im so in love with you honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise  
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be all right  
  
Love a boy who holds the world in a paper cup  
Drink it up  
Love him and hell bring you luck  
And if you find he helps your mind  
Sister take him home  
Dont you live alone  
Try to earn what lovers own  
  
Even though we aint got money  
Well Im so in love with you honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise  
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be all right  
  
And even though we aint got money  
Well Im so in love with you honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise  
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be all right
