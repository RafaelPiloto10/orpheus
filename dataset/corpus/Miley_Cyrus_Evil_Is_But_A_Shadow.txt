[Verse 1]  
Evil is but a shadow  
That always accompanies the good  
You can try to have a world  
A world without the shadow  
But it'll be a dark, dark and cold place world  
Cause it would be a world, a world without light too  
Oh, ohh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
The lights of nature  
The light of the true  
The light of silence  
The light of all I do  
The brigter it shines from the mountain  
The more evil hides in its hole  
Enjoy soo hard to defeat us  
A world starting to lose your control  
Oh, ohh, oh  
Trol, lose your control  
Trol, lose your control  
Trol, lose your control  
Trol, lose your control  
  
[Bridge]  
We won't stop  
We'll let it go, it drop  
How'd it get to be so obvious?  
I'll have fun  
We won't stop  
We'll let it fucking drop  
We won't stop, oh  
I'll have fun  
  
[Outro]  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world  
Evil is but a shadow  
A shadow in this world
