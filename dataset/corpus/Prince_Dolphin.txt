How beautiful do the words have to be  
Before they conquer every heart?  
How will you know if I'm even in the right key  
If you make me stop before I start?  
  
[Chorus]  
If I came back as a dolphin  
Would you listen to me then?  
Would you let me be your friend?  
Would you let me in?  
You can cut off all my fins  
But to your ways I will not bend  
I'll die before I let you tell me how to swim  
And I'll come back again as a dolphin  
  
Why does my brother have to go hungry  
When you told him there was food for all?  
This is the man that stands next to the man  
That stands to catch you when you fall (Oh!)  
  
If I'm under water, will you find me? (Find me)  
Will you shine a light and try to guide me?  
It's happened before, I've knocked on your door  
But you wouldn't let me in  
  
How beautiful do the words have to be  
Before they conquer every heart? (Oh!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(I'll come back, baby)  
(Let me in, let me in) As a dolphin  
(Be my friend) Dolphin  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
Dolphin  
As a dolphin  
As a dolphin  
As a dolphin
