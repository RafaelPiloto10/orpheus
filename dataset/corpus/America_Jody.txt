Just to think I had her in my hands  
To think we made our plans  
Somehow it feels just like a dream  
  
For I played it so darn cool  
Is there a bigger fool  
To say I wanted to be free  
Cause now I know just what she meant to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Jody, even the wind says your name, girl  
When I think of you I'm aflame, girl, every time  
Jody, girl I've tried but I can't forget  
The years when we lived together  
I thought it would be forever  
Jody, I'm begging now  
  
Look around but there's no way out  
What's it all about  
And how that name goes round my head  
I still see her face as she laid upon this bed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just say the word, I'll run to you  
I'll be the man you want me to  
How I'd miss you I never knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even the wind says your name girl  
When I think of you I'm aflame, girl  
Jody, even the wind says your name, girl  
When I think of you I'm aflame, girl
