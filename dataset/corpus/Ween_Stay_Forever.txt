In the morning sun, I couldn't tell you  
I couldn't tell you so many things  
About how much I really love you  
About how much you really mean  
So far away but it's so easy to see you  
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you  
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?  
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?  
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
With you  
  
So many colors that surround you  
Some so bright I can hardly see  
A light reflects on all the things that make you real  
Things that make you truly free  
  
So far away but it's so easy to see you  
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you  
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?  
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
And I want to know, do you feel the same way?  
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
With you
