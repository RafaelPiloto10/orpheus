Oh, if someone writes a song  
With a simple rhyme  
Just a song  
Where his feelings show  
And if someone feels the same  
About this simple song  
Oh, and sometimes, you can hear them say  
Music gives you happiness or sadness  
But it also, it also heals your soul  
  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music take control  
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain  
  
Oh, if someone plays piano  
With some simple chords  
Symbolic and endearing too  
And know if someone plays guitar  
With the old piano  
Then maybe you can hear them sing  
Music gives you happiness or sadness  
But it also  
Also heals your soul  
  
Oh yes  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music take control  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music heal your soul  
Let the music take control..
