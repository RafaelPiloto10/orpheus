You keep your pretty girls  
Chained inside the dungeon  
And diamonds and pearls  
You keep them a'coming  
Give them all of your affection  
  
You keep your naughty boys  
Locked inside the kitchen  
And when they make a noise  
A swish of your hand keeps them  
Screaming out for your affection  
  
I don't know the why or wherefores  
I don't what's wrong or right  
I just know at night  
You give them all of your affection  
  
You keep your servants down  
Swinging from the gallows  
And when they come round  
Oh you smile and you say hello  
Give them all of your affection  
You give them all of your affection  
You give them all of your affection
