  
As I look at the morning sky  
Today the wind is blowing hard  
See that bird has flown too high  
Pretty soon it will be tired  
I spent a day all by myself  
A rich man without his wealth  
Sometimes I get it wrong  
But I'm not the only one  
  
The afternoon was very clear  
The sun was beating down on me  
I got thirsty for a beer  
That I had to go to sea  
The sea was very rough  
It made me feel sick  
But I like that kind of stuff  
It beats arithmetic  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
The early evening mist  
Looked beautiful to me  
Was sweeter than a kiss  
I wish you all could see  
I'm a long long way from home  
But this photograph of you  
Even though it's monochrome  
Tells me what I should do  
So I got up on my feet  
And I knew it would be alright  
For my clothes were looking beat  
In the middle of the night  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this
