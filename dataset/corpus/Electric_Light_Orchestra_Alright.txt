The gold verandah in the dark has gone  
down to the metal man.  
No better time to leave the ground  
And maybe try to understand.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright.  
  
And through the darkest times of your life  
You always tried to be the one,  
And now the times have made you wonder  
If you ever knew what was goin' on.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.  
  
(background) Alright ... alright ... alright  
  
No use thinkin' about what you ain't got,  
Just makes you bitter.  
And as you speak, everything that you say  
Goes out on the big transmitter.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.  
  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
