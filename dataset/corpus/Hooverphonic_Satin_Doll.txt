This scary face on the wall  
His watch kills every minute  
With a sherlock holmes hat  
And a rope around his neck  
'cause she said  
  
Satin doll, satin doll  
Step by step  
Against the wall, against the wall  
Step  
  
'cause she said  
Satin doll, satin doll  
Step by step  
Promises  
Promises  
Is what she said  
  
Who's the vampires praying  
He strangles me every minute  
These purple eyes talk to him  
Get me out of this constraint  
  
Satin doll, satin doll  
Step by step  
Against the wall, against the wall  
Step...
