When you're down and you're lonely  
Come to me I'll be your only  
Always remember  
I'll be by your side  
Call me up daytime or night  
I'll always listen every time  
If you need me  
Then please believe me, don't you cry  
  
I'll show concern  
And I'll keep my word  
I won't stay away  
Now and then when your heart's in pain  
I'd like to say  
Always remember  
I'll be forever  
By your side  
  
Friends like this  
Are hard to find  
With time to talk  
And to confide  
If you need me  
Please believe me  
I'm by your side  
  
The secrets kept as we lie in bed  
I can't keep away  
Now and then when your heart's in pain  
I'd like to say  
Always remember  
I'll be forever  
By your side
