Sometimes  
When I'm in heaven  
I get forgetful of the earth, woah oh  
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds  
The heat is on  
Fixed up, and the sheet is down  
  
I got a pocket full of deadliness  
Opium den mother, then forget my head  
With the dead-rid coke, unsteadiness  
Faux blondes have less fun  
  
Pour more in my head my  
Back to the city I grew up in  
Again and again and again  
Forever a lake effect kid  
  
I got the skyline in my veins  
Forget your night times  
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel  
And joke us, joke us  
Till lake shore drive comes back into focus  
I just want to come back to love  
Spark until you hit it  
Keep you warm at night  
  
I got a pocket full of deadliness  
Opium den mother, then forget my head  
With the dead-rid coke, unsteadiness  
Faux blondes have less fun (fun)  
  
Pour more in my head  
Back to the city I grew up in  
Again and again and again  
Forever a lake effect kid [x4]
