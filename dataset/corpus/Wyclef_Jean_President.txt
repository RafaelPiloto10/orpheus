Yeah, election time's comin'  
Who you gon' vote for?  
Yeah  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
Instead of spendin' billions on the war  
I can use that money, so I can feed the poor  
Cause I know some so poor  
When it rains, that's when they shower  
Screamin', "Fight the power"  
That's when the vulture devoured  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
I know some soldiers  
That sleep, but they can't dream  
Wake up with screams  
Sounds of M-16s  
So take this medal of honor  
For your bravery  
I wish you the best kid  
You and your family  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
But the radio won't play this  
They call it rebel music  
How can you refuse it  
Children of Moses?  
  
Tell the children the truth, the truth  
It's not all that bling, that's diamonds  
Tell them the truth, the truth  
Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium  
Tell them the truth, the truth, yeah  
Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold  
  
If I was President, all Blacks will have reparation, no segregation  
Feed the nation 'til there is no famine  
Muslims, Jews, Christians would all hold hands  
Every week on the beach, party by the sand, word up  
  
Take trips on Air Force One  
No need to bring the homeless  
With no sneaks to Air Force One  
Better schools in the hood  
Better teachers for the classes  
Makin' money, payin' no taxes  
  
Find the best scientists, tell 'em  
"Come up with the answer  
I want the cure for AIDS and Cancer"  
But I gotta watch my back  
Snipers on the hill, with the steel  
Man power, waitin' to JF kill  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
I feel a ring comin'  
Let me play my guitar for them right now  
Let's go  
Refugees  
Yeah
