I used to think of myself as a soldier  
Holding his own against impossible odds  
Badly outnumbered and caught in a crossfire of devils and gods.  
  
All I ever wanted to be was free  
All I ever wanted to see was within my eyes to see  
Oh, but, these days  
Are just like you and me  
These days  
Are just like you and me.  
  
You used to be something I could believe in  
How could you let me forsake myself so,  
You used to think of your life as a riddle with no answer known.  
  
All you ever wanted to be was free  
All you ever looked for was what was within your sights to see  
Oh, but, these days  
Are just like you and me  
These days  
Are just like you and me  
  
We used to live like there was no tomorrow  
Tasting our trials a day at a time  
Laughing at sorrow and crying for justice such innocent crimes.  
  
All we ever wanted to be was free  
All we ever looked for was what was within our eyes to see  
Oh, but, these days  
Are just like you and me  
These days are just like you and me  
Just like you and me.  
You know they're just like you and me.
