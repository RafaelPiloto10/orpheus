Words and music by freddie mercury  
  
You suck my blood like a leech  
You break the law and you preach  
Screw my brain till it hurts  
You've taken all my money  
And you want more  
Misguided old mule with your pig headed rules  
With your narrow minded cronies  
Who are fools of the first division  
Death on two legs  
You're tearing me apart  
Death on two legs  
You've never had a heart of your own  
Kill joy bad guy big talking small fry  
You're just an old barrow boy  
Have you found a new toy to replace me?  
Can you face me?  
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye  
Feel good are you satisfied?  
Do you feel like suicide?  
(i think you should)  
Is your conscience all right  
Does it plague you at night?  
Do you feel good feel good?  
  
You talk like a big business tycoon  
You're just a hot air balloon  
So no one gives you a damn  
You're just an overgrown schoolboy  
Let me tan your hide  
A dog with disease  
You're the king of the 'sleaze'  
Put your money where your mouth is  
Mister know-all  
Was the fin on your back  
Part of the deal? (shark)  
Death on two legs  
You're tearing me apart  
Death on two legs  
You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own  
(right from the start)  
Insane you should be put inside  
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride  
Should be made unemployed  
Then make yourself null and void  
Make me feel good i feel good
