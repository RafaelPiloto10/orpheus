Where are  
The sunny days  
The blue skies  
The flowers for the children  
The colors for their eyes?  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
All these things now days  
Come in short supply  
It's time that we  
  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Where are  
All the sandy beaches  
Fishes in the sea  
Birds to sing for daybreak?  
Where are all the trees?  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
  
All these things now days  
Come in short supply  
It's time that we  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Where are all the grassy hilltops  
Clean air to breathe  
Pure water to drink of  
  
Beautiful sights to see?  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
All these things now days  
Come in short supply  
It's time that we  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Or there'll be no more you  
  
There'll be no more me  
There'll be no more children  
All we know will cease to be  
Don't you see  
Don't you see  
The things of this earth  
Keep us alive  
It's time that we  
  
It's time that we  
Make a space in our hearts  
And open our eyes  
Where are the sunny days?  
Blue skies  
The flowers for the children  
All the colors for their eyes  
All the sandy beaches  
Fishes in the sea  
  
All the birds to sing for daybreak  
Where are  
Where are  
Where are all the trees?  
Don't you see  
All these things they come in short supply  
It's time that we  
Make a space inside our hearts  
And open our eyes
