Just like a person from another world  
My eyes can see inside you, little girl  
I see things that you don't want to see  
I see things you're trying to hide from me  
I'm just trying to make you understand  
All the ways you can affect this man  
From the moment that you came in touch  
With the power there to burn so much  
You've got hidden talent (yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
You know your past is what's been bugging you  
If you're ready girl ... do what you gotta do  
Look for your life between the lines  
Bad directions and poor designs  
You've got hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
Check it out you ... got it, hidden talent, oh  
With the advantage of perspective I  
See there's more to you than meets the eye  
But now the time must come to spread your wings and fly  
Yeah (hidden talent) yeah  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
Check it out ... you got it, hidden talent, oh  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
Affair without warning  
Hidden talent, mmm (mmm)  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
(fade)
