Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams  
Ring them bell from the sanctuaries, 'cross the valleys and streams  
For they're deep and they're wide, and the world's on its side  
And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride  
Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel of the plow  
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep  
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the game is through?  
Ring them bells for the time that flies  
For the child who cries when innocence dies  
Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof  
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom  
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong  
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong
