When I'm worried and I can't sleep  
I count my blessings instead of sheep  
And I fall asleep counting my blessings  
When my bankroll is getting small  
I think of when I had none at all  
And I fall asleep counting my blessings  
  
I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads  
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds  
If you're worried and you can't sleep  
Just count your blessings instead of sheep  
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings
