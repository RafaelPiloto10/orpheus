When I wake up each morning  
Trying to find myself  
And if I'm ever the least unsure  
I always remind myself  
Though you're someone in this world  
That I'll always choose to love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
As for me it's getting down to the last unspoken part  
When you must begin to ease the pain of a broken heart  
Tell me why should I even care  
If I have to lose your love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
Yet it wasn't enough for you  
All the love I had to give  
I did my best to keep you satisfied  
I guess you'll never know how much I tried  
I really tried  
  
And if ever our paths should cross again  
Well, You won't find me being the one  
Who gets lost  
Once I had so much to give  
But You just refused my love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
I did my best to keep you satisfied  
I guess you'll never know how much I tried  
I really tried  
  
When I wake up each morning  
Trying to find myself  
And if I'm ever the least unsure  
I always remind myself  
Though you're someone in this world  
I'll always choose to love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
Though you're someone in this world  
I'll always choose to love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love
