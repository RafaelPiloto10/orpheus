Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?  
Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?  
  
Today you say you deyah  
Tomorrow you say you're gone  
But you're gone so long  
If there is no love in your heart - so sorry  
Then there is no hope for you - true, true  
  
Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?  
Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?  
  
So you're in the air  
But you still don't have a thing to spare  
You're flying high  
While we're on the low o-o-oh  
  
Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last? Tell me now  
Tomorrow people, where is your past? No where  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last? Ten years!  
  
Stop tellin' me the same story  
Today you say you deyah  
Tomorrow you say you're gone and you're not coming back  
If there is no love in your heart oh now  
There will never be hope for you  
  
Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, how long will you last? Ten years!  
Tomorrow people, where is your past?  
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, come on  
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, come on  
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, no soon come  
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, soon come  
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, today is here  
  
If you don't know your past, you don't know your future  
Everyone  
Don't know your past, don't know your future everyman  
Don't know your past, don't know your future, come on  
Don't know your past, don't know your future  
  
How many nations  
How many people did that one catch  
How many nations did that one catch  
Don't know past, don't know your future  
Don't know past, don't know your future
