He's so compassionate  
He's oh so kind  
All in peace, he says  
All in time  
  
He's wrapped in wisdom  
And wisdom he speaks  
So compassionate that I could freak  
  
Time is running out on him  
God is out to lunch  
Time is running out on his decision  
Every day that passes  
Proves that God has lost his glasses...  
Or could it be that tears  
Have blurred his vision  
  
He's so compassionate  
He's oh so kind  
All in peace, he says  
All in time  
  
He's wrapped in wisdom  
From his head down to his feet  
So compassionate but oh so weak  
  
Time is running out on him  
God is out to lunch  
Time is running out on his decision  
Every day that passes  
Proves that God has lost his glasses...  
Or could it be that tears  
Have blurred his vision  
  
He's so compassionate  
It's all for their sake  
Well, I don't know philosophy  
But I do know ache  
  
This ache is bigger  
Than words on TV  
So compassionate  
How can he be?  
  
Now that time is running out on him  
God is out to lunch  
Time is running out on his decision  
Every day that passes  
Proves that God has lost his glasses...  
Or could it be that tears  
Have blurred his vision
