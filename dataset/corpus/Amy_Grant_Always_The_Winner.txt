Always the winner, baby  
You're always the center, baby  
But don't you ever get lonely at night  
When the clouds have gone away  
It's always  
You're showing her the lady  
Always the lady  
You're full of  
Yourself, you know  
Gone crazy  
There was a time when you cared for their hearts  
And the need to show them love was tearing you apart  
But you changed, you know  
Become the star of the show  
Now you've got nothing to give  
Where is the truth you once lived  
You're just lonely  
Don't you feel lonely  
Turn out the spotlight, I'm tired, turn out the spotlight  
My mind will die, lord, I'm crying  
Oh, I'm to turn my gaze back, lord, to you  
You're the only one who knows me  
Just mold me back to you
