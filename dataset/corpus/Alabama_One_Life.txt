  
A man and wife had prayed for years for children  
Were losing faith and close to giving up  
Then a young girl with no way to keep her baby  
Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
A small coal mining town in West Virginia  
Prayed as they kept vigil day and night  
Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken  
But also thankful one made it out alive  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
Two thousand years ago the world lay waiting  
For the Savior they were told would come  
Then on that winter night there in a manger  
God blessed the world with his one and only son  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
It takes one honest prayer coming from your heart
