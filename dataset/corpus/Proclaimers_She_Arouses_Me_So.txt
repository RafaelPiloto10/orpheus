Well it's 2 oh 1  
And she's saying she's done  
But I need another go,  
Cause she arouses me so  
She arouses me so  
Yeah it's 3 oh 4  
And we're lying on the floor  
But I need another go,  
Cause she arouses me so  
She arouses me so,  
She arouses me so  
  
What's the point of sleepin'  
Instead of keepin'  
Doin' it anyhow?  
Forget about tomorrow,  
Until tomorrow  
Let's stay here and now  
  
Yeah it's 4, 19  
And it doesn't seem keen  
But she needs another go  
And she arouses me so  
She arouses me so  
  
Do do dit dit  
Do do dit dit  
  
What's the point of sleepin'  
Instead of keepin'  
Doin' it anyhow?  
Forget about tomorrow,  
Until tomorrow  
Let's stay here and now  
  
Yeah it's 6 oh 8  
And we're already late  
But we need another go  
And she arouses me so  
She arouses me so  
  
She arouses me so  
She arouses me so oh oh oh oh oh oh  
She arouses me so  
She arouses  
Really arouses  
She arouses  
Yeah she arouses me so
