[Intro]  
There's a room in a hotel in New York City,  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.  
I don't want to remember it all,  
The promises are made if you just hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
  
[Verse 1]  
I just need enough of you to dull the pain,  
To get me through the night until we're twins again,  
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again,  
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And there's a jet black crow droning on, and on, and on,  
Up above our heads droning on, and on, and on,  
Keep making trouble 'till you find what you love,  
I need a new partner in crime and you're my shotgun.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a room in a hotel in New York City,  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.  
I don't want to remember it all,  
The promises are made if you just hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
  
[Verse 2]  
A birth and a death on the same day,  
And honey I only appear so I can fade away.  
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream,  
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And there's a jet black crow droning on, and on, and on,  
Up above our heads droning on, and on, and on.  
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck,  
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day.  
  
[Bridge]  
There's a room in a hotel in New York City,  
It shares our fate and deserves our pity.  
I don't want to remember it all,  
The promises are made if you just hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
  
[Outro]  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
