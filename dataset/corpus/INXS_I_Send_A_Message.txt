In the silence I think of you  
I send a message and hope it gets through  
Think of the distance  
Think of the miles  
All of the valleys could take a while  
  
I miss the people  
I miss the fun  
You're my aberration  
She's my only one  
  
And I imagine you're standing here  
It's subliminal so inspirational  
Man of the world for all the good reasons  
Take away the pain and drink the wine  
  
I miss the people  
And I miss the fun  
You're my aberration  
She's my only one  
  
Oh yeah take it home  
  
(guitar solo)  
  
And in the silence I think of you  
I send a message and hope it gets through  
Think of the distance  
Think of the miles  
All of the valleys could take a while  
  
I miss the people  
I miss the fun  
You're my aberration  
She's my only one  
  
I miss the people  
You miss the fun  
You're my aberration  
She's my only one
