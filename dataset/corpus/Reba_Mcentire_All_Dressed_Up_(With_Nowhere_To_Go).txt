The sign says, "families welcome"  
At the Oaks Retirement Home  
But mostly, no one comes 'cept on the weekends  
Ruby Wilson lives in 303  
Where she spends most her time  
But it's almost noon on Sunday  
And she's been sitting in the lobby since nine  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
She's all dressed up  
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up  
With nowhere to go  
  
As Ruby watches all the others  
Leaving with their families  
The nurse tells her, it's time to come to dinner  
She says she's expecting company  
They're just running late  
But, the nurse knows the truth too well  
She just sighs and walks away  
  
She's all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
She's all dressed up  
Watching and waiting, but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When you're all dressed up  
With nowhere to go
