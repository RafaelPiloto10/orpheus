That wave  
Pulled me into your eyes  
Through the greeney grey pebbles  
And countless cathedrals arriving  
That wave  
Lift me into your mouth  
Turning spires and spittle of pearls  
To perplex the young diver  
I flew down to the bottom of the sea  
Where I questioned the fishes all about it  
I was in heaven  
Address cloud eleven  
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love  
That wave  
Carried me through your hair  
Up from suffocate seaweed  
The perfumed cushions cascading  
That wave  
Pushed me into your skin  
Where I bathed in the promises  
Giddy with planets parading  
I swam down to the bottom of the sky  
Where I questioned the blue birds all about it  
I was in heaven  
Address cloud eleven  
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love  
That wave!  
That wave  
Pulled me right overboard  
Into permanent morgasm  
Emotional action painting  
I flew down to the bottom of the sea  
Where I questioned the fishes all about it  
I was in heaven  
Address cloud eleven  
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love
