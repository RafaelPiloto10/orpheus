Would you dance if I asked you to dance?  
Or would you run and never look back?  
Would you cry if you saw me crying?  
And would you save my soul tonight?  
Would you tremble if I touched your lips?  
Or would you laugh? Oh, please tell me this.  
Now would you die for the one you love?  
Oh hold me in your arms tonight.  
  
I can be your hero baby  
I can kiss away the pain  
I will stand by you forever  
You can take my breath away  
  
Would you swear that you'll always be mine  
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?  
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?  
I don't care. You're here tonight  
  
I can be your hero baby  
I can kiss away the pain  
I will stand by you forever  
You can take my breath away
