What do you want  
What do you want  
I'm givin' everything I have  
I'm even trying to see if there's more  
  
Locked deep inside  
I'll try  
I'll try  
Can't you see, this is me  
  
What do you need  
What do you need  
Is someone just to hurt  
So that you can appear to be smart  
  
Keep a steady job  
Play God  
Play God  
What to you really know  
  
You parasite  
You're dynamite  
An oversight  
Misunderstanding what you hear  
  
You're quick to cheer  
And volunteer  
Absurdities, musical blasphemies  
Oh Lord  
  
Save us all  
What do you want  
What do you want  
I'm givin' every thing I have  
  
I'm even trying to see if there's more  
Locked deep inside  
I'll try  
I'll try  
Can't you see, this is me
