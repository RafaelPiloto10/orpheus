While you were out  
The message says  
You left a number  
And I tried to call  
But they wrote it down  
In a perfect Spanish scrawl  
In a perfect Spanish scrawl  
  
Yet again  
I'm missing you  
King size bed  
(in a) hotel someplace  
I hear your name  
I see your face  
I see your face  
  
(The) back street dolls  
And the side door johnnies  
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of  
Money  
Back in the alley  
Going bang to the wall  
Tied to the tail  
Of a midnight crawl  
Heaven wouldn't be  
So high I know  
If the times gone by  
Hadn't been so low  
The best laid plans  
Come apart at the seams  
And shatter all my dreams  
  
Sometimes I feel like  
Screaming  
Close my eyes  
It's times like this  
My head goes down  
And the only thing I know  
Is the name of this town  
Is the name of this town  
  
Yet again  
I'm missing you  
Won't be long  
O' coming home  
Until that distant time  
I'll be moving on  
I'll be moving on
