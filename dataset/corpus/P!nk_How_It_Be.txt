How It Be  
Can anybody here  
Tell me  
Oh tell me  
How it be  
Tell me  
How it be  
  
How it be true  
That someone, yes someone  
That means you  
Could lie to me oh lie to me  
How it be?  
  
Get my hopes up so much yes  
That there be, something there for me  
Something new, something shiny  
I am so blue  
  
How it be?  
Tell me  
Oh tell me  
How it be  
  
I thought there would be something here  
Something I didn't know before  
I thought you could open my eyes  
To something new, for me down here  
To load down here  
  
But you lied, oh you lied  
Then I cried, you lying liar  
There's nothing here for me  
The bird, man, is gone, or never existed  
  
How it be?
