We sailed away  
We walked 2 thousand miles  
And then we slipped away  
We looked so hard  
But couldn't seem to find just what  
The world was for  
Now we know  
Just what the journey's for  
  
Looking out to the stars  
Think about what you are  
What do they think of you  
Animals in their zoo  
They haven't got the time  
Landing's not on their minds  
How do they have the nerve  
We're animals in preserve  
  
They watch us all  
They're only making sure that we  
Don't trip and fall  
Now they look so hard  
But they can't tell us why they're  
Here and just what for  
Because they don't know  
Who opened up the door  
  
How can we find out more  
Who owns the keyless door  
Where does the circle end  
Who are the unwatched men  
Where do we go from here  
Faith is a fading fear  
Life is a waiting room  
I hope they don't call me soon  
  
How much more do you really  
Think you know than a flower  
Does about who's behind the door!
