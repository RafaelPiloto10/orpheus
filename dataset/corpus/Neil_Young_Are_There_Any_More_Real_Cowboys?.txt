Are there any more  
Real cowboys  
Left out in these hills?  
Will the fire hit the iron  
One more time?  
And will one more  
Dusty pick-up  
Coming rolling down the road  
With a load of feed  
Before the sun gets high?  
Well, I hope that  
Working cowboy never dies.  
  
Not the one  
That's snortin' cocaine  
When the honky-tonk's all closed  
But the one  
That prays for more rain  
Heaven knows  
That the good feed  
Brings the money  
And the money buys the clothes  
Not the diamond sequins  
Shining on tv  
But the kind the  
Working cowboy really needs.  
  
Are there any more  
Country families  
Still working hand in hand  
Trying hard to stay together  
And make a stand?  
While the rows and rows of houses  
Come creepin' up on the land  
Where the cattle graze and  
An old grey barn still stands  
Are there any more  
Real cowboys in this land?  
  
Are there any more  
Real cowboys in this land?
