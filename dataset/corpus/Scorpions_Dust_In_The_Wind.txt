I close my eyes  
Only for a moment and the moment?s gone  
All my dreams  
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity  
Dust in the wind  
All they are is dust in the wind  
Same old song  
Just a drop of water in an endless sea  
All we do  
Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see  
Dust in the wind  
  
All we are is dust in the wind  
don't hang on  
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky  
It slips away  
And all your money won't another minute buy  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind  
(all we are is dust in the wind)  
Dust in the wind  
Everything is dust in the wind  
(everything is dust in the wind)
