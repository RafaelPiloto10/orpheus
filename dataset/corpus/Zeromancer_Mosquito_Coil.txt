It's looking out  
From inside  
A Christmas bonus  
To last forever  
You think you're ready don't you  
  
It's a Mosquito Coil  
Where boys and girls  
Trying to stop their heads spinning  
A Mosquito Coil  
An instant supernova  
For beginners  
  
Once you're in  
You can't get out  
Dashboard Jesus  
Has your number  
And please remember me  
In your circle of friends  
  
What's killing you  
Is killing me  
One fling leads to another
