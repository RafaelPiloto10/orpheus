The lights're low I am too the crowd is high so are you  
It's gettin' close to closin' time and the breakup oh it breakup my mind  
You found me in this dimlit bar I'm with you and we're too far  
Now you say my kind of girl just can't fit in your kind of world  
Please don't leave me where you found me  
Oh don't leave me where you found me  
Keep your love wrapped warm around me  
Don't leave me where you found me  
  
I like to cook I like to sew I'd love to watch while babies grow  
I'd work my fingers to the bone if you'll make me the maker of your home  
Please forget the life I've led let me share more than your bed  
I'll make a vow to God above you'll always be the keeper of my love  
Please don't leave me...  
Please don't leave me where you found me
