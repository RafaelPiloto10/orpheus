Seen so many places and faces in my life,  
I been on the road for so long  
I will be tonight.  
I really love this life of traveling  
And seeing the sights.  
So I'm rollin',  
I'm rollin', rollin', rollin',  
Yeah, I'm rollin', rollin', rollin',rollin',  
Rollin' all over this world in search of love again.  
You know that you love me,  
But you don't even know my name.  
But I tell you, little darlin', it's the same old game.  
So I'm travelling one thousand miles  
To see your face again.  
Seen the good and the bad,  
But it always seemed to work out right.  
I'm not really sure of your love,  
But it's worth a fight.  
True love is an elusive game, try as we might.  
So keep your eyes on the road  
And your feet moving straight ahead,  
And don't you ever look back  
Keep on moving forward instead.  
Try and try, the only way to get ahead.
