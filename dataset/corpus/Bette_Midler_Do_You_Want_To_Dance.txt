Do you wanna dance, and hold my hand?  
Tell me you're my lover man.  
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?  
  
We could dance under the moonlight,  
Hug and kiss all through the night.  
Oh baby, tell me, do you wanna dance with me baby?  
  
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?  
Do you, do you, do you want to dance?  
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?  
  
Ah, that's right, ah, ah, aaaaaaaah.  
Do you want to dance under the moonlight?  
Hug me, kiss me, baby, all through the night.  
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me, do you want to dance?  
  
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?  
Do you want to dance?  
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me baby?  
You got to dance with me baby.  
Please dance with me baby
