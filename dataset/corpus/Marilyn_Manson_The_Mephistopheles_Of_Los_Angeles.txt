[Verse:]  
I don't know if I can open up  
I've been opened enough  
I don't know if I can open up  
I'm not a birthday present  
I'm aggressive regressive  
The past is over  
And passive scenes so pathetic  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise to every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't know if I can open up  
I been opened too much  
Double cross glossed over in my path-os  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise to every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles  
  
[Bridge:]  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I was fated, faithful, fatal  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
And I'm ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
And I'm ready to meet my maker  
  
[Chorus:]  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
Ready to meet my maker  
I feel stoned and alone like a heretic  
I'm ready to meet my maker  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
Lazarus has got no dirt on me  
And I'll rise to every occasion  
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles  
Of Los Angeles
