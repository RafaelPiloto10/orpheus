Is there anyone out there  
Willing to try ?  
Or are we satisfied with just getting by ?  
We've hurt mother nature  
  
Can't you see her she's crying  
We've robbed and we've raped her and taken her child  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason ?  
Just think about it  
  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason  
To live another season ?  
We're fighting more battles  
Everyday we're alive  
  
We should be rejoicing  
But instead we cry  
This world's so polluted  
You would think we were blind  
  
We poison our children  
Before they're defined  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason ?  
Just think about it  
  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason  
To live another season ? yeah  
Excuse me for saying  
'Cause I've never been shy  
  
But if we don't stop this  
We sho'nuff goin' die  
Yes I hope we can make it  
'Cause this river's run dry  
  
Now our only battle  
Will be to survive, hey  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason ?  
Come on and think about it  
  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason  
To live another season ?  
Yeah it's the new millennium  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Can we find a reason  
To live another season ?  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason ?  
To live another season ?  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ...  
It's the new millennium  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ...  
Can we find a reason  
  
To live another season ?
