I've had many times  
I can tell you  
Times when innocence I'd trade for company  
And children saw me crying  
I thought I'd had my share of that  
But these miss you nights  
Are the longest  
  
Midnight diamonds  
Stud my heaven  
Southward burning  
Lie the jewels that I obey  
Summer warm winds  
That embrace me  
Just as surely kissed your face  
Yeah these miss you nights  
Are the longest  
  
How I missed you  
I'm not likely to tell  
I'm a man and cold day light  
Buys the pride I'd rather sell  
All my secrets  
Are wasted affair  
You know them well  
  
Thinking of my going  
How to cut the thread  
And leave it all behind  
Looking windward for my comfort  
I take each day as it arrives  
But these miss you nights  
Are the longest  
  
Lay down all thoughts of your surrender  
It's only me who's killing time  
Lay down all dreams and themes once remembered  
It's just the same  
This miss you game  
Yeah these miss you nights  
Are the longest
