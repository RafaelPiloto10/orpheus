Well Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.  
  
Well, she's the gal in the red blue jeans  
She's the queen of all the teens  
She's the woman that I know  
She's the woman that (scream) loves me so.  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.  
(Let's rock)  
  
Well, now she's the woman that's got that beat  
She's the woman with the flyin' feet  
She's the woman that walks around the store  
She's the woman that yells (scream) more, more, more, more.  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.  
(Let's rock again, now)  
  
Well Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby  
Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe  
Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.
