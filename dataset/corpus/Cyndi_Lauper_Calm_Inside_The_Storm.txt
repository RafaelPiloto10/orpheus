I can get up  
On the right side of the bed  
But that won't stop the rain  
From coming down on my head  
I can live my life  
Playing hide and seek  
But when I look inside  
It's hard to make believe,  
Ah ah  
  
'N lately  
You seem so far away  
I wish I could say something  
But I don't know what to say  
I can feel your eyes  
I don't have to look at you  
Boy, discontent  
Is-a-sneakin' through  
  
You never really want anything  
But what you really need is everything  
I'll give you something only life can bring  
The calm inside the storm  
Love me a little, love me long  
Wo yeah  
The calm inside the storm  
Love me a little, love me long  
Don't you know  
You should be holding me  
But you're all locked inside  
Why don't you throw me your keys  
I'm like a rockin' ship  
On your rollin' sea  
You know crash lightnin'  
Never frightens me, nah  
  
...You never really wanted  
But what you really needed  
I want to give you something  
Mmm...the calm inside the storm  
Love me a little, love me long  
Love me a little, love me long
