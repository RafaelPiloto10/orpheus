The sun burned hot, it burned my eyes  
Burned so hot I thought I'd died  
Thought I'd died and gone to Hell  
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
I went to the river but the river was dry  
I fell to my knees, and I looked to the sky  
I looked to the sky, and the spring rain fell  
I saw the water from a deeper well  
  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
  
I was ready for love, I was ready for the money  
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey  
Ready for the winnin', ready for the bell  
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
I found some love and I found some money  
Found that blood would drip from the honey  
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell  
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
  
Well, I did it for kicks and I did it for faith  
I did it for lust and I did it for hate  
I did it for need and I did it for love  
Addiction stayed on tight like a glove  
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night  
And the three of us were a terrible sight  
Nipple to the bottle, to the gun, to the cell  
To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well  
  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
  
I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage  
I shook those walls and I rattled that gage  
I took my trouble down a dead-end trail  
Reachin' out a hand for a holier grail  
Hey there, mama, did you carry that load?  
Did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road  
'Bout the rebel yell, 'bout the one that fell?  
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well...  
  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well  
Well, lookin' for the water from a deeper well
