I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.  
The starry night, the campfire light.  
The coyote call, and the howlin' winds wail.  
So I ride out to the old sundown  
  
I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.  
Lord I'm just thinking 'bout a certain female.  
The nights we spent together, riding on the range.  
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.  
  
Roll me over and turn me around.  
Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.  
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.  
  
I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.  
Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.  
Down below the border, in a town in Mexico,  
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.  
  
Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.  
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.  
  
Roll me over, and I'll turn around  
And I'll move my fingers up and down  
Up and down  
  
It's okay amigo, just let me go  
Riding in the rodeo  
  
Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinning till I hit the ground  
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo  
Roll me over and set me free, the cowboy's life is the life for me
