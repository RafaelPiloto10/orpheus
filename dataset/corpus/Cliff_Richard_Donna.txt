Oh Donna  
Oh Doonna  
Oh Donna  
Oh Donna  
  
I had a girl Donna was her name  
Since she left me  
Well I've never been the same  
'Cause I love my girl  
Donna where can you be  
  
And now that you're gone  
I'm left here all alone  
All by myself to wander and roam  
How I love my girl  
Donna where can you be  
  
Oh Donna  
Now that you're gone  
I don't know what to do  
All my love and all my kisses  
Were for you, you just you  
  
I had a girl Donna was her name  
Since she's been gone  
I've never been the same  
'Cause I love my girl  
Donna where can you be  
  
Oh Donna  
Now that you're gone  
I don't know what to do  
All my love and all my kisses  
Were for you  
  
I had a girl Donna was her name  
Since she's been gone  
I've never been the same  
I love my girl  
Donna where, where can you be  
Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna
