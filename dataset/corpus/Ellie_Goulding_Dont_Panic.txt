[Verse 1]  
Bite down on your lip  
Take another sip  
Stop checking your phone  
Looking for the answers  
Mind running obsessed  
Feeling paralyzed  
Let me watch you undress  
Fall into the night  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost  
And we don't know who we are  
Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop  
So we just keep breaking hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?  
Can we take it back to the start?  
When love's not playing out like the movies  
It doesn't mean it's falling apart  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
  
[Verse 2]  
Been shattered before  
Everything breaks  
I can't really be sure  
Of our mistakes  
Come under my love  
Like an umbrella  
Going to make you feel good  
Yeah, better than ever  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, we change and we change and we feel so lost  
And we don't know who we are  
Yeah, we break and we break and we just can't stop  
So we just keep breaking hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?  
Can we take it back to the start?  
When love's not playing out like the movies  
It doesn't mean it's falling apart  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
  
[Bridge]  
I got big dreams baby  
I got big dreams baby  
So don't you over complicate it  
I got big dreams baby  
I got big dreams baby  
So don't you, don't you over complicate it  
  
[Chorus]  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing?  
Can we take it back to the start?  
When love's not playing out like the movies  
It doesn't mean it's falling apart  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
Don't panic  
Don't panic
