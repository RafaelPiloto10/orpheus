You were the freak king of the piercing shop  
All the girls thought that they could sing  
But they're really not  
Shit I don't get it  
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby  
How the fuck is your song  
In a coke commercial crazy  
I don't get it  
Your taste once exquisite  
  
What happened to Brooklyn?  
What happened to New York?  
What happened to my scene?  
What happened to punk rock?  
  
You called me the queen  
Of the downtown scene babe  
How the fuck would you go  
Switch it up and then replace me?  
I don't get it  
I'm so legit  
  
Tell me was it cause I wasn't  
Platinum in jewels  
That perhaps you thought  
I was a little bit even uncool  
Kid was that it?  
Stefani you suck  
I know you're selling 20 million  
Wish they could've seen you  
When we booed you off in Williamsburg  
You're hurt  
I know my words don't hurt yeah  
Oh girl I see you walking round  
In your pearls  
Thinking that you're number  
You're so funny  
Coz honey you're not  
  
What happened to Brooklyn  
The last frontier  
They said you can make it anywhere  
If you can make it here  
But where no magic in the air  
  
What happened to Brooklyn?  
What happened to our scene baby?  
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?  
Remember when the streets used  
To be dangerous and we were born bad  
And we were born bad?  
  
Punk rock punk rock  
The boys used to punch each other in the face  
And girls were walking round wasted  
Everyone had a good night  
Came back when sunlight  
Punk rock, rock, rock
