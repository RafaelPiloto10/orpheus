I can hear somebody knockin'  
On my bedroom door  
I find it rather shockin'  
It's my best friend's girl  
(Oo) Imagine my surprise  
There's a hungry look in her eyes  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
She said, I'm feelin' kinda lonely  
And only you will do  
Would you like to get to know me  
Like I wanna know you  
(Oo) No tellin' what a man will do  
Face to face with a woman like you  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea, see how the love goes  
I can hear her calling (calling)  
But no one understands her (no one understands)  
Beggin' me to let her in  
And she's waiting for my answer  
Should I open up the door  
And let trouble walk in  
Should I resist her even more  
Or tell her, come on in  
(Oo) No tellin' what a man will do  
Face to face with a woman like you  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea, see how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea, see how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes
