Give when you give  
The best of your service  
Telling the world that  
The Saviour has come  
  
Be not dismayed when  
Man don't believe you  
He'll understand  
And say well done  
  
Oh when I come to  
The end of my journey  
Weary of life  
And the battle is won  
  
Carrying the staff  
And the cross of redemption  
He'll understand  
And say well done  
  
Misunderstood yes  
The Savior of sinners  
Died on the cross  
He was God's only son  
Oh hear him calling  
  
His father in heaven  
Not my will, Lord  
But then be done  
And when I come...
