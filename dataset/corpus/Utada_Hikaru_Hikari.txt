English translation:  
Though I've lived  
All this time  
All by myself  
Unconcerned with destiny  
I was awoken by  
A flash of light,  
In the middle of the night  
I quietly stand at the exit  
Shooting light at the darkness  
Nowadays I wonder if making promises  
Will only make things worse.  
I just want to tell someone my wish.  
I'll introduce you to my family  
I'm sure you'll go over well.  
No matter what happens  
We're always together  
No matter what happens  
We're by each other's side  
A light named you finds me  
In the middle of the night.  
Go out into a noisy street (When you turn my way)  
Take off the mask of destiny. (Take it all away)  
Stop doing meaningless things  
Like always trying to predict what's gonna happen next.  
Let's eat tasty food today.  
The future is still way off.  
Even I don't know what will happen  
Don't complete it  
Make it better,  
We'll be okay if we take it  
One scene at a time.  
A light named you reflects my scenario,  
On the screen.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the TV  
An look only at me.  
No matter how good it seems  
I can't truly believe  
At those times  
We're with each other.  
A light called you finds me  
In the middle of the night.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the TV  
And look only at me.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the tV  
And look only at me.
