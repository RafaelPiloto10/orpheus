Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
Who has gone far away now from me  
Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
Long ago we were strollin' together  
All the shores and the drive-in's we did see  
Now she spends all her time with another  
But I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
Who has gone far away now from me  
Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?  
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
Who has gone far away now from me  
Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny  
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?
