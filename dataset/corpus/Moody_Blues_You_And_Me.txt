There's a leafless tree in Asia.  
Under the sun there's a homeless man.  
There's a forest fire in the valley  
Where the story all began.  
  
What will be our last thought?  
Do you think it's coming soon?  
Will it be of comfort  
Or the pain of a burning wound?  
  
All we are trying to say  
Is we are all we've got.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, never, stop.  
  
You're an ocean full of faces,  
And you know that we believe.  
We're just a wave that drifts around you,  
Singing all our hopes and dreams.  
We look around, in wonder,  
At the work that has been done.  
By the visions of our father,  
Touched by his loving son.  
  
All we are trying to say  
Is we are all we've got.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, never, stop.  
All we are trying to say  
Is we are all we've got.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, never, stop.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, ever, never, ever, stop...
