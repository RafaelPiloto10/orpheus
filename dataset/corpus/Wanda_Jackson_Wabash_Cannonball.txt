From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore  
From the queen of flowing mountains to the south bells by the shore  
She's mighty tall and handsome, she's known quite well by all  
She's the combination on the Wabash Cannonball  
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day  
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say  
There's a gal from Tennessee, she's long and she's tall  
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball  
Our eastern states're dandy, so all the people say  
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way  
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall  
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball  
So here's to daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand  
And always be remembered in the ports throughout the land  
His earthly race is over, the curtains 'round him fall  
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball  
So listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar  
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore  
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobos squall  
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball  
You're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
