When I'm walking the straight and narrow  
Sometimes life throws a little curve  
If I slip on the stones beneath me  
Will I lose my nerve?  
Looking up when I've hit the bottom  
Giving thanks that the motion's stopped  
I still have a rock to hold to  
If the bottom drops  
Out here on my own  
I won't be alone  
I'll keep believing You  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be believing  
I will be believing  
Oh I'll be believing You  
I'll be believing  
I will be believing  
Oh I'll be believing You  
  
If I find all my hopes are hollow  
Even if all my wells run dry  
If I'm left here with next to nothing  
And I don't know why  
I'm here on my own  
I won't be alone  
I'll keep believing You  
  
[Chorus 3X]
