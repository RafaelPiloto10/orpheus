Turn yourself around!  
You weren't invited!  
Turn yourself around!  
You weren't invited!  
Good, good things  
Happen in bad towns  
Good, good things  
Happen in bad towns  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run away, run away, you want it  
Run away, run away, you want it  
Run away, anyway, you want it  
Run away, run away, you want it  
  
What, what did you do to your back  
Kept soft thoughts cut lips carry pin back  
Junk jump off too much talk  
Old hope breeds  
Cold needs  
Undress cold keys  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ohh, ohhh...  
I've got call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey, honey  
Ohh, ohhh...  
I've got call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey, honey  
Ohh, ohhh...  
I've got call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey, honey  
Ohh, ohhh...  
I've got call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey, HONEY!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What?  
What?  
What?  
What?
