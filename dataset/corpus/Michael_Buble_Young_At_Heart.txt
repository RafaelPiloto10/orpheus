Fairy tales can come true  
It can happen to you when you're young at heart  
For it's hard, you will find  
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart  
  
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes  
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams  
And life gets more exciting with each passing day  
And love is either in your heart or on it's way  
  
Don't you know that it's worth  
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart  
For as rich as you are  
It's much better by far to be young at heart  
  
And if you should survive to a hundred and five  
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive  
And here is the best part, you have a head start  
If you are among the very young at heart  
  
And if you should survive to a hundred and five  
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive  
And here is the best part, you have a head start  
If you are among the very young at heart
