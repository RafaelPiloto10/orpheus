On the molly and I'm twisted, throw ya body with the fishes  
Double back around that corner and I'm bodying the witness  
Uh, Real niggas don't talk much, do drive by's and walk ups  
Lame rappers that talk much get a broke jaw, star struck

Pop a pill, pop you, my nick name is Pain Killer  
I'm still that same nigga, East side I rep that  
Pussy niggas better get right or where I see you, you get left at  
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk  
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
