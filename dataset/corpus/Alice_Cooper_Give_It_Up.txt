You got your sugar  
You got your spice  
You got a kitten  
Now isn't that nice  
You just can't wait for a picnic in Spring  
I just get nauseous  
When I think of those things  
You wait and wait and you wait for a lifetime  
For a little piece of cake in the night time yeah  
You wait and wait you can't wait any longer  
You wait and wait, couldn't be any wronger no  
Give it up  
Don't let it get you down  
Give it up  
you really really blew it  
Give it up  
Turn your head around  
You shop around for a sensible car  
You hold your breath when you wish on a star  
You settle down in a warm little house  
You make some babies with your warm little spouse  
Ah, how nice  
You wait and wait and you wait for a lifetime  
For a little piece of cake in the night time yeah  
You wait and wait you can't wait any longer  
You wait and wait, couldn't be any wronger no  
Give it up  
Don't let it get you down  
Give it up  
you really really blew it  
Give it up  
Turn your head around  
Just when you got it made  
And all your bills are paid  
You stumble and fall into your grave  
Ah, too bad  
You wait and wait and you wait for a lifetime  
For a little piece of cake in the night time yeah  
You wait and wait you can't wait any longer  
You wait and wait, couldn't be any wronger no  
Give it up  
Don't let it get you down  
Give it up  
you really really blew it  
Give it up  
Turn your head around
