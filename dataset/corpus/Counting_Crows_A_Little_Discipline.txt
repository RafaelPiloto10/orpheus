This time is better than last time  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can lock you up inside  
This time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can bring you down sometimes  
This time I got some other ideas  
But I don't want them to hear  
No, I don't want them to hear  
And it may not seem like a sensible scheme  
But I think I'd really like to die  
Into the pit of my desire or a bed of fire tonight  
"Oh no, this is the last time,  
Honey" she whispers in my ear  
But every time I look at her she disappears  
Ahh, this time is better than last time  
I feel better today  
And the music can plays and the elevator sways  
But I don't really feel like dancing'  
Because elevator dreams never really have much of a beat  
She says, "Oh no, this is the last time,  
Honey, we just wanna calm you down.  
You have nothing to fear,  
We will get you out of here."  
But every time I look at her she disappears  
Oh, this time is better than last time  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can twist you inside out  
This time I think you busted the bubble  
And I feel much better today  
A little discipline can mess you up inside  
This time I feel I need a little lift  
And I feel like I am a razor  
And I feel like I am a razor  
And the TV pans and the elephants dance  
And the nurse looks like she's angry  
So the pills slide down in the septic town tonight  
She says "Bad boy, just like the last time,  
Honey" and bites me on the ear  
But when I turn to look at her she disappears  
Oh, this time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel much better today  
And the elevator dreams with the hobby horse scream  
I feel like I'm going' home  
But the nurse says "Son, you're going' nowhere tonight"  
She says "Oh no, this is the last time  
Sonny, we're gonna have to tie you down  
'cause you gotta see clear to be getting out of here"  
But then every time I look at her she disappears  
Oh, this time I feel a little bit...  
But I feel better today  
A little discipline can take you out sometime  
This time, I feel I might be better  
I feel much, much better today  
A little discipline can turn you inside out  
This time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel better today  
A little discipline can fuck you up inside  
This time I feel a little foggy  
A little discipline can weigh you down sometimes  
I'm dreaming, underground  
A little discipline can suffocate your mind  
This time, I'm flying home  
A little discipline can drive you into the ground  
This time I think you she'd a little light  
I feel much better today  
A little discipline can lock you up inside  
A little discipline can lock you up
