You keep pushing me away  
In spite of what you say  
I found out yesterday that I've  
Been wasting all my time  
  
Trying to make you smile  
Trying to make this seem worthwhile  
You've been pushing me around  
In spite of what I do  
Trying to make things good for you  
  
Take your economy car and your suitcase  
Take your psycho little dogs  
Take it all away  
  
You've been racing through my mind  
You're picking up in speed  
You're driving recklessly  
It's like a car crash happening on my street  
  
Broken bodies at my feet  
And sirens on the way  
  
They're too late  
'Cause nobody's going to save us  
We're a rubbernecker's dream  
We're burning gasoline  
  
Go  
Take your economy car and your suitcase  
Take your psycho little dogs  
Take it all away  
  
And go  
Go ahead and destroy this  
Better come with an army  
Are you feeling, feeling okay, baby?  
  
Uh huh  
Na na  
Na na, na na, na  
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na  
  
Take your economy car and your suitcase  
Take your psycho little dogs  
Take it all away
