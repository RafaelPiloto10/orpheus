I used to trust nobody  
Trusting even less their words  
Until I found somebody  
There was no one I preferred  
  
My heart was made of stone  
My eyes saw only misty gray  
Until you came into my life  
I saw everyone that way  
  
Until I found the one  
I needed at my side  
I think I would have been  
A blind man all my life  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
  
I used to walk alone  
Every step seemed the same  
This world was not my home  
So there was nothing much to gain  
  
Look up and see the clouds  
Look down and see the cold floor  
Until you came into my life  
I saw nothing, nothing more  
  
Until I found the one  
I needed at my side  
I think I would have been  
A blind man all my life  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
(Shine, shine, shine)  
I think I see the light  
(Shine, shine, shine)  
  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
So shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
  
I think I see the light  
Coming to me, coming through me  
Giving me a second sight  
  
So shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine  
  
Shine, shine, shine  
(I think I see the light)  
Shine, shine, shine  
(I think I see the light)  
Shine, shine, shine  
(I think I see the light)  
  
Keep on shining  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light  
I think I see the light
