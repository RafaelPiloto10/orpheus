See what the world's done? Came to london  
She's a nothing, a no one, she's undone  
Broken dreams, stolen freedom  
Trapped in the night, trafficked and beaten  
All a part of an evil economy  
Nothing more than someone's commodity  
A precious being like you and me  
A daughter, a sister, a somebody!  
  
She was drawn by the bright lights  
She was tied up in their lights  
She worked right through the daylight  
No voice, she's a slave to the night  
  
27 million like me  
(That's 27 million on this cruel journey)  
  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
  
After the man left, she's nothing left  
No one, no love, no one to call her friend  
She's stuck in the pit of hell  
She's almost sick from the smell  
She's numb, she's dead from the inside out  
Her heart is screaming but you don't hear the shout  
Who's the voice? Who's gonna break the door down?  
Who wakes her up from the nightmare now?  
  
She was drawn by the bright lights  
She was tied up in their lights  
She worked right through the daylight  
No voice, she's a slave to the night  
  
27 million like me  
(27 million need heaven's mercy!)  
  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
  
27 million, are you joking?  
How did we let evil get so tight a grip  
Watching while the world falls apart?  
How did we let this stuff begin?  
We're not bothered if this offends  
Cause you got people that can depend  
But they ain't got that, they got nothing  
Sometimes you gotta stand for something  
Let this be the stand against your blood running  
  
Little girl don't cry  
Let me dry your eyes in the darkest night  
(You're not alone)  
Hold on through the storm  
You're not on your own  
Hold on, love will come  
  
We've got to rise up, open our eyes up  
Be her voice, be her freedom, come on stand up!  
[Repeat until end]
