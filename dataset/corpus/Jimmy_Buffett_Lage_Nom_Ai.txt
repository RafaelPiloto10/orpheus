Verse  
NORDSTROM WAS A SIMPLE MAN  
WHO HATCHED A NON-CONFORMIST PLAN TO SAVE HIS ASS  
EVERY NIGHT HE DANCED ALONE  
AND BLOTTED OUT THE MONOTONE THAT WAS HIS PAST  
HE PACKS HIS BAG OF MYSTERIES  
AND LEAVES THE LONELY MEMORIES WHERE THEY BELONG  
THEY CAME AND WENT SO EASILY  
THIS RISING TIDE IDENTITY, SINGS LIKE A SONG  
  
Chorus  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT LIFE IS JUST A GAME  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME  
  
Verse  
IN THE ROLL OF COSMIC DICE  
YOU WIN ONE HEART AND LOSE IT TWICE, BEFORE YOU KNOW  
LOVE IS FINE UNTIL YOU TASTE  
THIS MELANCHOLY BOUILLABAISSE CALLED LETTING GO  
  
Chorus  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT LIFE IS JUST A GAME  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME  
  
Verse  
HE MOVED ON UP TO OLD BEAN TOWN  
AND SUMMERED ON THE VINEYARD SOUND, TO PASS THE DAY  
ISLAND HOPPING, CRAB CAY BOUND  
TENDING BAR HE THINKS HE'S FOUND A BETTER WAY  
NOW WERE BACK WHERE WE BELONG  
WITHOUT A CLUE AND STILL WITHOUT A MASTER PLAN  
INCIDENT OR ACCIDENT  
IT ALL DEPENDS ON IF YOU'RE MEANT TO UNDERSTAND  
  
Chorus  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT LIFE IS JUST A GAME  
LAGE NOM AI-NOM AI  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME  
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE UP HIS OWN NAME
