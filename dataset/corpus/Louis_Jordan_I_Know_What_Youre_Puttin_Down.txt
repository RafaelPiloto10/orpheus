There's a whole lot of talk around town, about the way you carryin' yourself  
You're jivin' everybody in town, but baby, I know what you're puttin' down  
Everybody's tryin' to dig you baby, everybody but me  
Everybody's tryin' to dig you, everybody but me  
You're foolin' everybody in town, but baby, I know what you're puttin' down  
You went out last night, to a dinner, a show and a dance  
Ooh you went out last night, to a dinner, a show and a dance  
You must have been a perfect clown, but baby, I know what you're puttin' down  
You got a ramblin' mind, just don't wanna stay at home  
Yes baby you got a ramblin' mind, you just don't wanna stay at home  
You tell me you're visitin' all your relatives in town, but baby, I know what
you're puttin' down  
You came home last night with a new hat, new dress, and a new pair o' shoes  
Yes you came home at eight o'clock last night with a new hat, a new dress, and
a new pair o'shoes  
You ain't working nowhere in town, so baby, I know what you're puttin' down.
