You're playin' around with money and fear  
And a power you can't control  
And the zimmermen grin their perjured grins  
Sayin': there's no risk at all !  
Look into the eyes of the next generation  
I know you would never dare  
You're layin' the tracks  
Of the ultimate sin  
Like himmler and you don't care  
It only takes a few words  
It only takes a few  
To cut a long story short  
It only takes a few words...  
Oh my how it hurts..!  
Look into the eyes of the next generation...  
Look into the eyes of the next generation...  
Yor orders filtered through the ranks  
Intentions you can't hide  
With tightened lips  
You're sinking ships  
In the shadows of the night  
You presidents of genocide  
You ministers of crime  
You're laughing at your firemen  
From miles behind,  
From miles behind the lines..!  
It only takes a few words  
It only takes a few  
To cut a long story short  
It only takes a few words...  
Oh my how it hurts..!
