Oh well, it's long gone, long gone  
You got my baby and you're long gone  
But I'll be a hangin' around  
I know you're gonna put her down  
She'll need someone that's true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find you're long gone, long gone.  
  
You just wandered into town  
Took her and you started messin' around, with my baby  
You stole her heart 'cause she ain't used to your kind.  
With your fancy clothes and your uptown style  
It didn't take you but a little while to get your way  
'Cause your pretty little lies she couldn't see behind.  
  
And now it's long gone, long gone  
You got my baby and you're long gone  
But I'll be a hangin' around  
I know you're gonna put her down  
She'll need someone that's true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find you're long gone, long gone.  
  
Well, a man in me would like to fight  
To take you down by the river tonight  
And rearrange your face  
But that would make her hate the site of me.  
  
So there's nothing left for me to do  
Standin', watchin' that, the likes of me  
Hurt the girl I love while she's too much  
In love with you to see.  
  
Oh well, it's long gone, long gone  
You got my baby and you're long gone  
But I'll be a hangin' around  
I know you're gonna put her down  
She'll need someone that's true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find you're long gone, long gone
