I don't want to fall in love  
But it's been taken out of my hands  
And right now I realize  
I don't want to say goodbye  
  
I miss you more than words can say  
They never turn out right  
But here goes anyway  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
But somethin's got a hold of my heart  
It hurts that I can't let go  
Now I just want to let you know  
  
I need you more than words can say  
They never turn out right  
But here goes anyway  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds  
  
If I ever get myself together  
And it takes whatever it takes  
To get myself back to you  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds
