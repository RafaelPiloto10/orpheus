We just wrote this song on the bus the other day so just sit back and relax  
  
I'm the 7 foot man,  
I've committed no crime,  
Bumping my head into doorways,  
It happens all the time,  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
And I repeat,  
They don't make a ski boot that can fit my feet,  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
And I don't play basketball,  
  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
But I'm still just a man,  
So of course it hurts me a lot,  
When I walk into the ceiling fan,  
Small people say I wish I was him,  
But its been nine years since I've had a trim,  
The barber says,  
I can't reach the top of his head,  
  
7 foot man,  
(ha ha)I cannot hide,  
7 foot man,  
I know cause I've tried,  
7 foot man,  
My last girlfriend died,  
Because my penis,  
Is 7 foot wide!!!!!!!!!  
  
So the next time you see me,  
Walking around,  
And my head is right about to hit a tree branch,  
Tell me to duck down,  
And I'll pay you back ,  
Soon you will see,  
By getting you frisbee down from that tree,  
I do what i can,  
I'm the 7 foot man,  
  
7 foot man,  
7 foot man
