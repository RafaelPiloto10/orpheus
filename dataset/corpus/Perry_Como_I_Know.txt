( I Know, I know, oh yes, I know! )  
I know what it means  
To be lost in the dark!  
I know what it means  
To be tossed by the storm!  
I have walked alone  
With a heart of stone  
And despair too heavy for tears,  
But you caught my heart  
And you taught my heart  
To forget it's doubts and fear!  
And now that I know  
The joy of your love  
My head is high, I can face the sky  
And know that heaven is here below,  
I know . . .  
For you I could die,  
For you I will live,  
I know!  
( I Know, I know, I know! )
