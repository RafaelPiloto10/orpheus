Wake up in the morning, my hands cold in fear.  
And midsummer new york my heart shakes in terror.  
My heart, my hands, my legs, my mind,  
Evrything I touch is shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking,  
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, oooh.  
  
Wake up in the morning, my beds wet in sweat.  
And midsummer new york, scream in the mirror.  
And the door, and the chairs, and the floor, and the ceiling,  
Evrything you see is aching, shaking, shaking, shaking,  
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, oooh.  
And you shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, oooh.  
  
Wake up in the morning, my minds dried up in pain.  
Midsummer new yorks waiting for the rain.  
The window, the trees, the park, the sun,  
The whole world s shaking, is shaking, shaking,  
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, oooh.  
  
Shake, oh, shake, oh, shake,  
Shake, oh, shake, shake.  
Aching, aching, aching, aching, aching,  
Oh, its aching, aching, aching, oh, aching,  
Aching, aching, oh, its aching, aching, oh, oh.  
  
Shaking, shaking,  
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake!  
Shake, oh, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake, shake, shake.  
  
Shake, shake,  
Shake, shake, shake, shake.  
  
Ooh, oh, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, aching, oh, oh, aching, aching, aching, aching.  
Shake, shake, shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking,  
Shaking, ooh, oh, shaking, oh, shake,  
Oh, oh, shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking,  
Oh, oh, shaking, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake, shake, shake,  
Shake!  
  
Oh, oh, oh, shake, shake.
