She was forty-one and her daddy still called her baby.  
Everyone in Brownsville thinks she's crazy,  
'cause she walks to the station with a suitcase in her hand.  
And she's looking for a mysterious dark-haired man.  
  
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn.  
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on.  
But a man of low degree stood by her side,  
And he promised he would take her for his bride.  
  
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?  
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?  
Did I hear you say he was meeting you here today  
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

To take you to his mansion in the sky?

Delta Dawn, oh, what is that flower that you've got on?  
Could it be, could it be just a faded rose from one of those days gone by?  
Well, did I her you say  
That he was gonna meet you right here, right here today?  
He's gonna take you to his mansion in the sky.  
To take you to his mansion in the sky.
