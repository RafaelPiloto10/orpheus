I was watching the news tonight  
And all over the world  
People were singing and carrying signs  
All over the world  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
Through cities that I've been  
And though I'm not there tonight  
You know I'll be back again  
I'll be back again, I'll be back again  
I'm on a plane tonight for Germany  
And all over the world  
There are lots of people just like you and me  
All over the world  
Who know the bomb must never fall again  
All over the world  
And we must all learn how to live as friends  
All over the world  
All over the world, all over the world  
We are making the news tonight  
All over the world  
Because we know that what we do is right  
All over the world  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
All over the world  
Through the streets of Europe and Japan  
All over the world  
All over the world, all over the world
