Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
I've lost all your love so I can't understand  
Are you holding on to just show me you can  
This grip you'll have on me is as tight as it can be  
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
Staying here unwanted will be the death of me  
Needing love that you won't give me so desperately  
It's more than I can stand let me go for I still can't  
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
Got no place to go but I'll go anyway  
If I go I'll cry and I'll cry if I stay  
I still love you can't you see and I don't want to be free  
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me  
Staying here unwanted will be the death of me...
