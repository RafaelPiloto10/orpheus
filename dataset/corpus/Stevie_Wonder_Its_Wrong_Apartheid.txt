The wretchedness of Satan's wrath  
Will come to seize you at last  
'Cause even he frowns upon the deeds you are doing  
And you know deep in your heart  
You've no covenant with God  
'Cause he would never countenance people abusing  
You know apartheid's wrong, wrong  
Like slavery was wrong, wrong  
Like the holocaust was wrong, wrong  
Apartheid is wrong, wrong, wrong  
It's wrong, wrong, wrong , wrong  
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong  
The pain you cause in God's name  
Points only to yourself to blame  
For the negative karma you will be receiving  
'Cause when people are oppressed  
With atrocities that test  
The future of all mankind we  
The world won't stand seeing  
You know apartheid's wrong, wrong  
Like slavery was wrong, wrong  
Like the holocaust was wrong, wrong  
Apartheid is wrong, wrong, wrong  
It's wrong, wrong, wrong , wrong  
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong  
Ubuqaba babo bucacile  
Woqamba kuze kucace  
Ngoba nosathane uyabugxeka  
Lobuqaba
