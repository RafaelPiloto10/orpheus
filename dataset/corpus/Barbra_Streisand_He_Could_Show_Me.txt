He could show me things I've never dreamed of,  
Things I've never thought of before.  
He could show me what I've missed, baby,  
Somewhere there is something more.  
I've never been there, I might get lost at sea.  
I think he's been there and he could show me.  
Could he tell me why the days were empty?  
Days I wasted waiting for tomorrow.  
Some other time, some other place,  
Some other world, some other face,  
He could show me, he could show me.  
  
[Backing Singers:]  
He could show me what I've missed, baby,  
Somewhere there is something more.  
  
[Barbra:]  
I've never been there, I might get lost at sea.  
I think he's been there and he could show me.  
Could he tell me why the days were empty?  
Days I wasted waiting for tomorrow.  
Some other time, some other place,  
Some other world, some other face,  
He could show me, he could show me.  
  
[Backing Singers:]  
He could show me, he could show me, he could show me...
