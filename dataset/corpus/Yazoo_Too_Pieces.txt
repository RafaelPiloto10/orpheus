Write me a letter a face in the hall  
Hiding from someone afraid of the fall  
And she's waiting for someone to take her back to where she came from  
And she'll wait alone for hours she won't mind because there's someone  
In the story she remembers she remembers in the letter  
And the tears locked up inside her make her heart break open wider  
Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall
