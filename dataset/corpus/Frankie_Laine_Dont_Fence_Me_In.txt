Oh, give me land, lots of land, under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through that wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me be by myself in the evenin? breeze  
An' listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don?t fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
And I can't look at harbours and I can't stand fences  
Don?t fence me in  
  
(Oh, give me land, lots of land, under starry skies above,)  
(Don?t fence me in.)  
(Let me ride through that wide open country that I love:)  
(Don?t fence me in.)  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
An' listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don?t fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
An' gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
An' I can't look at harbours and I can?t stand fences  
So don?t fence me in, oh no  
Now brother, don?t you fence me in
