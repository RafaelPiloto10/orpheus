Life is like a mountain railway, with an engineer that's brave  
We must make the run successful, from the cradle to the grave,  
Heed the curves and hills and tunnels, never falter never fail,  
Keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the rail.  
  
[Chorus]  
Blessed Savior, thou will guide us,  
Till we reach that blissful shore,  
Where the angels wait to join us,  
In God's praise for evermore.  
  
As we roll along the mainline, they'll be storms and they'll be night,  
They'll be sidetracks unexpected, on the left and on the right,  
But with the straight always before us, and our hearts upon the prize,  
They'll be no disembarkation until we reach paradise.  
  
[Chorus]
