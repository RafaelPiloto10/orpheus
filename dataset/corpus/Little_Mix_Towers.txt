[Leigh-Anne]  
You turn, and I learn that the wall comes falling down  
Not a word, only heard what my friends could tell me now  
I feel love when I see your face  
But all these scars, I can't replace  
Shocked me hard, hit me hard,  
And I don't know what to say  
  
[Perrie]  
When you knock on my door  
And tell me you don't wanna fight  
Oh, baby I'm sure that I'm not gonna fall this time, oh  
  
[Jesy]  
You never brought me flowers  
Never held me in my darkest hours  
And you left it so late  
That my heart feels nothing, nothing in towers  
Once we were made like towers  
Everything could've been ours  
But you left it too late  
Now my heart feels nothing, nothing at all, oh oh oh oh  
  
[Jade]  
It's a shame, you're to blame  
'Cause once you owned my heart  
I remember feeling so high  
But I'm right back at the start  
I still feel love when I see your face  
But all these tears I can't erase  
Sorry heart, I'm sorry heart  
But we'll have to start again  
  
[Perrie]  
So don't knock on my door and tell me you don't wanna fight  
'Cause I heard it before and I'm not going back this time  
Not going back this time  
  
[Jade]  
Oh, you never brought me flowers  
Never held me in my darkest hours  
And you left it so late  
That my heart feels nothing, nothing in towers  
Once we were made like towers  
Everything could've been ours  
But you left it too late  
Now my heart feels nothing nothing at all,  
  
[All]  
Oh oh oh oh  
Nothing at all, oh oh oh  
  
[Leigh-Anne]  
When you're close, I wanna change my mind  
But I remember you and what we're like  
I don't wanna let you waste my time  
  
[Jesy]  
And you never brought me flowers  
Never held me in my darkest hours  
And you left it so late  
That my heart feels nothing, nothing at all  
  
[Perrie]  
Once we were made like towers  
Everything could've been ours  
But you left it too late n  
Now my heart feels nothing, nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Nothing at all  
  
[Jesy]  
Once we were built like towers  
Nothing at all  
We were built like towers  
Now my heart feels nothing at all
