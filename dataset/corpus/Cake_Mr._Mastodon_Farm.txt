Then they flap their wings at the last second.  
  
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.  
  
Then they flap their wings at the last second.  
  
I can see their dead weight  
  
Just dropping like stones  
  
For small loaves of bread  
  
Past my window all the time.  
  
But unless I get up  
  
Walk across the room  
  
And peer down below  
  
I don't see their last second curves  
  
Toward a horizontal flight.  
  
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.  
  
Now due to a construct in my mind  
  
That makes their falling and their flight  
  
Symbolic of my entire existence,  
  
It becomes important for me  
  
To get up and see  
  
Their last second curves toward flight.  
  
It's almost as if my life will fall  
  
Unless I see their ascent.
