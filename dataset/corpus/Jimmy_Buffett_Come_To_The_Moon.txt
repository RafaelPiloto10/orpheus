There's a full earth tonight  
And Mars is big and bright  
And all our friends are flying in  
It's such a lovely sight  
Gravity never could hold me  
That is what you always told me  
  
So come to the moon  
I hope to see you soon  
Half a million miles isn't far to go  
You know I need you so  
So come to the moon  
The starship's leaving soon  
Until then I'm just wishing on every star  
You will be here real soon  
Come to the Moon  
  
Those crazy Martian days  
We went our separate ways...  
Time and space we'll find a place  
To bring our lives in phase  
We're lost amid the galaxies revolving  
And we're all just a part of what's evolving  
Evolving  
So come to the moon
