I don't know what I'm doing tonight,  
But that's alright  
I don't know what I'm doing with my life  
But that's fine  
I don't know what were singing tonight  
And that's alright  
  
I don't konw what I'm singing about now  
Cause the years are young  
Feel like I can learn alot if I openup my eyes  
But I'm just fine (fine)  
  
And ill never cry again  
And ill never lie again  
Cause I don't want to be a falling star in you eyes  
And ill never cry again  
  
I don't know what today will bring to my life  
But that's just fine  
I got my bags packed,  
I'm leaving home for the very first time  
I can't fucking wait  
  
And ill never lie again  
And ill never cry again  
Cause I don't want to be a falling star in your eyes  
And ill never lie again  
  
Oh no I'm going out tonight  
And the kids are alright  
Well lordy dear  
His life is bright  
And ill open up my eyes  
  
Its 12 oclock where are your kids tonight  
Theyre doing just fine, doing fine tonight  
Its 1 where are your kids tonight  
They're doing just fine, doing fine tonight  
  
I left you a note  
I let you know I love you  
And I'm going out tonight  
But I'm be just fine  
Don't worry your heart

I'm never gonna crush  
Any bone in your frame  
Aint got in my mind  
But I'm going out tonight  
And I'm doing just fine

And I don't fall so never worry about me no more
