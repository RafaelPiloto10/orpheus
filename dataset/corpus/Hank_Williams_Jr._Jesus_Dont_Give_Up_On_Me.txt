Jesus I know I've neglected to do the little things the big things you wanted
me to  
I've let you down Jesus that's not hard to see Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on
me  
Stand by me Jesus forgive me somehow if there's any hope left don't leave me
now  
I might be worth saving I'm trying to be Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me  
  
It's late I know and I've made you wait  
But don't turn the light out don't lock the gate  
Forgiveness and patience that's all I need Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me  
Stand by me Jesus...
