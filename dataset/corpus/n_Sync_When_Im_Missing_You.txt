Sunday morning time to say goodbye  
But I'll be holding you soon  
Though I'm leavin', girl don't start to cry  
I'll be thinkin' of you.... Yeah  
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train  
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again  
How can I say when my words ever dry  
How can I smile with the tear in my eye  
Summer's so lost with rainin' in June  
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you  
Oh yeah, baby, oooh  
Now time and healin'  
Another week come by  
Girl it feels like years, hmmm...  
I've been callin' every day and night  
How I wish you were here, ooh yeah..  
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train  
I'm countin' down the days 'til I'm home again  
How can I say when my words ever dry  
How can I smile with the tear in my eye  
Summer's so lost with rainin' in June  
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you  
I never met a girl who is so this sweet  
Can't wait to see you again, oohh  
I never had a love that was so complete  
And you know that I'll be dreamin' 'til then  
Oooooh, baby...  
I said the time is now, baby...  
How can I say when my words ever dry(how can I say)  
How can I smile with the tear in my eye(tear in my eye)  
Summer's so lost with rainin' in June  
That's how it feels when I'm missin' you  
Wooh yeah baby.. (how can I smile)  
I said yeah, I said I'm missing you..(ooohh)  
Summer's so lost when it's rainin' in June(aaahhh)  
That's how it feels (that's how it feels)  
When I'm missing you
