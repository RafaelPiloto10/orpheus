Drones since the dawn of time  
Compelled to live your sheltered lives  
Not once has anyone ever seen  
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy  
I'll instigate I'll free your mind  
I'll show you what I've known all this time  
  
God hates us all, god hates us all  
You know it's true god hates this place  
You know it's true he hates this race  
  
Homicide-suicide  
Hate heals, you should try it sometime  
Strive for peace with acts of war  
The beauty of death we all adore  
I have no faith distracting me  
I know why your prayers will never be answered  
  
God hates us all, god hates us all  
He fuckin' hates me  
  
Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark  
Global chaos feeding on hysteria  
Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game  
Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high  
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time  
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies  
  
I never said I wanted to be god's disciple  
I'll never be the one to blindly follow  
  
Man made virus infecting the world  
Self-destruct human time bomb  
What if there is no god would you think the fuckin' same  
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith  
Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say  
I got my own philosophy  
  
I hate everyone equally  
You can't tear that out of me  
No segregation separation  
Just me in my world of enemies  
  
I never said I wanted to be god's disciple  
I'll never be the one to blindly follow  
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple  
  
I reject this fuckin' race  
I despise this fuckin' place
