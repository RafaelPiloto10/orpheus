When we got together  
We were drowning in the touch  
You kept things to yourself  
And didn't say too much  
I let you have your silence  
'Cause I thought you needed time  
But now I want to stop  
Tryin' to read between the lines  
I can't wait forever  
One side needs to know  
The feelings of the other  
Before they know their own  
Every night  
You take your silence to bed  
Every day  
The same words go on never said  
And tonight  
We'll do it all over again  
You've touched my life forever  
But we'll never really start  
Every time you turn on the light  
My heart's in the dark  
Heart's in the dark  
You can have your secrets  
A part of you that's yours  
But you want me in your life  
And need to know what for  
Help me get around it  
'Cause we're more than passing ships  
I see it in your eyes  
Let me hear it from your lips  
Every night  
You take your silence to bed  
Every day  
The same words go on never said  
And tonight  
We'll do it all over again  
You've touched my life forever  
But we'll never really start  
Every time you turn on the light  
My heart's in the dark  
Heart's in the dark  
Our love is a broken rage  
And I'm drowning in my doubts  
It may sound like I'm angry  
But I'm only reaching out  
And time won't change  
What I'm goin' through only you can do that  
If you want me now to stay with you  
Then bring the reason back  
And tonight  
Don't take your silence to bed  
Every day  
Don't let those words go unsaid  
And tonight  
We'll start it all over again  
Baby touch my life forever  
Let me know you want to start  
'Cause every time you turn on the light  
My heart's in the dark  
And tonight  
Don't take your silence to bed  
And today  
Don't let those words go unsaid  
And tonight  
We'll start all over again  
Baby touch my life forever  
Let me know you want to start  
'Cause every time you turn on the light  
My heart's in the dark
