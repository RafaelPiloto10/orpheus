The storm is coming but I don't mind.  
People are dying, I close my blinds.  
All that I know is I'm breathing now.  
  
I want to change the world, instead I sleep.  
I want to believe in more than you and me.  
But all that I know is I'm breathing.  
All I can do is keep breathing.  
All we can do is keep breathing  
Now I, now I  
Now I, now, now  
  
All that I know is I'm breathing.  
All I can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]  
  
All we can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]  
Now
