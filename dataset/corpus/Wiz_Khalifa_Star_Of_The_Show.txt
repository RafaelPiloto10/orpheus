Yeah  
Ugh  
Ugh  
Ugh  
  
See I've been going on and on forever  
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never  
Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather  
And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella  
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own  
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along  
When I was sixteen, finna get put out my home  
Now the man make the money, my nigga, my money grown  
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on  
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on  
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown  
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone  
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong  
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song  
Party every weekend, hardly ever home  
Don't get a chance to see me face to face  
So you have to talk about me when I gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay away from the fake or phony (phony)  
Niggas who can't support their role  
So keep hatin' me from the crowd  
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-ow  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)  
  
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up  
And all my jewelery ice age the piece froze up  
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up  
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us  
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us  
Get you to buy a drink than its over cous'  
We back around the time that she sober'd up  
But shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up  
The best moments of my life  
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life  
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife  
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice  
It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'  
Like "where did all my paper go"  
Roll some more weed and get medicated  
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Niggas losing their roles  
Can't play they positions (play they positions)  
One day they down for the team (team)  
Next day they missin' (Next day they missin')  
Same ones was all in the front  
Supposed to be there for support (there for support)  
And half the time it's the ones you care for  
Fuck you here for, huh?  
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
They wanna be a big shot, only number one  
Everybody wanna be a superstar  
Big shot, only number one  
But everybody wanna be the star though  
Ugh  
The money come, the money go  
And when it come down to it  
That's something niggas with real money should know  
We partied a lot, and drank  
Now they don't talk to me  
Started off not so great, now I'm on top of things  
  
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same  
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame  
I see the bigger picture on the wall in the frame  
Spent a couple of days on team making it rain  
I was cool but, I was thinking ocean views  
Polo trunk shades on and boat shoes  
Cantox lick oil, my nigga I ain't slippin'  
You won't star me out, ugh bad transmission  
So if for the better, yeah a nigga different  
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twistin'  
Mattress money put up 'cause now my money different  
You got a lot to say, but they ain't never tried to listen  
Record all night in the studio in the morn  
Playin' back when we did, now tell me is that wrong  
Crack the Rose, pop a top or two  
And toast to what this hard work got us to
