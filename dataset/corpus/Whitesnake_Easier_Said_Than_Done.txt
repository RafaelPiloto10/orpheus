You've got my love to keep you warm  
Give you shelter from the storm  
Any time you need  
Through the long and lonely night  
You got me to hold you tight  
My love is guaranteed  
You're everything I'm waiting for  
Now I don't have to look no more  
  
Take me as I am  
I'll do the best I can for your love  
It's easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
It's easier said than done  
Sometimes I swim against the tide  
When I know you're by my side  
There ain't nothing I can't do  
Baby my heart's an open book  
Anytime you wanna look  
'Cause it's written just for you,oh whoa  
You're everything I'm waiting for  
Now I don't have to look no more  
  
Take me as I am  
I'll do the best I can for your love  
It's easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
It's easier said than done  
  
You're everything I've waited for  
Now I don't have to look no more  
You're everything I want you to be  
Baby, baby won't you stay with me  
  
Take me as I'm  
I'll do the best I can for your love  
It's easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done  
It's easier said than done
