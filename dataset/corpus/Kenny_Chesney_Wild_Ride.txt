I walked in, there sat Slim  
Cleaning up his memory with some sapphire gin  
Mr. Pain grabbed my arm and pulled me aside  
And said kid are you ready for the wild ride  
  
I looked up, there she stood  
I say, didn't look so great, I say you look good  
Aww she took her hand ran it up my thigh  
And said, cowboy you ready for the wild ride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on now junior take a wild ride (wild ride)  
See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Things start breakin' on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Yes it does  
  
Out on the highway, I saw my mind  
In tiny little pieces blown from side to side  
My heart was shattered along with my pride  
Guess you can't keep 'em on the wild ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was crawling cross the floor, I was tryin' to leave  
When I felt something tugging what was left of my sleeve  
I heard a little voice with a gold plated vibe  
Say I bought a ticket for the wild ride  
  
[Chorus x2]
