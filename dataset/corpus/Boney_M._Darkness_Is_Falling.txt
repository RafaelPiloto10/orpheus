When darkness is falling and shadows grow long  
It's time for the children to sing this old song  
It tells of the coming of wonders untold  
Forgotten is winter, its fury and cold  
  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
  
When darkness is falling and shadows grow long  
It's time for the children to sing this old song  
It tells of the coming of wonders untold  
Forgotten is winter, its fury and cold  
  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
When darkness is falling and stars fill the sleigh  
The waiting is over and we all know why  
It's time for celebrating and having a feast  
  
Because of the tidings that come from the east  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow
