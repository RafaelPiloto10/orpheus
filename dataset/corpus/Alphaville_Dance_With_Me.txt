When the heat of light melts into the speeding time  
When the king returns to the ivory cityside  
Let the Magnet Mages wave the signals  
Flashing oh so fast  
Then you'll meet me there under the moonshine  
In a lover's heaven, we'll keep our promises at last  
In a lover's heaven we'll forget the past  
Do you want to dance with me  
Through one of those lonely nights  
It's more than a dream  
Maybe we're reaching the gardens of delight  
Do you want to dance with me  
Through one of those lonely nights  
It's more than a dream  
Maybe we're drowning in empires of delight  
  
In the stardust dawn underneath the crystal roofs  
Where the solar boys are playing games  
They never lose  
Where the sailors are swaying  
Through the lightdomes shining in the sky  
There you'll meet me, darling, anyway  
In a lover's heaven, we'll keep our promises at last  
In a lover's heaven we'll forget the past
