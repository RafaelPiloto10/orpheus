Found a head and an arm in da garbage can  
Don't know why I'm here  
Livin' on the run for oh so long  
I gotta go collect  
Double talkin' jive  
Get the money motherfucker  
'Cause I got no more patience  
Double talkin'  
I got (Lies)  
No more patience man  
  
Back in town an'a all new friends  
They sayin' how ya been?  
Fucked up and outta place  
That's how I felt back then  
Double talkin' jive  
Get the money motherfucker  
'Cause I got no more patience  
Double talkin'  
I got (Lies)  
No more patience man  
You dig what I'm sayin'?
