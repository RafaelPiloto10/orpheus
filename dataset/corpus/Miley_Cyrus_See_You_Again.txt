I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim  
I have a heart that will never be tamed  
I knew you were somethin' special when you spoke my name  
Now I can't wait to see you again  
  
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right  
I feel like I must have known you in another life  
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes  
Now I can't wait to see you again  
  
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down  
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout  
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me  
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"  
  
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself  
My heart it can't rest 'til then  
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again  
  
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside  
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night  
I'm not a mind reader but I'm readin' the signs  
That you can't wait to see me again  
  
The last time I freaked out, I just kept lookin' down  
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout  
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me  
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh she's just being Miley"  
  
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself  
My heart it can't rest 'til then  
Ooh whoa whoa I, I can't wait to see you again!
