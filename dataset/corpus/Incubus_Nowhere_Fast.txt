Will I ever get to where I'm going?  
Will I ever follow through with what I had planned?  
  
I guess it's possible that I have been a bit distracted  
And the directions for me are a lot less in demand  
  
Will I ever get to where I'm going?  
If I do, will I know when I'm there?  
If the wind blew me in the right direction  
Would I even care?  
  
I would  
I take a look around  
It's evident the scene has changed  
And there are times when I feel improved upon the past  
Then there are times when I can't seem to understand at all  
And yes it seems as though I'm going nowhere  
Really fucking fast
