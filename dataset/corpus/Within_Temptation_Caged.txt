These are the darkest clouds  
That have surrounded me  
Now I find myself alone  
Caught in a cage  
There's no flower I can find in here  
Not withering, not pale to me  
  
Everyone with a friendly face  
Seems to hide some secret inside  
  
He told me he loved me  
While he laughed in my face  
He just led me astray  
He took my virtue  
I feel so cold inside  
Sorrow's frozen my mind  
  
My heart is covered  
With thoughts entangled  
How could I ever have felt so real  
Is there a place more lonely  
Than I feel within  
Could I have seen  
Could I have known  
I just took it as the truth  
  
Everyone with a friendly face  
Seems to hide some secret inside  
  
He told me he loved me  
While he laughed in my face  
He just led me astray  
He took my virtue  
I feel so cold inside  
Sorrow's frozen my mind  
  
Always there to remind me  
It keeps me from believing  
That someone might be there  
Who'll free me and never ever leave me  
  
He told me he loved me  
While he laughed in my face  
He just led me astray  
He took my virtue  
I feel so cold inside  
Sorrow's frozen my mind
