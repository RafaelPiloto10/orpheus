No, I'm not making that promise again  
Nothing can change my mind  
Nothing at all  
'cause love has a way of comin' undone  
'till I'm all alone with my heart  
And here I'll stay  
And I always thought I'd see you again  
Oh how it hurts, every time you've crossed my heart since then  
Gonna give it all it takes  
To hold what might have been,  
But I always thought I'd see you again  
Now there's no reason to run for the phone  
No need to hold my breath  
Hopin' it's you  
Each time I see someone we used to know  
Or go some place we used to go  
It's not the same  
'cause I always thought I'd see you again  
'oh how it hurts every time  
You've crossed my heart since then  
Gonna give up all it takes  
To hold what might have been cause I always thought I'd see you again  
Love doesn't come when you need love  
It's not always there when you fall  
Try as you may, you got nothin' to say  
Nothing at all  
I always thought I'd see you again  
Oh how it hurts every time  
You've crossed my heart again  
Gotta give it all it takes  
To hold what might have been  
Cause I always thought I'd see you again  
Cause I always thought I'd see you again  
Again  
Again
