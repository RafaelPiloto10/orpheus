With the moon and the sun in his eyes  
He's arriving  
And I don't know what I'd do without him  
I got life suddenly  
  
See, see me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
  
I'm leaving my heart in the palm of his hand  
So gently  
I know he knows that I love him  
Though I've never said is there an easy way  
  
See, see me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
  
Coming home  
I'm coming home  
It feels like I'm coming home  
Coming home  
I'm coming home  
  
See, see me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me I've got nothing to hide  
See, see me
