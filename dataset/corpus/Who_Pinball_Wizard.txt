Ever since I was a young boy,  
I've played the silver ball.  
From Soho down to Brighton  
I must have played them all.  
But I ain't seen nothing like him  
In any amusement hall  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!  
  
He stands like a statue,  
Becomes part of the machine.  
Feeling all the bumpers  
Always playing clean.  
He plays by intuition,  
The digit counters fall.  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!  
  
He's a pin ball wizard  
There has got to be a twist.  
A pin ball wizard,  
S'got such a supple wrist.  
  
How do you think he does it? I don't know!  
What makes him so good?'  
  
He ain't got no distractions  
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,  
Don't see lights a flashin'  
Plays by sense of smell.  
Always has a replay,  
'N' never tilts at all  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball.  
  
I thought I was  
The Bally table king.  
But I just handed  
My pin ball crown to him.  
  
Even on my favorite table  
He can beat my best.  
His disciples lead him in  
And he just does the rest.  
He's got crazy flipper fingers  
Never seen him fall  
That deaf dumb and blind kind  
Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!
