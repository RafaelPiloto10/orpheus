Hey little Donna, sweet little Donna I know  
You wanted my love and I gave it to you.  
Hey little Donna, sweet little Donna you know  
Goodbye is hello, 'cause I'm on the road.  
  
Take it easy, don't get me wrong,  
Just keep me in your dreams.  
Take it easy, life goes on  
My little backstage queen.
