True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, oh, is the thing  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
Long days spent on the edge of space  
Oh, maybe someone will come along, love  
All day with every familiar face  
Oh, tells me you're very very wrong, love  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love, true love  
True love, true love  
Oh, true love  
This dance could never be true enough  
Oh, there's more than lead us to our destiny  
Entranced, we traveled, the two of us  
Oh, and I knew that only you could rest the world for me  
I live deep in the heart of things  
Feel such a part of things  
That remind me of you, love  
And I know whatever the future brings  
Wherever the pointer swings  
There will always be true love, you love  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love is the answer to, to everything  
True love is the answer, true love is the thing  
True love, yes, that's the answer to, to everything  
It's the answer, it's the thing  
True love, it's the answer to everything  
It's the answer, it's the thing  
True love
