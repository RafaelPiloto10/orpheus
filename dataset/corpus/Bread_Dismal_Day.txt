Dismal Day  
  
I look into my morning mirror  
And it reveals some things to me that I had not been able to see  
I saw someone that I'm not sure I want to be  
An empty lonely face was starin' back at me  
  
All and all, I would have to say  
It's been a rather dismal day  
  
The afternoon was slow in coming  
I drug myself  outside the people that I knew would be there  
And though they walked along pretending not to care  
I knew behind my back they'd point and laugh and stare  
  
CHORUS  
  
And now the evening shadow's falling  
I guess it's best I lay my hopes to rest for no one's calling my name  
I sit and wait behind a door that's never knocked on  
I live in silence like my phone that's never talked on  
  
CHORUS
