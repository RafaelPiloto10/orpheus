Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why  
  
I read the story about a week ago  
They found her on the beach that night  
They thought the light had gone out of her eyes  
and no-one thinks she'll ever be right  
She was so full of her life  
Happy with the people she knew  
But then no-one can tell  
  
Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why  
  
Guess all they found were some marks in the sand  
A message saying 'She is mine'  
Nobody touched her as she got in the car  
Well nobody dares to anytime  
She was so full of her life  
The girl that everybody once knew  
But now no-one can tell  
  
Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why  
  
And when they read a story out to the judge  
I heard they had to turn away  
It's all over town  
  
I saw her face in the back of a car  
As they were speeding out of town  
She's got a mark on the side of her face  
that no-one's ever seen around  
And what she is or what she's become  
I guess the town will never know  
  
Child come away  
It's the girl with the deputy walking by  
Child go and play  
No I won't give you reasons so don't ask why
