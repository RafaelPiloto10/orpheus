Only when you travel  
Very deep inside yourself  
Can you recognise the stranger  
You've become  
And suddenly you're standing  
On your own  
Far from Home  
Far from Home  
And when we're face to face  
Look in my eyes  
And when we're face to face  
Tell me no lies  
You know we need help  
And I'm with you  
All of the way  
All of the way  
All of the way  
Only love can take a man  
And turn him inside out  
Time to turn the page and start  
A whole new story now  
Once again we're standing  
On our own  
With far to go  
With far to go  
With far to go
