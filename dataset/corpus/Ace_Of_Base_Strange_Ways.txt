I've got strange ways  
But it won't take long my friend  
I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be gone  
  
I've got strange ways but  
It won't take long my friend  
I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be back  
  
Again I've got no one  
But it won't take long my friend  
I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be gone (I'm telling you someday I'll be gone)  
  
God bless you for being  
By my side when I fell through  
You could hear me you've got  
Internet gateways through my world  
God bless you I'm feeling all the  
  
Force you're closing in  
Take it easy  
You dock at my side when  
I'm on fire  
I've got strange ways  
  
Sometimes I lose it (I lose)  
Don't know where I'm going (don't know)  
But I do hope you follow  
All the way  
  
God bless you for being  
By my side when I fell through  
You could hear me  
You've got Internet gateways  
Through my world  
You don't know it  
You're turning all this stone into a heart  
I can see you  
As you're fighting the fire  
When I burn  
I've got (I'm telling you someday baby  
I'll be gone, back)
