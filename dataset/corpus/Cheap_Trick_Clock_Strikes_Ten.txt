Clock strikes ten it's a Saturday night  
Got money in my pocket and it feels allright  
Not stayin' home gonna stay out late  
Gotta hear some rockin' music and it feels just great  
  
Clock strikes twelve on a Saturday night  
All the creeps are sleepin' all the cools in sight  
All the kings and queens, they're out tonight  
Lookin' for some action 'til I feel allright  
  
Imagine what we're doin' tonight  
You really got me goin' tonight  
Imagine what we're doin' tonight  
I'm crazy for some action tonight  
  
Clock strikes two out all night  
All my money's spent but that's allright  
Not goin' home gonna stay out late  
Get ready for some action want some action tonight  
  
Imagine what we're doin' tonight  
You really got me goin' tonight  
Imagine what we're doin' tonight  
I'm crazy for some action tonight  
  
Clock stikes four I want some more  
Everybody's layin' on the floor  
Not goin' home gonna stay out late  
Gotta hear that rockin' music it feels allright  
  
Imagine what we're doin' tonight  
You really got me goin' tonight  
Imagine what we're doin' tonight  
I'm crazy for some action tonight
