I'm gonna pack my bags and drive all night  
I'll be in the mountains by morning light  
Drive the road I traveled years ago  
As a young girl leaving home  
  
With dreams as big as the trees were tall  
I knew I'd have nothing or I'd have it all  
And you all know what happens when the bright lights call  
You're either gonna make or you're gonna fall  
Make it or you're gonna fall  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a dream chaser, a star gazer that's what I am  
But I've always known I'd come back home when I found my rainbows end  
Rainmakers and heart breakers could never change my plans  
Dream chaser, that's what I am  
  
I'm goin' home where the stars shine bright in a mountain sky  
That path above I've followed all of my life  
It's guiding me back to where my dreams began  
Then I'll be gone again  
I'll be gone again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dream chaser, that's what I am
