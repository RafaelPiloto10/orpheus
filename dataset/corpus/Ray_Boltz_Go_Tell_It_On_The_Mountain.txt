[CHORUS:]  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]  
  
While shepherds kept their watchin  
Oer silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]  
  
Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And brought us Gods salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn  
  
[CHORUS (repeat 5X)]
