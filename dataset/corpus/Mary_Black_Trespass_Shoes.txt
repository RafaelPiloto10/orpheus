When I see you coming  
In your trespass shoes  
Hear the song you're humming  
How can i refuse  
With your half drunk bottle  
And your slurring tongue  
Singing sentimental  
Don't it always make me feel so young  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
When the push comes down to shoving  
When the four winds blow  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
  
Now my heels are snagging  
On these pavement stones  
Days and nights are dragging  
'Til I get you home  
With your four o'clock shadow  
and your cowboy songs  
Singing sentimental  
Don't it always make me feel so strong  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
Push comes to shove and worse for better  
when the four winds blow  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
  
With your forehead furrowed  
And your facts all wrong  
Oh so temperamental  
Oh but baby when it's said and done  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
Push comes to shove and worse for better  
Only goes to show when the four winds blow  
  
Been alone  
We've been together  
Stood at toe to toe  
Getting older doesn't matter when lights down low  
Push comes to shove and worse for better  
Only goes to show  
  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do  
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
