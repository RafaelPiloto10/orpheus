Savior, my savior  
Pouring out over desert sands  
Through parched skin  
And madness.  
  
On chamber after chamber  
'Till it's all run out  
But oh, my savior  
My Savior.  
  
You said: remember  
You said: remember, remember,  
When you're all dried out  
That which was sacred  
That which was sacred  
Remember...  
  
Savior, my savior  
Pouring out over desert sands  
Through parched skin and madness  
On chamber after chamber  
Parched skin and madness.
