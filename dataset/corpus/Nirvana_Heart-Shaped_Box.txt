She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak  
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks  
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap  
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black  
  
Hey!  
Wait!  
I've got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Wait!

Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice  
  
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet  
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath  
Broken hymen of your Highness, I'm left back  
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Forever in debt to your priceless advice
