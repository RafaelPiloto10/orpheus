The days with you were endless summers  
The rains would come but we didn't seem to care  
Then before I knew  
I fell in love with you  
It felt so real, I wondered if you feel it too  
For many nights I stayed awake 'til morning  
Wond'ring how to ask if you cared  
Then to my surprise  
The love I had inside  
Was something that you didn't seem to share  
REFRAIN:  
I have to say goodbye  
Guess it's time to end it  
Say goodbye  
It's the only way  
Much as I want to cry  
There simply is no reason why  
It's hard for me  
But still I've got to try  
If love for you cannot be with me  
There's really nothing more to say  
Remember whoever may come to share my life  
You'll always have a special place inside  
(Repeat Refrain twice)  
I've got to try  
Woh ... Wooh ...  
Goodbye
