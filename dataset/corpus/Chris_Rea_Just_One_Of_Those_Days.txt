Cold red sunsets that freeze the rainbows out  
Standing here in the rain  
I've been thinking how, how much happier  
I have been since you came  
Staring down at the sidewalk shining  
Satin winds floating down  
Change the crystals on ladies faces  
I think I'll stick around  
Laden gutters, flowing over  
Hit the streets and explode  
Young girls laughing and make up streaming  
Go running down the road  
I've been thinking and too much drinking  
And things I just don't dare to say  
It's still raining but who's complaining  
It's just one of those days
