It started out when she was small  
She was premature  
She wasn't nothing at all  
Two pounds six ounces  
A little pumpkin seed  
But she got more love  
Than you ever gonna need  
  
[Chorus]  
She got big fat love  
She got big fat love  
  
She don't eat enough  
To keep her alive  
When she bends over  
She's a quarter to five  
Skinny little thing  
But she ain't afraid  
To dance the Watusi  
On a razor blade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tiny little hands  
Tiny little nose  
Tiny little footsteps  
Wherever she goes  
Little bit don't leave  
No bath rub ring  
You pull the plug  
She's down the drain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She got big fat love  
  
Bigger than me  
Bigger than you  
Bigger than the hippo  
Down at the zoo  
Thin is in  
Stout is out  
Big fat love  
Is what I'm talking about  
  
[Chorus: x2]
