We'll meet again,  
Don't know where,  
Don't know when  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day  
Keep smiling through,  
Just like you always do  
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away  
  
So will you please say "Hello"  
To the folks that I know  
Tell them I won't be long  
They'll be happy to know  
That as you saw me go  
I was singing this song  
  
We'll meet again,  
Don't know where,  
Don't know when  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day  
  
We'll meet again,  
Don't know where  
Don't know when.  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.  
Keep smiling through  
Just like you always do,  
'Til the blue skies  
Drive the dark clouds far away  
So will you please say"Hello"  
To the folks that I know.  
Tell them it won't be long.  
They'll be happy to know  
That as you saw me go,  
I was singin' this song.  
  
We'll meet again,  
Don't know where,  
Don't know when  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
