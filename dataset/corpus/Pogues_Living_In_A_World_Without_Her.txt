My girl could break my heart  
And tear my soul apart  
Couldn't see myself living in a world  
Without her  
She's a tear, she's a scream  
Takes me high but my worst dream  
Could I survive living in a world  
Without her?  
My mommy said open the door  
I didn't want to be that boy  
All my friends told me I'd pull through  
But all that's said and all that's done  
Won't persuade me that I'm wrong  
I know I'd die living in a world  
Without her  
All my hopes and all my dreams  
Rest with her or so it seems  
I never want to see the world  
Without her  
She's a saint, she's a clown  
Picks me up when I'm down  
There'd be so much missing from the world  
Without her  
Tangled up in falling vines  
She took my hand, I know she's mine  
Pickin' up the pieces of the past  
Well, I awoke before the dawn  
Dreamed we'd fought and she had gone  
Now I know how it feels  
Without her  
An empty club, when we first met  
Sharing our last cigarette  
How could I have lived in a world  
Without her  
The sweetest girl I ever had  
She's the best, she must be mad  
There's no way I living in a world  
Without her  
We walked four miles to get back home  
Through the crowds we walked alone  
She told me all about her last stand  
The sun came up and lit the scene  
She looked so fine, so I see  
There's no way I'm living in a world  
Without her  
There ain't no way I am living in a world  
Without her  
There's just no way I am living in a world  
Without her
