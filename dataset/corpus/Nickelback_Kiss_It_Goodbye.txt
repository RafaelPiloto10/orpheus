Hollywood is plastic, but easy on the eyes.  
Big Apple is fantastic, but cuts you down to size.  
  
They'll treat you like a doormat, expecting you to fail.  
Says right across your forehead, integrity for sale.  
  
You'll be on TV when it starts to snow in hell.  
Bet you wish you heard about it.  
Bet you wish you heard about it.  
You won't believe me, so go and see it for yourself.  
  
From Mexico to New York.  
Blondes from California.  
East Coast takes the cocaine, West Coast marijuana.  
Don't be surprised when you swallow more than pride.  
It's tough to see through bullshit when it's up above your eyes.  
  
Kiss is goodbye,  
  
Stealing comes with practice, lying comes with ease.  
But neither one is faster then falling to your knees.  
  
Money leads to fame and fame is the disease.  
The latest epidemic, reality TV.  
  
You'll be on TV when it starts to snow in hell.  
Bet you wish you heard about it.

You won't believe me, so go and see it for yourself.

Kiss it goodbye.  
Kiss it goodbye.
