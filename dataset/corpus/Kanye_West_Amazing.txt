It's amazing  
I'm the reason  
Everybody fired up this evening  
  
I'm exhausted  
Barely breathing  
Holding on to what I believe in  
  
No matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)  
  
I'm a monster  
I'm a killer  
I know I'm wrong, yeah  
  
I'm a problem  
That'll never  
Ever be solved  
  
And no matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a monster  
I'm a maven  
I know this world is changin'  
  
Never gave in  
Never gave up  
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of  
  
No matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'  
  
I'm amazin'  
Yeah I'm all that  
If i ain't on my grind  
Then what you call that?  
  
Victorious  
Yeah we warriors  
We make history  
Strive for victory  
Standing at my podium  
I'm trying watch my sodium  
Die high blood pressure  
You even let the feds get cha!  
I'm amazin'  
Born on the full moon  
I was bred to get in  
No spoon  
That's why I'm so goose  
Summer time, no juice  
Big family, small house no rooms  
They like oh god!  
why you go so hard?  
Look what he's been through  
He deserves an applause  
  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' [Repeat: x3]
