Dear mother the struggle is over now  
And your house is up for sale  
We divided your railway watches  
Between the four of us  
I fought over the pearls  
With the other girls  
But it was all a metaphor  
For what was wrong with us  
As the room is emptying out  
Your face so young comes into view  
And on the back porch is a well-worn step  
And a pool of light you can walk into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you, forever  
Like a river  
  
Can you clear up the mystery of the Sphinx?  
Do you know any more about God?  
Are you dancing with Benjamin Franklin  
On the face of the moon?  
Have you reconciled with Dad?  
Does the rain still make you sad?  
Last night I swear I could feel you  
Moving through my room  
And I thought you touched my feet  
I so wanted it to be true  
In my theater there is a stage  
And a footlight you can step into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you, forever  
Like a river  
  
In the river I know I will find the key  
And your voice will rise like the spray  
In the moment of knowing  
The tide will wash away my doubt  
'Cause you're already home  
Making it nice for when I come home  
Like the way I find my bed turned down  
Coming in from a late night out.  
Please keep reminding me  
Of what in my soul I know is true  
  
Come in my boat, there's a seat beside me  
And two or three stars we can gaze into  
  
I'll wait no more for you like a daughter,  
That part of our life together is over  
But I will wait for you forever  
Like a river  
  
I'll never leave, always just a dream away  
A star that's always watching  
Never turn away  
We'll never leave, always just a thought away  
A candle always burning  
Never turn away  
The moon will hide, the tree will bend  
I'm right beside you  
I'll never turn away
