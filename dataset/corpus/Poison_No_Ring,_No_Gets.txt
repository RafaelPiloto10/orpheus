Lately boy, your head ain't right  
And nothing seems to thrill you  
Word on the streets is  
No sex no more 'cause, it'll kill you  
  
You touch, she bites,  
You push, she shoves  
Then she yells in your ear  
No glove, no love  
Oh, it ruined the mood  
But you know she's right  
When the biggest talks and the littlest walks  
You better learn how to walk the walk  
  
[Chorus]  
As far as I can see  
It's really no big mystery  
It's the same old story  
No ring, no gets  
It ain't the boat you float  
It's the motion in the ocean and I quote:  
Before you start pumping that feul without your jets  
No ring, no gets  
  
This feeling coming over you  
It's a variable strength of emotion  
You keep thinking your smooth  
Start making your move  
But your lady starts causin' commotion  
  
You want to round the bases  
She knows that's for sure  
But Miss Palm and her five sisters  
Don't cut it no more  
You know tonight you'd like to buy her a kite(?)  
But the wind ain't blowing you got that right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Woman hold the lock  
A man's known that for years  
You're going up inside to persuade that key  
Could bring a man to tears  
  
Your gun is loaded  
You got her right in sight  
About to pull your trigger  
When the girl pulls out the lights  
  
But keep your cool don't make a scene  
Cause her ?  
?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
But you won't find (repeat)..  
Spoken: Shut Up!
