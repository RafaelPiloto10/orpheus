I'm a fool to care  
When you treat me this way  
Whoa, I love you so  
But, darling, I know  
I'm a fool to care  
  
I'm a fool to cry  
Since you told me goodbye  
Oh, you can't be true  
So what can I do  
I'm a fool to care  
(I'm a fool to care)  
  
I know I should laugh, ha ha  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
I'm a fool to care  
When you don't care for me  
Why should I pretend  
I know I'll lose in the end  
I'm a fool to care  
  
I know I should laugh  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
I'm a fool to care  
When you don't care for me  
So why should I pretend  
I'll lose in the end  
Oh, I'm a fool to care
