Time on your side that will never end  
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend  
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it  
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic  
  
It don't matter to me  
'Cause all I wanted to be  
Was a million miles from here  
Somewhere more familiar  
  
Too much time spent dragging the past up  
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up  
Settling down in your early twenties  
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist  
  
It don't matter to me  
'Cause all I wanted to be  
Is a million miles from here  
Somewhere more familiar  
  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
  
Great rulers make for greater glory  
The only thing growing is our history  
Knock me down, I'll get right back up again  
I'll come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man  
  
It don't matter to me  
'Cause all I wanted to be  
Was a million miles from here  
Somewhere more familiar  
  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from home  
And oh my God, I can't believe it  
I've never been this far away from
