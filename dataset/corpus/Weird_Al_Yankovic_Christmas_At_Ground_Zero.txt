It's Christmas at ground zero  
There's music in the air  
The sleigh bells are ringing and the carolers are singing  
While the air raid sirens blare  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
The button has been pressed  
The radio just let us know that this is not a test  
Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping  
It's the end of all humanity  
No more time for last minute shopping  
It's time to face your final destiny  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
There's panic in the crowd  
While we dodge debris let's trim the tree  
Underneath the mushroom cloud  
  
You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop  
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill  
But if someone's climbing down your chimney  
You better load your gun and shoot to kill  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
And if the radiation levels OK  
I'll go out with you and see all the new  
Mutations on New Year's Day  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
Just seconds left to go  
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover  
Underneath the mistletoe  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
Now the missiles are on their way  
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked  
On this jolly holiday  
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked  
On this jolly holiday
