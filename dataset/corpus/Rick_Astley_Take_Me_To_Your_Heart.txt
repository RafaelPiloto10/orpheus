Are we lovers  
Or only just friends?  
Come tomorrow.  
Will I be lonely again?  
When you see me  
Is it love in your eyes?  
What's your feeling  
Deep down inside?  
  
Do you think about me (think about me)  
When I'm far away?  
Do you dream about me? (dream about me).  
Can I find a way  
To make you want me (make you want me)  
The way that I want you?  
'Cause I think I love you (think I love you).  
Could you love me too?  
  
[Chrous:]  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
If you knew what I'm feeling,  
You would not say no.  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
For your love, for your love  
Is all I need to know.  
  
Can you tell me  
When you look at me  
If you need me?  
In all honesty.  
Because I'm certain  
As sure as can be:  
I'd make you happy  
Eternally.  
  
'Cause I think about you (think about you)  
When you're far away.  
And I dream about you (dream about you)  
Night and day.  
Can I make you want me (make you want me)  
The way that I want you?  
Cause I think I love you (think I love you).  
Could you love me too?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
If you knew what I'm feeling  
You would not say no.  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
For your love, for your love,  
Is all I need to know.  
  
'Cause I think about you (think about you)  
When you're far away.  
And I dream about you (dream about you)  
Night and day.  
Can I make you want me (make you want me)  
The way that I want you?  
'Cause I think I love you (think I love you)  
Could you love me too?  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
If you knew what I'm feeling  
You would not say no.  
Take me to your heart,  
Never let me go.  
For your love, for your love,  
Is all I need to know.
