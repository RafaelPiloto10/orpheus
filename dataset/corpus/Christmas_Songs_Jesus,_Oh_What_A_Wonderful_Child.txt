Jesus, Jesus  
Oh  
What a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
New life, new hope  
New joy He brings  
Won't you listen  
To the angels sing  
Glory, glory, glory  
To the new born King  
  
Jesus, Jesus  
Oh  
What a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
New life, new hope  
New joy He brings  
Won't you listen  
To the angels sing  
Glory, glory, glory  
To the new born King  
  
He was herald  
By the angels  
Born  
In a lowly manger  
The virgin Mary  
Was His mother  
And Joseph  
Was his earthly father  
Three wise men  
Came from afar  
They were guided  
By a shining star  
To see King Jesus  
Where He lay  
In a manger  
Filled with hay  
  
Jesus, Jesus  
Oh  
What a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
Oh new life, new hope  
New joy He brings  
Won't you listen  
To the angels sing  
Glory  
To the new born King  
  
Oh, Jesus  
Jesus  
Mary's baby  
Lamb of God  
Heavenly Child  
Jesus  
Jesus  
I Love Him  
  
Oh, Jesus  
All Mighty God  
King of kings  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus  
Wonderful  
Wonderful one  
  
Oh, oh  
Oh, Jesus  
Oh, Jesus  
Son of God  
Oh, Jesus  
Glory  
To the new born King  
Yeah
