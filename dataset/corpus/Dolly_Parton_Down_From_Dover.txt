(Dolly Parton)  
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing  
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing  
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of
clover  
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover  
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground  
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown  
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over  
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home
place  
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face  
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her  
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down
from Dover  
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady  
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby  
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover  
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover  
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me  
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me  
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over  
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover  
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying  
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no
crying  
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold
her  
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from
Dover, from Dover  
Down from Dover
