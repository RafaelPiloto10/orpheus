Yesterday as I finished the last of the seven graves  
I went to call McKenzie  
I woke him up in the middle of the night  
You should have heard me... SURPRISE!  
  
Oh revenge is sweet  
  
Up and awake, McKenzie knew that I was still alive  
And I have to tell you  
He is the Mayor of this God forsaken town  
He's Lucy's father, the man that brought me down  
  
He is such a sick little man  
He's so much sicker than me, and I am  
  
Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates  
Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead  
  
Revenge is sweet  
Revenge is sweet, I know that you agree  
  
Call me sick in the head, but I would never lie to you  
I worked for the man  
Mayor McKenzie is an old perverted swine  
I caught him one night, molesting his own little child  
  
Who do you think they all believed?  
  
He is such a sick little man  
He's so much sicker than me, and I am  
  
Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates  
Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead  
  
McKenzie did you hear me?...No Lucy, she is fine  
She's sleeping in her coffin  
Can't wait to meet your face again  
  
He is such a sick little man  
He's so much sicker than me, and I am  
  
Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates  
Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead
