"Affection not dissection,  
Meat is murder,  
Animals are for petting."  
Oh shut the fuck up already.  
  
I'm tired of you whining,  
About poor little animals dying,  
And the food they are supplying.  
Because if a big animal had the chance,  
It wouldn't take another glance,  
It would eat you up.  
  
"Affection not dissection,  
Meat is murder,  
Animals are for petting."  
Oh shut your trap already.  
  
I don't want to listen,  
And I'm tired of your bitchin,  
About what's in my kitchen.  
Because if a big animal had the chance,  
It wouldn't take another glance,  
It will eat you up.
