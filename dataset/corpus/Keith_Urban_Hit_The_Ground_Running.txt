Well, if you ever said goodbye I wouldn't waste all of my time cryin'  
I wouldn't sit home alone wonderin' where I went wrong  
I'd be rockin' on outta of here baby faster that a rollin' tear  
Ain't no grass gonna grow under me when you're gone  
No, I won't stay down for long  
  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I know exactly what I'd do, honey  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you, yeah  
  
Gonna stop in long enough for a couple of things I gotta pick up  
Like some pretty red flowers and a store bought card  
That say what I really feel, that I'll need you and I always will  
And the three little words that used to come hard  
Then I'd jump in back in my car  
  
Then I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I know exactly what I'd do, honey  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you, yeah  
  
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud  
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do  
I'd hit the ground, hit the ground  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you, yes I would  
  
So if you gotta go baby I won't stop you  
And I won't sit around and miss you, no, no, no  
'Cause if you leave I'm comin' with you, yeah  
Comin' with you baby  
  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I know exactly what I'd do, sugar  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground runnin'  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you  
  
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud  
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do  
I'd hit the ground, I'd hit the ground  
I'd hit the ground runnin' after you
