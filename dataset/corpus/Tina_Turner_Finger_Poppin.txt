I used to jump when you called  
And I would cry when you leave  
I had to plan every move  
Just to keep you pleased  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I don't care no more  
About nothing you do  
Now I'm goin' shoppin'  
Finger, fingerpoppin' on you  
  
I got bags under my eyes  
From losin' sleep  
You gave me malnutrition  
'Cause I just couldn't eat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You never bought me no clothes  
I had to steal what I wear  
I wore shoes so long  
'Til my feet were bare  
  
[Chorus]
