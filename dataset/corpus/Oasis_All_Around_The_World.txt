It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me  
To go through all the things that I want to be  
I don't believe in everything I see  
You know I'm blind so why'd you disagree  
  
Take me away 'cause I just don't want to stay  
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day  
These are crazy days but they make me shine  
Time keeps rolling by  
  
All around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You're gonna make a better day  
All around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You know it's gonna be okay  
  
Whatcha gonna do when the walls come falling down  
You never move, you never make a sound  
Where you gonna swim with the riches that you found  
You're lost at sea, well, I hope that you drown  
  
Take me away 'cause I just don't want to stay  
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day  
These are crazy days but they make me shine  
Time keeps rolling by  
  
All around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You're gonna make a better day  
And all around the world  
You've gotta spread the word  
Tell 'em what you've heard  
You know it's gonna be okay
