Send me away  
I'm here on my own  
Hammer, stutter now  
Lets rock, lets roll now  
  
She says I'm obsessed  
I say I'm in love  
Oh, Me  
You've done it now  
Now send me a way out  
I feel insecure  
And Desperate  
But not right now  
I feel it now  
And you don't see  
The way I see  
I've got it now  
I'm desperate  
  
Desperate  
Desperate  
  
I'm better off like this  
I'm better off  
I'm better off like this  
  
Don't you know I care  
No, no  
  
Desperate  
Desperate  
Desperate  
Desperate  
  
I'm better off like this  
I'm better off  
I'm better off like this  
Don't you know I care  
No, no  
  
I wish I was myself  
Again  
I wish I was myself  
Again.
