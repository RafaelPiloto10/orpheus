My mouth is dry  
My legs are weak  
I'm thinkin' this 'cause I can't speak  
I'm lookin at you lookin' at me  
You must think that I'm just crazy  
  
If you only knew what you're putting me through!  
There's that heart attack!  
You're givin' me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're givin' me a heart attack!  
I must have died and gone to heaven  
What a way to go!  
  
I can't catch my breath  
It must be a dream  
But you're the cutest thing I've ever seen  
I'm way past the point of recovery  
You're gonna be the death of me  
  
If you only knew what you're putting me through!  
There's that heart attack!  
You're givin' me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're givin' me a heart attack!  
I must have died and gone to heaven  
What a way to go!  
A heart attack, you're giving me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're giving me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're giving me a heart attack!
