Once it was just innocence  
Brash ideas and insolence  
But you will never get away  
With the things you say today  
  
But you can try if you want  
  
Don't you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said  
Many many years ago when life appeared rosy red  
No one ever shared your bed  
Nothing ever filled your head  
Except yourself and little Ted  
And scary dreams that you were dead.  
Don't you want to hide your face  
When going through your teenage books  
And read the kind of crap you wrote  
About "ban the bomb" and city crooks  
Think about how long it took  
To get over that sudden "Yuk"  
When in the mirror you would look  
Well now my son you're well in stook  
  
Cry if you want, cry if you want  
  
Didn't you writhe in anger when you saw the man in his big car  
Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far  
Should have been a famous star  
But that ain't what you really are  
You could shout your last hurrah  
  
While they are propping up the bar  
Maybe things were better then  
Before you led a promised life  
Rash commitments and heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised  
You fall in love with other's wives  
Drive 'em nuts with empty lies  
Angry 'cause you lost the prize  
Forgot the color of their eyes.  
  
Cry if you want, cry if you want  
  
Let your tears flow Let your past go  
  
Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were  
Yesterday the day before when you were young with much to learn  
Aren't you glad it's your last term  
No more acting lowly worm  
You can make the suckers squirm  
When you tell them how much you earn  
Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you keep inside  
Does your ego save your face "I had a go - I really tried"  
Now you know your leaders lied  
Does it stop you acting snide  
Or are you still a boy that cried  
Tears now surely long since dried.  
  
Cry if you want, cry if you want
