Walkin cross a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
(Just like you Marley!)  
Walkin cross a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
I've been walkin cross a log  
I've been walkin with a dog dog dog  
(This ones for you Marley!)  
  
Walkin cross a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
(Marley this ones for you, were checking this one for you Marley!)I've been
walkin cross the log  
I've been wonderin where my dog done gone  
(Hey Marley, this ones for you man, This ones for you Marley, were singingthis
one for you!)  
  
Stepped upon a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
(Marley if you like this one roll over on your back!)  
Stepped upon a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
Stepped upon a log, walkin through the fog fog fog  
(Singing about you Marley, were singing for you!)  
  
Stepped upon a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
(Were through with discussion, were singing this one for you Marley)Dog log is
hereI knew if she was near, she was still sneezin  
(No were talking about here dog Marley)  
  
Its Holdsworth!  
Holdsworth!  
Holdsworth!  
Holdsworth!  
  
Walkin cross a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
(Time for discussion, right here before the next lyric, discussion!)  
I've been walkin with a dog, dog, dog.  
(I saw Holdsworth sittin at the table)  
  
Walkin cross a long, long, long, long, long, long, log  
(Speakin to the Lord!)  
I've been walkin cross the log  
(I ran into Holdsworth!)  
  
Walkin cross the log  
I've been wonderin where Holdsworth done gone  
Where's my dog gone?  
Where's my dog gone?  
Where's my dog gone?  
  
Gone Gone  
Gone Gone  
Gone Gone  
Gone Gone  
Gone Gone  
Gone Gone
