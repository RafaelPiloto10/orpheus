Thought you were ordinary  
Would not amount too much  
I guess they never knew you  
You found the place they couldn't touch  
  
Said you were nothing special  
Always kept to yourself  
You had to fight your own way  
There's always been touch too much at stake.  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
  
You'll never pass for someone  
Who'll find a place in life  
You'd sooner take that last breath  
To give away your heart and mind  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark
