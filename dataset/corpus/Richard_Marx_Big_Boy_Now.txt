I've been searching  
Not the first or the last  
Trying to figure out the mystery of the half empty glass  
Time is turning for the rest of the world  
While a temporary leap of faith helps the story unfurl  
  
They say that hearts don't stay broken  
Even though the scars remain  
And eyes don't stay swollen  
Even if it feels that way  
  
[Chorus]  
But it's not that serious  
I'm a big boy now  
And I'm not that delirious  
So don't show me how  
Cause I've gotten beyond the agony  
And my perspective is saving me  
  
Never doubted what the cards would reveal  
And if the joker showed his ugly face  
Not that big of a deal  
It's just a moment in the scheme of it all  
But it's difficult to visualize when the axe starts to fall  
  
But then a heart won't stay broken  
Even on it's darkest day  
The right door could open  
Pick you up and drift away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With all the confusion  
How does anybody come through  
But life is illusion  
And no one can tell you what you've gotta do  
  
You know a heart won't stay broken  
Even on it's darkest day  
The right door could open  
Pick you up and drift away
