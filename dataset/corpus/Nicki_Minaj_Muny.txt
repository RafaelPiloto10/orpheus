[Chorus]  
Oh no we don't play with silly girls  
All I know is the material girls  
Give me the muny, the cars, the case loads, the mun-mun-muny  
The Yen and the Pesos  
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny  
Yen and the Pesos  
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny  
Yen and the Pesos  
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny  
Yen and the Pesos  
The mun-mun-muny, the mun-mun-muny  
The mu-mu-mu-mu-muny, the mu-mu-mu-mu-muny, muny, muny  
  
Told y'all on Drake's sh-t, told y'all to fixate  
Bitches want my old sh-t, buy my old mixtape  
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more  
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo  
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation  
Top five tax bracket in the population  
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why  
I ain't got to wonder if I want to lease or buy  
And I dictate how I'm gon piece the pie  
I ain't talkin' about no mothafuckin' pizza pie  
'Cause I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin  
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans  
Na, homie you gon' need a bigger cock-pit  
Cause when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit  
(Aye, yo captain, aye yo cap',  
I, I don't wanna hear that navigation, baby pa'  
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to get some sleep, ya dig?)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm in the UK but just for one day  
Whose to say I won't come back again  
Materialistic I'm narcissistic,  
My shoe game is mean it's so sadistic  
I took a learjet to cop some lipstick,  
Yeah I'ma risk it, I'm optimistic  
I sip on Rose you sip your  
Mistake my flows' a biscuit short of a picnic  
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators,  
Balenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators  
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson,  
I'm on the bike doin' wheelies in a mansion  
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin',  
Gucci bag just to put the coke cans in  
(Hey, yo, Anna, hey yo Anna Wintour,  
I'ma need that cover baby girl, it's Pink Friday, ya dig)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Material, I'm always on that new sh-t  
Material, this sh-t is exclusive  
Material, material World for material girls (girls, girls, girls)  
Material, don't ever get the truth bent  
Material, I could get you the blueprint  
Material, material world for material girls (girls, girls, girls)  
  
Material, material, ma-ma-material  
Material, material, ma-ma-material  
Material, material, ma-ma-material, girls (girls, girls, girls)  
Material, material, ma-ma-material  
Material, material, ma-ma-material  
Material, material, ma-ma-material, girls
