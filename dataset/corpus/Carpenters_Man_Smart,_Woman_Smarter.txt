Let us put man and woman together  
  
And see wich one is smarter  
  
Some say man, but I say no  
  
The women got the man like a puppet show  
  
It ain't me, it's the people that say  
  
The men are leadin' the women astray  
  
But I say, that the women today  
  
Are smarter than men in every way  
  
Well, that's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
Little boy sat down and cried  
  
An old man passin' asked him why, he said  
  
I can't do what the big boys do  
  
Old man sat down and he cried too  
  
Ain't me, it's the people that say  
  
The men are leadin' the women astray  
  
But I say, that the women today  
  
Are smarter than men in every way  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
That's right, the women are smarter  
  
Well that's right, the women are smarter  
  
Smarter than man in every way
