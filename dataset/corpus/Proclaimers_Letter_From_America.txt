When you go will you send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
Well broke off from my work the other day  
Spent the evening thinking about all the blood that flowed away  
Across the ocean to the second chance  
I wonder how it go on when it reached the promised land  
When you go will send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
I've looked at the ocean tried hard to imagine  
The way you felt the day you sailed from Wester Ross to Nova Scotia  
We should have held you, we should have told you  
But you know our sense of timing we always wait too long  
When you go will you send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
Lochaber no more, Sutherland no more  
Lewis no more, Skye no more  
Lochaber no more, Sutherland no more  
Lewis no more, Skye no more  
Lochaber no more, Sutherland no more  
Lewis no more, Skye no more  
I wonder my blood will you ever return  
To help us kick the life back to a dying mutual friend?  
Do we not love her I think we all tell you about  
Do we have to roam the world to prove how much it hurts?  
When you go will you send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
Bathgate no more, Linwood no more  
Methil no more, Irvine no more  
Bathgate no more, Linwood no more  
Methil no more, Irvine no more  
Bathgate no more, Linwood no more  
Methil no more, Irvine no more  
Bathgate no more, Linwood no more  
Methil no more, Lochaber no more
