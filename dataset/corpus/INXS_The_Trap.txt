DON'T YOU WORRY, DON'T YOU WORRY  
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT  
  
WELL LIFE IS THE TRAP, BUT IT SURE TASTES GOOD  
AFAR FROM JUNK, IT AIN'T A FOOL  
  
IT'S DARK, DARK AND LONELY  
AND THERE'S NO ONE, NO ONE THERE  
  
ALL THESE DAYS ARE BETTER THAN OF it's FAIR  
DON'T YOU WORRY, DON'T YOU WORRY  
  
LIFE IS THE TRAP, IT'S COLD TO THE TOUCH  
YOU GOT DIAMOND DREAMS, IT'S COLD TO THE TOUCH  
  
IT'S DARK, DARK AND LONELY  
AND THERE'S NO ONE, NO ONE THERE  
DAYS OF ABANDON, NOTHING IS THERE  
  
LOOSING REASON, LOOSING REASON  
LOOSING REASON, LOOSING REASON TO CARE  
  
WELL LIFE IS THE TRAP, BUT SURE TASTES GOOD  
AFAR FROM JUNK THAN OF it's FAIR  
  
IT'S DARK, DARK AND LONELY  
AND THERE'S NO ONE, NO ONE THERE  
  
DON'T YOU WORRY  
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT
