So you feel that stain of dried up discussions without weight  
It's that feeling you will not have to destroy  
It's that feeling that you will not have to ignore  
The dirty walls  
So you've been plagued, but is everything okay  
I cannot bear the shallow words they throw  
It's that feeling that you will not have to employ  
It's that feeling that you will not  
It's got to go  
This conversation is going nowhere  
It's transparent as fuck  
This conversation must be over  
Because all I see is mud
