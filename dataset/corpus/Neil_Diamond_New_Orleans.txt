I said, hey hey hey, hey ya  
I said, hey, hey ya ya  
  
Well come on everybody  
Make a trip with me  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
They got the honeysuckle  
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine  
Love is bloomin' there all the time  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
  
You know that any Southern belle  
Is a Mississippi Queen  
  
Hey hey hey hey ya  
Hey hey ya ya  
  
Well come on everybody  
Take a stroll with me  
We gonna listen to the music  
With a Dixieland beat.  
They got the magnolia blossoms fill the air.  
If you ain't been to heaven  
You ain't been here  
Now all the French moss hangin'  
From a big oak tree.  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans.  
  
Hey hey hey hey ya  
Hey hey ya ya  
  
Well let's go everybody  
Take a trip with me.  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans.  
They got the honeysuckle  
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine.  
They got love bloomin' there all the time.  
You know that any Southern belle  
Is a Mississippi Queen.  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans.  
  
Well, come on,  
You got it  
We gonna dance, going to New Orleans.  
That's the place  
I said, come on  
Come on, come on, come on
