Everything was wonderful when you were in my life.  
Yesterday we were on a roll, baby, then we end up in a fight.  
Everywhere I look, I see problems, where I never seen before.  
The cracks in the sidewalk, when I get home my key don't even fit the door.  
  
[Chorus:]  
The moon don't shine, it's broken down.  
The clouds are crying, they're broken down.  
The car won't start, it's broken down.  
And this shattered heart, it's broken down.  
My whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
  
Stepped outside into the night, I took a walk around the block.  
I stopped by the church that I used to go inside but even that door was
locked.  
So I came back home, feeling so alone, a light had burned out in the hall.  
My TV is broke, said I'm out of smoke, there's no one I can even call.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said my whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
  
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.  
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I mean my whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
My whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, it's broken down.
