Illume says the candle that I burn  
A reflection in the window  
All the way to Point Dume  
Illume, like it dances  
I am a cliff dweller  
From the old school  
  
I like the coastal cities  
I like the lights  
I like the way the ocean blends  
Into the city at night  
It's like living on a working river  
The coastline is glittering  
Like a diamond snake  
In a black sky  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
I will not take you for granted  
I wouldn't trade you for jade  
Or for diamonds  
Not for one minute  
Not for anything  
I need you to be there  
Just remember when I am haunted  
That I was just so scared  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
I saw history go down  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
It's just like a river  
Ooh, it's never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Because it's just like a river  
It's never ending  
It's just like a river  
It's never ending  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
I saw history go down  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
It's just like a river  
Ooh, it's never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
I'm alone now  
With my thoughts  
Of how we could make it  
Of how we could get out  
What we've been through  
All of the trauma  
The smell of Nag Champra  
Shadow of a stranger  
  
What I saw on this journey  
Is what legends are made of  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
It's just like a river  
Ooh, it's never ending  
I cannot pretend  
That the heartache falls away  
  
Because it's just like a river  
It's never ending  
It falls away  
Like a river  
It's never ending
