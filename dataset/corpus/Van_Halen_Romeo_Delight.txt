I told her, never in hell, no special reason.  
Must a lied 'cause I ain't leavin'.  
We're in for a very long night.  
Heard a vicious rumor from your mama's tongue:  
You a desp'rate woman, need a man with a gun.  
High crime zone in the city of lights.  
Baby, please!  
Can't take it anymore.  
Baby, please!  
Can't take it anymore.  
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight,  
And I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze.  
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight.  
Baby, don't get uptight.  
Baby, please!  
Want to see my I.D.? Try to clip my wings!  
Don't have to show you proof of anything.  
I know the law friend.  
At the 'leventh hour. I'm goin' back outside.  
Give it a try.  
I'm your last loose end.  
Baby, please!  
Can't take it anymore.  
Baby, please!  
Can't take it anymore.  
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight  
And I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze.  
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight.  
Baby, don't get uptight.  
Baby, please!  
I feel my heart beat,  
Feel my heart beat,  
Feel my heart beat,  
Oh yeah.  
Baby, please!  
Can't take it anymore.  
Baby, please!  
Can't take it anymore.  
I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight,  
And I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze.  
I ain't lookin' for somebody to fight.  
Baby, don't get uptight.  
Baby, please!  
Loss of Control  
Mayday!  
I checked it out. I think you ought to know.  
I'm only wastin' time. I think I'd better go.  
You way too civilized. Oh,  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Baby, I checked it out. I think you ought to know.  
I'm only wastin' time. I think I'd better go.  
You way too civilized. Oh,  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!  
Baby, I checked it out. I think you ought to know.  
I'm only wastin' time. I think I'd better go.  
You way too civilized. Oh,  
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control!
