[Gavroche enters.]  
  
Gavroche  
Liar!  
Good evening, dear inspector  
Lovely evening, my dear.  
I know this man, my friends  
His name is Inspector Javert  
So don't believe a word he says  
'Cause none of it's true  
This only goes to show  
What little people can do!  
  
And little people know  
When little people fight  
We may look easy pickings  
But we've got some bite  
So never kick a dog  
Because he's just a pup  
We'll fight like twenty armies  
And we won't give up  
So you'd better run for cover  
When the pup grows up!  
  
Grantaire  
Bravo, little Gavroche, you're the top of the class!  
  
Prouvaire  
So what are we going to do  
With this snake in the grass?  
  
Enjolras  
Tie this man and take him  
To the tavern in there  
The people will decide your fate  
Inspector Javert!  
  
Various Students  
Take the bastard now and shoot him!  
Let us watch the devil dance  
You'd have done the same Inspector  
If we'd let you have your chance!  
  
Javert  
Shoot me now or shoot me later  
Every schoolboy to his sport  
Death to each and every traitor  
I renounce your people's court!  
  
Combeferre  
Though we may not all survive here  
There are things that never die  
  
Grantaire  
What's the difference? Die a schoolboy  
Die a policeman die a spy!  
  
Enjolras  
Take this man, bring him through  
There is work we have to do!  
  
[Javert is bundled away as the first shots ring out. Eponine enters, wounded.]  
  
Joly  
There's a boy climbing the barricade!  
  
Marius  
Good God! What are you doing?  
'Ponine, have you no fear?  
Have you seen my beloved?  
Why have you come back here?  
  
Eponine  
Took the letter like you said  
I met her father at the door  
He said he would give it  
  
[She collapses]  
  
Don't think I can stand any more.  
  
Marius  
Eponine, what's wrong? I feel...  
There's something wet upon your hair  
  
[There is blood on his hands]  
  
Eponine, you're hurt  
You need some help!  
Oh God, it's everywhere...
