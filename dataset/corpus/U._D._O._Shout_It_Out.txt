Why are you so frightened - we're getting in the mood  
Body breaking volume - we are loud and rude  
Laser piercing lighting - megasonic sound  
The first day of your lesson - upheaval in the ground  
  
We're forging straight ahead now - it's not a dream  
Never ever lose the power - we're as hard as steel  
Don't you feel the fire - the burning in your soul  
Just come and join the fantasy - it will make you free  
  
So cut the crap out - it's for you  
Feel so damn proud - of this rocking crew  
We'll break the world down - tear up all the rules  
Reality is clear now - the future is for you  
  
So shout it out - just let it out  
So shout it out - as loud as you can  
So shout it out - just let it out  
So shout it out - as loud as we all can  
  
Now's the final showdown - it's time to be released  
Our weapons are so deadly - we're armed up to the teeth  
Electrostatic sound waves - you cannot hide  
Gonna execute our metal shock - straight between the eyes  
  
Shout - shout - shout - shout  
Shout - shout - shout - shout
