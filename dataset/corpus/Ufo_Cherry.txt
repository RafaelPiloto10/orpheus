Gotta give you love oh cherry  
Dance for me there's only you  
Play the barrooms just for pennies  
Wish I wasn't just passing through  
Tell me your secrets, tell me no one way lyin' now  
We are golden , We are golden  
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night I roll alone  
On the tabletops she's dancing, sit and smile into your beer  
Turn around no cherry for me, let me know you know I'm here  
We are golden, We are golden  
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night, making it feel all right  
Come on cherry let's make it together  
Out of the neon and into my life  
We can't play this game forever, now...  
  
Gotta give my love oh Cherry, dance for me there' s only you  
Play the barrooms just for pennies, wish I wasn't just passing through  
Tell me your secrets, tell me no one way lyin' now  
We are golden, we are golden  
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night I roll alone
