And I said before  
I don't want no more  
And I can't complain  
'cause my minds insane  
I won't say it again and I won't even think about it  
I just hope you believe me but I  
Think that you're gonna doubt it  
When I say it again  
As I said before  
I don't want no more  
And I can't complain  
'cause my mind's insane  
I won't say it again and I won't even think about it  
I just hope you believe me but I  
Think that you're gonna doubt it  
When I say it again  
Leaves on the trees  
Nothing more to believe  
I can't be sure  
And I know I'm not crazy  
Life is just a pleasant breeze  
Tides rush the shore  
Pleasing me a little more  
Nothing here to fight me  
Everything delight's me  
Hope I get my tea by 4  
But don't lay no second laughs down my way  
Don't let the evening's that devour you lie forever  
Don't you lay no second laughs down my way  
Don't let the evening's that devour you lie forever  
As I said before  
I don't want no more  
And I can't complain  
'cause my mind's insane  
I won't say it again and I won't even think about it  
I just hope you believe me but I  
Think that you're gonna doubt it  
When I say it again
