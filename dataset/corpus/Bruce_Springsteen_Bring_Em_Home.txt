If you love this land of the free  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring them back from overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
It will make the politicians sad, I know  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
They wanna tangle with their foe  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
They wanna test their grand theories  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
With the blood of you and me  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
We'll give no more brave young lives  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
For the gleam in someone's eyes  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
The men will cheer and the boys will shout  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
And we will all turn out  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
The church bells will ring with joy  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
To welcome our darling girls and boys  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
We will lift their voice in song  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
When Johnny comes marching home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring them back from the overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
If you love this land of free  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring them back from the overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
