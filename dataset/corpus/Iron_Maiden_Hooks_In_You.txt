I got the keys to view at number 22  
Behind my green door there's nothing to see  
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence, laid  
Back and looking for sympathy  
I like a girl who knows where she's bound  
I don't like girls who've been hanging around  
  
[Chorus]  
Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling  
For that well hung feeling  
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I  
Got the hooks screwed in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's tied up she can't come to the phone  
You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home  
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound  
She never could keep her feet on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Right on the money got it wrapped up tight  
New ideas for the decor tonight  
Gonna make this house a preservation zone  
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own
