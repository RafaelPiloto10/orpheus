Down the street  
A baby just cried  
When he woke up all alone  
  
A train's leaving town  
Oh, that lonesome sound  
It's chilling me right to the bone  
  
A song is playing  
I can barely hear  
About a love that's gone wrong  
The freezing rain on my window pane  
Listen, they're playing my song  
  
Taps being played  
By a soldier's grave  
So sad, it torments your soul  
Listen to that North wind moan  
Tonight is so dark and cold  
  
Somewhere a siren  
Cuts through the night  
It sounds like the  
Whole world's gone wrong  
  
Thunder just warned  
But it's coming a storm  
Listen, they're playing my song  
  
Listen, they're playing my song
