Don't you drink with me ''cause you know that I'm a loser.  
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.  
Never did what people said. I should've.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
  
I spend my life working up a sweat to be a bad boy.  
Getting girls into trouble every day.  
Going from town to town.  
Now I tell you I've been around.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
  
Lay it on me, yeah,  
Don't you drink with me 'cause I tell you that I'm a loser.  
And I'm proud of that fact as you can plainly see.  
Going from town to town. Now I tell you I've been around.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.  
I'm just a low down critter who never did any good.
