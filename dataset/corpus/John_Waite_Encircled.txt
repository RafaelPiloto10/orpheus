In these days of wild roses  
I held a compass in my hand  
I had three wishes for a future  
That I won't need to understand  
  
And I've got holly green on blood red  
Manhattan Christmas on my arm  
My soul ain't worth saving  
Feels like I've lost my lucky charm  
  
And I've been living in the gutter  
I've been loaded like a gun  
I've been sliding down the mountain  
And it feels like kingdom come  
  
And I'm always fighting windmills  
Have to take it as it comes  
See I'm  
I'm encircled  
  
I am  
If you want me tell me  
'Cause I can't play this game much longer  
Feels a lot like oblivion  
  
This feeling just keeps getting stronger  
And I've been living in the gutter  
Without American Express  
Heroes changing horses midstream  
  
I'm detached  
I'm second-guessed  
Won't you please come back and get me  
My whole world is in a mess  
  
See I'm  
I'm encircled  
This time I am  
I'm encircled  
  
In these days of wild roses  
I'm encircled  
Yeah  
And I've been living in the gutter  
  
I've been loaded like a gun  
I've been sliding down the mountain  
And it feels like kingdom come  
And I'm always fighting windmills  
  
Have to take it as it comes  
See I'm encircled  
This time I am  
I'm encircled  
  
I am  
In these days of wild roses
