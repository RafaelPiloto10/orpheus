Dream on  
Though it's hard to tell  
Though you're foolin' yourself  
Dream on  
  
You can hide away  
There is nothing to say, so dream on  
Dream on  
Though it's hard to tell  
Though you're foolin' yourself, dream on  
  
You can laugh at me because I'm crying  
You can tell your friends how much  
I begged you to stay  
You can live your fantasy without me  
But you'll never know how much I needed you  
  
Dream on  
It's so easy for you  
Though I'm broken in two, dream on  
Dream on  
You can never see  
What you're doing to me, so dream on  
  
You can cross your heart and still be lyin'  
You can count the reasons why you've thrown it away  
You can dream your life away without me  
But you'll never know how much I needed you  
  
You can laugh at me because I'm crying  
You can tell your friends how much  
I begged you to stay  
You can live your fantasy without me  
But you'll never know how much I needed you  
  
Dream on  
It's so easy for you  
Though I'm broken in two, dream on  
Dream on  
You can never see  
What you're doin' to me, so dream on  
Dream on  
Though it's hard to tell  
Though you're foolin' yourself,dream on  
Dream on
