Sometimes in our lives  
We all have pain  
We all have sorrow  
But, if we are wise  
We know that there's always tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
Lean on me when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long  
Till I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  
  
You can call on me brother  
When you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
I just might have a problem  
That you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
  
Please, swallow your pride  
If I have things  
You need to borrow  
For no one can fill  
Those of your needs  
That you won't let show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If there is a load  
You have to bear  
That you can't carry  
I'm right up the road  
I'll share your load  
If you just call me, call me  
If you need a friend, call me  
If you need a friend  
If you ever need a friend  
Call me  
Call me
