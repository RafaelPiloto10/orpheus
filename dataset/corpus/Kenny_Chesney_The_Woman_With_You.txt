She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side.  
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb.  
Look on her face saying don't say a word.  
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing.  
Western sky all turning red.  
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said:  
  
Been gopherin', chaufferin', company chairmen.  
Coffee maker, copy repairman.  
Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear man that I don't do.  
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.  
Dancing backwards in high heels.  
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you  
  
She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize
me.  
I was gonna run the bank.  
I was gonna run the map.  
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath.  
Back then you know I had this plan.  
Before all of this reality set in.  
Here comes life boy ready or not.  
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got.  
  
'Cause I'm gopherin', chaufferin', company chairmen.  
Coffee maker, copy repairman.  
Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear man that  
I don't do.  
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.  
Dancing backwards in high heels.  
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you.

The woman with you
