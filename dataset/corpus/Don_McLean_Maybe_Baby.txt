[Chorus]  
Maybe baby, I'll have you  
Maybe baby, you'll be true  
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me  
  
It's funny honey, you don't care  
You never listen to my prayer  
Maybe baby, you will love me someday  
  
Well, you are the one that makes me glad  
And you are the one that makes me sad  
And when some day you want me  
Well, I'll be there, wait and see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, you are the one that makes me glad  
And you are the one that makes me sad  
And when some day you want me  
Well, I'll be there, wait and see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me
