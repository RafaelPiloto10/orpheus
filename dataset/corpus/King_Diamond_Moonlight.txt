In the moonlight  
I see children searching for their souls  
In the moonlight  
Can you hear them howling on the wind  
Night after night, I see them passing by  
They whisper in my ear, "We know you are there."  
I see no eyes, I guess they must be blind  
Wish that I could lead them  
To a better world than mine  
  
In the moonlight  
Not a bird is singing lullabies  
In the moonlight  
I hear a church bell ring it's evil song  
Night after night, I see them passing by  
They whisper in my ear, "We know you are there."  
I see no eyes, I guess they must be blind  
Wish that I could lead them  
To a better world than mine  
  
In the moonlight, in the moonlight  
  
Night after night, I see them passing by  
Wish that I could lead them  
To a better world than mine  
  
In the moonlight  
I see children searching for their souls  
In the moonlight  
I hear screams of pain from a thousand years ago  
  
Raven spread your wings, lead the spirits to their home  
Raven spread your wings, lead the spirits to their home  
To their home  
  
In the moonlight, in the moonlight
