Tell you a story not a little white lie  
Wasn't long tall sally it was no surprise  
That's right, tell me that's right  
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news  
That night, tell me that's right  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
Love comes a-tumblin' down, oh yeah yeah  
  
All shook up and bent out of shape  
Wasn't Johnny B. Goode but it sounded great  
That night, tell me that's right  
From the cabaret to the highway of hell  
Had a monkey on his back it was easy to tell  
That night, tell me that's right  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
Love comes a-tumblin' down oh yeah yeah  
  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
Love comes a-tumblin' down oh yeah!  
  
I'm wishing to live longer aided by the supreme healing force of music  
It most definitely overcomes all weakening aspects of the body  
I've felt quite lost and distraught without those wonderful vinyl productions  
I'm convinced it's an addiction, too. I feel just great again  
(band, get ready)  
  
When you see the train come  
Then you'll know what to do  
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
That's right, tell me that's right  
(love came) a-stumblin' and a-tumblin' down  
Not a pretty picture when the body was found  
That night, tell me that's right  
  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
You see the train come you know what to do  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Johnny b. goode it sounded just great  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Long tall sally it was no surprise  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Not a pretty picture when the body was found  
(love comes a tumblin')  
Mama mama mama mama
