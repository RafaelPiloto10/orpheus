He could be the hottest man alive  
But he can't hold a flame up to you and I  
'Cause I'm so much better when I'm standing by your side  
And I can do anything  
As long as your in my life  
Since you been around  
All I ever wanna do is try to hold you down  
And there's nothin', nothin' that I can do  
'Cause you make me feel like...  
  
I can stop a train if I want to,  
Can't nothin' get in my way  
'Cause I got you  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
I can tell the sun when to shine  
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
You got me singin' yeah, yeah, yeah I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
  
You're something like a drug,  
Impossible to stop me when I'm trippin' off of love  
I always run back 'cause I never get enough  
'Cause boy, you're my everything  
That's why I need you in my life  
And no it ain't a thing  
I reach up in the sky, grab a cloud and make it rain  
And there's nothin', nothin' that I can do  
'Cause you make me feel like...  
  
I can stop a train if I want to,  
Can't nothin' get in my way  
'Cause I got you  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
I can tell the sun when to shine  
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
You got me singin' yeah, yeah, yeah I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
  
Baby, you make me better daily  
Even when no one else is around  
And can't nobody show me all the love that you give me  
And that's why I'm gonna hold you down  
So when you want me  
I'll give my all,  
'Cause you be there to catch me whenever I start fallin'  
When I'm with you, I get stronger everyday  
That's why I say... (oh oh oh)  
  
'Cause with you I'm stronger, stronger.  
I can stop a train if I want to,  
Can't nothin' get in my way  
'Cause I got you  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
I can tell the sun when to shine  
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
You got me singin' yeah, yeah, yeah I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
You got me singin' yeah, yeah, yeah I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger
