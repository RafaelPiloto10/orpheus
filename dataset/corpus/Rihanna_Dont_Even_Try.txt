Why do you call  
When I'm not  
Feelin' you  
(Baby)  
Why can't you leave  
Boy just walk away  
When are you going  
To understand  
Ohha  
  
What sort of things  
They be tellin' you  
I've got to stop them  
From compelling you  
Boy  
They better stop  
They're not  
Hhelping you  
Ohhha  
  
Don't even try  
Cuz I know that  
You're not the one  
Don't waste  
Your time  
Goodbye  
Don'tcha cry  
The game is done  
  
I'm gonna tell you  
Right here  
Let this be  
The last time  
I'm gonna make it  
So clear  
Boy, you must be  
Outcha mind  
I'm gonna tell you  
Right here  
Let this be  
The last time  
I'm gonna make it  
So clear  
You must be  
Outcha mind  
  
Don't you lie  
Don't you try  
Say goodbye  
It just  
Won't work  
Your head's  
In the sky  
Must be trippin'  
Must be high  
But there's  
So much  
I'm worth  
  
I'm not stupid  
I'm not a fool  
I know  
What I'm doin'  
I went to school  
You better listen  
Do what you're told  
My love's  
More valuable  
Than a pot of gold  
  
I'm gonna tell you  
Right here  
Let this be  
The last time  
I'm gonna make it  
So clear, boy  
You must be  
Outcha mind  
I'm gonna tell you  
Right here  
Let this be  
The last time  
I'm gonna make it  
So clear  
Must be  
Outcha your mind  
  
Don't even try  
Cuz I  
Know that you're  
Not the one  
Don't waste  
Your time  
Goodbye  
Don't you cry

Don't even try  
Cuz I know  
That you're  
Not the one  
Don't waste  
Your time,  
Goodbye  
Don't you cry
