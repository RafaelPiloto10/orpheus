Kiss today goodbye  
The sweetness and the sorrow  
Wish me luck the same to hoo you  
But I can't regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
Look, my eyes are dry  
The gift was ours to borrow  
It's as if we always knew  
And I won't forget  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
Gone, love is never gone  
As we travel on  
Love's what we'll remember  
  
Kiss today goodbye  
And point me toward tomorrow  
We did what we had to do  
Won't forget, can't regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
What I did for love  
And I won't forget  
What I did for love  
  
Gone love is never gone  
As we travel on  
Love's what we'll remember  
  
Kiss today goodbye  
And point me toward tomorrow  
We did what we had to do  
Won't forget, can't regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
What I did for love
