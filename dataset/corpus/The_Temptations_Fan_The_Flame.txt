Once a wiseman said to me  
This advice I give you free,  
A woman is made of fantasy  
So fan the flame.  
  
Always keep her hopes up high.  
Make her laugh don't make her cry and don't let her love die,  
So fan the flame.  
A woman needs love and affection and little things mean a lot  
(Little things mean a lot)  
  
And when she has an emotional baby.  
That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot.  
Make her feel shes ten feet tall, even though she short and small.  
So fan the flame.  
  
Her love is your reality let her go and you will see just how lonely life can
be.  
So fan the flame.  
A woman needs love and praising so give her them each day  
Tell her you love her, its added protection  
That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot.
