It's crippling never really knowing  
They're huddling where it's always nice  
  
And plus there is a flame of frail and trippy hearts  
And swallowed, being small and being still  
Following where ever you will  
  
Look at them, they're sensitive  
And they inch out, look at them  
  
And plus there is a flame of frail and trippy hearts  
And swallowed, being small and being still  
Following where ever you will
