Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
It's the middle of the night, 3 am, I'm waiting  
For the cell phone by my bed to ring, I'm acting like a fool  
The alarm on my clock rings, just like a fairy tale  
Even if I find the glass slipper, it'll be no good  
If it's too much trouble for you to care, then let me know soon  
Even I don't have that much time  
I'm movin' on without you  
  
I can't pretend anymore  
That I don't know about your stupid alibis  
We didn't always have these kind of memories  
It shouldn't have been painful  
Why?  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
The lines I planned to say were perfect  
But I still can't get through, it's 4 am  
When the night's too quiet, my thoughts get restless  
I understand, but I still can't get enough sleep  
I've forgotten that promise  
I'll give you back your ring, so give me back my heart  
I have to go on without you  
  
It's hard, so I'll be the one to break up  
It's not good playing a good girl  
It shouldn't have been painful  
Why?  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
Even if it's confusing, I want to be loved  
Without saying it, I want you to understand  
It shouldn't have been painful  
Why?  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me
