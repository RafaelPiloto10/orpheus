Rain falls  
Dark clouds are racing up above  
I gaze in solitude  
Looking through a misty glass window  
'Cause then it used to be the two of us  
  
This empty room  
Filled my thoughts with memories of you  
I turned and looked around  
Oh, but found no sight of you  
I guess it'll never be as true, no no ooh  
  
Chorus  
Starlight  
All I need is you tonight  
Oh, starbright  
Grant my wish tonight  
I'm beggin' you, starlight  
All I need is you tonight  
Hoh, starbright  
Get rid of the spell tonight, ooh  
  
Rain falls  
Dark clouds keep racing up above  
It's still in solitude  
Oh, longin' for you  
Guess my heart will always be with you  
My heart will always be with you  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Hoh, starbright  
Get rid of the spell tonight
