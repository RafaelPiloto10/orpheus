Trapped in time and I don't know what to do  
These friends of mine, I can see right through  
You don't gotta tell me I don't gotta move  
'Cause I'm sittin' back here sharin' in the groove  
  
No I'm no nice guy (Me no are no nice guy)  
No I'm no nice guy (Me no are no nice guy)  
No I'm no nice guy (Me no are no nice guy)  
  
I walk through the hallways inside my mind  
I chase the backbeat from behind  
Big dude in the doorway was blockin' my way  
He reached to grab me and this is what he said  
  
No I'm no nice guy (Me no are no nice guy)  
No I'm no nice guy (Me no are no nice guy)  
No I'm no nice guy (Me no are no nice guy)  
  
This is the end  
My only friend, the end  
Indians lying on dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts in the young child's fragile ... mind  
Ah!  
Careful with that axe, Eugene  
Mother  
Careful with that axe, Eugene  
Ah!
