I've got a lot of memories to last me the rest of my life  
So if you don't want to love me, baby that'll be alright  
I'm gonna take all the lovin' that I have for you  
Gonna take all the loneliness an' sit right down with the blues!  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories  
Give my self a party, think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
Gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues!  
  
A few of your love letters, a photograph or two  
A gift you gave on my birthday with words of "I love you"  
There's lots of things to think about, when you're feelin' blue  
So I'm gonna take all the loneliness, sit right down with the blues!  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories  
Give my self a party, think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
I'm gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues!  
  
Just me an' the blues!
