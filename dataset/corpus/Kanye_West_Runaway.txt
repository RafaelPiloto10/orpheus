And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,  
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,  
Every one of them that I know  
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs  
That'll never take work off  
Baby, I got a plan  
Run away fast as you can  
  
She find pictures in my email  
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick  
I don't know what it is with females  
But I'm not too good at that shit  
See, I could have me a good girl  
And still be addicted to them hood rats  
And I just blame everything on you  
At least you know that's what I'm good at  
  
And I always find  
Yeah I always find  
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,

Baby, I got a plan  
Run away fast as you can  
  
Runaway from me baby  
Runaway  
Runaway from me baby  
Runaway  
Crazy, just crazy  
Runaway as fast as you can  
Runaway from me baby  
Runaway  
Runaway from me baby  
Runaway  
Crazy  
Why cant she just runaway  
Baby I got a plan  
Run away fast as you can  
  
Twenty four seven, three sixty five,  
Pussy stays on my mind  
I-I-I-I did it,  
All right, all right, I admit it  
Now pick your best move,  
You could leave or live wit' it  
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off  
Split and go where?  
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha  
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off  
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off  
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers  
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas  
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet  
Comes with a price tag, baby face it  
You should leave if you can't accept the basics  
Plenty bitches in the baller-nigga matrix  
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless  
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless  
P!  
  
Never was much of a romantic  
I could never take the intimacy  
And I know it did damage  
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me  
I guessin' you're at an advantage  
'Cause you could blame me for everything  
And I don't know where I'ma manage  
If one day you just up and leave  
  
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,  
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,  
Every one of them that I know  
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs  
That'll never take work off  
Baby, I got a plan  
Run away fast as you can
