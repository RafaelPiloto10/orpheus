Where'd you go?  
Dark eyed traveller  
I almost feel you breathe  
Where'd you go?  
Dark eyed traveller  
Can you even hear me speak?  
  
You make things bright  
When they took the night away  
Led me inside and kissed all my tears away  
Said you were here to stay  
  
Where'd you go?  
In the morning  
When I was way down with dream  
Where'd you go?  
In the morning  
When fever pulled me down stream  
You made things bright  
And you took the night away  
Lend me your eyes and show me a brand new way  
Now I just feel dead today.
