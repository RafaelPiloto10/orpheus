You're selling ads you slimy toad  
Don't smile at me and shake my hand  
You're killing me  
You're killing us  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
You're selling ads you stupid twit  
The naked lunch is on your knife  
The homicides are suicides  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
Your copy kills  
Your copy smells  
Realities are crushed beneath the ads your copy sells  
  
Go back to hell you giddy fools  
There is no truth you cannot maim  
He killed himself  
You killed him first  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
Your copy kills  
Your copy smells  
Realities are crushed beneath the ads your copy sells  
  
You're selling ads you slimy toad  
Don't smile at me and shake my hand  
You're killing me  
You're killing us  
Because you're only  
'Only selling ads'  
  
Because you're only 'only selling ads'  
Because you're only 'only selling ads'  
Because you're only 'only selling ads'
