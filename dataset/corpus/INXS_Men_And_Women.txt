can't see how I can  
Turn around what has been done  
I was just like a child  
With my eyes wide open  
  
History and any cause  
And my eyes are still open  
But my mouth my mouth is shut  
I'm closing off the lies  
  
Making my own mind up  
When I can I will  
How many dirty little secrets  
Were kept behind my back?  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Giving each other the sham  
  
I don't see  
How I can turn around what has been done  
I was just like a child  
With my eyes wide open  
  
Hungry at any cost  
Now my eyes are still open  
But my mouth my mouth is shut  
I'm closing out the lies and promises  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Men and women  
  
Giving me the sham  
Giving me the sham  
Giving me the sham  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Giving me the sham  
  
Men and women  
Men and women  
Giving me the sham
