My love lives at  
The end of a rainbow  
One day I'm gonna  
Fly there on a firefly  
High above white angry water  
With a love song in my heart  
  
Someday, somehow  
I know I'm gonna get there  
I've been patient for so long  
All my daydreams  
Seem so much nearer now  
And I beg you hear my song  
  
Firefly  
On your glowing wings I'll ride  
Till I sit beside  
This dream of mine  
Firefly, high on a risin' tide  
Only want to touch  
The things I've seen  
  
Steppin' lightly from star to star  
Cross a wilderness of blue  
Wonderin' how much  
In love with me you are  
'Cause I'm so much in love with you  
  
Firefly, can you take me  
I ain't had no lovin' lately  
Firefly bring me love  
  
To my new horizon  
The one that I've still  
Got my eyes on, my my firefly  
Firefly, firefly, firefly  
  
In my dreams you come to me  
The answer to my prayer  
As I begin to feel  
You warm my heart  
I awake and you're not there  
  
Now and then I see your eye  
As the stars begin to shine  
No rain to cool my passion  
No! Not now!  
No, now you're mine!
