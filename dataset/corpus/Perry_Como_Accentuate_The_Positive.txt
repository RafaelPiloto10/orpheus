(ac-cent-thu-ate the positive,  
E-lim-inate the negative,  
Ac-cent-thu-ate the positive, an latch on!)  
  
You gotta accent-thu-ate the positive,  
E-lim-inate the negative,  
An latch on  
To the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister in-between!  
  
You gotta spread joy up to the maximum,  
Bring gloom down to the minimum,  
An have faith (amen!)  
Or pandemoniums  
Liable to walk upon the scene!  
  
To illustrate  
My last remark  
Jonah in the whale!  
Noah in the arc!  
An what did they do (what did they do?)  
Just when everything looked so dark?  
  
(what did they, what did they, what did they do?)  
  
Man! They said  
You better accent-thu-ate the positive,  
E-lim-inate the negative,  
An latch on  
To the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister in-between!  
No, don't mess with mister in-between!
