Oh yeah, Some days it's so easy  
And sometimes I forget her  
But I want you back again  
Back again  
  
Maybe it's a game  
You win some and you lose some  
Oh, when you've found a good one  
Don't let her get away  
Don't let her go  
  
Oh yeah, If only I could have you  
Just the way I want to  
Oh, to have you back again  
Back again  
  
Oh, I'm just a fool baby  
Playing Mr. Cool baby  
Rolling round like I got nothing much to lose  
But I know you and you know me  
And I know you can see  
So help me get my way back to you  
Back to you  
  
Walking past your window  
Used to smile when you'd throw  
Your sweet kisses back to me  
Back to me  
  
Oh yeah, remember when I asked you  
If you'd be my one true  
Oh, it seems like yesterday  
It's yesterday  
  
Oh yeah, I'm just a fool baby  
Playing Mr. Cool baby  
Rolling round like I got nothing much to lose  
But I know you and you know me  
And I know you can see  
So help me get my way back to you  
Back to you  
  
I want you so take me back please  
Take me back, my baby  
  
If only I could love you  
Just the way I want to  
Yeah  
  
I'm just a fool baby  
Playing Mr. Cool baby  
Rolling round like I got nothing much to lose  
But I know you and you know me  
And I know you can see  
So help me get my way back to you  
  
I want you so take me back please  
Take me back, oh baby  
  
If only I could have you  
Just the way I want to  
Just the way I want, yeah
