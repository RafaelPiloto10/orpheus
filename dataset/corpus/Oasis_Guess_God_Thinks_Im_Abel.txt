I could be your lover, you could be all mine.  
We'd go on for ever, 'til the end of time.  
You could be my best friend, stay up all night long.  
You could be my railroad, we'd go on and on.  
  
Let's get along, there's nothing here to do.  
Let's go find a rainbow.  
I could be wrong - what am I to do?  
Guess God thinks I'm Abel.  
  
You could be my enemy, I guess there's still time.  
I get round to loving you, is that such a crime?  
  
Let's get along, there's nothing here to do.  
Let's go find a rainbow.  
I could be wrong, but what am I to do?  
Guess God thinks I'm Abel.  
  
No-one could break us.  
No-one could take us.  
If we tried.  
  
No-one could break us.  
No-one could take us.  
If we tried.  
  
No-one could break us.  
No-one could take us.  
If we tried.  
  
Come on oh, let's make it tonight.
