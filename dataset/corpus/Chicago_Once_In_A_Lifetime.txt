When I saw your face  
I could feel my heartbeat begin to race  
In the still of the night  
It was love at first sight  
  
Not too long ago  
I was on my own  
Never would have known  
You'd come into my life  
Now you're the love of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Once in a lifetime  
Maybe the last time  
Just the right time to fall in love  
Once in a lifetime  
For such a long time  
I've been waiting for you  
  
You were there for me  
It was there for you  
We were meant to be  
Now we're fallin' in love  
Finally fallin' in love  
  
[Chorus]
