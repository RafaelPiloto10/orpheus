You rest your mind  
Flying to the home that you knew  
You made you past  
Trying to get home in as few but  
All the time  
Your mind is just aching for  
All the time  
You can't stop but faking it  
All the time  
Your mind is just breaking your heart  
You rest you heart  
Oh, listen to me  
You can be 'bout, anywhere  
You can take you mind anyplace because  
Your mind's open, the rest is up to you  
You can dream 'bout any dream  
You can take safaris right up into the sky's open,  
The rest is up to you  
You can do it  
You can dream it all  
Sing it in your heart  
Don't have to be lonely  
You can do it  
You can feel it all  
Breakin' in your heart  
Don't have to be lonely  
You can do it  
You can leave it all  
Make another start  
You can be 'bout, anywhere  
You can take you mind anyplace because  
Your mind's open, the rest is up to you  
You can dream 'bout any dream  
You can take safaris right up into the sky's open,  
The rest is up to you  
Might wind up just anywhere  
Might wind up just anywhere  
Might wind up just anywhere
