On the farm, on the farm,  
Oh, it's beans, beans, beans that make you feel so mean,  
On the Hinky Dinky 'Double D' farm.

I have not brought my specs with me,  
I have not brought my specs with me!  
  
Oh it's corn, corn, corn that make you feel forlorn,  
On the farm, on the farm,  
Oh, it's corn, corn, corn that make you feel forlorn,  
On the Hinky Dinky 'Double D' farm.  
  
Mine eyes are dim, I cannot see,  
I have not brought my specs with me,  
I have not brought my specs with me!  
  
Oh it's meat, meat, meat that knocks you off your feet,  
On the farm, on the farm,  
Oh, it's meat, meat, meat that knocks you off your feet,  
On the Hinky Dinky 'Double D' farm.  
  
Mine eyes are dim, I cannot see,  
I have not brought my specs with me,  
I have not brought my specs with me!  
  
Oh it's pie, pie, pie that makes you want to cry,  
On the farm, on the farm,  
Oh, it's pie, pie, pie that makes you want to cry,  
On the Hinky Dinky 'Double D' farm.

Oh it's soup, soup, soup that makes you want to droop,  
On the farm, on the farm,  
Oh, it's soup, soup, soup that makes you want to droop,  
On the Hinky Dinky 'Double D' farm.

Oh it's peas, peas, peas that make you want to sneeze,  
On the farm, on the farm,  
Oh, it's peas, peas, peas that make you want to sneeze,  
On the Hinky Dinky 'Double D' farm.
