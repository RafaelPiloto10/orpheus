You have done great things  
You have done great things  
You have done great things  
Oh You have done great things  
  
When the Lord brought back the captive ones of Zion  
We were like those who dream  
Our mouths were filled with laughter  
Our tongue with joyful shouting  
They say among the nations  
"The Lord has done great things for them"  
  
The Lord has done great things for us  
The Lord has done great things for us  
We are filled with joy, we are filled with joy  
  
You have done great things  
You have done great things  
Yeah You have done great things  
Father, You have done great things

You've restored our hearts like streams that flow  
Those who've sowed in tears have reaped their joy  
And returned with shouts and songs  
Carrying the fruit of God
