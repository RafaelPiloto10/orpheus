A little dream castle, with every dream gone  
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn  
And my heart is heavy, as I gaze upon a cottage for sale.  
The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay  
  
A beautiful garden has withered away  
Where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say, A cottage for sale  
From every single window, I see your face  
But when I reach the window, there's empty space  
  
The key's in the mailbox, the same as before  
But no one is waiting for me anymore  
The end of our story is there on the door, A cottage for sale
