You can go but be back soon  
You can go but while you're working,  
This place I'm pacing round,  
Until you're home safe and sound  
Fare well but be back soon  
Who can tell where danger's lurking  
Do not forget this tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
How could we forget  
How could we let  
Our dear old Fagin worry  
We love him so we'll come back home  
In a such a great big hurry  
  
It's him who plays the piper,  
It's the one that pipes his tune!  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
You can go but be back soon,  
You can go but bring back plenty,  
Of pocket hankerchieves  
And you should be clever thieves  
Whip it quick and be back soon  
There's a sixpence here for twenty  
Ain't that a lovely tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
Our pockets'll hold a watch of gold  
That chimes upon the hour!  
A wallet fat  
An old man's hat,  
  
The crown jewels from the tower!  
We know the bow street runners,  
But they don't know this tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
Cheerio but be back soon,  
I don't know somehow I'll miss yya  
I love ya that's why I  
Say cheerio not goodbye  
Don't be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless ya  
Remember our old tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
We must disappear, we'll be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrow  
We'll miss you too,  
  
It's sad but true  
That picking  
Is such sweet sorrow!  
  
And when we're in the distance,  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
We must disappear  
We'll be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrrow  
We'll miss you too  
It's sad but true  
That parting is such sweet sorrow!  
And when we're in the distance  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
Cheerio but be back soon  
I don't know somehow I'll miss you  
I love you that's why I  
Say cheerio not goodbye  
Don't be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless you  
Remember our old tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
And when we're in the distance  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
So long fare well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!
