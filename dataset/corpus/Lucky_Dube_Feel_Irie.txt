How long shall you carry  
That burden on your shoulders?  
How long shall those tears  
Keep rolling down  
Your beautiful face?  
We all have troubles  
Now and again, know what I'm saying?  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how hard we try,  
Trouble will find us one way or another.  
People had trouble since the pope  
Was an alter boy  
People had worries from when the  
Dead sea was only critical.  
Hear those drums rolling  
Listen to those guitars skanking  
Yeah... Put a smile on your face  
Don't let the troubles get you down,  
Let me tell you how we feel...  
  
We feel irie  
Do you feel like we do  
  
No man can hide from his fears  
Since they are part of him  
They'll always know where to find him,  
Come on and walk tall and  
Keep your head high  
  
I tell you again and again  
Put a smile on your face,  
Don't let the troubles  
Get you down  
  
[Chorus until fade]
