I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You think you know  
The smile on her lips  
The thrill an' the touch  
Of her fingertips  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You think you'll find  
A heaven of bliss  
In each caress  
In each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her  
  
You stole her love from me one day  
You didn't care how it hurt me  
But you can never steal away  
Memories of what used to be  
You think she's yours  
To have and to hold  
Someday you'll learn  
When her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
