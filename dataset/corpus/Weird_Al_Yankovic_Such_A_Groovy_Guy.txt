I got my alligator boots I wear my pants skin tight  
I wear my dark sunglasses in the middle of the night  
And when I look in the mirror I'm-a such an awesome sight  
It makes me wanna kneel down and pray  
I'm so adorable and charming I'm sure that you can see  
And everyone's always trying to hang around with me  
They tell me I'm the greatest and it's hard to disagree  
'Cause I'm so perfect in every way  
And I'm so cute, I can hardly stand it  
And I'm so handsome honey I could just die  
I know you'll never be as wonderful as me but at least you can try  
'Cause I'm such a groovy guy  
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy  
Baby are you in the mood for a little romance?  
Well for starters I can pour some chocolate pudding down your pants  
And then attach electrodes to your brain and watch you dance  
Oh, golly wouldn't that be fun?  
Oh and then I might decide to tie you up with dental floss  
I'll make you wear a harness and I'll show you who's the boss  
Of course if you refuse, well honey it's your loss  
I mean, I don't do this with just anyone  
So baby, how can you say it's all over?  
So how can you tell me goodbye?  
So now you tell me that you're leaving me for good  
And all I wanna know is why?  
I mean after all  
I'm really such a groovy guy  
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy  
I mean you could do worse!  
I'm such a groovy guy  
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
I'm such a groovy guy  
...
