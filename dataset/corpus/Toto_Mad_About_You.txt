There's something I must say  
Something I must do  
I planned it all this way  
Designed it just for you  
Do you want to be with me  
Be with me at all  
Do you have to be so cool?  
Your gentle touch maneuvered me  
But all the time I always knew  
  
I'm really mad about you  
There's nothing bad about our love  
I'm giving you the only heart I have  
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough  
  
Can we go on this way  
There's nothing left to prove  
It's not another game  
Or another simple move  
Do you believe in me  
Believe in me at all  
Are you telling me the truth?  
Is it just imagination  
Or the perfect dream  
That I'm here with you  
  
I'm really mad about you  
There's nothing bad about our love  
I'm giving you the only heart I have  
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough  
  
I'm really mad about you  
There's nothing bad about our love  
I've never had a broken heart before  
But I know you'll never tear mine apart
