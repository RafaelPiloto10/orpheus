Spark and Cindy live by their own means  
They wouldn't have if I only  
Know'd where they'd been  
And I want to make things a part of my life  
And I want to see that  
Things are going to be right  
But if you can't even  
Stand on your feet  
And if you don't own the  
Air that you breathe  
Then it's not for me to say  
  
But I wouldn't live that way  
And I wouldn't stand apart  
And I wouldn't find the real  
And I wouldn't play a part  
And I wouldn't find in love  
So misguided by some fool  
And just what I'm trying t say  
Makes my head spin round the room
