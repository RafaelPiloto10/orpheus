I read your letter just this morning  
The first you've wrote since you've been gone  
You've found a good life in California  
You've finally found yourself a home  
  
You've bought a new car, a great big red one  
With a top that rolls right down  
You must be something in San Francisco  
A dressed up, painted country clown  
  
You're fakin' it well, but it's easy to tell  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
The pace is too fast and you're out of your class  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
  
You know I love you, at least you ought to  
I've loved you all of my livin' days  
You got no business makin' changes  
Yeah girl, I love your country ways  
  
Go sell that red car, catch an airplane  
And i'll be waiting when you land  
Yeah, get a white dress, find a preacher  
We'll get some rings to fit your hand  
  
You're fakin' it well, but it's easy to tell  
You're plain jane country come to town  
The pace is too fast and you're out of your class  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
You're plain Jane country come to town  
You're plain Jane country come to town
