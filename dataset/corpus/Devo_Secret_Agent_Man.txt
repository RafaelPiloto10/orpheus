You know I live a life of danger  
For the FBI  
Keeping tabs on our nation  
On the land, on the sea, in the sky  
But every single night  
Before I go to bed  
I get down on my knees  
And thank God  
I'm a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
They've given me a number  
But they've taken 'way my name  
I got one hell of a job to perform  
For the U. S. of A.  
Got the responsibility  
Of our nation's top security  
But every night and day  
I salute the flag and say  
Thank you, Jesus  
'Cause I'm, I'm a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
  
You know they got me doin' this  
Doin' that  
And a little bit of something else  
Fighting cavities of evil  
Safe-guarding America's health  
But not an afternoon pass  
I don't get up off my ass  
Thank you God  
'Cause I'm, I'm a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
  
'Cause I'm a secret agent man
