I can't be cool or nonchalant  
Call me an impulsive fool  
You're all I want  
You may be right  
It's too much to soon  
To talk of love all night  
In your bedroom  
I don't know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find I'm here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
I won't play games or waste your time  
But I won't feel ashamed to speak my mind  
So just relax  
Don't question why for calculated facts  
Will not apply  
I don't know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find I'm here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
In my life there've been few  
Who've affected me the way you do  
(You do you do)  
I'll tell no lies I won't pretend  
But if you've a broken heart  
I'll help it mend  
I don't know why  
It always comes as a surprise  
To find I'm here with you  
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true  
Smile and I am rubbing my eyes  
At a dream come true
