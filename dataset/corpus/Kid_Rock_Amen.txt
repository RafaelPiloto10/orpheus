It's another night in hell  
Another child won't live to tell  
Can you imagine what it's like to starve to death  
  
And as we sit free and well  
Another soldier has to yell  
Tell my wife and children I love them in his last breath  
  
C'mon now amen, amen, amen  
  
Habitual offenders, scumbag lawyers with agendas  
I'll tell you sometimes people I don't know what's worse  
Natural disasters or these wolves in sheep clothes pastors  
Now damn it I'm scared to send my children to church  
And how can we seek salvation when our nations race relations  
Got me feeling guilty of being white  
But faith in human nature, our creator and our savior, I'm no saint  
But I believe in what is right  
  
C'mon now amen, amen  
I said amen, amen  
  
Stop pointing fingers and take some blame,  
Pull your future away from the flame  
Open up your mind and start to live  
Stop short changing your neighbors  
Living off hand outs and favors, and maybe  
Give a little bit more than you got to give  
  
Simplify, testify, identify, rectify  
And if I get high stop being so uptight  
It's only human nature and I am not a stranger  
So baby won't you stay with me tonight  
  
[INSERT JAPANESE TRANSLATION]  
  
It's a matter of salvation from them patience up above,  
So don't give up so damn easy on the one you love, one you love  
Somewhere you got a brother, sister, friend, grandmother, niece or nephew  
Just dying to be with you  
You know there's someone out there who unconditionally, religiously, loves you  
So just hold on 'cause you know it's true  
And if you can take the pain  
And you can withstand anything, and one day  
Stand hand in hand with the truth  
  
I said amen, I said amen  
I said amen, I said amen,  
  
Amen
