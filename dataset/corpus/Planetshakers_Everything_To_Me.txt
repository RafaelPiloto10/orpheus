When i feel down i look to you  
When i feel low your words ring true  
Its not by might or in my strength  
But its by your spirit moving in my life  
'Cause God you are my life  
  
I will praise you  
you're everything to me  
I'll live for you  
You're the reason that i sing  
I won't go back to the way it used to be  
'Cause i've found you and your everything to me  
  
At times when i look down and all i see is  
Sinking sand  
I'm thankful that it's you the solid rock on  
Which i stand
