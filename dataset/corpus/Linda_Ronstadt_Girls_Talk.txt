There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder  
Thought I heard you mention my name can't you talk any louder  
Don't come any closer  
Don't come any nearer  
My vision of you can't come any clearer  
Oh I just wanna hear girls talk  
  
Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk  
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls talk  
But I can't say the words you want to hear  
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear right here and now  
  
Girls talk  
And they wanna know how girls talk  
And they say it's not allowed girls talk  
If they say that it's so don't they think that I know by now  
That the word up on everyone's lips stick that you're dedicated  
You may not be an old fashioned girl but you're gonna get dated  
Was it really murder were you just pretending  
Lately I have heard you are the living end  
  
Girls talk  
And they wanna know how girls talk  
And they say it's not allowed girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
if they say that it's so don't they think that I know by now  
  
But I can't say the words you want to hear  
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear right here  
There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder  
Thought I heard you mention my name can't you talk any louder  
Don't come any closer  
Don't come any nearer  
My vision of you can't come any clearer  
Girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
And they say it's not allowed girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
Girls talk, girls talk
