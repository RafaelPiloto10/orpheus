Come with me and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
We'll begin with a spin  
Traveling in the world  
Of my creation  
What we'll see  
Will defy explanation  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with  
Pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
If you want to see magic land  
Close your eyes and you will see one  
Want to be a dreamer, be one  
Anytime you please  
And please save me one  
  
Come with me and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
There is no place to go  
To compare with your imagination  
So go there to be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
Living there you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be
