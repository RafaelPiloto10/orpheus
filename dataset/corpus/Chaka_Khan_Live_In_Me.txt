There's a feeling I just can't deny  
It's fire straight from my soul  
And it's hot enough to tear you up  
Make you lose control  
  
Gonna soothe you, put you in a trance  
And get your sense aroused  
So there ain't no use in holdin' back  
Gotta let that feelin' out  
  
[Chorus:]  
Live in me, come in, my life  
Fill me with all that sweet delight  
I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside  
So give me the love I need tonight  
  
Foolin' 'round, you got no time to waste  
So, baby, turn out the light  
And let's get down to what it takes  
To keep me satisfied  
Don't give me dreams, I don't want to know  
'Cause I need something to hold  
And action speaks more tenderness  
Than words could ever show, so...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Groove with the motion  
Let's take it to the top  
Ride with the feeling  
There's no way I'm gonna stop  
I'll give you heaven  
To help you through the day  
And super lovin'  
Takes your breath away  
  
Live in me (just live in me)  
Come in, my life (come in, my life)  
Fill me with all that sweet delight  
(Fill me with love, that sweet delight)  
I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside  
(I'm burnin' up, steamin' inside)  
So give me the love I need tonight  
(Just give me love I need tonight)
