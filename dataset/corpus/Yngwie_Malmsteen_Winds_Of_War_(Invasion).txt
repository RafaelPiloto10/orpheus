I can feel them, they're here.  
The howling winds of war.  
You can sense them.  
They are bad omens.  
You can see the death dealing hordes.  
And for eons now.  
Since the dawn of time.  
Round and round it goes.  
Since long before us.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
There's no reason.  
There's no rhyme.  
They will bring eternal night.  
Oh no!  
It's too late to turn back now.  
A soldier lives to die.  
And now for all to behold.  
It's the moment of truth.  
Here are the sons of Babylon's whore.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
[guitar solo]  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion.  
The winds of war.  
Invasion
