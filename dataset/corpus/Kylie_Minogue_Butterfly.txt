Mm mm  
In the morning I'll wake up with you  
There's not anything I would rather do  
  
you are more than you'll ever know  
And your love teaches me 2 grow  
you are more than my everything  
And your love gives me wings  
  
Like a butterfly  
And I'll dance in the sunlight  
Like a butterfly  
From the day in 2 the night  
  
Your touch  
Is the 1 thing I know is true  
My mind  
Is completely devoted 2 you  
  
you are more than you'll ever know  
And your love teaches me 2 grow  
you are more than my everything  
And your love gives me wings  
  
Like a butterfly  
And I'll dance in the sunlight  
Like a butterfly  
From the day in 2 the night  
  
And it might not last more than a day  
But I'll take my chances anyway  
'cause my heart is saying it's 4 real  
No-one else has made me feel this way
