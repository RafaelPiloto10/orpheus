Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all  
It's a miracle  
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal  
That's a miracle  
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone  
It's a miracle  
We're having a miracle on Earth, mother nature does it all for us  
The wonders of this world go on, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon  
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle  
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on Earth - an end to war  
It's a miracle we need - the miracle  
The miracle we're all waiting for today  
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle  
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat  
That's a miracle  
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony  
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on Earth  
Mother nature does it all for us  
(the wonders of this world go on)  
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea  
Super powers always fighting  
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle  
  
(The wonders of this world go on)  
Well it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle  
The one thing (the one thing)  
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)  
Is peace on Earth (peace on Earth) and an end to war (end to war)  
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle  
Peace on Earth and end to war today  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends  
That time will come
