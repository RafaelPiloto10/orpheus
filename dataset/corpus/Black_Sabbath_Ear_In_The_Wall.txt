Hello, can you hear me? I might not be alone  
Don't see anyone near me but I just won't go home again  
Let's meet in the morning, I just can't speak tonight  
This is more than a warning, be silent 'till it's light  
  
And then you know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me  
Remembering it all makes my flesh start to crawl  
I've seen an ear in the wall  
  
This time, it could prove it but you've heard this all before  
Cry wolf and you're moving to a special kind of danger zone  
I need a witness, somebody just like you  
So bring an exorcist, a wizard and the holy ghost  
  
You know I'll be there, waiting for someone to believe me  
Remembering it all makes my flesh creep and crawl  
I've seen an ear in the wall  
  
One more reason, one more time  
Someone's searching through my mind  
Now where am I supposed to go  
It's not who you are, it's who you know  
What's it gonna be?  
  
I knew you would answer, I'm the curiosity  
You could miss a chance because the fool might see reality  
There it is, in the corner, you must be going blind  
What's wrong? Were you born before your God invented eyes?  
  
It's got to be there, grinding away at my secrets  
It's growing so dark and you can't see it all  
I'll turn on some lights so you're sure not to fall  
It's next to the eye in the wall
