Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees  
Baby, just get on your knees  
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please  
Baby just say pretty please  
  
I'll be back at 11, you just act like a peasant  
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present  
Yeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'  
I appreciate the gifts like the whips and them bezzles  
Now it's bells and the whistles, now I'm makin' it sizzle  
And it's ready, come and get it, it's takin' off like a missile  
Let me see what you're workin' with, If you're ridin', I'm murkin' it  
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it  
  
I don't need a dozen roses  
You ain't gotta wine and dine, no  
I don't need a pretty poet  
Oooh, gettin' all emotional  
You gotta beg for it, beg for it  
I wanna see you lookin' up  
Baby I'ma need you to beg for it  
  
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees  
Baby, just get on your knees  
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please  
Baby just say pretty please  
  
Gimme brain, assume the position  
Make me way smarter like you was a magician  
Paid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition  
Good head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission  
You make me cum down, make it run down  
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the run down  
You got that legendary, this shit is freak, scary  
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry  
  
I don't need a dozen roses  
You ain't gotta wine and dine, no  
I don't need a pretty poet  
Oooh, gettin' all emotional  
You gotta beg for it, beg for it  
I wanna see you lookin' up  
Baby I'ma need you to beg for it  
  
Cause we are just animals  
Baby it's primal  
I want you on all fours  
And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl  
If you want it all  
It's non negotiable  
So do as I say  
If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss  
  
I don't need a dozen roses  
You ain't gotta wine and dine, no  
I don't need a pretty poet  
Oooh, gettin' all emotional  
You gotta beg for it, beg for it  
I wanna see you lookin' up  
Baby I'ma need you to beg for it  
  
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees  
Baby, just get on your knees  
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please  
Baby just say pretty please
