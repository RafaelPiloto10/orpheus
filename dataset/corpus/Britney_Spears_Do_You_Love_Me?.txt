Feat Usher  
  
[Verse:]  
(Usher)  
  
You think it's fine, you think it's ok. When you down, your going back up. You
can never see when love is gonna hit you, no, oooh  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Usher)  
  
Do you love me?  
  
(Britney)  
  
Only with the groove  
  
(Usher)  
  
Do you love me?  
  
(Britney)  
  
Only when you sing  
  
(Usher)  
  
But I'm singing right now baby  
  
(Britney)  
  
But you still can't understand. It was over a long time. Get it round in your
head oooooh  
  
[Verse 2:]  
(Usher)  
  
It happened on a friday night. She came round with drinks and snacks  
  
(Britney)  
  
I found the message on his message machine.. Oh from another women, I loved
you and I wish I could sing  
  
(Chrous x 1)  
[Verse 3:]  
(Britney)  
  
I hate you  
I despise you  
I loved you  
You ruined it.  
Oooh  
  
(Chorus X 2)
