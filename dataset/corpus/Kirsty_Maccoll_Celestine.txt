Oh she is hot, she's hot, she's hot  
She's just a wild and wicked slut  
And she lives inside my head and stops me sleeping  
And when I think she's finally gone  
Some guy arrives and turns her on  
Then she parties until dawn  
This can't go on Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
You're killing me so slowly  
So many men, so many fights  
So many parties and late nights  
She plumbs the depths and hits the heights  
That Celestine  
She pretends that she can't hear me  
She pretends she's nowhere near me  
She just goes quiet and pretends  
That she's not in  
But Celestine, I know you're there  
In your exotic underwear  
And you are fixing up your hair now, Celestine  
Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
You're killing me so slowly  
My lover looked into my eyes  
And I could tell by his surprise  
It was not me he saw in there but Celestine  
And now it's her that he lusts after  
I can hear that wicked laughter  
Still he comes to me but I know where he's been  
Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
You're killing me so slowly  
Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
You're killing me so slowly  
My lover hasn't got a clue  
He doesn't know that he's untrue  
And it's not me he makes love to but Celestine  
Oh, yes she's hot, she's hot, she's hot  
I guess she's everything I'm not  
And she lives inside my head and stops me sleeping
