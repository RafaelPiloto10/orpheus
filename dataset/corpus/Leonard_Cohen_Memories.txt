Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel  
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel  
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl  
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will  
So won't you let me see  
I said "won't you let me see"  
I said "won't you let me see  
Your naked body?"  
  
Just dance me to the dark side of the gym  
Chances are I'll let you do most anything  
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice  
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice  
Ah but no you cannot see  
She said "no you cannot see"  
She said "no you cannot see  
My naked body"  
  
So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust  
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us  
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love  
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust  
And all my faith to see  
I said all my faith to see  
I said all my faith to see  
Her naked body
