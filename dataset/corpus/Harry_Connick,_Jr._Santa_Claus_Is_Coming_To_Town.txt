You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making a list  
And checking it twice  
Gonna find out  
Who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees when you are sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows when you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town
