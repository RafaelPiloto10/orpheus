Yo, for those who live the way that I live  
We came a long way  
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest  
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas  
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father  
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar  
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow  
Ain't nothing free in the world in life  
No matter who you are, everybody got they price  
And some cost more than other's  
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living  
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'  
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips  
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin  
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends  
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL  
It's Nas and R. Kell  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Never thought that I'd ever live this life  
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side  
Anything I want, I can say it's mine  
No more worries 'bout how can I provide  
  
Money makes the world go round  
(Nothin' move but the money)  
You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round  
(Said nothin' move but the money)  
  
[R. Kelly]  
Oh, many say it's wrong cause I love to spend  
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins  
All I wanna do try, and let you know  
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke  
  
Money makes the world go round  
(Money makes the world go round)  
You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does  
(Still nuttin' move but the money)  
Said money makes the world go round  
(Money make the world go round, what?  
Still nuttin' move but the money)  
Nothing but the money  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does  
  
Feels so good, yeah, yeah  
So good, this life I finally live  
And feels so real  
So real this freedom I finally feel  
Show me the money  
  
Money makes the world go round  
(Go money, go money)  
You believe it if you want to  
Money makes the world go round  
(Go money, go money, yo)  
Said that almighty dollar  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does  
(Still don't nuttin' move but the money)  
This brother's got to have it  
Money makes the world go round  
From sun up till the sun goes down  
(Yeah, what?)  
So much money  
  
Money makes the world go round  
Hey, makes the world go round  
Money makes the world go round  
  
Money makes the world go round  
Show me a man that don't need money  
Money makes the world go around  
And I'll show you a world  
(Show me a world)  
Standing still, oh  
Money makes the world go round  
Yes it does, talking 'bout the loot  
Money makes the world go round
