Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields  
Sold in the market down in New Orleans  
Scarred old slaver knows he's doin' all right  
Hear him whip the women just around midnight  
  
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good  
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should  
  
Drums beatin' cold, English blood runs hot  
Lady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop  
House boy knows that he's doin' all right  
You should have heard him just around midnight  
  
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good  
Brown Sugar, just like a young girl should  
  
Brown Sugar, how come you dance so good  
Brown Sugar, just like a black girl should  
  
I bet your mama was a tent show queen,  
And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen  
I'm no school boy but I know what I like  
You should have heard them just around midnight  
  
Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good  
Brown Sugar, just like a black girl should  
  
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, wooo!  
How come you, how come you dance so good  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wooo!  
Just like a, just like a black girl should  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wooo!
