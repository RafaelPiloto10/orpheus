All I care about is money and the city that I'm from  
I'ma sip until I feel it  
I'ma smoke until it's done  
I don't really give a fuck  
And my excuse is that I'm young  
And I'm only getting older  
Somebody shoula told ya  
I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
I said I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
A strong on  
2 white cups and I got that drink  
It could be purple it could be pink  
Depending on how you mix that shit  
Money to be gotten I'ma get that shit  
Cause I'm on one  
Fuck it I'm on one  
Ah yeah ah yeah  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
  
You know what I'm sippin  
I teach you how to mix it  
But you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't I don't trust these bitches  
They might catch me slipping  
So you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
They might they might catch me slipping  
And put in something different  
So you're the only one  
Cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't I don't trust these bitches  
They might catch me slipping  
So you're the only one

Drizzy drake check me out  
Coming live from the mu-fucking north side  
Kid game run game run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like it's somebody you don't know  
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show  
I can tell I can tell I can tell certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess they didn't really make 'em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still let them girls in  
And tell 'em all leave them cellphones on the table where we see 'em  
I'm all day wit' it man am to the pm  
Niggas hatin' I just wish that they would say it when we see 'em all  
  
That's that shit that drives me crazy  
And it's all that I've been getting lately  
And it's pro'ly why I'm scared to put the time in  
Women wanna fuck like that mean I'm them  
Looking for somethings and I think that I can find them  
In you in you  
  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho oh trust issues  
Ho ohhh
