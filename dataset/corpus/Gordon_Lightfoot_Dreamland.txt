You come to me in times of need  
When you can't find anyone  
You seem to be much better off now  
There's a rainbow number one  
We could see life through the gutter then  
Till it caused my heart to break  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to take  
  
Sometimes I remember when  
We were all dressed up in still  
I don't recall the gist of it all  
But you drove the young men wild  
You could wrap me around your finger  
Till it caused my heart to break  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to take  
  
So if you need me near you  
You can do it if you choose  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to lose  
  
You make me do what you want me to do  
Then you run the rules on me  
You seem to be the wiser now  
Could it be you'be been deceived  
Anytime you felt like tryin'  
You would cause my heart to break  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to take  
  
So if you need me near you now  
You can do it if you choose  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to lose
