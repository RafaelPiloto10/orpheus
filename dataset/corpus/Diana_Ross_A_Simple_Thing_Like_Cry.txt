If it didn't hurt so bad  
If it didn't hurt so bad  
Maybe I could cry  
If I thought it was all a joke  
And you were putting me on  
If I could just make a wish  
And this moment would be all gone  
If I could see a trace of hope  
Somewhere in your eyes  
Maybe then I could do  
A simple thing like cry  
If it didn't hurt so bad  
If it didn't hurt so bad  
Maybe I could cry  
Don't you know I plan to spend  
Every moment of my life with you  
Now you're trying to tell me  
That my dreams just won't come true  
Thanks for giving me a million reasons why  
But it hurts too bad to do  
A simple thing like cry  
If I thought it was all a joke  
And you were putting me on  
If I could just make a wish  
And this moment would be all gone  
If I could see a trace of hope  
Somewhere in your eyes  
Maybe then I could do  
A simple thing like cry  
If it didn't hurt so bad  
If it didn't hurt me so bad  
Maybe I could  
If it didn't hurt so bad  
Maybe I could cry  
I could cry, cry  
If it didn't hurt me  
If I didn't love you  
Hurt me
