Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
To see you high and lifted up,  
Shining in the light of your glory.  
Lord, Pour out your power and love,  
As we sing holy, holy, holy.  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
To see you high and lifted up,  
Shining in the light of your glory.  
Lord, Pour out your power and love,  
As we sing holy, holy, holy.  
Holy, holy, holy  
(You are)  
Holy, holy, holy  
Holy, holy, holy  
I want to see you.  
Holy, holy, holy  
(You are)  
Holy, holy, holy  
Holy, holy, holy  
I want to see you.  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart  
I want to see you, I want to see you.  
I want to see you.  
I want to see you...
