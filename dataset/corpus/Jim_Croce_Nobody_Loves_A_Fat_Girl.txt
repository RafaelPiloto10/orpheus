Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love  
Nobody seems to want me  
I'm just a truck upon the highway of love  
  
I'm all alone inside of my form  
When every ounce of me is dyin' to keep somebody warm  
Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love  
  
Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love  
Nobody seems to want me  
I'm just a truck upon the highway of love  
The only game I can get the boys to play  
Is to have them sit around and try to guess how much I weigh  
Nobody loves a fat girl  
But oh how a fat girl can love, pretty mama  
Oh how a fat girl can love
