So you need to kick up your heels  
Baby, I can understand  
Don't you know how it's making me feel?  
I want to be your only man  
  
When it comes right down to the wire  
I just need a touch of your fire  
But you're livin' it up  
You're givin' it up  
  
Seems I'm always waiting for you  
To find your yesterday  
I think I know what you're tryin' to do  
I got a better way  
  
Baby, soon enough it will end  
You'll be reachin' out for a friend  
But now you're livin' it up  
You're givin' it up all the time  
Please be mine  
  
So good at the runaround  
You're still making me wait outside  
Holding on to broken promises  
So good at the runaround  
I don't want to stand in line  
It's my turn, baby  
Please just let me in  
  
Though you're always out on the town  
I feel your loneliness  
While your life is leading you 'round  
It's just like an empty kiss  
  
When it comes right down to the truth  
Well, it comes right down to you  
You've been givin' it up  
And losin' in love every time  
Please be mine  
  
So good at the runaround  
You're still making me wait outside  
Holding on to broken promises  
So good at the runaround  
I don't want to stand in line  
It's my turn, baby, please  
  
So good at the runaround  
I still fall for the same old lies  
Holding on to broken promises  
So good at the runaround  
I don't want to lose this time  
It's my turn, baby, let me in  
Just let me in  
Baby, please just let me in
