I'm on the outside looking in  
What do I see  
So much of this left to begin  
Where would I be  
Out on the outside looking in  
Cover me through this night  
  
I guess I don't know what's left to say  
Hear me out  
All of the dreams of yesterday  
Keep breaking me down  
What's on the outside  
Can you say?  
Or am I getting carried away?  
  
[Chorus]  
It's in your mind  
It's in your eyes  
So it's goodbye again  
It's way past time  
For one last try  
So it's goodbye again  
  
Goodbye again  
  
I'm getting on  
What's the use?  
You know how I get  
I can't decide which is the truth  
At least not yet  
I got the feeling that it's you  
What can be said alone in this room?  
And now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who wants you now?  
Maybe somebody else  
I'll wait around  
Maybe you'll forget  
You were never here  
Maybe forget  
You were ever,  
Never, here  
  
I'm on the outside looking down  
What do I see?  
So much of this cold in the ground  
Where would I be?  
Out on the outside looking down  
Cover me before you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're falling out  
I'm falling in  
So it's goodbye again  
It's way past time  
For one last try  
So it's goodbye  
Again  
  
[Chorus]
