I've been to hell. I spell it, I spell it DMV  
Anyone that's been there knows precisely what I mean  
Stood there and I've waited and choked back the urge to scream  
And if I had my druthers I'd screw a chimpanzee-call it pointless  
  
When I need relief I spell it THC  
perhaps you may know vaguely what I mean  
I sit back and smoke away huge chunks of memory  
As I slowly inflict upon myself a full lobotomy-call it pointless  
  
Barbecues, tea kettles, gobs of axle grease  
There comes a time for every man to sail the seas of cheese  
Now, life's a bowl of bagel dogs, but there are unpleasantries  
Cold toilet seats, dentist chairs and trips to DMV-call it pointless  
  
I've been to hell. I spell it, I spell it DMV  
Anyone that's been there knows precisely what I mean  
I've stood in line and waited near an hour and fifteen  
And if I had my druthers I'd screw that chimpanzee-call it pointless
