A man stood in the shadows his face was dripping sweat  
He took a break from running but he wasn't done yet  
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds  
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town  
The town line's far away and  
He won't sleep for days  
Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife  
Now the sheriff's men have got him running for his life  
  
He should have known that girl was trouble but he wasn't thinking clear  
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer  
But a deputy did see them and tracked the sheriff down  
Just had time to grab his clothes and high ball out of town  
  
The town line's far away and  
He won't sleep for days  
And even if he makes it, there's nothing he can do  
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasn't heard the news  
  
A man stood in the shadows thinking about the past  
About all the women he had known and living life too fast  
But he heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head  
Should have known the sheriff wouldn't rest till he was dead  
  
The town line's far away and  
He's six feet in the grave  
He's lying there with Annie, who was the sheriff's wife  
Till the sheriff and his men robbed them of their lives
