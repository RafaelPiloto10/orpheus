Love can seem such a mystery  
Confusing though it may be  
It's the one thing that we all need most  
  
Love can make your world go round  
Sometimes it can bring you down  
Yet there's no way to avoid the fall  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
  
Love will finally bring us all  
Together eventually  
There's only one road for us all  
  
Releasing our fear of the unknown  
Believing in what could be  
Now it's time for each of us to answer the call  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
  
Sometimes love can be so true  
Sometimes it's running out on you  
No matter how hard you try  
You can't avoid the fall  
Only love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Believe in what could be  
Now its time for each of us  
To answer the call  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Together eventually  
Love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Together eventually  
Love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Together eventually  
Love conquers all
