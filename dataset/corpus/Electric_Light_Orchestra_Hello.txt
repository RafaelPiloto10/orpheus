Hello, hello  
It's great to see you once again  
It's been so long, we were such friends  
Long time ago  
  
Hello, hello  
Your smiling face, your warm embrace  
We've been apart far too long  
It felt so wrong  
  
Nice to know, you're coming over  
Nice to know, the wait is over  
  
Hello, hello  
Is that a smile on your face?  
Here's a kiss, just in case  
This one's for you  
  
Hello, hello  
It's great to see you once again  
It's been so long, we were such friends  
Long, long time ago
