Do you want to dance  
Would you take a chance with me  
Let the music play  
Dance your life away, be free  
Don't you know that with the music  
You're dancing all your troubles away  
Do you wanna dance  
Would you take a chance today  
Do you wanna dance  
Would you take a chance today  
Come on baby  
Do you wanna dance  
Come on everybody  
You've gotta take a chance  
Come on baby  
Do you wanna dance  
Come on everybody  
  
Please don't be so shy  
Come on, just give it a try for me  
Don't you feel the beat  
It's as easy as one, two, three  
Don't you know that with the music  
You're dancing all your troubles away  
Do you wanna dance  
Would you take a chance today  
Do you wanna dance  
Would you take a chance today  
Come on baby  
Do you wanna dance  
Come on everybody  
You've gotta take a chance  
  
Come on, lets, baby,  
Please dance with me baby  
I know you do it so good  
I'll be waiting all night  
Just to make you feel right  
And now it's up to you  
Come on and boogie with me  
Come on baby  
Do you wanna dance  
Come on everybody  
You've gotta take a chance
