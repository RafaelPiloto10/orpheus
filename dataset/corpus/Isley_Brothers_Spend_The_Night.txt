Spend the night  
With me tonight  
C'est soir tonight  
  
Spend the night  
With me tonight  
Tonight tonight  
  
Why go home to an empty bed?  
Why try to fight those passions in your head?  
We're two hearts on fire  
Fueled by a simple touch  
With love and desire we both need so much  
  
You're the girl  
Only girl  
So right for me  
  
You're the girl  
Golden girl  
  
Spend the night  
With me tonight  
C'est soir tonight  
  
Spend the night  
With me tonight  
Tonight tonight  
  
Listen,  
I'm not out just for an easy lay  
I really love you in a special way  
Unlock the door girl  
We can throw away the key  
I want more of you  
And girl here's all of me  
  
You're the girl  
Only girl  
So right for me  
  
You're the girl  
Golden girl  
  
Spend the night  
With me tonight  
C'est soir tonight  
  
Spend the night  
With me tonight  
Tonight tonight
