You had me to get her.  
And here, I thought it was me.  
I was changin', arrangin' my life to fit your lies.  
It's all said and all done.  
I gave it all for the long run.  
Can she say the same thing?  
I guess this is good bye and good luck.  
(I can't be what you want me to be)  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry for changing.  
I'm sorry it had to be this way.  
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend.  
But, I won't apologize for who I am.  
  
No, no.  
  
Remember the time when you said  
You were out with your best friend.  
But it wasn't the best friend  
That you know I thought you meant and  
I used to accept it,  
I didn't know I could be free.  
But I am, and I won't go back  
'cause you so don't deserve me.  
(I don't even want to be her)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I thank you for this hopeless war  
Cause through the pain now I'm stronger now than before.  
Now I'm more.  
I don't need you anymore.  
I'm sorry.  
(Listen close I won't say this again)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm sorry for changing.  
I'm sorry it isn't like it was.  
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend.  
But, I won't apologize,  
Why should I apologize,  
No, I won't apologize for who I am
