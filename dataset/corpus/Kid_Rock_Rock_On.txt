Tears on the pillow  
Is all you leave behind  
And the only thing you know, this time  
Is it's time to let go  
So put the key under the mat  
And don't you look back, just  
  
Rock on, baby rock on  
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone  
Cause trapped in these blues, ain't where you belong  
So baby rock on  
  
Let the songs and the static  
Fight for the dial  
Inside an addict's last passin' mile  
Well I know it ain't easy, but the wheel's in your hand  
And who knows where you'll land, so just  
  
Rock on, baby rock on  
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone  
And may the good Lord God bless you, and help you along  
Now baby rock on  
  
And baby don't stop, just  
  
Rock on, baby rock on  
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone  
I know your heart's black and blue, but life don't last long  
So baby rock on  
  
Baby rock on
