Last time you saw me,  
I was walking, out the door.  
Got a nasty habit,  
Comin', back for more.  
Ain't just a threat no!  
It's a promise, well kept.  
So when all is said and done,  
I came to shred  
  
Shred! Simply stated,  
Shred! In a word.  
Shred! Simply stated,  
Shred!  
  
Dirty little rumor, circulating round  
Spreadin' like the plague. in every little town.  
Capturing the spirit! and goin' to the head.  
Comin' from a blindspot,  
Comin' out to shred! shred!  
  
You know me  
  
Go!  
Next time you see me!  
I'll be walking, through that door.  
And all those nasty habits,  
Risin' up once more.  
Here comes the promise,  
In actions not said.  
So make no bones about it  
I'm back to shred!  
  
You or me.  
Shred! Simply.  
Shred! Shred!  
Shred! In a word  
Shred! Shred! Shred!  
Shred!!! Shred!
