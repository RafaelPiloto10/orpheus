The snow is in the north  
The icy wind is blowing  
In seas that I don't know  
You're losing me babe  
My eyes are filled with crying  
For seven days now  
If you don't come back to me  
I feel the flood is coming  
You're losing me  
You're losing me  
You're losing me, yeah  
  
From deep into the night  
In seas that I don't know  
A hurricane is raging  
In my emotions  
The mist begins to rise  
You're losing me, babe  
My heart is ever changing  
For seven days now  
If you don't come back to me  
I see the flood is coming  
  
You're losing me  
You're losing me  
You're losing me  
  
Rain on my face is like a river  
All I can do is let it run  
Ice in my blood that makes me shiver  
I need your smile to bring me back the sun  
  
If you don't come back to me  
I see the flood is coming, yeah  
  
You're losing me...
