Esta es la casa (This is the house)  
Este es el cerro (This is the hill)  
Esta es la historia (This is the story)  
Es algo chiquitito (It's a little thing)  
  
This is the house  
This is the hill  
This is the story, it's a little thing  
A lock of hair  
An invisible smoke trail  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh, oh, oh everything changes  
  
This is your picture (it's in black and white)  
This is the family having a party  
There's a crack in the ceiling  
And there's an open door  
Nothing there but the dust and the rust  
Oh, oh, oh everything changes
