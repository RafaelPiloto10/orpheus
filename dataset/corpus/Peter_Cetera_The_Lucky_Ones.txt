Sometimes you're sentimental  
I know exactly what to do  
And if I'm temperamental  
You calm me down and you pull me through  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the lucky ones  
We have one another  
When the end of the day has come  
I return to you  
  
Life can be so demanding  
Sometimes it's hard to make it through  
It's love and understanding  
You give to me, I give to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our own fairy tale  
Our favorite bedtime story  
One that we won't forget  
We fell in love  
We knew from the start  
We'd always be together  
The first time that we met  
Can't forget  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All alone in the setting sun  
I'll have you and you'll have me
