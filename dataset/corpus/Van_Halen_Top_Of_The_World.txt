Hey, baby, whew!  
I know that you believe in me,  
That's all I ever need, uh huh.  
No, no, nothing's gonna stop me,  
Nothing will be scaring me, oh no  
Hey baby, it's the only way out  
Oh, little darling,  
C'mon what's it all about?  
Standing on top of the world  
For a little while.  
Standing on top of the world  
Gonna give it all we got.  
Oh, I know it won't hurt,  
I gotta have a little taste  
I just want to sink my teeth in that  
Fine piece of real estate, yeah  
Hey baby, make it nice and sweet,  
Oh, little darling  
Let's take a walk down easy street  
Standing on top of the world,  
For a little while.  
Standing on top of the world  
Let's give it all we got, oooh oooh  
Baby, gotta feeling, oooh oooh,  
Oh, I want to touch it,now, oooh oooh oooh,  
See the whole wide world turn upside down.  
Hey, baby, whew!  
Someday, we'll be  
Standing on top of the world  
For a little while  
Standing on top of the world  
Till we got stung.  
Standing on top of the world  
For a little while.  
Standing on top of the world  
Gonna give it all we got.  
(Standing on top) Hey, baby.  
(Standing on top) Hey darling  
Standing on top,  
Standing on top,  
Standing on top
