I'm headed for the border  
It's on my mind  
And nothin' really matters  
I've got to be on time  
Look in the view mirror  
Is he hot on my tracks  
Is he getting nearer  
I feel some heat is on my back  
  
[Chorus]  
(Speed demon)  
Speedin' on the freeway  
Gotta get a lead way  
(Speed demon)  
Doin' it on the highway  
Gotta have it my way  
(Speed demon)  
Mind is like a compass  
I'm stoppin' at nothin'  
(Speed demon)  
(He say) Pull over boy and get your ticket right  
  
And nothin' gonna stop me  
Ain't no stop and go  
I'm speedin' on the midway  
I gotta really burn this road  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Speed demon, you're the very same one  
Who said the future's in your hands  
The life you save could be your own  
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law  
Gonna live each day and hour like  
For me there's no tomorrow  
  
Go! Go! Go! Aaow!  
  
[Chorus]
