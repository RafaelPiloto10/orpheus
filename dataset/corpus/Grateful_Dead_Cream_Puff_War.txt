No, no! She can't take your mind and leave  
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve  
  
I can't believe that she really wants you to die  
After all it's more than enough to pay for your lie  
  
Wait a minute, watch what you're doin' with your time  
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah  
  
Well, can't you see that you're killing each others soul  
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go  
  
Your constant battles are getting to be a bore  
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war
