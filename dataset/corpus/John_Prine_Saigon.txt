You got everything that a girl should grow  
I'm so afraid to kiss you I might lose control  
You can hold me tighter but turn loose of my gun  
It's a sentimental present all the way from Saigon  
Honey, honey, honey, please call me  
You don't need no money we can do it for free  
I got a friend in Phoenix with a two-way radio  
All the static in my attic getting ready to blow  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
All the static in my attic getting ready to blow  
My head is getting tighter, Lord I'm starting to squeak  
I was talking to the mailman late last week  
He had a letter in his sweater from Stuttering Don  
He said things are getting better in  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Things are getting better back in Saigon  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Things are getting better back in Saigon  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Things are getting better back in Saigon  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Saigon, honey, honey, honey  
Things are getting better back in Saigon
