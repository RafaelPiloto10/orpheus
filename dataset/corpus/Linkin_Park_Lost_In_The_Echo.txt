(Yeah) (Yo)  
You were that foundation  
Never gonna be another one, no  
I followed, so taken  
So conditioned I could never let go  
Then sorrow, then sickness  
Then the shock when you flip it on me  
So hollow, so vicious  
So afraid I couldn't let myself see  
That I could never be held  
Back up, no, I'll hold myself  
Check the rep, yep you know my rail  
Forget the rest let them know my hell  
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell,  
Kept respect up the vets stay their,  
Let the rest be to tell they tale  
That I was there saying  
  
[Chorus]  
And these promises broken  
Deep, feeble  
Each word gets lost in the echo  
So one last lie I can see through  
This time I finally let you  
Go, go, go  
  
Test my will, test my heart  
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up  
Y'all go hard, I go smart  
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?  
I've seen that frustration  
Big cross, they're lost but don't know  
And I've come back unshaken  
Let down, I've lived and let go  
So you can let it be known  
I don't hold back, I hold my own  
I can't be mad, I can't be calm  
I can't sing flat, it ain't my tone  
I can't fall back, I came too far  
Hold myself up and love my scars  
Let the bells ring wherever they are  
'Cause I was there saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, you can tell 'em all now  
I don't back up, I don't back down  
I don't fold up, and I don't bow  
I don't roll over, don't know how  
I don't care where the enemies are  
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!  
Won't forget how I got this far  
And every time, saying  
  
[Chorus]
