Have you ever known a free lancer  
Thinks that he's a camper  
Known around my way as the cramper  
Like P.M.S. always pokin'  
  
But he won't go away with a little Motrin  
Now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder  
The worms kinda like I guess a modern day Felix Unger  
When ya first meet em ya think he's O.K.  
  
But then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way  
Hear say here I say through the grapevine  
He squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line  
Just like a little fuckin' fag  
  
He always wants to get high but never has a bag  
Never works says he can't find the right job  
Ain't got a dime and when he does he's a tightwad  
He's the dampest there's no one damp  
  
Huh huh.... he's the mother fuckin cramper  
Now the crampers red, there's no one redder,  
He rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater  
He's sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer  
  
You come home he's at your house drinkin' your last beer  
Pokin' and strokin' he makes you want to belt him  
Always wearin' out his mother fuckin' welcome  
And then sporty's never that cautious  
  
He sips from your forty and he always backwashes  
Talk about a certain subject, he'll jinx it  
Let him borrow a shirt, the stooge always shrinks it  
He's the dampest, there's no one damper  
  
Huh huh.... he's the mother fuckin' cramper
