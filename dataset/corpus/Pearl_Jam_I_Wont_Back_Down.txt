No, I won't back down  
No, I won't back down  
You can stand me up at the gates of Hell, but I won't back down  
  
I will stand my ground, won't be turned around  
I will keep my world from draggin' me down, I won't back down  
No, I won't back down  
  
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out  
Hey, I will stand my ground  
No, I won't back down  
  
Oh, I know what's right, I got just one life  
I will keep this world from pushin' me around, I'll stand my ground  
No, I won't back down  
  
Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out  
Hey, I will stand my ground  
Hey, I will stand my ground  
And I won't back down  
  
And I won't back down, no I won't back down
