Such a wicked vicious woman,  
black magic voodoo queen  
Les-bo nymphomaniac,  
ooh, she's got a girlfriend that is seventeen  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
Stole the rent and drank all my J.D,  
she went and hi-jacked my brand new car  
I say A.C, she says D.C,  
the damned bitch is just too bizarre  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
I call her liar  
Her eyes burn the flame  
Liar, the princess of pain  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Such a wicked vicious woman,  
the hellraiser finally pushed her luck  
Before I finally leave her in her dust,  
I'm gonna ...........her till she can't stand up  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
I call her liar  
Her eyes burn the flame  
Liar, the daughter of DeSade  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye Ballcrusher  
Bye bye bye
