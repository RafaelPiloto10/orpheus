What do you want, baby  
One last piece of my heart  
What do you need, baby  
We could make a new start  
  
I'm not scared  
All the nights alone  
Lying there crying with the television on  
Watching those scoops about love and happiness  
Wonder what I ever did to deserve a fate like  
  
I don't wanna be around  
For that famous final scene  
I just can't help myself  
I'm a fool for your love  
  
Leave me alone, please  
My heart can't take any more  
You left me going crazy  
It started like just like a phone  
  
You're the number one  
You're the only one I need  
If you don't want my love  
Then set me free  
  
I don't wanna be around  
For that famous final scene  
I can't help myself  
I'm a fool for your love  
  
Don't come closer  
You know I'm easy to phone  
You don't love me  
Any fool can see  
I'm telling you goodbye  
Bye, bye  
  
Leave me alone, please  
My heart can't take anymore  
Leave me alone, please  
Let me walk out that door  
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone  
  
I don't wanna be around  
For that famous final scene  
I just can't help myself  
I'm a fool for your love  
  
I'm a fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone  
A fool for your love  
I'm a fool for your love  
Leave me alone, please  
My heart can't take it no more  
Leave me alone, leave me alone
