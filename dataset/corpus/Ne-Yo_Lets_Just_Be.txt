We can watch a dvd  
Baby  
Sit up  
In the house and be  
Just be there  
You ain't gonna get  
Cute for me  
Truthfully  
I prefer you  
With no make up  
In one of my t-shirts  
Bunny slippers  
On your feet, girl  
And just try to be  
All up under me  
On the couch  
In front of the tv  
Baby that's gangsta  
  
Let's just be  
(Babe)  
Baby let's just be  
Ain't gonna be  
No runaround  
In these streets  
(These streets baby)  
Just my girl and me  
(And me)  
Doin' whatever babe  
Let's just be  
  
Dinner  
From the microwave, ok  
Girl  
I'm gonna put  
My cell away  
No distractions  
We're just gonna  
Take this day  
To lay around together  
And be lazy  
Play a video game  
Or maybe  
I'll paint your toenails  
I'll sing you a song  
If you want me to  
Girl whatever you  
Want to do  
It's so simple  
  
Let's just be  
Baby, let's just be  
(Let's just be)  
Ain't gonna be  
No runaround  
In these streets  
(Streets)  
Just my girl and me  
(Girl and me, baby)  
Doin' whatever babe  
Let's just be  
(Let's just be)  
  
Baby, let's just be  
Ain't gonna be  
No runaround  
In these streets  
(Oh)  
Just my girl and me  
(Mmhhmm)  
Doin' whatever babe  
  
Wrapped up in my arms  
Girl until the morn  
Nothing is better my baby  
Soon we'll fall asleep  
Then eventually  
We'll wake up  
And I'll be ready  
(Baby, wake up)  
  
Let's just be  
Overcome  
By passionate love  
Let's just be  
Oh, overwhelmed  
By each other's touch  
Let's just be  
On the brink  
Of explosion when we  
When we  
Girl when we, when we  
Just be, ooh baby  
Can we just  
Can we just  
  
Let's just be  
(Be)  
Baby, let's just be  
(Be)  
Ain't gonna be  
No runaround  
In these streets  
Just my girl and me  
Doin' whatever babe  
Let's just be  
  
Baby, let's just be  
Ain't gonna be  
No runaround  
In these streets  
Just my girl and me  
Doin' whatever babe
