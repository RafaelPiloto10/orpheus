Every time I leave  
You say you won't be there  
And you're always there  
Every time I cry your name at night  
You pull close and say it's alright  
I look in your eyes, just like the rain  
Washing me, rain wash over me  
Touching your face, I feel the heat of your heartbeat  
Echo in my head like a scream  
What you do to me!  
Waited so long I can't wait another day without you  
  
Jet City Woman  
It's a long way, home to my  
Jet City Woman  
I see her face everywhere, can't get her out of my mind  
  
Whenever I'm alone I'm thinking  
There's a part missing from my life  
Wonder where I'd be without your love  
Holding me together now I'm  
Watching the time tick, tick away  
Face grows longer every day  
Fortunes are lost on the women I've seen  
But without you I can't breathe  
You're the air to me!  
Waited so long I can't wait another day without you  
  
Jet City woman  
Got to find my way home to her  
Jet City Woman  
I see her face everywhere I look!  
Jet City Woman  
Just a thousand miles and I'll be there  
Jet City Woman, to make the clouds go away  
Time for some blue sky!  
  
Waited so long now the plane's delayed  
An hour, reminds me of all our days apart  
Hold on, just a little longer  
  
Jet City woman  
Wonder where I'd be, you're the air to me  
Jet City Woman  
Eyes like the rain, rain down on me  
Jet City woman  
No more nights alone  
I'm almost home now  
Jet City Woman  
Close my eyes, I'm there in my Jet City
