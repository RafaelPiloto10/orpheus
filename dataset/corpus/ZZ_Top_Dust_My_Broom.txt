I'm gonna get up in the morning  
I believe I'll dust my broom.  
I'm gonna get up in the morning  
I believe I'll dust my broom.  
Well my best gal I'll be leaving  
So my friend, get out my room  
  
I'm gonna write a letter to China  
See if my baby's over there.  
I'm gonna write a letter to China  
See if my baby's over there.  
If she ain't up in the Hawaiian Islands,  
Must be in Ethiopia somewhere  
  
I believe believe my time ain't long.  
I believe believe my time ain't long.  
I've had to quit my baby and give up my happy home.
