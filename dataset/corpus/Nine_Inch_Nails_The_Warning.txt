Some say it was a warning  
Some say it was a sign  
I was standing right there  
When it came down from the sky  
The way it spoke to us  
You felt it from inside  
Said it was up to us  
Up to us to decide  
  
You've become a virus  
That has eaten up its host  
We've been watching you with all of our eyes  
And what you seem to value most  
  
So much potential  
Or so we used to say  
Your greed, self importance, and your arrogance  
You piss it all away  
  
We heard a cry  
We've come to intervene  
You will change your ways, and you will make amends  
Or we will wipe this place clean  
  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Your time is tick-tick-ticking away  
Ticking away
