Headin' from El Paso  
Ridin' down the highway  
Look out my window  
What do I see  
Some armadillo done gone crazy  
Flew in front of semi  
Man, looks like squash to me  
  
Thinkin' 'bout my my baby  
Livin' down in Houston  
Wonder if that squashes armadillo too  
Guess I'll stop in Greenland  
And have me some ol' veggies  
This highway will do that to you  
  
I'm thinkin' Squash  
On the highway

I'm talkin' Squash  
Out on the highway  
Vitamin D and A and be Complex too  
I'm talkin' Squash

Occasional Cat

In the Winter it's frozen food

Winter kill  
Out on the highway

I'm talkin Squash
