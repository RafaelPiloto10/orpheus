(Gold-Lloyd-Echolette)  
  
This is a national anthem  
From the flip-side of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards  
Hey, tell me it's true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?  
Hey, what do we know,  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Everybody walks this side of the run-way  
Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up...
