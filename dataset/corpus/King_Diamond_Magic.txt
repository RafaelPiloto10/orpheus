In the darkness...after the show  
Outside the Theater, the air is damp and cold  
All the people.. heading for home  
They don't believe, that what they saw was MAGIC  
  
Oh..it was Magic I know  
This night was full of it, I never saw the undertow...No  
Never saw the EVIL, never saw the EVIL  
I never saw the EVIL down below  
  
"I will never forget that night"  
I saw the MAGIC in your eyes  
We will never forget that night  
We saw the MAGIC in each other's eyes

In the darkness.. after the show  
Outside the Theater, the air is damp and cold  
All the people.. they are gone  
Just you and me, and we believe in MAGIC  
  
Oh.. it was Magic I know  
Talking the night away, the things we like are all the same  
want to get to know her, want to get to know her  
I gotta get to know her deep down inside

Suddenly I feel so cold...it feels as if a Ghost is next to me  
Cold breath in my ear, as it whispers: "KISS HER NOW"  
  
Oh.. it was Magic I know  
That kiss one year ago, a magic seal of our eternal love  
Tonight she went to the Theater alone  
But she never came home and I gotta find her now  
  
"I will never forget that night"  
I saw the MAGIC in your eyes  
We will never forget that night  
We saw the MAGIC in each other's eyes  
"I will never forget that night"  
I saw the MAGIC in your eyes  
We will never forget that night  
We saw the MAGIC in each other's eyes
