Yesterday I was on the edge  
Hoping everything was going to work itself out  
A good honest man doing the work of God  
Trying to make things better for Him  
A lover of life in a school for fools  
Trying to find another way to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
New Music, Music, New Music  
Sweet Music can lighten us  
Can brighten the world, can save us  
  
My friend said well, I think I found a way  
To help make myself richer  
I said don't you know , well, it won't be too long before  
The bad ol' devil will get you back  
Back, I said put back your heart and sing , sing while  
You know you're still living  
Sing, sing, sing , while you know there's still  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a look at the world  
Think about how it will end  
There'd be no wars in the world  
If everybody joined the band  
Think about the light in your eyes  
Think about what you should know  
There'd be no wars in the world  
If everybody joined in the show Oh Oh  
  
Think about the light in your eyes  
Think about what you should know  
There'd be no wars in the world  
If everybody joined in the show  
In the show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday I was on the edge  
Hoping everything was going to work itself out  
A good honest man doing the work of God  
Trying to make things better for Him  
A lover of life in a school for fools  
Trying to find another way to survive
