River you heard my first cry as a baby  
And like my mom you sang me lullabies  
You knew my fishing pole  
When I was eight years old  
And river you never told me lies  
River I can see you from my window  
Your muddy water makes me feel alone  
River you keep flowing  
Like you know just where you're going  
But river will you ever take me home  
  
River I'm not proud of what I've done  
Somehow my fishing pole became a gun  
Through these prison bars I see  
That you're still running free  
But river I've got no place to run  
River I can see you from my window  
Your muddy water makes me feel alone  
River you keep flowing  
Like you know just where you're going  
But river will you ever take me home  
River I can see you
