Hi. hi. I was running after you for a long time.  
I, I was watching you from  
Actually I've watched you for a long time.  
I like to watch you when you're walking  
Back and forth on the beach.  
And the way your the way your cloth looks.  
I like I like to see the edges  
The bottom of it  
Get all wet when you're walking near the water there.  
It's real nice to talk to you.  
I didn't. I-I-I-I-I, how are you? how are you?  
(oh albino)  
I saw I saw you from your balcony window  
And you were standing there waving at everybody  
It was really great because there was about  
A billion people there, but when I was waving to you,  
Uh, the way your face was, it was so, the way your face was  
It made me feel exactly like we're  
It's not that you were just waving to me, but  
That we were we were waving to each other.  
Really it was really wonderful  
I really felt happy  
It really made me happy  
And. um. I. I just wanted to thank you  
Because  
You  
You really really you made me  
You made me feel good  
And  
Oh I, it's nothing.  
I um. I. well I'm just clumsy.  
Yeah.  
No, it's just a band aid.  
No, it's ok.

Something's always happening to me  
Yeah. well. I'll be seein' ya.
