Your cheatin' heart will make you weep  
You'll try and try and try to sleep  
But sleep won't come the whole night through  
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You'll toss around and call my name  
You're gonna walk the floor the way I do  
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You'll toss around and call my name  
You're gonna walk the floor the way I do  
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you  
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
