Cry like you feel,  
Try like you feel, feel it!  
Try to escape,  
Cry to escape, escape it!  
It's so hard to run away  
He's a virgin killer  
  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,  
You're a demon's desire!  
  
Death on the screen,  
Sadistic magazines, watch out  
Suicides ev'ryday,  
Political ways, get it  
Well, you can't find new ways  
But he's a virgin killer  
  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,  
You're a demon's desire!  
  
Garbage in the streams,  
A-bombs in your dreams, look out  
Sharks in the pictures,  
Exorcist prescriptions, forget it  
Try to get away from that,  
'cause he's a virgin killer  
  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,  
You're a demon's desire!
