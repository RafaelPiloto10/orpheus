I heard the voice of redemption  
For me there is no exemption  
I started praying  
I heard the voice of satisfaction  
Needing me for benefaction  
I started pleading  
I heard the bells begin to chime  
Warning me oh lord  
Don't let this be my time  
Don't let this be my time  
I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire  
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher  
When nothing fits and nothing seems right  
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you  
You saw me slide, you saw me fall  
We kept our pride through it all  
We started screaming  
When skies are dark, no sun shines through  
I know I see the light in you  
We stopped dreaming and started believing  
I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire  
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher  
When nothing fits and nothing seems right  
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you  
I'll be there  
In my hour of need  
You were there always  
Now it's time for me to be there for you too  
Always  
I'll be there for you
