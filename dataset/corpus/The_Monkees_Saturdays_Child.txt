Monday had a sad child  
Always feeling low down,  
Tuesday had a dream child  
She's always on the go  
Now I'm in love with Saturday's child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.  
  
If you love a Wednesday  
You'll live your life apart now  
And if you love a Thursday  
She's gonna break your heart,  
So I'm in love with Saturday's child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.  
  
Seven days of the week made to choose from  
But only one is right for me  
I know that Saturday's got what it takes, babe.  
I can tell by the way she looks at me  
  
Friday likes the good life  
She'll take you for a ride now  
And Sunday makes a good wife  
But she wants to be a bride  
So I'm in love with Saturday's child  
She drives me wild  
Gonna spend my time  
Makin' sure that Saturday's child is mine.
