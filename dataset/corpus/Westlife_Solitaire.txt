There was a man, a lonely man,  
Who lost his love through his indifference  
  
A heart that cared, that went unchecked,  
Until it died within his silence  
  
[Chorus]  
And Solitaire's the only game in town  
And every road that takes him, takes him down  
And by himself, it's easy to pretend  
He'll never love again  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing Solitaire  
  
A little hope goes up in smoke  
Just how it goes, goes without saying  
  
There was a man, a lonely man  
Who would command the hand he's playing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A little hope goes up in smoke  
Just how it goes, goes without saying  
  
[Chorus]
