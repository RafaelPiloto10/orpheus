This is for my peoples who just lost somebody,  
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady  
Put you hand way up high  
You will never say bye.  
(no no no)  
Momma's, daddy's, sister's, brother's,  
Friends, and cousins.  
This is for my people's who lost their  
Grandmothers  
Lift your head up to the sky  
'Cause we will never say bye.  
  
As a child, there were them times  
I didn't get it, but you kept me inline  
I didn't know  
Why you didn't show up sometimes  
On Sunday mornings  
And I missed you, but what we talked through  
All them grown folk things, separation brings  
You never let me know it, you never let it show  
Because you loved me  
And so much more then to say  
If you were with me today  
Face to face.  
  
I never knew I can hurt like this  
And everyday life goes on like  
I wish I can talk to you for a while  
Wish you but try not to cry  
As time goes bye  
  
And I'm sure you reached a better place  
And still I'd give  
The world to see your face  
Me right here, next to you  
But it's like your gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing to do is say  
Bye, bye-bye  
Bye-bye  
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
  
And you never got a chance to see  
How good I've done  
And you never got to see me  
Back at number one  
I wish that you was here to celebrate together  
I wish that we can spend the holidays together  
I remember when you use to tuck me in at night  
Or the teddy bear you give me I held so tight  
I thought you were so strong,  
You make it through whatever  
Its so hard to accept the fact you gone forever  
  
I never knew I can hurt like this  
And everyday life goes on like this  
I wish I can talk to you for a while  
I miss you but I try not to wish  
As time goes by  
  
And I'm sure you reached a better place  
And I'd still give  
The world is in your face  
Me right here, next to you  
But it's like your gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing to do is say  
Bye, bye-bye  
Bye-bye  
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
  
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody,  
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady  
Put you hand way up high  
You will never say bye.  
(No no no)  
Momma's, daddy's, sister's, brother's,  
Friends, and cousins.  
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers  
Lift your head up to the sky  
'Cause we will never say bye.  
  
I never knew I can hurt like this  
(I never knew it)  
And everyday (everyday I wish that I)  
Life goes on like this (I wish, I wish)  
I wish I can talk to you for a while  
(I wish)  
I miss you but I try not to wish  
(I wish)  
As time goes by

I'd still give the world to see your face  
And me right here, next to you  
And the hardest thing to do  
Is say  
Bye-bye  
Its hard to say  
Bye bye bye bye bye  
So come on  
Somebody sing it with me  
Wave your hands up high  
  
'Cause this is for my peoples that  
Just lost somebody  
This is for everybody  
Just lift your head to the sky  
'Cause we will never say bye-bye
