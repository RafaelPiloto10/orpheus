This is me, I've got a nasty sense of humor  
And a case of high anxiety  
If you please, I would rather be alone  
Let the water running judge me  
  
So I got my life together  
But it's half of what it should be  
So you think you can make it better?  
You better help me, help me  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
There's a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
  
Can't you see I got a perfect explanation  
But keep it deep inside of me?  
Pardon me, but if you really want to know it  
Then you better learn to judge me  
  
So you've got you're life together  
But you say you gotta have more  
So you think I could make it better  
Just be careful what you wish for  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
There's a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
  
Paper clip prediction  
But these pictures are deceiving  
'Cause their colors lost their place  
And now they're dripping down and bleeding  
  
And they're running and running away  
Packed it up and leaving  
And these dreams turn to nightmares  
Like a promise with no meaning  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it  
If this is what you live for  
You might as well forget it  
  
You don't know what you're in for  
This war will never end  
Be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it, get it, get it  
You just might get it, get it, get it, so hold tight  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
There's a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
(You just might get it)  
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
This is me  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
This is me
