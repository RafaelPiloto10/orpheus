Been reaching for a reason for the pain has come  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Been waiting for the season when the healing's done  
(Oh, oh, oh)  
Well, line up in black in white  
This blood runs red on both side  
Broken in two, hurting as one (oh)  
  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as  
  
See the pain and the tragedy in hearts and minds  
Hear the voices, all the chatting after all those crimes  
Well, our past life's dressed in white  
We're all just try to fight  
  
Broken in two, hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as  
  
Line up in black in white  
This blood runs red on both side  
Our past now thrown aside  
We're all just trying to fight  
Broken in two, hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
Hurting as one (oh)  
  
We could be one  
We could be one  
Coming undone  
We could be one  
Hurting as
