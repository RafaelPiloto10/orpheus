In my home town for anyone who sticks around  
You're either lost or you're found  
There's not much in between  
In my home town everything's still black and white  
It's a long long way from wrong to right  
From Sunday morning to Saturday night  
  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
We follow the roads that lead us  
To drugs or Jesus  
  
My whole life, I've tried to run, I've tried to hide  
From the stained-glass windows in my mind  
Refusing to let God's light shine down on me, down on me  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
There's not much space between us  
Drugs or Jesus  
  
Everybody wants acceptance, we all just want some proof  
Everyone's just looking for the truth  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
We're all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
We follow the roads that lead us  
To drugs or Jesus  
Oh, I need you Jesus  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  
  
Hallelujah...
