Just sit yourself down friend  
Pull up a chair friend  
There ain't nobody here friend  
But the people you need  
  
Roll yourself a joint friend  
Empty your head friend  
Make yourself at home friend  
This is where you belong  
  
[Chorus]  
Put your feet up on the fire  
If it makes you feel much better  
Have a glass of homegrown wine  
Don't you think it tastes fine  
  
Tear you away friend  
On a planet to space friend  
Faster than you can think friend  
You'll be there before you know
