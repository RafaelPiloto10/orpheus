Lay me down at your altar, baby  
I'm a slave to this luck  
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tales  
  
I have prayed for a power like you  
To see deep down in my soul  
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower at desert road  
  
Magic, or one, or mystery  
All of you trying to work on me  
I would surrender myself  
Holy hell, and heaven high  
You will open up my eyes  
And I'm finally here  
  
This is spiritual, under your spell  
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel  
Like an angel, oh, at blow  
Like a feather, you make me float  
  
Love you crazy kite on your left  
Lost in sweet ecstasy  
Found a nirvana finally  
  
Magic, or one, or mystery  
All of you trying to work on me  
I would surrender myself  
Holy hell, and heaven high  
You will open up my eyes  
And I am finally here  
  
This is spiritual, under your spell  
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel  
Like an angel, oh, at blow  
Like a feather, you make me float  
  
(You make me float, you make me float)  
  
This is spiritual, under your spell  
So phenomenon, the way you make me feel  
Like an angel, oh, at blow  
Like a feather, you make me float  
  
(You make me float, oh, you make me float)
