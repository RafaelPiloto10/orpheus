'I love you girl' that's what you used to say  
And that no one would ever take it away  
I gave you all I had inside, baby it's alright  
But then you took the love right from my heart  
It's funny a thing so strong can fall apart  
I gave you all I had inside, baby it's alright, ooh  
One day you'll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that you'll change when you never do?  
I've always found a reason to let it slide, baby not this time.  
Ooh, because I know where you're going from here (Don't take me down with you)  
  
Don't take me down (take me down with you)  
'Cause I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)  
And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
You had someone, you had me to love.  
  
Why do we put up all these fronts?  
There's something about the way that you loved me once.  
And why, why is it wrong to want it back again?  
Oh no, one day you'll wear out the lines you always use  
Why do you say that you'' change when you never do?  
I've always found a reason to let it slide, baby not this time.  
Ooh, because I know where you're going from here (Don't take me down with you)  
  
Don't take me down (take me down with you)  
'Cause I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)  
And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
You had someone, you had me to love.  
  
Too many times, I've realized the truth (don't take me down, don't take me  
down) Too many times  
I've seen enough, I've seen it enough to know  
This time you're not, you're not gonna take me down  
Down, down, down, down yeah  
  
Don't take me down (take me down with you)  
'Cause I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)  
And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down.  
You had someone, you had me to love.
