It's a cheating situation  
A stealing invitation  
To take what's not really ours  
To make it through the midnight hours  
It's a cheating situation Just a cheap imitation  
Doing what we have to do  
When there's no love at home  
  
There's no use in pretending  
There'll be a happy ending  
Where our love's concerned  
Sweetheart, we both know  
  
We'll take love where we find it  
Love and try to hide it  
It's all we got  
For we know they're not  
Gonna let us go  
  
It's a cheating situation  
A stealing invitation  
To take what's not really ours  
To make it through the midnight hours  
It's a cheating situation  
Just a cheap imitation  
Doing what we have to do  
When there's no love at home  
  
It's a cheating situation  
When there's no love at home
