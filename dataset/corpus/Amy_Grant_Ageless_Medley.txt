Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
Listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
Too late for walking in the middle,  
Too late to try.  
And it's too late for sitting in the balance,  
No more middle line.  
  
Are you puzzled by the way that you're behaving?  
You wonder why you do the things you do?  
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance?  
It feels like something's got a hold on you.  
  
Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
When I'm losing my sense of direction,  
And I'm needing some strength and protection,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You, and when I,  
When I think I can't stand any longer,  
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
El-Elyon na Adonai,  
Age to age, You're still the same,  
By the power of the name.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
Erkamka na Adonai,  
I will praise and lift You high,  
El Shaddai.  
  
I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly.  
I'm lighter than air.  
  
And I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly,  
And soar through the air.  
  
'Cause I have felt for the first time,  
I can be myself,  
No more faces to hide behind,  
Just a smile,  
And a dream that's mine.  
Even if I am  
The only one,  
Who wants to fly....  
  
I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl,  
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world.  
But that's all right, as long as I can have one wish I pray:  
When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say,  
  
She's got her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes, ya know.  
Just like my father's eyes.... (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing....  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing!  
You know you really gotta sii-hii-yiing!  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing! (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
I have decided,  
I'm gonna live like I believer,  
Turn my back on the deceiver.  
I'm gonna live what I believe.  
I have decided,  
Being good is just a fable,  
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.  
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing.  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing,  
We've all gotta sii-hii-yiiiiiing!  
Come on, sing, sing, sing!
