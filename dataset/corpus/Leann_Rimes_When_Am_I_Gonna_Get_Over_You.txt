You told me on the day that you left me  
To take real good care of myself  
But it's so hard to do  
If I can't have you here to hold me  
When I want nobody else  
  
[Chorus]  
When am I going to get over you  
And stop living in the past  
When am I going to get over you  
  
When my pour heart beats it's last  
Soon you'll wake me and you'll say I've been dreaming  
I'll just have to wait 'til then  
Till my time here is done  
And the Angels come to take me  
Then I'll be with you again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday I may love again  
But you'll be with me here and there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When my pour heart beats it's last  
You told me on the day that you left me
