I hate hoes  
I hate hoes  
I hate hoes  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
All these hoes is the motherfucking same,  
Play you to the left like a motherfucking lame,  
Call you out you motherfucking name,  
Fuck you all lames  
I got game!  
I hate hoes, hoes hate me  
I hate hoes, hoes hate me  
I hate hoes, hoes hate me  
I hate hoes, hoes hate me  
  
For real bitch, don't take the shit wrong  
Thinking I'm nice I'll break you jawbone  
Get the fuck on  
Leave me alone  
Bitch you better go on  
See, you all hoes ain't optimistic  
Cockblockin' bitches  
You unproper bitches  
What's the problem bitches?  
You say your nigga hurt your feelin's  
Well, hoes done hurt mine  
Not once, not twice,  
But bitch all the time  
So I'm a dog to a broad  
Have 'em all crying,  
I done cried before,  
That don't make me a hoe  
That just show me where my feelin's ain't supposed to go  
See, I got the magic stick you dumb bitch  
Other nigga you fuck with, be on some punk shit  
And I'm gonna show you all I don't need no help,  
Just as soon as I loosen my belt  
Bitch!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need a moment,  
I can't stand bitches and hoes  
'cause a bitch is a bitch and a hoe gonna hoe,  
But a woman hold her own  
She got her own home  
She drive her own car  
Buying drinks at the bar  
Take a nigga out to eat  
Take a nigga to the mall  
Treat a nigga good  
And wash a nigga draws  
But bitches ain't shit,  
Always talking shit  
They wanna be the shit  
But is they shit? No  
And hoes, they fuck off the god damn chain  
Everything and everything but don't take names  
So that's a nasty hoe and I can't do shit wit it  
Please get out my face I don't need a case  
Yeah, I love you all respectful women  
Independent women  
I takes 'em out all the time  
But you all hit the baggage need to keep on tracking  
I ain't speaking I ain't talking to nothing  
'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just keep my name out you mouth  
Before you find out how a down south hoe will out  
You're a hater, she's a hater, three a hater, for  
Everywhere I go I see some hating ass hoes  
Southern Belle, Jazzy Belle, Never Monogamous  
?? be hot because my deeper esophagus  
Still they run up on me, smile and phone me,  
Laugh 'cause soon as I turn my back they stab it  
Learn to play fair  
Stop trying to care  
Two hoes to one nigga,  
Bitch, learn to share  
Baby, you dead ass broke  
For hating on the rich chicks  
See how I flow?  
Bitch, put it on you wish list  
Two seater wit the chill on  
My baby daddy put the grill on  
Fixing to put the heels on  
Chrome spokes with the low pros  
And the trunk funk blows up the cedar on the dashboard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the men's national anthem for this year  
All you real women,  
You all can sing this shit too  
If you a hoe and you hate another hoe,  
You can sing this shit too  
If you a bitch and you hate and bitch,  
You can sing this shit too  
So everybody's gonna sing this shit  
I hate hoes, they hate me too  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Yup  
Bitch!
