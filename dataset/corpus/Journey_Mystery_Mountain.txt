Mountain of mystery,  
Rising high above the clouds.  
Mountain of magic,  
Standing tall and proud,  
Your magical veins  
Flowing silver and gold,  
Your cumulus cloud glows misty red,  
As Apollo sets beyond your head.  
Releasing the pressure built over the years  
The mountain is crying hot lava tears  
Molten rock created under vibrations of  
Subterranean thunder  
Ejecting boulders like pieces of sand  
The mountain is  
Giving birth to the land.  
  
Under your feet you feel a rumble  
As thousands of rocks are starting to tumble  
Above the trees where the buzzard flies  
Swirling vapors begin to rise  
Beneath those misty peaks you hide  
A tremendous force boiling deep inside.
