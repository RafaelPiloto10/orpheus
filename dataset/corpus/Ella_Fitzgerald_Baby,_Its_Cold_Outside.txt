I really can't stay  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
I got to go away  
But baby, it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry?  
And father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
But baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink?  
No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break the spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
  
I ought to say no, no, no, Sir  
Mind if I move in closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride?  
I really can't stay  
Oh, baby don't hold out, baby  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
I simply must go  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
But, baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been  
How lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Gosh, your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh, your lips are delicious  
Well, maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to get home  
But, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see  
How can you do this thing to me?  
  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Think of my life long sorrow  
At least there will plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay  
Get over that old out, baby  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Where could you be going  
When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?  
Baby, it's cold, cold outside
