Baby stands before an open window  
Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching her restless day  
  
She turns from her window to me  
Sad smile her apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
And still she spares me the words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting her feelings  
Struggles to speak, but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly it's so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak her troubled mind  
So I'm offering these to her as if to be kind:  
There's a train everyday leaving either way  
There's a world, you know  
There's a way to go  
And you'll soon be gone, it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A child's drawings left there on the table  
And a woman's silk lying, on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To Lock you safe behind this open door  
  
Suddenly it's so clear to me  
That I'd asked you to see what you may never see  
And now my kind words find their way back to me  
There's a train everyday, leaving either way  
There's a world, you know  
You got a way to go  
And I'll soon believe, it's just as well  
This is my opening farewell
