You're as soft as the rose  
You're as sweet as the honey  
You're as warm as the bright morning sun  
You're as cool as the breeze on the last days of April  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
You're like time is to space  
You're like faith is to trustin'  
You're like blue is to feelin' unkind  
You're like joy is for love,  
You're like dreams are for chasin'  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you  
You're my little angel you see  
You're as bright as the moon  
You're as light as a feather  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
Like the rain is for the crops  
You're like food for my thoughts  
You're like true is for knowin' what's not  
You're like leaves are for trees  
You're like bees are for buzzin'  
You're as fine as fine can be  
  
You're as bright as the moon  
You're as light as a feather  
You're as fine as fine can be
