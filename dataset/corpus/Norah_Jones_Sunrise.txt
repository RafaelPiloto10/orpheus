Sunrise, sunrise  
Looks like morning in your eyes  
But the clocks held 9:15 for hours  
Sunrise, sunrise  
Couldn't tempt us if it tried  
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone  
And i said ooh, ooh, ooh, to you  
  
Surprise, surprise  
Couldn't find it in your eyes  
But I'm sure it's written all over my face  
  
Surprise, surprise  
Never something I could hide  
When I see we made it through another day  
  
Then I say, oh, oh, oh, to you  
  
And now the night  
Will throw its cover down on me again  
Oh, and if I'm right  
It's the only way to bring me back  
  
Oh, oh, oh, to you  
Oh, oh, oh, to you
