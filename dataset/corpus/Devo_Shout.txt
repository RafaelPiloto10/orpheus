Shout shout  
I'm shoutin' about the world outside  
I'm shoutin' because you just can't hide  
I'm shoutin' from the plain honest truth  
I'm shoutin' there's so much we could do  
Shout i'm shoutin' shoutin' shoutin'  
  
I'm shoutin' because it's hard to believe  
I'm shoutin' it's so easy to see  
I'm shoutin' we're waitin' for a reply  
I'm shoutin' for the very last time  
  
Shout well baby this one's for you  
Shout for everything that you do  
Shout until the battle is won  
Shout we'll live to fight on and on  
  
And when you add it all together  
And when you roll it in a ball  
And when you watch another pyramid  
  
As it's about to fall  
Remember you were there  
Remember if you care  
All those who held their ground  
When it all came down  
Said shout shout  
Shout it out
