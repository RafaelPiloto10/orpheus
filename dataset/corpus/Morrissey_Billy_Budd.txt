Say, Billy Budd  
So you think you should?  
Oh, everyone's laughing  
Say, Billy Budd  
So you think that you should?  
Everyone's laughing!  
Since I took up with you  
  
Things have been bad  
Yeah, but now it's twelve years on  
Now it's twelve years on  
Yes, and I took up with you  
  
I took my job application  
Into town  
Did you hear? They turned me down  
Yes, and it's all because of us  
Oh, and what was in our eyes  
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah  
  
I said, Billy Budd  
I would happily lose  
Both of my legs  
I would lose both of my legs  
Oh, if it meant you could be free  
Oh, if it meant you could be free  
  
(Don't leave us in the dark!)
