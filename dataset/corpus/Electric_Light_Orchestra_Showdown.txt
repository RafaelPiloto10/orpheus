She cried to the Southern wind  
About a love that was sure to end  
Every dream in her heart was gone  
Heading for a showdown.  
  
Bad dreamer, what's your name?  
Looks like we're riding on the same train  
Looks as though there'll be more pain  
There's gonna be a showdown.  
  
And it's raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
Tonight, the longest night.  
  
She came to me like a friend  
She blew in on the Southern wind  
Now my heart is turned to stone again  
There's gonna be a showdown.  
  
Save me, oh save me  
It's unreal, the suffering  
There's gonna be a showdown.  
  
And it's raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
Tonight, the longest night.  
  
(Raining, raining raining, raining)  
  
Raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
The longest night.  
  
And it's raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
Tonight, the longest night.  
  
You gotta save me, girl  
Well, I'm ready for saving  
I'm a fool for you  
Ya know I'm ready, come on and save me  
  
Can't you feel what you're doing to me, now?  
I'm on the run again.  
  
Gotta save me
