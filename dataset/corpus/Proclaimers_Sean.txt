Sean I'd say the best one  
Came from Tupelo, Mississippi  
I'll tell you now that grown men cry  
And Irish girls are pretty  
  
Though fear and hurt and care  
Can lead me to despair  
I saw why I'm here  
The morning you appeared  
  
Sean, I sat awhile on clouds  
To ask God if he's living  
I should have spent the time  
On knees in thanks for what He's given  
  
From parents smart and strong  
To both of us passed on  
From kings is where you come,  
Through daughters and through sons.
