Up a lazy river by the old mill run  
Lazy river in the noon day sun  
Linger in the shade of a tree  
Throw away your troubles, dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes that mornin', as we roll along  
Blue skies up above ....everyone's in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be  
Up a lazy river with me  
  
Up a lazy river by that old mill run  
That lazy, hazy river in the noon day sun  
You can linger for a while in the shade of a tree  
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream of me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes that bright new mornin' as we roll along  
There may be blue skies up above  
But as long as we're in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be  
If you go up a lazy river with me
