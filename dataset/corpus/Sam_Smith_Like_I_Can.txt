[Verse 1]  
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman  
He could be your preacher, when your soul is down  
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but  
He'll never love you like I can, can  
  
He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance  
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand  
He could have your humour, but I don't understand cause  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can  
  
[Verse 2]  
A chance encounter of circumstance  
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced  
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Bridge]  
We both have demons, that we can't stand  
I love your demons, like devils can  
If you're still seeking an honest man  
Then stop deceiving lord please  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
