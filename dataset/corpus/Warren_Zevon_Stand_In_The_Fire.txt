All you guitar players  
Scalding hot  
And Zeke's going at it  
Givin' it everything he's got  
'Cause anything goes  
Whatever it takes  
I might pitch a fit  
But I won't put on my brakes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire,  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire, stand in the fire, stand in the fire  
  
I see a red-headed girl  
In the red silk dress  
Ya' know, I'm asking her to dance with me  
She might say yes  
Feel the heat  
From the beat  
Don't it burn you too?  
And all I want to do  
Is just... Rock you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stand... In the fire, stand in the fire [Repeat x 2]
