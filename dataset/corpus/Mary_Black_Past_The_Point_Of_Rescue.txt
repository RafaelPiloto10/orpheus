Last night I dreamed you were back again  
Larger than life again, holding me tight again  
Placing those same kisses on my brow  
Sweeter than ever now, lord I remember how  
Couldn't get enough of kissing  
Do you know how much I'm missing?  
No you don't, but I do  
Days like a slow train trickle by  
Even the words that I write refuse to fly  
All that I can hear is your song haunting me  
Can't get the melody out of my head you see  
Distractions I've been using  
Do you know how much I'm losing?  
No you don't, but I do  
But I do and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue  
An is no word from you at all the best that you can do  
Never meant to push or shove you  
Do you know how much I love you?  
No you don't, but I do.
