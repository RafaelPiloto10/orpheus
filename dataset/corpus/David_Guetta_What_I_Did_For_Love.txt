[Verse 1]  
Talking loud, talking crazy  
Locked me outside  
Praying for the rain to come  
Bone dry again  
Guess it's true what they say  
I'm always late  
Say you need a little space  
And I'm in your way  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It hurts, but I remember every scar  
And I've learnt that living is the hardest part  
I can't believe what I did for love  
I can't believe what I did for us, oh  
Crash and we burn into flames  
Stitch myself up and I'd do it again  
I can't believe what I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
[Chorus]  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm a fool for your games  
But I'd always play  
Can't admit it was a waste  
Just too much at stake  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It hurts, but I remember every scar  
And I've learnt that living is the hardest part  
I can't believe what I did for love  
I can't believe what I did for us, oh  
Crash and we burn into flames  
Stitch myself up and I'd do it again  
I can't believe what I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
[Chorus]  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
I can't believe what I did for love
