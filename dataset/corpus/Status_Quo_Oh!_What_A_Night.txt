Walking the tightrope  
And losing the pole  
I hung on by my teeth  
One of those nights  
That didn't feel too right  
Gonna cry myself to sleep  
  
Oh what a night  
Oh what a flight it was  
Oh, oh what a night  
  
No telephone news  
And I'm missing you  
I can't afford to phone  
There's a thousand people  
Using my room  
But I've never felt so alone  
  
I picture you face  
I keep hearing your voice  
I'm dying in the sheets  
I daren't think too much  
So I drink so much  
I still can't get to sleep
