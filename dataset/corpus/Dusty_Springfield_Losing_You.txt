How many tears do you cry  
If love should break your heart in two  
How many tears will I cry  
Now that I know I'm losing you  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
And no matter what you do  
You're still a part of me  
Even though I'm losing you, oh  
  
How many years will go by  
Before my heart begins to mend  
Waiting and wondering why  
I never thought our love could end  
  
I try forgetting you  
But you're still here on my mind  
It would take a miracle  
But someday maybe I'll find  
  
That I'm in the loving arms of someone  
That I'll know, know he's the someone  
Who'll kiss all the heartache away  
And come that day  
I won't mind losing you  
  
Yes, I try forgetting you  
But you're still here on my mind  
It would take, yeah, a miracle  
But someday maybe I'll find  
  
That I'm in the loving arms of someone  
That I'll know, know he's the someone  
Who'll kiss all the heartache away  
And when he comes to me that day  
I won't mind losing you, oh, oh  
I won't mind losing you, yeah  
I won't mind losing you
