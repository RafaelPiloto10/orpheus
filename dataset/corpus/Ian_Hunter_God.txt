God said to me "gonna kick your ass - 'cos all you do is ask ask ask  
All that energy looking for me when I'm sitting here inside you - plain to see  
How I built you cell for cell gave you sights to see - gave you tales to tell  
Even let you help yourself for a while - to take some weight off this busy
child"  
  
I said to God "i found you out - I know what this world is all about!"  
God said "stop - don't scramble your brain - my opponent's been messing you
around again  
See him and me are enemies and we play little games for galaxies  
And he's inside you - 'n I am too - so here we are - just the three of you"  
  
"oh we made mistakes - too many cards - but making human beings can be hard  
A God gets tired of playing so much chess - he wishes his God would get him
out of his mess"  
I said to God "what's it like to die" he said "it's as plain as the sea and
sky  
Conception was him and me and you - when your batteries fade we all just move
on"  
  
I said to God "who's winning this game - is the devil in front" he said "is
that his name  
You know I've been so busy I never asked - I never looked up from this awesome
task"  
I said to God "what's good 'n bad" he said "it's just something you've got to
have  
It don't mean nothing to us up here - but your primitive people - you gotta
have fear"  
  
I said to God "do I think for myself" he said I told you once you just help
yourself  
Don't forget you're composed of three, your thinking comes from him and me"  
I said to God "how big are you, is there a religion - is it true  
How big's the universe - is time - the same for you as my life is to mine"  
  
  
God said "if all the things that made worlds float - were all to part - then
you would note  
The size of him and the size of me - and that's how big we both shall be"  
  
He said "the universe is small - just like some fortune-teller's ball  
And we both sit down - and we play the game - when somebody wins it all starts
again"  
  
"there's no religion - you did that - it helps to keep your little leaders fat  
Like faith 'n superstition stay - to help you pass the time away  
But when you talk of time and life - it makes me think of circles, heights  
Expansion is the clue - your dreams - are nearer than you've ever been"  
  
"you see my little toy to think - is from two bowls of wine to drink  
Don't take too much or you may drown - behave yourself - see you around..."
