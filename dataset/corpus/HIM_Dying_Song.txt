I've seen you breathe life into the weakest of hearts,  
And heard you scream out loud the sweetest poem,  
Echoing across the ocean reminding me why I still try  
To hold onto whatever is left of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more,  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life.  
  
I've seen these dreams being crushed by a single thought,  
And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth  
Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs,  
With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light,  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love with you  
  
Crawl back into bed tomorrow's trembling at the sight of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love,  
Life and love (dying song)  
Life and love (a dying song)  
With you (a dying song)  
With you (dying song)  
With you (dying song)  
With you (a dying song)
