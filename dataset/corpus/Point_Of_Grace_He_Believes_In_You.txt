You're not hearing the answers you've been praying for  
You try and try, can't find an open door  
You're not seeing the miracles not a one in sight  
And the way you feel you sure need one tonight  
Your faith is crumbling, your feet are stumbling  
It's so hard to believe in Him  
But He believes in you when you're at your weakest  
And hope's still burning through the night but you can't see it  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But in those moments when you can't believe it's true  
He believes in you  
Chin deep in the water you tried walking on  
And you reach for Him and you think He's gone  
He's still there beside you with His stubborn love  
No, He never left and He won't give up  
He will protect you until you're rescued  
Oh, there's nothing that He can't do  
'Cause He believes in you when you're at your weakest  
And hope's still burning through the night but you can't see it  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But in those moments when you can't believe it's true  
He believes in you  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But at those moments when you can't believe it's true  
He believes in you  
He believes in you, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you
