When I was young  
I used to dream of going far  
Having my once in a lifetime  
Chance to prove I was a star  
A thousand times I stood in  
The wings dreaming it was me  
I heard the people going wild  
But it was just my fantasy  
Life is a dance  
Maybe we're all players  
So stand up and smile  
And don't be afraid  
  
This is my night  
This is my song  
Standing right here out on  
The stage is where I belong  
  
This is my song  
This is my night  
Standing right here out on  
The stage in the spotlight  
Whoo hoo  
  
I traveled the road  
Wherever the road would lead  
I made mistakes  
But I wouldn't quit  
I made myself believe  
Dreams come true for those who  
Dream, so one day you can say  
If the music be the fruit of life  
Then let my music play  
  
Life is a dance  
Maybe we're all players  
So stand up and smile  
And don't you be afraid  
  
This is my life  
This is my song  
Standing right here out on  
The stage is where I belong  
  
This is your life  
This is my song  
This is my life  
Standing right here out on  
The stage in the spotlight
