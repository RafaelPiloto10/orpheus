Well you've got me workin' so hard lately  
Workin' my hands untill they bleed  
If I was twice the man I could be  
I'd still be half of what you need  
Still you lead me and I follow  
From the small of your back up to your chin  
Over to the tip of your switchblade  
As you pull it out as you stick it in  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Well you just leave me nailed here  
Hanging like Jesus on this cross  
I'm just dying for your sins  
An aide to the cause  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Wrap my soul in bandages  
I'm tired of this war  
Go ahead and cut me  
I can't even feel it anymore  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
But I love  
Love the pain  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
I'm wearin' these chains  
Twist twist twist  
Make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
  
(Turn it on... Turn it on...)  
  
Is this on?  
Oh.  
I'm so tired I can't get to sleep  
The squeaking of the bed  
Is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head  
It's uncomforting to remember  
How I used to like a good fuck every once in awhile  
I just wanted you to know  
That when I do it...  
  
I only think of you
