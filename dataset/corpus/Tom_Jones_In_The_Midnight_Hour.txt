I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,  
That's when my love comes tumbling down,  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,  
When these no one else around,  
  
I'm gonna take you,  
Girl and hold ya,  
And do all the things I told ya,  
In the midnight hour,  
  
Yes I am,  
Wooh yes I am,  
One more thing I just want to say right here,  
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out,  
  
To see that twinkle in your eye,  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,  
That's when my love,  
Began to shine,  
  
Your the only girl I know,  
That really loves me so,  
In the midnight hour,  
Oh yeah,  
  
In the midnight hour,  
Yeah, alright,  
Play it for me one time now,
