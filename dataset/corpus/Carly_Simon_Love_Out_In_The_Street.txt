I've seen the sidewalks  
And I've been aware  
Of the lamps and tables and the paperback books  
That you throw out there  
All your artifacts  
In disrepair  
Make up a pile so high  
Could tie up the traffic in the thoroughfare  
  
Put your love out on the street  
Put your love out on the street  
Put your love out on the street  
Put your love out on the street tonight  
  
I don't mind your sinning  
I'm no saint myself  
And if the neighbours call you a hellcat  
Then let them call me a Jezebel  
Cause I've come to know you  
I've come to know you so well  
From spying on you from my bathroom window  
In this cheap hotel  
  
So let flow the hydrants  
And we'll dance in the spray  
And we'll wash out our dirty laundry  
In the alleyway
