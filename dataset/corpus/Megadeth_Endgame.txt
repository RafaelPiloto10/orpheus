Attention! Attention!  
All citizens are ordered to report to their District detention centers!  
Do not return to your homes,  
Do not contact anyone!  
Do not use any cellular or G-P-S devices!  
Surrender all weapons at once!  
Attention! This way to the camps!  
  
I woke up in a black FEMA box  
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin  
My dreams are all nightmares anymore  
And this is what I dream every night  
  
The Leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States  
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A  
Without the R-F-I-D chip, you're just an illegal alien  
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order  
  
This is the end of the road, this is the end of the line  
This is the end of your life, this is the  
  
A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops  
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours  
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die, the clock is  
Ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour  
  
I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned  
I had to bleed, inside the day yard  
A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm  
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore  
  
The Ex-President signed a secret bill that can  
Land a legal US Citizen in jail and the  
Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights  
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!  
  
Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat by the  
Tyranny of Mind control, for the mark of the beast  
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved  
Believe me when I say, this is the endgame!
