You say you want to live for today  
Before today is lost  
But when the returns come in  
Do they balance the cost  
I can see your four wheels spin  
I can smell smoke from the blaze  
But we arent moving anyway  
If youre seeing past rose colored shades  
  
If you live like that  
Don't look back  
Cause its cold  
And its mighty  
It may turn your back  
Blood on the tracks baby  
Blood on the tracks  
Blood on the tracks baby  
I said don't look back  
  
I see it all around  
People want it good and want it fast  
As long as it moves you for the moment  
It doesn't matter if it lasts  
But our love is sweet  
It can drive me to my knees  
But we still got troubles you and I  
Seeing the forest for the trees  
  
If you live like that  
Don't look back  
Cause its cold  
And its mighty  
It may turn your back  
Blood on the tracks baby  
Blood on the tracks  
Blood on the tracks baby  
I said don't look back  
  
I've had enough of these two lives  
You say youll give to me  
I've had enough of your freedom  
You know I want to feel free  
I've had enough gospel  
I could spin my head around  
I said if youre so caught up in heaven  
You don't even see the ground  
  
If you live like that  
Don't look back  
Cause its cold  
And its mighty  
It may turn your back  
Blood on the tracks, baby  
Blood on the tracks  
Blood on the tracks, baby  
I said don't look back  
  
All we need is to take time  
(slow down, new way)  
See tomorrow in plain sight  
(new dawn, new day)  
New horizon in plain view  
And were oiling up the engine  
To put you straight on through  
  
If you live like that  
Don't look back  
Oh no cause its cold  
And its mighty  
It may turn your back  
Blood on the tracks baby  
Blood on the tracks  
Blood on the tracks baby  
I said don't look back  
  
Blood on the tracks baby  
Blood on the tracks  
Blood on the tracks baby  
I said don't look back  
Oh theres blood on the tracks baby  
Blood on the tracks  
Blood on the tracks baby  
Don't look back  
Don't look back  
If you live like that
