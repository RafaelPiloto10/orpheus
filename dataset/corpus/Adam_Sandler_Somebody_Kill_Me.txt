Ok, I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the
Cure a lot.  
  
You don't know how much I need you.  
While you're around I don't feel blue.  
And when we kiss I know that you need me too.  
I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true.  
  
But it all was bullshit.  
It was a goddamn joke.  
And when I think of you and I,  
I hope you fucking choke.  
  
I hope you're glad with what you've done to me.  
I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy.  
You left me here all alone, tears running constantly.  
  
Oh somebody kill me please,  
Somebody kill me plee-ase,  
I'm on my knees,  
pretty pretty please kill me.  
  
I want to die.  
Put a bullet in my head.  
  
You're going to the mental institution.
