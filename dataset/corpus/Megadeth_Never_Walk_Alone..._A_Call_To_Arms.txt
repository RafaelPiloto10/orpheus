Hiding in any doorway  
In any shadow  
Any place where danger  
Waits to kill my time  
There is one who lies in wait  
To seal your fate  
As sure as you live and die  
Live and die  
Live and die  
  
[Chorus]  
When you feel that something's wrong  
I'll shelter you and keep you warm  
I'll never let you walk alone  
I loved you when you still hated me  
I'm comin' and it won't be long  
Time to reap what I have sewn  
Never ever let you walk alone  
I know your enemy - it once was me  
  
Let me wrap my arms all around you  
Suffer the trespasses that you made  
I will drink your pain away  
Forever and a day  
If you just call out my name  
If you just call  
Call my name  
If you just call...  
Even whisper it  
  
[Chorus x 3]
