Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff  
Are the only ones with enough  
To feel what I'm about to say in this song  
When they want you to be like somebody else  
And you just wanna be yourself  
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong  
It is when all the press articles happening  
And the cameras get to snappin  
And they try to make you out as a lie  
Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em'  
By using logic and reason  
It's a lose lose why even try  
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected  
And They never really know how to feel  
Phone calls is something that you're expecting  
For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill  
You never noticed the fact you might be working what I'm receivin' at first  
And niggas wanna say that you ain't around  
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself (yourselves)  
Instead of claimin' that you couldn't help and maybe next time you were
(ain't) In town  
  
Chorus:  
You gonna try to try harder cos  
Try harder cos  
  
Try -Try-Try-Try  
  
And the managers make you circum to pressure  
And you spitin' the pressure than most of the rappers running the game  
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past  
And turn the profit to cash  
There's time I would have done it the same  
I mean I got me a range  
Also got me a guilty conscience  
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran  
Sometimes I wish that I woulda' just chilled on the sneakers  
And watched the game from the bleachers  
Cos I'm really telling me what I spent  
In a house that I promised to get my mother  
Don't compensate for the other time  
I wasted late out at the club  
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner  
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love  
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets  
And just spending money on beats that  
She can rest without a toss and a turn  
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me  
And people watch me on tv  
That's exactly why I often get burned  
But I'm gonna try to.
