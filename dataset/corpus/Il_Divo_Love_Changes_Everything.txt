Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Hands and faces,  
Earth and sky,  
Love,  
Love changes everything:  
How you live and  
How you die  
  
Love  
Can make the summer fly,  
Or a night  
Seem like a lifetime.  
  
Yes, Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Now I tremble  
At your name.  
Nothing in the world will ever  
Be the same.  
  
Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Days are longer,  
Words mean more.  
Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Pain is deeper  
Than before.  
  
Love  
Will turn your world around,  
And that world  
Will last for ever.  
  
Yes, Love,  
Love changes everything,  
Brings you glory,  
Brings you shame.  
Nothing in the  
World will ever  
Be the same.  
  
Off  
Into the world we go,  
Planning futures,  
Shaping years.  
Love,  
Bursts in, and suddenly  
All our wisdom  
Disappears.  
  
Love  
Makes fools of everyone:  
All the rules  
We make are broken.  
Yes, Love,  
Love changes everyone.  
Live or perish  
In it's flame.  
Love will never,  
Never let you  
Be the same.  
  
Love will never,  
Never let you  
Be the same.
