If you were here beside me,  
Instead of in New York  
If the curve of you was curved on me  
  
I'd tell you that I loved you  
Before I even knew you  
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you  
  
If our hearts had never broken  
Well there's no joy in the mending  
So much this hurt can teach us both  
  
There's distance and there's silence  
Your words have never left me  
They're the prayer that I say every day  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
The lone neon lights  
And the heat of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to spark  
I miss it all from the love to the lightning  
And the lack of it snaps me in two  
  
If you were here beside me  
Instead of New York  
In the arms you said you'd never leave  
  
I'd tell you that it's simple  
And it was only ever thus  
There is nowhere else that I belong  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to spark  
I miss it all from the love to the lightning  
And the lack of it snaps me in two  
  
Just give me a sign  
There is end in a beginning  
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to go out
