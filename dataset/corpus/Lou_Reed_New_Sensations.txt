I don't like guilt be it stoned or stupid  
drunk and disorderly I ain't no cupid  
Two years ago today I was arrested on Christmas Eve  
  
I don't want pain, I want to walk not be carried  
I don't want to give it up, I want to stay married  
I ain't no dog tied to a parked car  
  
Ooohhh, new sensations  
Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations  
  
Talkin' 'bout some new sensations  
Talkin' 'bout some new sensations  
  
I want the principles of a timeless muse  
I want to eradicate my negative views  
And get rid of those people who are always on a down  
  
It ain't enough to tell what is wrong  
but that's not what I want to hear all night long  
Some people are like human toulinols  
  
Ooohhh, new sensations  
Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations  
  
Talkin' 'bout some new sensations  
Talkin' 'bout new sensations  
  
I took my GPZ out for a ride  
the engine felt good between my thighs  
The air felt cool, it's was forty degrees outside  
  
I rode to Pennsylvania near the Delaware Gap  
sometimes I got lost and had to check the map  
I stopped at a roadside diner for a burger and a coke  
  
There were some country folk and some hunters inside  
somebody got themselves married and somebody died  
I went to the juke box and played a hillbilly song  
  
They was arguing about football as I waved and went outside  
and I headed for the mountains feeling warm inside  
I love that GPZ so much, you know that I could kiss her  
  
Ooohhh, new sensations  
Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations  
  
Talkin' 'bout your new sensations  
Talkin' new sensations  
  
Ooohhh, new sensations ...
