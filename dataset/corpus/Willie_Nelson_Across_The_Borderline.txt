There's a land where I've been told every street is paved with gold  
And it's just across the borderline  
When it's time to take your turn here's a lesson that you must learn  
You could lose more than you'll ever find  
When you reach the broken promiseland every dream slips through your hand  
You'll know it's too late to change your mind  
'Cause you paid the price to come so far just to wind up where you are  
And you're still just across the borderline  
  
Up and down the Rio Grande a thousand footprints in the sand  
Reveal the secret no one can define  
The river flows on like a breath in between our life and death  
Who's the next to cross the borderline  
  
Hope remains when pride is gone and it keeps you moving on  
Calling you across the borderline  
When you reach the broken promiseland...  
And you're still just across the borderline
