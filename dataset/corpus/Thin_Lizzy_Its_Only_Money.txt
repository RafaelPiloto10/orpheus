You don't believe in love  
You don't believe in hatred  
Put your money in the bank  
It's the only way to save it  
  
You try to make a buck  
But you haven't made a penny  
You need a little luck  
But you know you won't get any  
  
You don't believe in God  
You don't believe in glory  
You've got a brother in the clinic  
Tells the same kind of story  
  
If he had another life  
He'd know what would be waiting  
If he had another soul  
He could sell it all to Satan  
  
You don't believe in war  
You don't believe in Jesus  
Got a sister in New York  
She knows how she pleases  
  
Walking the streets  
On the south side of the city  
Trying to make ends meet  
Isn't that a pity, for money
