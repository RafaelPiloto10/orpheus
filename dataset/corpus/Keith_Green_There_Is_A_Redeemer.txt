There is a redeemer,  
Jesus, God's own Son,  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,  
Holy One,  
  
Jesus my redeemer,  
Name above all names,  
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,  
Hope for sinners slain.  
  
Thank you oh my father,  
For giving us Your Son,  
And sending Your Spirit,  
'Til the work on Earth is done.  
  
When I stand in Glory,  
I will see His face,  
And there I'll serve my King forever,  
In that Holy Place.  
  
Thank you oh my Father,  
For giving us Your Son,  
And sending Your Spirit,  
'Til the work on Earth is done.
