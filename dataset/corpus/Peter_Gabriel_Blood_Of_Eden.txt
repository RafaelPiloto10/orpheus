I caught sight of my reflection  
I caught it in the window  
I saw the darkness in my heart  
I saw the signs of my undoing  
They had been there from the start  
  
And the darkness still has work to do  
The knotted chord's untying  
The heated and the holy  
Oh they're sitting there on high  
So secure with everything they're buying  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
With the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
We wanted the the union oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man  
  
My grip is surely slipping  
I think I've lost my hold  
Yes I think I've lost my hold  
I cannot get insurance any more  
They don't take credit, only gold  
Is that a dagger or a crucifix I see  
You hold so tightly in your hand  
And all the while the distance grows between you and me  
I do not understand  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
With the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
We wanted the the union oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man  
  
At my request you take me in  
In that tenderness I am floating away  
No certainty, nothing to rely on  
Holding still for a moment  
What a moment this is  
Oh for a moment of forgetting  
A moment of bliss  
Oh  
  
I can hear the distant thunder  
Of a million unheard souls  
Of a million unheard souls  
Watch each one reach for creature comfort  
For the filling of their holes  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
I feel the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
I feel the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
  
In the blood of Eden we have done everything we can  
In the blood of Eden, so we end as we began  
With the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
It was all for the union, oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man
