All my life  
They've been here.  
Waiting for you.  
Patiently.  
They want your tears to fall  
All they want is your purest sin  
All they want is your heart and soul  
They want to welcome you in  
Innocent,  
But they will lead you  
Back to me.  
They will seem  
All they need is one tortured soul  
They need walking shadows  
All they need is your last confession  
They need your pain to show me  
I'm waiting for the unforgiven  
Waiting for you to come home  
Waiting for sleep to come  
I waiting for my one obsession  
  
'Innocence is pain in disguse'  
They said.  
Now I believe
