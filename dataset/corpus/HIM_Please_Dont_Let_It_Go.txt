We're drifting apart,  
But I want you to know  
Wherever you are I belong  
Love's singing us a song  
But we fail to sing along  
Wherever you go I will follow  
  
So please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go  
So please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go  
  
You try to be strong  
But you're always so alone  
Whatever I do I do you wrong  
Death sings our song  
And we eagerly sing along  
Whatever you do I adore  
  
So please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go  
So please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go  
  
Don't let go of life  
Let go of love  
Let go of all we have  
  
Don't let go of trust  
Let go of lust  
Let go of all we share  
  
So please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go  
Please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
And if you won't let it I won't let it go  
  
So please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go  
Please don't let it  
Please don't let it go  
Cause if you won't let it I won't let it go
