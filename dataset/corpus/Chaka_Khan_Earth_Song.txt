Sun...  
How can I thank you  
You've warmed my heart and soul  
You've made my body brown and smooth  
Washed away the cold  
Moon...  
You've made a dreamer out of me  
I can see, and I think I can feel it when you  
Change your face  
Please forgive me if I turn away  
I'm just a sleeper  
I know that you watch my dreams  
You're my heavenly keeper  
  
Heavenly keeper  
Heavenly keeper  
Just a sleeper  
Heavenly keeper, oh -  
  
Stars...  
What a mystical woman that you made me  
I've seen of times before the human race  
As long as I'm breathing  
As long as I can move  
I'll be strong  
Cause I know you've always been in the place  
Please forgive me if I turn away  
I'm just a sleeper  
I know that you watch my dreams  
You're my heavenly keeper  
  
Heavenly keeper  
Heavenly keeper  
Just a sleeper  
Heavenly keeper  
  
Never, never, never, never  
(repeat)
