Man, I never slept so hard  
I never dreamt so well  
Dreaming, I was safe in life  
Like mussels in a shells  
Rolling and controlling all the basements and the backroads of our lives  
Fill their dreams with big fast cars  
Fill their heads with sand  
Holy white we'll paint the town  
The color of our flag  
Hey there little lady has your baby got the look of some old man ?  
Standing on the corner of the third world  
Hungry men will close their minds  
Ideas are not their food  
Notions fall on stony ground  
Where passions are subdued  
Color all the madness for the madness is the thorn that's in our side  
Standing on the corner of the third world  
When we gonna learn?  
Who we gonna turn to?  
The promises they make  
The call for attention  
Compassion is the fashion  
Free to earn, our pockets burn  
We buy for love  
Die for love  
Hold me I'm crying  
Hold me I'm dying
