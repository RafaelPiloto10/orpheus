She was a Mexican girl, she had Mexican blood  
I seen it the night that she died  
She was a Mexican girl, she had Mexican blood  
Oh, how she could drive that Mexican boy wild  
  
He's on the run near El Paso  
And he'll cross all across America  
He's leaving behind old Mexico  
And his girl, that pretty Mexican girl that died  
  
She had Mexican blood  
He was a Mexican boy with a Mexican smile  
And he drank a little tequila  
He was a Mexican boy in a Mexican town  
And, oh, how he loved his young senorita  
  
Now and then he'd cross the Rio Grande  
And he'd come back a wanted, hunted man  
And his Mexican girl was his Mexican prize  
And that girl was his girl, that pretty Mexican girl that died  
  
She had Mexican blood  
He was a cowboy's boy and a cowboy's son  
And on his side he had a gun  
He was a cowboy's boy, he was the law  
He was out looking for someone  
  
That night he rode into town  
The Mexican boy tried to gun him down  
That's when his heart broke up inside 'cause lying on the ground  
Was his girl, that pretty Mexican girl, she died  
  
She had Mexican blood  
He loved her, and she loved him  
And when he lost her  
Oh, how it hurt him  
  
He loved her  
I seen it the night she died  
That's when he lost her  
  
Now his heart is broken  
He loved her, and she loved him  
And when he lost her, he lost everything
