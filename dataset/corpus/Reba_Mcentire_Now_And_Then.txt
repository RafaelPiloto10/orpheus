I see you now, I think of then  
And dwell upon the happiness of way back when  
Cause since you said goodbye  
The feelings just won't die  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
A million years have come and gone  
And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own  
But seeing you today  
Took my breath away  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Suddenly I felt myself wondering  
If you might wanna try it again  
And though I wanted so much to hold you  
You smiled and shook my hand  
  
So i'll exist on dreams again  
On days when we were lovers and not just friends  
And even if I find another love in time  
I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Oh, I still long to hold you now and then
