It's my life  
Yeah I know  
It's not a perfect one, but  
It's a life  
I can live with  
  
But you don't know  
If you can  
And you don't know  
If you want  
Cause you don't know  
If I'm the right one  
And you don't know  
Well let me tell you  
  
There's  
Something inside  
That's freaking me out  
Please don't  
Leave me alone  
Something inside me  
Is wearing me out  
Please don't  
Don't do it again  
  
Just like a fly  
On a jar  
Twinkle, twinkle little star  
You don't feel like you belong here  
But it's your life  
Even though  
It's not perfect  
It's a life you can live with
