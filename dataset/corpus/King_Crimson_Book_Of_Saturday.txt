If I only could deceive you  
Forgetting the game  
Every time I try to leave you  
You laugh just the same  
  
'Cause my wheels never touch the road  
And the jumble of lies we told  
Just returns to my back to weigh me down  
  
We lay cards upon the table  
The backs of our hands  
And I swear I like your people  
The boys in the band  
  
Reminiscences gone astray  
Coming back to enjoy the fray  
In a tangle of night and daylight sounds  
  
All completeness in the morning  
Asleep on your side  
I'll be waking up the crewmen  
Banana-boat ride  
  
She responds like limousine  
Brought alive on the silent screen  
To the shuddering breath of yesterday  
  
There's the succour of the needy  
Incredible scenes  
I'll believe you in the future  
Your life and death dreams  
  
As the cavalry of despair  
Takes a stand in the lady's hair  
For the favour of making sweet sixteen  
  
You make my life and times  
A book of bluesy Saturdays  
And I have to choose
