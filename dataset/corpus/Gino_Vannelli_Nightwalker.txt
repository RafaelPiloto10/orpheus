I sleep at night  
On a cloud high on the horizon  
And when I close my eyes  
My soul is struck by lightning  
Then I sleep at night  
Like a storm  
Oh, I walk the night  
'cause your head is gone from my pillow  
And when the twilight shines  
My eyes crash through the windows  
'cause I sleep at night without you  
When it's dark and the night lays me down  
When the moon shines the light on the ground  
I just run where my thoughts take me to  
'cause I can't live in this world  
Without love without you  
I walk the night  
I walk the night  
Oh, I dream at night  
It must be a madman's rainbow that I'm chasing  
'cause when I close my eyes  
I feel your sweet sensation  
'cause I dream at night about you  
When it's dark and the night lays me down  
When the moon shines the light on my ground  
I just run where my thoughts take me to  
'cause I can't live in this world  
Without love without you  
I walk the night  
I walk the night  
I just run where my thoughts take me to  
'cause I can't live in this world  
Without love without you  
I walk the night  
I walk the night
