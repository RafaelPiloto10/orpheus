Nobody, nobody, will ever love you  
The way that I love you  
Cause nobody's that strong  
Love's bittersweet, life's treasures deep  
No one can keep a love that's gone wrong  
  
Nobody, nobody, gonna love you  
The way I could  
Cause nobody's that strong  
No nobody's that strong  
  
Nobody, nobody, is gonna love you  
The way that I love you  
Cause nobody is that strong  
  
You've had many lovers,  
You'll have many others  
But they'll only just break  
Your poor heart in two  
And nobody, nobody, will love you  
The way I could  
Cause nobody's that strong,  
No nobody's that strong
