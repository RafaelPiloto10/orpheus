Free and easy  
That's my style  
Howdy-do me?  
Watch me smile  
  
But fare-the-well me  
After a while  
'Cause I gotta roam  
And any place I hang my hat is home  
  
Sweetenin' water  
Cherry wine  
Thank you kindly  
Suits me fine  
  
Kansas city even Carolina  
That's my honeycomb  
'Cause any place I hang my hat is home  
Birds roostin' in a tree  
  
Pick up and go  
And the goin' proves  
That's how it oughta to be  
Pick up too when the spirit moves me  
  
Cross the river  
'Round the bend  
Howdy stranger?  
So long friend!  
  
There's a voice in the lonesome wind  
Keeps a whispering roam  
I'm going where a welcome mat is  
No matter where that is  
  
'Cause any place I hang my hat is home
