The late George Wallno worked on High Street and lived on manners  
52 years he sat on his verandah, made his saddles  
And if you had questions about sheep or flowers or doves  
You just asked the saddler, he lived without sin  
They're building a library for him  
  
Time is a traveller  
Tenterfield saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
The son of George Wallno went off and got married and had a war baby  
But something was wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy  
And if there were questions about why the end was so sad  
Well George had no answers about why her son ever has need of a gun  
  
Time is a traveller  
Tenterfield saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
The grandson of George has been all around the world and lives no special
place  
Changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face  
He'd almost forgotten them both because of the life that he leads  
There's nowhere for George and his library or the son with his gun to belong  
Except in this song  
  
Time is a traveller  
Tenterfield saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
Time is a meddler  
Tenterfield Saddler  
Make a bet  
Fly away cockatoo  
Down on the ground  
Emu up ahead  
  
Time is a tale teller  
Tenterfield Saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
Time is a tale teller  
Tenterfield Saddler  
Make a bet  
Fly away cockatoo  
Down on the ground  
Emu up ahead
