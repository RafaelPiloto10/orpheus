Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
You say tomorrow's another day,  
All I know is we're here today.  
I've got nightmares I could never share with you,  
The kind that keeps me up all night.  
So hold me tight till the room is light  
And tell me that it's all right.  
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh - oh-oh-oh)  
Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
We may go our separate ways some day,  
But we know we shared our dreams today.  
I've got nightmares I would never wish on you,  
The kind that keeps me down all day.  
So hold me tight till the sky is light  
And tell me that it's all right.  
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh - oh-oh-oh)  
Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye.  
Yoko!!  
(it's getting light)  
Mummy, mummy.  
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh - oh-oh-oh)  
  
Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never say) goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
(never)
