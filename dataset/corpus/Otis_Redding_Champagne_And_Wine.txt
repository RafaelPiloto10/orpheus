Sittin' here thinking, about the times I roamed  
Different girls, that I have known  
Of all girls, that I have met  
You are the one girl that I can't forget, listen  
  
We had our time, now  
Good and bad, now  
I can't forget a man  
I sho' ain't gonna forget him, now  
Remember Side Stream  
Where we used to meet  
Making love, nobody but you and me  
  
Champagne and wine  
That's what you gonna get  
Champagne and wine  
What it's gonna be  
Just as long girl you see about me  
I'm gonna be, knocking on your door  
I want the same love, that I had before, listen  
  
I'm a man now  
Full grown man  
You got me eating from the tip of your hand  
I don't mind eatin', long as you feed me  
Good love and good ole sympathy  
  
Champagne and wine  
That's what it's gonna be  
Everyday, is gonna just be like Sunday  
Every night your gonna have stars in the sky  
  
Ou giving you  
Champagne and wine  
I'm gonna give it to you  
Ou, ou weeh  
Ou, na na na na na na na na na na  
Ou weeh baby  
Giving you champagne and wine  
I want you to love me, baby  
I really do need you, honey  
Really do want you baby
