You and me we were the pretenders  
We let it all slip away  
In the end what you don't surrender  
Well the world just strips away  
  
Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers  
Ain't gonna find no miracles here  
Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin'  
I got a deal for you right here  
  
I ain't lookin' for praise or pity  
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch  
I just want someone to talk to  
And a little of that human touch  
Just a little of that human touch  
  
Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town  
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies  
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood  
It's just you and me tonight  
  
Tell me, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want something to hold on to  
And a little of that human touch  
Just a little of that human touch  
  
Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize  
Well it comes at a hard hard price  
You can't shut off the risk and the pain  
Without losin' the love that remains  
We're all riders on this train  
  
So you've been broken and you've been hurt  
Show me somebody who ain't  
Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain  
But, hell, a little touchup  
And a little paint  
  
You might need somethin' to hold on to  
When all the answers, they don't amount to much  
Somebody that you could just to talk to  
And a little of that human touch  
  
Baby, in a world without pity  
Do you think what I'm askin's too much  
I just want to feel you in my arms  
Share a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Share a little of that human touch  
Feel a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch  
Give me a little of that human touch
