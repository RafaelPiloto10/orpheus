You can't let it get you down  
No no, no no no  
No no, no no no  
No no, oh, no no  
Don't let it get you down  
You can't let it get you down  
Just when everything seems to be going alright  
Some unexpected misery enters your life  
Then you ask your self how could this be  
Wondering why I've been there?  
You see your whole world come crashing down  
All at one time  
Your bodies weak from all the worrying  
And so is you mind  
Your walking down that rocky road  
But things will get better  
'Cause trouble won't last forever  
Can't let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Can't let it get you down  
Have you ever felt the need to get away from it all  
The person that you care about the most just broke your heart  
Just to be in the same room with them, you can't stand the thought  
I've been there, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You don't know if your relationship is worth holding on  
How much longer can you take being treated so wrong  
You're confused on what to do but no matter what you do  
You're gonna make it through, yeah  
Can't let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Can't let it get you down  
Oh, take it from me  
The only thing you need is a little faith  
The size of a mustard seed  
You may cry through the night but hold on  
'Cause joy comes in the morning, oh yeah  
In the morning  
Joy comes in the morning  
Have a little faith  
Just a little faith  
And you can make it  
So don't you give up  
Can't let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Can't let it get you down  
Can't let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Can't let it get you down  
Can't let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Can't let it get you down  
Can't let it get you down  
Not now  
Come to far to turn around  
Gotta walk with your head up high  
Believing you can reach the sky  
Can't let it get you down
