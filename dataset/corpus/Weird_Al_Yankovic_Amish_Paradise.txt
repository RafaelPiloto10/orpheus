As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain  
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain  
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me  
You know I shun fancy things like electricity  
At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows  
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows fool  
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that  
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone  
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline  
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin  
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine  
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish paradise  
I've churned butter once or twice  
Living in an Amish paradise  
It's hard work and sacrifice  
Living in an Amish paradise  
We sell quilts at a discount price  
Living in an Amish paradise  
  
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week  
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek  
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well  
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell  
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it  
An Amish with a 'tude?  
You know that's unheard of  
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat  
And my homies agree  
I really look good in black fool  
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears  
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years  
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare  
We're just technologically impaired  
  
There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar  
Not a single luxury  
Like Robinson Caruso  
It's as primitive as can be  
  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We're just plain and simple guys  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
There's no time for sin and vice  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We don't fight, we all play nice  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
  
Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter  
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise anutter  
Think you're really righteous?  
Think you're pure in heart?  
Well, I know I'm a million time as humble as thou art  
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes want to be like  
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife  
So don't be vain and don't be whiny  
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie  
  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We're all crazy Mennonites  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
There's no cops or traffic lights  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
But you'd probably think it bites  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
  
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh  
ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-yecch!
