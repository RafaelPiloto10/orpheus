Well, I can see what you mean  
It just takes me longer  
And I can feel what you feel  
It just makes you stronger  
  
I know, I know, I know  
Oh, the feeling grows  
I see, I see, I see  
It's got to be  
You can take me for a little while  
You can take me, you can make me smile  
In the end  
  
Well, I can do what you do  
You just do it better  
And I can cry like you cry  
It just makes me sadder  
  
Well, I can shine like you shine  
It doesn't make me brighter  
But if I think like you think  
It don't make my load much lighter
