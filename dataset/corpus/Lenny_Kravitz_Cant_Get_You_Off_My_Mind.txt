Life is just a lonely highway  
I'm out here on the open road  
I'm old enough to see behind me  
But young enough to feel my soul  
  
I don't want to lose you baby  
And I don't want to be alone  
Don't want to live my days without you  
But for now I've got to be without you  
  
I've got a pocket full of money  
And pocket full of keys that have no bounds  
But then I think of lovin'  
And I just can't get you off of my mind  
  
Babe can't you see  
That this is killing me  
I don't want to push you baby  
And I don't want you to be told  
  
It's just that I can't breathe without you  
Feel like I'm gonna lose control  
  
I've got a pocket full of money oh yes I do  
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds  
But when it comes to lovin'  
I just can't get you off of my mind, yeaaah  
  
Am I a fool to think that there's a little hope  
Yeah yeahhhhhheee yeah  
Tell me baby, yeah  
What are the rules the reasons and the do's and don'ts  
  
Yeah yeahhhhhheee yeah  
Tell me baby tell me baby, yeah  
What do you feel inside?  
  
I've got a pocket full of money  
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds  
Oh yeah  
But when it comes down to lovin'  
  
I just can't get you off of my mind, yeah  
I just can't get you off of my mind, yeah.
