I dried my eyes, now I crust them with sleep  
I'll crust them over  
She begged me "don't hate me"  
She spun me a story  
Where winning looks like losing  
And I win every time  
So thread spools sweetie, get ready  
Until my silk is sold  
  
Growing up [Repeat: x2  
Yeah, I'll myself a new [Repeat: x1]  
  
I've dried my eyes, now its "Rushmore"  
I'm deep with futures like Chicago  
Glenview never meant a thing to me  
She never meant a thing to me  
Except for putting idealists in a body bag  
Forget it  
I'll go out tonight to piss on her doorstep  
And listen to the misfits "where eagles dare" to swallow whole  
  
Up  
Growing up [Repeat: x1]  
  
Go  
  
Whoa-oh-oh, I guess I'm my own better half [Repeat: x1]  
Whoa, oh,I guess I'm on my own  
Yeah, yeah,I guess I'm on my own  
Yeah,I guess I'm on my own  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I guess I'm on my own
