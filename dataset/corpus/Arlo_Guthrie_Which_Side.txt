Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
There's trouble all around the world  
Well, it looks that way to me  
People don't know what to do  
They don't know where they should be  
But just one question still remains  
To which we must respond  
Two roads lead from where we are  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS:  
Are you on, boys  
Which side are you on  
Which side are you on, boys  
Which side are you on  
Moses crossed the desert  
With a band of weary men  
For forty years they wandered through  
The hot and burning sand  
And Moses went and prayed alone  
The weary vagabond  
And lightning wrote these words in stone  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS  
Jesus stumbling through the streets  
On the road to Calvary  
Nailed high to testify  
With other local thieves  
And as they hung there dying  
One asked what lay beyond  
That all depends the master said  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS  
Some men work for little things  
And some men work for more  
Some men work for anything  
And some don't work at all  
And me myself I'm satisfied  
To sing for God's own son  
And ask you what I ask myself  
Which side are you on
