Love's been here and gone  
But the mem'ry keeps holding on  
Now I know how love is if I can live through this  
Love's been here and gone  
When there's love your heart is strong  
But it weakens when love goes wrong  
Now I've known that power dealt the parting hour  
Love's been here and gone  
I've loved once but never again a closed heart just won't let love in  
Hopin' only to you oh what can I do love's been here and gone  
[ piano ]  
I've loved once but never again...
