Well she's walking through the clouds  
With a circus smile that's running round  
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales  
That's all she ever thinks about  
She's riding with the wind  
  
When I'm sad she comes to me  
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free  
It's alright, she says, it's alright  
Take anything you want from me, anything  
Anything, yeah  
  
Well she's walking through the clouds  
With a circus smile that's running round  
Oh, butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales  
That's all she ever thinks about  
She's riding with the wind, yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah little wing
