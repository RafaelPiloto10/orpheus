There is life in shadowed caverns  
Where the gray-blue gardens grow  
In the forests and the deserts  
In the wind and in the snows  
And it's all the precious cargo  
Of our fragile spaceship earth  
And it's countless voices cry on  
Let us live  
Let us live  
The miracle is that they're here at all in the timeless night  
We are all fabric of life  
This miracle may never come again  
The planet is alive let it live  
Let us live  
In the roaring soaring cities  
In the mills and in the minds  
In the ice fields and the rice fields  
People work and live their lives  
And they strive to raise their children  
Hoping somehow they'll survive  
Is it all to much to ask for  
Let them live  
Let them live  
It's a thousand million light years  
To the farthest fringe of space  
And there may be nothing out there  
Even like the human race  
And we may be all alone then on our tiny island home  
And the planet is alive oh let it live  
Let it live
