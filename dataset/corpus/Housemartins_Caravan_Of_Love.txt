Are you ready Are you ready  
Are you ready Are you ready  
Are you ready for the time of your life  
It's time to stand up and fight  
It's alright It's alright  
Hand in hand we take a caravan to the maravl land  
One by one we gonna stand up with pride  
One that can't be denied  
Stand up Stand up  
From the highest mountain, valley low  
We'll join together with hearts of gold  
Now the children of the world can see  
This is a better place for us to be  
The place in which we were born  
So neglected and torn apart  
  
Every woman every man  
Join the caravan of love  
(Stand up) stand up  
Stand up  
Everybody take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
(Stand up) stand up  
Stand up  
  
I'm your brother  
I'm your brother don't you know  
She's my sister  
She's my sister don't you know  
  
We'll be living in a world of peace  
And the day when everyone is free  
We'll bring the young and the old  
Won't you let your love flow, from your heart  
  
Every woman every man  
Join the caravan of love  
(Stand up) stand up  
Stand up  
Every body take a stand  
Join the caravan of love  
(Stand up) stand up  
Stand up
