How did I get here? I turned around and there you were  
I didn't think twice or rationalize  
'Cause somehow I knew  
  
That there was more that just chemistry  
I mean I knew you were kind of into me  
But I figured it's too good to be true  
  
I said, "Pinch me, where's the catch this time?"  
Can't find a single cloud in the sky  
Help me before I get used to this guy  
  
They say that good things take time  
But really great things happen  
In the blink of an eye  
  
Thought the chances to meet somebody  
Like you were a million to one  
I cannot believe it, you're one in a million  
  
All this time I was looking for love  
Trying to make things work that weren't good enough  
Till I thought I'm through, said, "I'm done"  
And stumbled into the arms of the one  
  
You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff  
Say that I'm your diamond in the rough  
When I'm mad at you, you come with your velvet touch  
  
Can't believe that I'm so lucky  
I have never felt so happy  
Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes  
  
They say that good things take time  
But really great things happen  
In the blink of an eye  
  
Thought the chances to meet somebody  
Like you were a million to one  
I cannot believe it, you're one in a million

I cannot believe it, yeah yeah

One in a million, yeah  
You're one in a million
