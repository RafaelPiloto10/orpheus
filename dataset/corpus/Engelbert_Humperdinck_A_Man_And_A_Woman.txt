When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely  
Night  
Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight  
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's  
Light  
They'll stay together, so much in love  
  
And in the silence of the mist, of the morning mist  
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be  
Kissed  
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss  
That holds a promise of happiness?  
  
Though yesterday still surrounds you with a warm and  
Precious memory  
Maybe for tomorrow we can build a new dream for you and  
Me  
  
This glow we feel is something rare, something really  
Rare  
So come and say you wanna to share, wanna to really  
Share  
The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there  
That only loving can give the heart  
  
When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night  
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night  
Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's  
Light  
They'll be together, so much in love  
Together, so much in love  
  
So tell me  
  
You're not afraid to take a chance, really take a  
Chance  
Let your heart begin to dance, let it sing and dance  
To the music of a glance, of a fleeting glance  
To the music of romance, of a new romance  
Take a chance
