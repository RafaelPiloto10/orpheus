Well I just washed my car  
And I think it's gonna rain  
I'm not gonna quiver or complain,  
And I just smashed my hand on it's  
Stupid metal frame that's enough to drive us all insane.  
Nothing to sort out and nothing to do right,  
Always a thorn in my side and it's not right,  
So complicated we're tired and unpaid,  
Tough to admit it accept it not my day.  
And now I'm just a target,  
I'd bridge to word it so I'm just standing where I just don't know,  
I know I'm not for you  
And I should be asking how should I stay asleep,  
Or brave it now.  
Nothing to sort out and nothing to do right,  
Always a thorn in my side and it's not right,  
So complicated we're tired and unpaid tough,  
Tough to admit it, accept it not my day.
