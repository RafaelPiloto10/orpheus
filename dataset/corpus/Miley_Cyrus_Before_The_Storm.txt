I know this isn't what I wanted  
I never thought it'd come this far  
Just thinking back to where we started  
And how we lost all that we are  
We were young and times were easy  
But I could see it's not the same  
I'm standing here but you don't see me  
Give it all for that to change  
  
I don't want  
To lose her  
Don't let her go  
  
[Chorus]  
Standing out in the rain  
Need to know if it's over  
Cause I would leave you alone  
Flooded with all this pain  
Knowing that I'll never hold her  
Like I did before the storm  
  
Yeah  
Before the storm  
  
With every strike of lightening  
Comes a memory that lasts  
And not a word is left unspoken  
As a thunder starts to crash  
Maybe I should give up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trying to keep  
The light from going out  
And the clouds were ripping out my broken heart  
They always say  
A heart is not a home  
Without the one who gets you through the storm  
  
[Chorus]
