Let's take it nice and easy  
It's gonna be so easy  
For us to fall in love  
  
Hey baby whats your hurry  
Relax and don't you worry  
Were gonna fall in love  
  
Were on the road to romance - that's safe to say  
But let's make all the stops along the way  
  
The problem now of course is  
To simply hold your horses  
To rush would be a crime  
'Cause nice and easy does it every time  
  
(Repeat)
