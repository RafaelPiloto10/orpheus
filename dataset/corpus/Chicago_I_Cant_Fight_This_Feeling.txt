I can't fight this feeling any longer  
Yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow  
What started out as friendship has grown stronger.  
I only wish I had the strength to let it show.  
  
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever.  
I say there is no reason for my fear.  
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together.  
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear.  
  
Even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight.  
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night.  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might.  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore.  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for.  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore.  
And throw away the oars forever.  
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore.  
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for.  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor.  
Come crashing through the door.  
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore.  
  
My life has been such a whirl wind since I saw you.  
I've been running around in circles in my mind.  
And it always seems that I'm following you girl.  
'Cause you take me to the places that I thought I'd never find.  
  
Even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight.  
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night.  
And I'm getting closer than I ever though I might.  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore.  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for.  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore.  
And through away the oars forever.  
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore.  
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for.  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor.  
Come crashing through your door.  
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore.  
  
Oohhhh!!!!
