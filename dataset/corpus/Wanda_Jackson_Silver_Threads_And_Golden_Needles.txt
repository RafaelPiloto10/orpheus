I don't want your lonely mansion  
With a tear in every room  
All I want's the love you've promised  
Beneath the halo moon  
  
But you think I should be happy  
With your money and your name  
And hide myself in sorrows  
While you play your cheatin' game  
  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare not drown my sorrows  
In the warm glow of your mind  
  
You can't buy my love with money  
'Cause I ain't never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare not drown my sorrows  
In the warm glow of your mind  
  
You can't buy my love with money  
'Cause I ain't never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine
