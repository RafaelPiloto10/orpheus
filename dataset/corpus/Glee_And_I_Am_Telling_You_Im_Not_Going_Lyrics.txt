And I am telling you

And I am telling you  
I'm not going  
Even though there rough times are showin  
There's just no way  
There's no way  
  
Were part of the same place  
Were part of the same time  
We both share the same blood  
We both have the same mind  
  
And time and time  
We've had so much to share  
No No No No No way  
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning  
And finding that there's nobody left  
  
Darlin' there's no way  
No No no no way  
I'm livin' without you  
I'm not living without you  
You see there's no way  
There's no way  
  
Tear down the mountain  
Just scream and shout  
You can say what you want  
I'm not walking out  
  
Stop all the rivers  
Push, strike and kill  
I'm not gonna leave ya  
There's no way I will  
  
And I am telling you  
I'm not going  
You're the best man  
I'll ever know  
There's no way I can ever ever go  
  
No No No no way  
No No no way I'm living without you  
I'm not living without ya now  
Living without ya  
  
I don't want to be free  
I'm stayin I'm stayin  
And you and you and you  
You're gonna love me  
Ohhh

Yes you are  
You'll love me
