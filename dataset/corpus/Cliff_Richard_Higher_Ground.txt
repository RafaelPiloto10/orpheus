My heart has no desire to  
Stay where doubts arise  
And fears dismay.  
Though we must dwell  
Where these are bound  
I must go on to higher ground.  
I want to scale the  
Utmost hight and catch  
A gleam of glory bright.  
For faith has caught  
The joyful sound,  
The song of life on higher ground.  
Lord, lift me up  
And let me stand my feet  
On heaven's stable land.  
Oh, greater plane  
That I have found.  
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.  
I'm treading on the  
Upward way, new hights  
I'm gaining every day,  
Still praying as I'm homeward bound:  
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground.
