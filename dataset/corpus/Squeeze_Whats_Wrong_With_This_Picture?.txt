What's wrong with this picture  
Her eyes are like moons  
It's just like looking  
In two empty rooms  
She's looking so fragile  
As thin as an eel  
What's wrong with this picture  
What does it reveal  
Beauty speaks  
There's so much to say  
Tell me what's wrong with this picture today  
  
What's wrong with this picture  
She's lighter than air  
Life seems to be happening  
But she is not there  
The late night temptation  
The eyes on her skin  
What's wrong with this picture  
There's nobody in  
  
What's wrong with this picture  
Location withdrawn  
It's empty without you  
Your face so forlorn  
  
Shake yourself  
Sweep you head away  
Tell me what's wrong with this picture today
