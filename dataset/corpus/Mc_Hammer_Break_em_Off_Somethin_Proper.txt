Chorus (8x): (Q-tip)  
If you say Hammer Proper  
(Hammer)  
We about to break em off somethin Proper  
Once again it's on!  
You nigga's tried to dis me  
You missed me  
Chill G, For real G  
Man you nigga's kill me  
Tryin to knock me off the top  
Yo there's no contest G in the market  
Ya'll hata's never ? me  
As I deliver, hits too make em quiver  
Make em shiver, Q-tip couldn't flow if he was a river  
And me, I'm sellin milli like runnin the mill  
And like Big Daddy Kane "I Wonder How You Gotta Record Deal"  
Well everyday too make hits, you ain't got it  
Til this day you never ? never had it  
For me I tend to kick it like a partner  
And must I remind you I'm the funky headhunter  
I understand you bout as man as Rupaul  
I come on your block and move you out like a you-Haul  
So step right up and be the next contestant  
A Tribe Called Quest Is A Bad Investment  
I'm breakin em off with somethin proper!  
Chorus (4x)  
Like Hardaway boy I got skills  
Like 7up you never had it never will  
You talkin that mess punk  
I see that Kriss Kross couldn't make you jump (now they don't want funk)  
Your wack album out be doin  
They done bullshit you gotta go gotta go  
So pick the time and the place if you ever wanna Warren G  
Cause you could stay if you was Jodeci (Do you wanna Just Stay!)  
And get your sexual protection  
Or I'ma have your head in that played out rapper's collection

Cause you probably dis hammer fast son

Chorus (6x)  
Like the rest you was tryin to get paid  
These days you walkin around the Raid  
Cause I'm known to blow em away like a hand grenade  
(2 Bigg MC)  
We don't contest with them punks that ain't in our league  
And with the slangity bees

The funky headhunter so I can't get enough head!  
(2 Bigg MC)  
Dis me I'll sit your ass in the tortuary  
I'm makin your home a mortuary  
(MC Hammer)  
I'm so hyped to make you seat like a sedative  
You didn't sign to another crew had to be a relative  
(Suge Knight)  
You all about as real as yo gel fro  
For you we had know use  
So we gone execute you like Death Row  
(MC Hammer)  
So don't misunderstand  
I was a Menace 2 Society  
When ya'll were Little Boys In Da Hood

(MC Hammer)  
When you bust my badge  
You better fell the raft

All them girls that gotta say Daddy Hammer's name
