My heart is taken it's not lost in space  
And I don't want to see your mooney mooney face  
I say why on earth do you revolve around me  
Aren't you aware of the gravity  
Don't need another satellite  
  
I'm happy standing on my feet of clay  
I have no wish to swim your Milky Milky Way  
I say why on earth do you send your letters 'round here  
Only to gum up the atmosphere  
Don't need another satellite  
  
So circling we'll orbit another year  
Two worlds that won't collide  
So circling we'll orbit another year  
Moon still tries to steal the tide away  
  
Don't need another satellite  
Don't need another satellite  
  
Abort your mission let's just say you tried  
Before you glimpse I have a darker darker side  
I say why in Heaven's name do you come on these trips  
Only to freeze in a total eclipse  
Don't need another satellite  
  
So circling we'll orbit another year  
Two worlds that won't collide  
So circling we'll orbit another year  
Moon still tries to steal the tide away  
Don't need another satellite  
Don't need another satellite [don't need another satellite]
