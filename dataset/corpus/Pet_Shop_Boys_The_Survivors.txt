Cross a windy bridge one winter night  
Past Embankment Gardens  
Enter warmth and light  
Face the music (it's never easy)  
Forget the chill  
Face the future (it's never easy)  
Find the will  
If live is worth living  
It's got to be done  
One might be forgiven  
For thinking it's a life on the run  
Many roads will cross through many lives  
But somehow you survive  
Look around  
Picture what's in store  
Is this the final edit  
Or is the subject now a bore?  
Don't shrug your shoulders (it's always easy)  
You can't ignore  
That life is worth living  
It's still worth a damn  
One might be forgiven for thinking  
It's something of a sham  
Many words may make it sound contrived  
But somehow we're alive  
(The Survivors)  
Our heads bowed  
(The Survivors)  
At memorials for other faces  
In the crowd  
Teachers and artists (it's never easy)  
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins  
(It's never easy)  
Or twinsets-and-pearls  
If life is worth living  
It's got to be run as a means of giving  
Not as a race to be won  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow we'll arrive  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow we'll survive
