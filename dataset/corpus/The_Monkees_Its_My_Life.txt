It's my life and I'm takin' over now  
It's my life and it's time that I learned how  
No excuses. For the truth is  
It's my life now  
  
I stumble and I fall  
And I think about it all  
Then I make amends  
But it never ends  
  
And I've just begun to wonder why  
And I listen to the songs,  
And I read all the words,  
And I seem to remember something that I heard  
Of a fire and a cave and shadows on the wall  
  
It's my life and I'm takin' over now  
It's my life and it's time that I learned how  
No excuses. For the truth is  
It's my life now  
  
I want to believe in the miracles  
But they mix me up. Then they pass the cup  
And I've just begun to look the other way  
And I don't want to lean on the stars or on the dreams  
On the fantasies or the deities  
Don't I think it's time to lean on me?  
  
It's my life and I'm takin' over now  
It's my life and it's time that I learned how  
No excuses. For the truth is  
It's my life now  
  
No excuses. For the truth is  
It's my life now
