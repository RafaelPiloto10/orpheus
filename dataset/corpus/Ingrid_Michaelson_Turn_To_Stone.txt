Let's take a better look  
Beyond a story book  
And learn our souls are all we own  
Before we turn to stone  
  
Let's go to sleep with clearer heads  
And hearts too big to fit out beds  
And maybe we won't feel so alone  
Before we turn to stone  
  
And if you wait for someone else's hand  
You will surely fall down  
If you wait for someone else's hand  
You'll fall, you'll fall  
  
I know that I am nothing new  
There's so much more than me and you  
But brother how we must atone  
Before we turn to stone
