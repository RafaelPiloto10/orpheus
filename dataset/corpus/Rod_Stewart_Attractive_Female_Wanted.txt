I'm tired of buying Penthouse and Oui and Hustler  
It's Friday night I'm all alone still a bachelor  
She said she'd call me when she'd finished work  
Haven't heard a word all day  
  
I may not be Warren Beatty or Mohammed Ali  
(Attractive female wanted)  
I ain't asking a great deal, just a female to move in with me  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
I'll share all my records, toothbrush and car  
And color TV, honestly  
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
She doesn't have to be a movie star  
Cover of a magazine  
She can work in a garage all day  
In the evening some canteen  
  
I'm tired of blind dates making silly mistakes  
It's embarrassing  
(Attractive female wanted)  
I've had no complaints  
  
But obviously you've guessed  
No compliments  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
Won't someone please answer my prayers  
Before I'm old and grey  
(Attractive female wanted)  
I've been lonely too long  
All of my family think I'm gay  
  
She doesn't have to be a movie star  
Cover of magazine  
She can work in a garage all day  
In the evening some canteen  
  
Attractive female wanted  
Active female wanted  
I may get drunk stink like a skunk  
But she'll look after me  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
Put me to bed ease my aching head  
And made fuss of me  
You know what I gonna do  
Think I'll write a letter  
To Mr. Hugh Heffner confidentially  
  
Dear Sir  
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy
