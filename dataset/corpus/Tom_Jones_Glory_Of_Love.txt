You've got to give a little,  
Take a little  
And let your poor heart break a little  
  
That's the story of  
That's the glory of love  
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little  
Before the clouds roll by a little  
  
That's the story of  
That's the glory of love  
As long as there's the two of you  
You've got the world and all its charms  
And when the world is through with you  
You've got each others arms  
  
You've got to win a little Lose a little  
And always have the blues a little  
That's the story of That's the glory of love.  
That's the story of, that's the glory of love.
