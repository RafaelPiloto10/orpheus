I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
  
Faster and faster we run into life, no time for emotions  
Higher and higher we raise our limits too fast  
Lost with protectors and will to survive, it's an illusion  
Colder and colder it gets as we walk down the line  
  
I don't wanna be a part  
Of that foolish game  
I just try another start  
Nothing stays the same  
  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
  
Stronger and stronger we march into thy  
Don't show no weakness  
Don't show no mercy for those who are allied in pain  
Stay where you are no complaining at all  
  
Never get restless  
Never just step out of line cause it won't be the same  
  
I don't wanna be a part  
Of that foolish game  
I just try another start  
Or else I go insane  
  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In a world that cries for more equality  
I'm free, as free as one can be  
In this world so full of tears and misery  
Today  
Today  
Today  
Today
