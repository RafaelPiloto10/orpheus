Chorus:  
  
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing  
You don't really wanna stop  
Eh eh  
Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing  
You don't really wanna stop  
Eh eh  
  
Verse one: puff daddy  
  
Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon  
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars  
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours  
If it's not it's yours, we on the job  
Everybody eatin, everybody involved  
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap  
Bad boy stop what's the chance of that?  
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks  
And we don't have to answer to jack  
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers  
Pull up at the party, eight straight hummers  
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders  
Pop corks, we be the toast of new york  
And out west, we want y'all to understand  
All we wanna do is make you dance  
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot  
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse two: lil' kim  
  
When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough  
Fuck domino's, strictly dice  
Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price  
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke  
While my pockets on re-up  
Y'all niggaz shit on e, what a pi-ty  
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me  
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple  
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies  
Drive a ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow  
He know, anything I touch I blow  
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow  
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a lexus too  
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you  
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone  
Lil' kim and puff daddy keep keepin it on  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse three: puff daddy  
  
Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road  
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow  
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home  
On the six-four, sittin on chrome  
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall  
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off  
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us  
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us  
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious  
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon  
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch  
Every single region, we own blocks  
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better  
Every single I drop, at least two are better  
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot  
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything we make is hot  
Thought I told you that we never stop  
Keep risin to the top, yeahhh  
Keep risin to the top, yeahhh  
(repeat above four lines over another chorus to fade)
