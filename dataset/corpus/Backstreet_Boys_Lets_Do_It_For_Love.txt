I love you with everything that's in me  
Did you know that?  
You'll be the first that's ever been so close  
You should know that  
I've been loving you since the beginning  
For what it's worth I've always been waiting for this moment  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love  
  
Never had a reason to believe that love would find me  
It must've known something that I didn't know  
And you showed me that if I had a chance to go to heaven  
Girl I'd stay here cause nothing could make me miss this moment  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love  
  
I can't think of any place I'd rather be than here with you  
When I hold you close to me feeling every bound of your heartbeat, baby  
It's the way you look into my eyes  
That lets me know just what you wish it's for a night like this  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love  
  
  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love
