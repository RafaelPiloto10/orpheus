In a deep breath it all starts to change.  
Flip my world inside out, honestly I like it better this way  
When I mesh the night through the back of my eyes  
  
I have put myself here  
I'm the culprit  
I am the culprit  
  
I've been swallowed up alive  
Shut down  
Building from the inside out  
I can finally walk through the walls  
  
I swear I've slipped right through the cracks in the floor  
It's so easy when it's pulling me under  
  
Now I can see things from the outside,  
And I will sit here with no place in mind  
  
I can't escape from this place, this is so familiar to me  
  
I can hear the unsatisfying silence  
My mouth is open but none of you can hear me
