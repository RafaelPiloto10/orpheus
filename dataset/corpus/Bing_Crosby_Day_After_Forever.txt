All day tomorrow  
I'll be whispering your name  
And the day after forever  
I know I'll do the same  
  
May time or winter  
I won't let you out of sight  
And the day after forever  
We'll talk about tonight  
  
Your laughter is a melody  
That I'll remember long  
It plays upon my heartstrings  
It's my favorite song  
  
All through a lifetime  
I'll be loving you and then  
On the day after forever  
I'll just begin again
