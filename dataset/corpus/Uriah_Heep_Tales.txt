We told our tales as we sat under  
Morning's sleepy sky  
With all the colors of  
The sunrise shining in our eyes  
  
One, then another  
With a story of yesterday's life  
Or of a lover who had  
Gone in a moment of strife  
  
No thought of sleep ever dwells  
Upon the wise man's mind  
Some task or audience  
Stealing every moment of his time  
  
Thus we have learned to live  
While mortal men  
Stand waiting to die  
How can we do what must be done  
In just one short life  
  
And if you ask  
Then you must know  
If you still doubt  
You should be told  
It was not we  
That made it so  
It was by those  
Who went before  
  
And there you sit  
Tomorrow's child  
So full of love  
So full of life  
But you must rise  
To meet the day  
Lest you become another tale  
  
Another tale
