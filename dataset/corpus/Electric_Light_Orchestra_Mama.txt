She came up from the country with a smile for everyone  
She left her blue horizon just to find another home  
A lonely girl who'd traveled many days  
A lonely heart that could not find the way  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near  
Momma, it's a sad and lonely life  
  
A misty morning rider, she came wanderin' through the hills  
A wanderin' soul appearin' over rainy window sills  
A loser in her heart but in her face  
A smile for everyone under God's grace  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near  
Momma, it's a sad and lonely life  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
  
Midnight maiden madness, what to search for in this place'  
Gateway to the city, night sky shadows on her face  
A lady lost in nowhere but her stare  
Leaves the world, her life to start somewhere  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near  
  
Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near
