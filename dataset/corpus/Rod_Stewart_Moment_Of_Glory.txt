Here is a story that is bound to amuse ya  
(about a fine young couple startin' out in life)  
A dedicated husband and a real fine worker  
(who lived for his children and his beautiful wife)  
But one night in Dallas at a computer convention  
(he got so loaded he could hardly stand)  
Woke up with a heavy head and a strange girl beside him  
(returned home a worried guilty man)  
But inside his coat his wife found a note  
It said "Thanks for the good time Can I see you again"  
She asked him "Why oh why" Tears rollin' down her eyes  
"would you give it all up for a moment of glory" glory  
  
Packed up all her bags and returned to her mother  
(Two small children clinging to her dress)  
Hurt and disillusioned but never down hearted  
(she picked up the pieces of her broken life)  
And meanwhile back in Boston the culprit lie thinkin'  
(trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine)  
Fired from his job and missing his children  
(he didn't care one way if he lived or died)  
Oh what a crying shame nobody else to blame  
for one night of pleasure he had given her pain  
Oh how it was so hard to climb so far to give it all up  
for a moment of glory, glory  
  
As the months rolled by and accusations fly  
the bloodsuckin' lawyers know they're in for a kill  
The gold war begins she's takin' off her rings  
Close friends take sides while the waters are still  
  
Phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment  
(it was his little boy Johnny and his sister Beth)  
They said "Daddy we miss you would you talk to Mommy"  
(a line of communication he had sadly missed)  
She said "Now don't get me wrong this is where you belong"  
I said "Good-bye children we can work it all out"  
"But don't you ever forget how this family has bled  
'cause you give it all up for a moment of glory" glory  
  
Won't you give it all up  
you give it all up  
Won't you give it all up  
you give it all up
