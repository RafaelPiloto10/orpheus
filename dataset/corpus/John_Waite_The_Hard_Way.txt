Jenny's sitting in the car  
In the middle of some abandoned Shoney's parking lot  
Ripping off the filters off her cigarettes  
Crying, he loves me, loves me not  
  
She checks her makeup in the rearview mirror and turns the radio on  
It hasn't hit her yet  
But all she's looking at is another lonely night coming on  
Everybody learns the hard way  
  
The hard way about love  
It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere  
But make no mistake  
Everybody learns the hard way about love  
  
Meanwhile across town Tommy's in a dark bar watching some blonde girl shaking
all she's got  
Out on the tiles, out on the edge  
He's gonna give it his best shot  
All that hard earned money ever got him was all alone  
  
It's two in the morning and the only thing that's falling is the rain  
And it's a long walk home  
Everybody learns the hard way  
The hard way, yeah  
  
The hard way about love  
It's easy to think that there's something better out there somewhere  
But make no mistake  
Everybody learns the hard way about love  
  
Everybody learns the hard way about love  
And in the cold heart light of day  
Romeo doesn't always get his Juliet  
You take your hands off the wheel  
  
Your eyes off the prize  
You'll get a lesson that you won't forget  
Down on your knees and regret
