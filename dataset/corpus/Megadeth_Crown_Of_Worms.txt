I am the author, dream up your pain  
Drink as did Bacchus, rebel just like Cain  
Lord of the city, I shall remain  
All pandemonium, I shall reign  
Sit in my fortress, up on my hill  
Drinking the wine, 'til I've had my fill  
Building up high, my castle walls  
Oh, to veil my splendid fall  
  
I present you, I present to you,  
I present you this crown of worms  
  
Surrounding myself with mysery  
Drawn curtains heavy of my history  
Exquisite I am, perfect unity  
On my left hand is false majesty  
I feign affection, refute the true story  
Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory  
I care for no one, my gospel is death  
For me the light's gone, only darkness is left  
  
I present you, I present to you,  
I present you this crown of worms  
  
As black in deed, as cold as stone  
A commandment of one, as proud as gold  
As neglected in spirit, as time is old  
As legion is numbers, as legend is told  
I am alone, with the agony of truth  
My power of will, my judgment and chain  
My end is knowledge and conscience of guilt,  
My final confusion hidden from me till I'm done
