In recognition of a hundred million album sales  
In recognition of your popularity  
You take your gaudy prize  
From people you said you despise  
You wear your self-respect upon your bended knee  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their name  
  
In recognition of your service to the working class  
In recognition of your party loyalty  
You get an ermine robe  
And you declare when you are probed  
You only took it so the missus would be pleased  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their names  
  
Oh vanity  
It gets them one by one  
Cat, religion, monarchy  
But only in tale, fairly frail  
  
In recognition of your bravery up on the stage  
In recognition of your bankability  
You get to wait in lines  
With soldiers crippled by land mines  
And you think it's the Yanks that don't get irony  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their name  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their name  
  
Their name  
Their name  
Their name
