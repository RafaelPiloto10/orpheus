If you believe in Darwin's theory  
I'm not saying you have to but it's an interesting theory  
Darwin said we all evolve from monkeys  
If his theory is accurate and who am I to say?  
Does the opposite work going the other way?  
If it does I wanna devolve back to a monkey  
I wanna be a monkey that's for sure  
I wanna be a monkey like Curious George  
I would sit around all day just eating bananas  
I might be naked or just wear pyjamas  
And make my money appearing in hilarious movies  
Monkey see, monkey do  
That would be my excuse  
It's not my fault, I'm just a monkey who can see  
I wanna be a monkey, that'd be nice  
I wanna be a monkey, eating other monkey's lice  
When they say it's so easy that a monkey could do it  
I'd be more than happy to prove it  
Then you'd know for sure if it was easy or not  
And if you wanna see the home of Michael Jackson  
I could provide some simian distraction  
Cuz we all know monkeys are Michael's second biggest weakness  
I wanna be a monkey yes I do  
I wanna be a monkey and fling my poo  
I wanna be a monkey  
I'd be agape if I was an ape  
What a thrilla to be a gorilla  
It would rock to be a macaque  
I wanna be a monkey
