Look out of my window  
See the world passing by  
See the look in her eye  
  
One more time to live and I have made it mine  
Leave the wise to write for they write worldly rhymes  
  
And he who wants to fight begins the end of time...  
For I have riches more than these  
For I have riches more than these  
  
Desolation  
Creation  
Tell me someone why there's only confusion  
Evolution  
  
Tell me someone that this is all an illusion  
Pollution  
Tell me someone  
Saturation  
  
Tell me someone  
Population  
Annihilation  
Revolution  
  
Tell me someone why this talk of revolution  
Confusion  
Tell me someone when we're changing evolution  
Illusion  
  
Tell me someone  
Conclusion  
Tell me someone  
Starvation  
  
Degredation  
Humiliation  
Contemplation  
Changes in my life  
  
Inspiration  
Elation  
Changes in my life  
Salvation  
  
Changes in my life  
Communication  
Compassion  
Solution  
  
Look out on the hedgerow  
As the world rushes by  
Hear the birds sign a sigh  
  
One more tree will fall how strong the growing vine  
Turn the earth to sand and still permit no crime  
How one thought will live provide the others die  
For I have riches more than these  
For I have riches more than these
