Your mouth is dry  
The moon is shining  
The night is cold and lonely  
For you this must be frightening  
  
Since you moved down my spine,  
There's something wrong in the shade of mine  
Let's do it one more time  
You let me hear in this bed of mine  
  
Give me one good reason why  
As you're spare  
Spare your throat tonight  
Give me one good reason why  
I should give you,  
Give you love tonight  
  
Bodies shaking  
(Bodies shaking)  
Darkness fading  
(Darkness fading)  
Yeah!  
  
Can you please keep screaming,  
Screaming blood for me  
  
The sun is up  
I see things clearly,  
Your bruises show so bloody  
For me this must be tempting  
  
Since you moved down my spine,  
There's something wrong in the shade of mine  
Let's do it one more time  
You let me hear in this bed of mine  
  
Give me one good reason why  
As you're spare,  
Spare your throat tonight  
Give me one good reason why  
I should give you,  
Give you love tonight  
  
Bodies shaking  
(Bodies shaking)  
Darkness fading  
(Darkness fading)  
Yeah!  
  
Can you please keep screaming,  
Screaming blood for me  
  
One good reason  
Give me one good reason why  
One good reason  
Give me one good reason why  
  
Give me one good reason why  
As you're spare,  
Spare your throat tonight  
Give me one good reason why  
I should give you,  
Give you love tonight.  
  
Bodies shaking  
(Bodies shaking)  
Darkness fading  
(Darkness fading)  
Yeah!  
  
Can you please keep screaming,  
Screaming blood for me.
