Hey wait a minute  
You're a little lost  
Things keep on changing  
And so does the cost  
Of doin' business with yourself  
Don't want nobody else, no  
  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't take no from you  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't take no, no, no, no  
  
Hey mister sister  
Leave me alone  
Today kids don't grow up  
They just grow alone  
Guess you know how bad I felt  
When you were with somebody else, oh  
  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't take no from you  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't take no, no, no, no  
  
Hey  
You  
Hey, hey you  
  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't take no from you  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't no  
I won't no for an answer  
  
I won't no (for an answer)
