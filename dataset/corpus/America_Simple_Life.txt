Life today is frittered away  
You've got to simplify  
Each in our own way, we live for today  
And never know why  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
  
Take your cars and your bars  
And trade 'em all in for a nice wood fire  
At the end of the day I know you will say  
You couldn't get much higher  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
You know I'd like to make it mine
