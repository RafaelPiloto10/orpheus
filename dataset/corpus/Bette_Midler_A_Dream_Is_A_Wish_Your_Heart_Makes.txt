A dream is a wish your heart makes  
When you're fast asleep  
In dreams you will lose your heartache  
Whatever you wish for you keep  
  
Have faith in your dreams  
And someday, your rainbow will come shining through  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you just keep believing  
The dream that you wish will come true  
  
A dream is a wish your heart makes  
When you're feeling small.  
Alone in the night you whisper  
Think no one can hear at all.  
You wake with morning sunlight to find fortune that smile on you.  
Don't let your heart be filled with sorrow  
For almost in tomorrow the dream you wish will come true.  
  
The dream is a wish your heart makes  
The dream is a wish your heart makes  
You wake with the morning sunlight to find fortune that smile on you.  
Don't let your heart be filled with sorrow  
For almost in tomorrow the dream you wish will come true.  
No matter how your heart is grieving  
If you just keep believing  
The dream that you wish will come true
