The lights are on but you're not home  
Your mind is not your own  
Your body sweats, your body shakes  
Another kiss is what it takes  
You can't eat, you can't sleep  
There's no doubt you're in deep  
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe  
Another kiss is all you need  
  
You like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah  
It's closer to the truth, you know  
You're gonna have to face it  
You might as well face it, you're addicted to love  
  
You see the signs but you can't read  
You're running at a different speed  
Your heart beats at double time  
Another kiss and you'll be mine  
One-track mind, you can't be saved  
Another young love is all you crave  
And if the sun left you  
You don't mind if you do  
  
You like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah  
It's closer to the truth, you see  
You're gonna have to face it  
You're gonna have to face that you're addicted to love  
  
You might as well face it, you're addicted to love
