Only just a friend,  
The love story begins,  
Now here's a happy ending to believe in.  
And always there for me,  
Now you're with me in my dreams  
It's got me wondering if you ever,  
Dream of me.  
I don't wanna risk losing everything.  
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking.  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl, you'll be my best friend,  
Can we put this to bed then?  
Tonight's the night  
To cross the line  
Baby won't you be mine?  
Not just my home girl  
Time that I take you home girl  
Tonight's the night  
To cross the line  
Let me love you tonight.  
I, I, I  
  
Kiss, kiss, kiss me on my lips  
We've been dancing 'round the moment  
Now we're doing it.  
Breathe, breathe.  
And sigh your sweet relief  
We've been holding it so long,  
The wait was killing me.  
Oh and we, are what we, have been waiting for.  
So baby, open your mind, while I close the door.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't let this moment just slip away.  
Cause we'll never know, unless we try someday  
If you're ready, I'm so ready  
Tonight's the night  
Tonight's the night.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
