Remember when  
Never needed each other  
The best of friends  
Like sister and brother  
We understood  
We'd never be alone  
  
Those days are gone  
Now I want you so much  
The night is long  
And I need your touch  
Don't know what to say  
Never meant to feel this way  
Don't want to be  
Alone tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
What can I do to make you mine?  
Falling so hard, so fast, this time  
What did I say?  
What did you do?  
How did I fall in love with you?  
  
I hear your voice  
And I start to tremble  
Brings back the child that  
I resemble  
  
I cannot pretend  
That we can still be friends  
Don't want to be  
Alone tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to say this right  
And it has to be tonight  
Just need you to know  
  
I don't want to live this life  
I don't want to say goodbye  
With you I want to spend  
The rest of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What can I do to make you mine?  
Falling so hard, so fast, this time  
Everything's changed  
We never knew  
How did I fall in love with you
