Everybody's worried about time  
But I just keep that shit off my mind  
People living on twenty four hour clocks  
Everybody's worried about time  
But I just keep that shit off my mind  
People living on twenty four hour clocks  
But we're on a ride that never stops  
  
Hey Mister Bee the world change but you remain the same  
And I wonder how you'll survive with the environment going down the drain  
Hey Miss Dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
  
A dog looked at me and said, Ziggy why can't we trust man  
Puss and me get together, so, why can't you all just understand  
An old tree stood there silently listening to every word we said  
As a tear fell he cried what type of creature is man  
  
I said hey Mister Tree the world change but you remain the same  
And I wonder how you survive with the environment going down the drain  
Hey Miss Butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
  
Everybody's worried about time  
But I just keep that shit off my mind  
People living on twenty four hour clocks  
But we're on a ride, yes we're on a ride, we're on a ride that never stops  
  
Hey Mister Bee the world change but you remain the same  
And I hope you'll survive while the environment is going down the drain  
Hey Miss Dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes  
You must be wondering what type of creature am I  
You must be wondering what type of creature is man
