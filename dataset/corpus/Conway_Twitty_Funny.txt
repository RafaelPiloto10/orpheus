Well, I just saw you out with another  
And I watched as you held his hand  
It seems funny to see you with him instead of me  
Funny but I'm not laughing.  
  
Then I heard you say it's all over  
That you never loved me anyway  
That the things we had done were only in fun  
Funny but I'm not laughing.  
  
Then I turned away so my eyes couldn't see  
His arms were around you where mine used to be.  
  
You would have laughed if you'd have only seen me  
Yes, I guess, I was a funny sight to see  
Standing there on the street  
With my heart at my feet  
Funny but I'm not laughing.  
  
Funny but I'm not laughing...
