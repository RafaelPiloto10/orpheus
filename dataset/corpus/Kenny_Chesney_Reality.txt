For me it's a beach bar  
Or on a boat underneath the stars  
Or with my band up on a stage  
For a while everything's okay  
  
For some it's a fast car  
Moonshine in a mason jar  
And everybody has their way  
Somehow to escape  
  
Reality, yeah, sometimes life  
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be  
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy  
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality  
  
Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer  
We need a rock and roll show in the summer  
To let the music take us away  
Take our minds to a better place  
  
Where we feel that sense of freedom  
Leave our worries behind, we don't need 'em  
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate  
And we'll escape  
  
Reality, yeah, sometimes life  
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be  
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy  
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality  
  
Everybody raise your hands and voice tonight  
Set your soul free, let's take a carpet ride  
We'll leave it all behind  
  
Reality, yeah, sometimes life  
Ain't all that it's cracked up to be  
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy  
'Cause everybody needs to break free from reality  
  
Come on everybody, break free  
Come on everybody, break free
