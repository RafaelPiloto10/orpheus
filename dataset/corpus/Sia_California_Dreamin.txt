[Chorus] x2  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
I've been for a walk on a winter's day  
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
  
[Verse]  
I stopped into a church I passed along the way  
Well I got down on my knees and I pretended to pray  
You know the preacher liked the cold, he knows I'm gonna stay  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
  
[Bridge]  
I'd be safe and warm  
I'd be safe and warm  
I'd be safe and warm  
I'd be safe and warm  
  
[Outro]  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
I've been for a walk on a winter's day  
If I didn't go, I could leave today  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
Oh such a winter's day  
On such a winter's day
