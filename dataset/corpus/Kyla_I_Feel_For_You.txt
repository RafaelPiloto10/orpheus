Something inside,  
My heart,  
And it feels like magic,  
It's changing my life.  
Since you came to me,  
Everything is so bright I see  
You touched my heart,  
And gave me love so real.  
This time around I wanna let it show  
There's something special,  
In my heart you ought to know  
I feel for you,  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love  
You are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean always love you  
Because to me  
You are a dream  
Come true  
Love grows  
Everyday  
And it's hard to deny it  
You inspire me all the way  
The joy you bring  
Makes my heart keep on singing  
And all I wanna do  
Is to remain close to you  
This time around I wanna let it show  
There's something special  
In my heart you ought to know  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love you are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean I'll always love you  
Because to me you are a dream  
Come true  
You are my angel in disguise  
You are the reason I survive  
With you each moment is worthwhile  
You make me smile  
And if without you  
Surely I cry  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love you are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean I'll always love you  
Because to me you are a dream(3x)  
That's what I feel for you...
