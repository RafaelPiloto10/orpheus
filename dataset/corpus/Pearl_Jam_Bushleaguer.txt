(lies, lies, lies, lies, lies...)  
(lies, lies, lies, lies, lies...)  
How does he do it? How do they do it? uncanny and immutable  
This is such a happening tailpipe of a party  
Like sugar, the guests are so refined  
A confidence man, but why so beleaguered?  
He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer  
Swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike  
Drilling for fear makes the job simple  
Born on third, thinks he got a triple  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way...  
I remember when you sang that song about today  
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed  
A think tank of aloof multiplication  
A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter  
Retrenchment and hoggishness  
The aristocrat choir sings, "what's the ruckus?"  
The haves have not a clue  
The immenseness of suffering  
And the odd negotiation, a rarity  
With onionskin plausibility of life  
And a keyboard reaffirmation  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way...  
I remember when you sang that song about today  
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed  
I remember when you sang that song about today  
Now it's tomorrow and everything has changed  
Changed, changed, chains, etc...
