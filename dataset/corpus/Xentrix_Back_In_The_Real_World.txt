You tell us how you'll make it to the top,  
But you don't try.  
Your bullshit makes us sick,  
We just laugh until we cry.  
We've heard it all before,  
And we don't care.  
Don't talk to me no more,  
Life just ain't fair.  
Now that you've patronised us, humiliated us,  
Please go away.  
I hope you're satisfied, come back,  
Say I told you so one day.  
We've heard...  
Look before you leap,  
Think before you speak,  
Wait before you move.  
How many times must you tell us of your  
Stupid pointless dreams?  
Wake up and realise that life  
Is not as easy as it seems.  
We've heard...  
Look before...
