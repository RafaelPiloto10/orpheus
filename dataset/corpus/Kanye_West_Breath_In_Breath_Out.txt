(feat. Ludacris)  
[Hook: Ludacris]  
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out  
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out  
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in, breathe out  
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"  
[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap  
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)  
But is it cool to rap about gold  
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)  
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack  
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack  
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant  
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again  
And it's still about the Benjamins  
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms  
Strippers named Cinnamon  
More chips than Pentium  
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is  
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks  
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"  
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?  
What the hell was wrong with me dog?  
Sing along with my y'all  
[Hook: Ludacris]  
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

Push a big truck, pull ya keys out  
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out  
Breathe in, breathe out  
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out  
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out  
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick  
I always had a Ph. D.: a Pretty Huge dick  
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like
