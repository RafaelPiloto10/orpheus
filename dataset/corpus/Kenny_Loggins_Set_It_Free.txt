I can see the rain  
Come into my room again  
Broken window pane  
Now reminds me I'm alive  
  
Could it be right  
Giving up, my darling  
I'll wait for you now  
To remind me why I've gone  
  
How I love to write  
Songs that have no answers  
Oh, there's nothing on my mind  
That I want to let go of  
  
Letting it go on pretending  
Everything has its way of ending  
And I'm a loner  
The way I should be  
  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to fly  
Set it free  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to be  
Can I be free?  
  
Still it's gotta rain  
Wonder when I'll see a change in weather  
Something's getting tangled up again  
And I can't find an end  
  
Can't let it go on returning  
I've given everything that the harlequin boy can find  
And I'm tired of trying  
I'd rather leave than tell lies  
  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to fly  
Set it free  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to be  
You'll be free  
  
You'll be free my love to fly  
Free to be what I can't face  
In love again  
Set it free  
  
Free  
Set it free  
Set it free my love  
  
Free  
Set it free  
Set it free my love
