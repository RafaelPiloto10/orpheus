Give him a soft guitar to play what he choose  
He ain't got no fancy chords  
Only got his blues  
Poor happy Jimmy  
I didn't know him very well but he was with me  
And I won't take a dime just to make it rhyme  
Cause I cried and cried the day he died  
Poor happy Jimmy  
Give him sweet melodies he sing with all he has  
He got a funky paraphrase  
It sound like good time jazz  
Poor happy Jimmy  
I didn't know him very well but he was with me  
And I won't put the blame on the aeroplane  
But I boo-hoo'd on the day he flew  
Poor happy Jimmy  
I wonder why  
That I can't forget all the things you said about your life and times  
You set a spell inside  
Oh James your soft guitar it make me feel to cry  
The sole consolation is  
A good man never dies  
God bless you Jimmy  
I love you with all my heart so deep within me  
And you won't see the end of your lonely friend  
Cause I'll pray and pray for you every day  
Poor happy Jimmy  
Poor happy Jimmy ....
