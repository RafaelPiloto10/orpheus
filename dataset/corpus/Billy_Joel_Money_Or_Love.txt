Money or love, which one are you doing it for?  
Everybody has to make that choice sometime, you know  
Something is wrong, I can tell the feeling is gone  
Do you still remember when we started long ago?  
Wasn't it love that kept us all driving in a rented car?  
Who could've known that endless road would ever have come this far?  
  
Money or love, it's your decision where to draw the line  
Everybody has a soul they can control or compromise  
When did you to start putting a price upon the pain in your heart?  
When did I become the reason for the sadness in your eyes?  
You could've asked me anytime, I would've told you why  
Maybe I might I would change your mind, but now it's too late to try...  
  
Goodbye...  
  
Every night I ask myself, could I have been closer to you, when you needed
someone else  
Could a friend who really knew you try... Help you decide  
  
Money or love, tell me what ya gonna do with your life?  
Everybody needs a passion or they cash in while they can  
Make up your mind, before you realize you've run out of time  
You need to reason why, you've got to touch the fire to make your stand  
You could've asked me anytime I would've told you why  
Maybe I might have changed your mind, but now it's too late to try.  
  
Goodbye...  
  
Money or love  
  
Wasn't is love that kept us all driving in a rented car?  
Who could've known that endless road  
Would ever have come this far?  
  
Was it money or love?  
  
Money or love...  
  
Was it money or love... Money or love...  
Money or love... Money or love... Money or love...  
Was it money or love... Was it money or love... Was it love...?
