Why does the sun go on shining why does the sea rush to shore  
Don't they know it's the end of the world cause you don't love me anymore  
Why do the birds go on singing why do the stars glow above  
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when I lost your love  
I wake up in the morning and I wonder why everything's the same as it was  
I can't understand no I can't understand why life goes on the way it does  
Why does my heart go on beating why do these eyes of mine cry  
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when you said goodbye  
[ piano ]  
Don't they know it's the end of the world it ended when you said goodbye
