Take away the sensation inside  
Bitter sweet migraine in my head  
Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind  
I can't take this feeling anymore  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling,  
The sensations overwhelming,  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright  
Tell me that I won't feel a thing  
So give me Novacaine  
  
Out of body and out of mind  
Kiss the demons out of my dreams  
I get the funny feeling, that's alright  
Jimmy says it's better than here,  
I'll tell you why  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling,  
The sensations overwhelming,  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright,  
Tell me that I won't feel a thing,  
So give me Novacaine  
  
Oh Novacaine  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling,  
The sensations overwhelming  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright,  
Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing,  
So give me Novacaine
