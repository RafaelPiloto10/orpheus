Undercover cop car  
Came screeching to a halt  
Body lying on the ground  
Must be someone's fault  
Circumstantial evidence  
Seemed to point her way  
Her right to remain silent  
Was all she heard them say  
  
Blue dress, blue eyes  
Blonde hair, about five foot nine  
Wrong place, wrong time  
Wrong face, wrong crime  
  
(chorus):  
Mistaken identity  
Could happen to you or to me  
Mistaken identity  
Mistaken identity  
Could happen to you or to me  
Mistaken identity  
Mistaken identity  
  
(i didn't do it, no, i didn't do it)  
No money for a lawyer  
To defend her case  
Standing in the line-up  
Tears rolling down her face  
  
No one cared to listen  
Someone had to take the heat  
Sometimes there's no justice  
When you're a victim of the street  
  
Wrong place, wrong time  
Wrong face, wrong crime (x4)  
  
(chorus):  
Tu ut tu tu tu...tu ut tut tu tu  
They didn't even say  
I'm sorry  
Tried to put her away  
In a hurry  
  
Don't make her pay the price  
She's not guilty  
(guilty)  
For someone else's crime  
Set her free  
(set her free)  
  
I didn't  
I didn't  
I didn't do it no (x4)  
  
(chorus out)
