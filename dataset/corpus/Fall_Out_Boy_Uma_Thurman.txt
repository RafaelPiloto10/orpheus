[Intro]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle,  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
Bury me 'till I confess.  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
And I can't get you out of my head.  
  
[Verse 1]  
The stench, the stench, of summer sex,  
And CK eternity, oh hell yes.  
Divide me down to the smallest I can be,  
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
Bury me 'till I confess.  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
And I can't get you out of my head.  
  
[Verse 2]  
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb,  
It's worth two lions, but here I am.  
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams,  
But they're not quite what they seem.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
  
[Bridge]  
You'll find your way,  
And may death find you alive.  
Take me down the line,  
In Gem City we claim the tide.  
You'll find your way,  
And may death find you alive.  
Take me down the line,  
In Gem City we turn the tide.  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
Bury me 'till I confess.  
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman,  
And I can't get you out of my head.  
  
[Outro]  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.  
I can move mountains,  
I can work a miracle, work a miracle.  
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath,  
May nothing but death do us part.
