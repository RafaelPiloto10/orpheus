Lord, in Your love  
You've given life to me  
Lord, in Your love  
Lord, for Your love  
I give my life to You  
Lord, for Your love.  
  
As You she'd Your blood  
May I she'd my blood for You  
In Your Truth revealed  
May my life be ever true.  
  
Through Your grace, my Lord  
Is my life redeemed from sin  
In Your death, my Lord  
Did my life begin again!  
  
I was empty, Lord  
Till Your presence filled my soul  
Without purpose, Lord  
Till Your purpose made me whole.  
  
How can I repay  
All the good You've done for me  
How can I express  
All the love I have for Thee?...
