Baby, please try to forgive me  
Stay here don't put out the glow  
Hold me now don't bother  
If every minute it makes me weaker  
You can save me from the man that I've become  
oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Looking back on the things I've done  
I was trying to be someone  
Played my part, kept you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart  
  
Sadness is beautiful  
Loneliness is tragical  
So help me I can't win this war  
oh no  
Touch me now don't bother  
If every second it makes me weaker  
You can save me from the man I've become  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm here with my confession  
Got nothing to hide no more  
I don't know where to start  
But to show you the shape of my heart  
  
I'm looking back on things I've done  
I never want to play the same old part  
Keep you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart  
  
Looking back on the things I've done  
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)  
Played my part, kept you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (Now let me show you the true shape
of my heart)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Show you the shape of my heart
