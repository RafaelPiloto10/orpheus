She looked at me with fire in her eyes.  
Looks can't kill but she certainly tries,  
and she tried as she might.  
But I'm gonna be all right,  
Shakin' it loose tonight.  
She said honey, "Forget me quick."  
Another fool, another Hollywood trick.  
Movin' on a red light.  
But I'm gonna be all right,  
Shakin' it loose tonight.  
  
I got to go there's someone on the phone.  
Knock on my door, but there's nobody home  
I turned out the light  
And I'm gonna be all right,  
Shakin' it loose tonight.  
  
Shake, shake, shakin' it loose tonight.  
Shake, shake, shakin' it loose tonight.  
I'm gonna make it.  
Shakin' it loose tonight.
