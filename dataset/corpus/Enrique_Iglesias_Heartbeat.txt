Heartbeat,  
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat  
Heartbeat, heartbeat  
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat  
  
I saw you talking on the phone  
I know that you are not alone  
But you're stealin' my heart away  
Yeah you're stealin' my heart away  
  
You're acting like you're on your own  
But I saw you standing with a girl  
Stop tryn' to steal my heart away,  
Stop tryn' to steal my heart away  
  
I don't know where we're goin'  
I don't know who we are  
  
I can feel your heartbeat  
I can feel your heartbeat  
He said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
Running through me  
Feel your heartbeat  
She said  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
Running through me  
Heartbeat  
Feel your heartbeat  
  
Maybe it's the way you move  
You got me dreaming like a fool  
That I could steal your heart away  
I could steal your heart away  
  
No matter what it is you think  
I'm not the kind of girl to blink  
And give my heart away  
Stop tryin' to steal my heart away  
  
I don't know where we're goin'  
I don't know who we are  
  
I can feel your heartbeat  
He said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
He said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
Running through me  
Heartbeat  
Feel your heartbeat  
She said  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
Running through me  
  
Stop stealin' my heart away  
Stop stealin' my heart away  
Stop stealin' my heart away  
You're stealin' my heart away  
  
I don't know where we're goin'  
I don't know who we are  
Feels like we are floating  
High above the stars, stars, stars, stars  
  
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat  
Heartbeat, heart heartbeat  
But I can feel it  
I can feel it  
I can feel it I can  
  
I can feel your heartbeat  
He said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
He said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
Running through me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
She said to me  
I can feel your heartbeat  
Running through me  
Heartbeat  
Feel your heartbeat  
  
Stop stealing my heart away  
Tell it to me girl  
Stop stealing my heart away  
Give it to me boy  
Stop stealing my heart away  
Say it to me girl  
You're stealing my heart away  
  
Stop stealing my heart away  
Stop stealing my heart away  
Stop stealing my heart away  
Your heartbeat.
