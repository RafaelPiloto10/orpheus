Tempered by greed, tall buildings breathe  
Give a sigh of relief when it's night  
Stirring from sleep, we night owls creep  
Is there any sign of life under this stone?  
  
Star chime, hollow and true  
Love child  
  
Weep for me, and I will set your wheels in motion  
Walk with me the inner reaches of emotion  
  
Sheltered by creed, one piled on one  
Do you have a little room for one small one?  
  
Light shine, wild and free  
Sunrise  
  
Weep for me, and I will set your wheels in motion  
Walk with me the inner reaches of emotion  
Stand by me, and I will fill you with devotion  
Walk with me the inner reaches of emotion  
  
Weep for me, the sands of time will fill the ocean  
Keep with me, like a roller on the ocean  
Walk with me, the inner reaches of emotion
