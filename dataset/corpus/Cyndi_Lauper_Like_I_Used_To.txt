I know you expected me  
To act just like a schoolgirl  
Followed your rules  
Just like a fool  
Wrapped up in your world  
What's good for you  
Don't mean that's so good for me  
What can I do, but hang around  
And lose myself just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
  
Well I ain't gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand  
And take things lying down like before  
Won't take your crap the way I used to  
Ain't gonna be the way it used to,  
Alright for you, ain't alright for me  
  
Maybe I was weak though the average  
Person probably thinks I'm stronger  
When I need someone else  
I shut out myself,  
Scared to say the wrong words  
What's right for you  
Don't think that's alright for me  
You spread the glue, so I can't move  
And stick to you just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw...  
  
Oh I ain't gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand...  
Ain't gonna do it like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
Alright for you ain't alright for me, no  
Every time you put me down  
Every time you screw me around  
Every time you do that to me  
I'm my own possession  
I'm my own possession...
