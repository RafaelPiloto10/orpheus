I won't pray here  
Or bow my head  
I won't praise your name  
I won't kneel down  
  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of sane (Oh Lord)  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of hell (Father)  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of heaven again  
  
I don't need faith  
Forgiveness of sin  
I don't need saving  
I don't need lies  
  
I don't believe  
In the angel wars (Oh Lord)  
I don't believe  
In the virgin birth (Father)  
I don't believe  
In the cross on the hill (Jesus)  
I don't believe  
In the kindness of God to man  
  
I'll drive a stake  
Through the black of your heart (Oh Lord)  
I'll pull down your temples  
And burn every word (Father)  
I'll kill all the angels  
That show me 'The Light' (Jesus)  
I'll drift into darkness  
And tear out the soul of God
