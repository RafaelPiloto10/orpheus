Born in the valley  
And raised in the trees  
Of western Kentucky  
On wobbly knees  
With mama beside you  
To help you along  
You'll soon be growing up strong  
  
All the long, lazy mornings  
In pastures of green  
The sun on your withers  
The wind in your mane  
Could never prepare you  
For what lies ahead  
The run for the roses so red  
  
And it's run for the roses  
As fast as you can  
You fate is delivered  
Your moment's at hand  
It's the chance of a lifetime  
In a lifetime of chance  
And it's high time you joined  
In the dance  
It's high time you joined  
In the dance  
  
From sire to sire  
It's born in the blood  
The fire of a mare  
And the strength of a stud  
It's breeding and it's training  
And it's something unknown  
That drives you  
And carries you home  
  
And it's run for the roses  
As fast as you can  
Your fate is delivered  
Your moment's at hand  
It's the chance of a lifetime  
In a lifetime of chance  
And it's high time you joined  
In the dance
