Watching blood stain windows  
He must just love the blame  
See the children crying  
His mother's died again  
  
Dig her grave much deeper  
The fatal price you pay  
I hope I'm there to hold her  
When she comes back again  
I see the death and the disaster  
There is no happy ever after  
The time has come  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
  
Is the Armageddon  
Finally here at last  
You may see the mushroom  
But you won't hear the blast  
Don't need a self made prophet  
Don't need a holy war  
Don't need another D-day  
To even up the score  
  
I'm cursed with living on a goldmine  
The doomsday clock was built by mankind  
No place to run  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
  
I see the death and the disaster  
There is no happy ever after  
The time has come  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun  
Countdown's begun
