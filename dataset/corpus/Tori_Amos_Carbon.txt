carbon made found her at the  
End of a chain "time to race"  
She said "race the downhill"  
Behind crystalline irises  
Loons can drive  
Where the world bleeds white  
Just keep your eyes on her  
Keep  
Don't look away  
Keep your eyes on her horizon  
Bear claw free fall  
A gunner's view black and blue  
Shred in ribbons of lithium  
Blow by blow  
Her mind cut in sheets  
Layers deep now unravelling  
Just keep your eyes on her.  
Get me Neil on the line  
No I can't hold  
Have him read "snow glass apples"  
Where nothing is what it seems  
"Little sis you must crack this"  
He says to me  
"you must go in again carbon  
Made only wants to be unmade"  
Blade to ice it's  
Double diamond time  
And keep your eyes on her  
On her eyes on her horizon
