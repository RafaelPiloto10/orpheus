Take out all my hair blonde today to change my homy touch  
I'll even learn a joke to tell that makes my pale face blush  
I'll change the high neck dress I wear to low cut dress I found  
To come up to what you're wantin' I'll sure come a long way down  
I'll put on heavy makeup so the real me won't show through  
I'll be the thing I hate the most if I can't be with you  
I'll come to the dark and dirty streets in the roughest part of town  
To come up to what you're wantin' I'll sure come a long way down  
[ steel ]  
I'll wear my lipstick much too red and a dress that fits too tight  
I'll be the kinda girl you want to fit into your life  
I'll give up everything that's good rechange to the things you bound  
To come up to what you're wantin' I'll sure come a long way down  
I'll put on heavy makeup...
