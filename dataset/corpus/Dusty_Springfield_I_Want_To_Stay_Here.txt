I don't wanna go to the party with you  
I don't wanna go to the dance  
I don't wanna go anywhere with you  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
  
Now that I can be alone with you  
I won't throw away the chance  
There's no other place like home with you  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
  
All through the week  
I miss you so  
But, now that I've got you  
I'm gonna hold you closer and closer and closer  
  
I don't wanna go out walking with you  
And now that I am in this trance  
I don't even know if I'll talk to you  
I just wanna stay here and  
I wanna love you, I wanna love you  
  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
I wanna stay here and love you  
Yes, I wanna stay here and love you  
Just wanna stay here and love you, ooh-ho, baby, baby  
I wanna stay here and love you  
Yes, I wanna stay here and love you
