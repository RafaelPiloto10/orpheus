Live performance  
Well, I dreamed I was a gypsy riding the land  
With a tambourine and a gypsy queen  
And a rainbow caravan  
Happy old land sailor, yeah, that's what I want to be  
Stealing diamonds from the rich men to throw in the sea  
Singing look toward the land  
'cause the land holds the key  
Keep an eye on the land  
And an eye on man  
  
Well, I dreamed I was a cabin boy  
On an American Clipper line  
Watering flowers for the captain  
That they may not wilt  
Bringing cargo to colonies of South Caroline  
On the best ol' Clipper Dave Mckay ever built  
  
Singing look toward the land  
'cause the land is the key  
Singing keep an eye on the land  
And an eye on the sea  
  
Well, I dreamed I was your lover  
'Cause that's what I want to be  
And I dreamed that every night you dreamed only of me  
And we walked along the beach, and ooh, we held hands  
And I told you you were my only woman  
And I was your only man  
  
Singing look toward the lovers  
For they are the key  
Keep an eye on the lovers  
And an eye on the war machine  
  
Yes I dreamed I was a captain of a river queen  
Caressing Mississippi waters down to New Orleans  
Yeah, a happy ol' riverboat captain, that's what I'd like to be  
And I'd let you ride my honey, I'd let you ride her for free  
  
Singing look toward the river  
'Cause the river's the key  
Keep an eye on the river  
And an eye on the sea  
  
Well, I dreamed I was your friend  
'Cause that's what I want to be  
And every night, you had dreams  
And they were all of me  
We'd walk all the streets together  
Hand in hand  
And be kind to the women  
And the women be kind to the me
