Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down  
I think you only live to see the lights uptown  
I wasted my time when I would try try try  
Cause when the lights have lost their glow you'll cry cry cry  
Soon your sugar babies will all be gone  
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone  
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye bye bye  
When I turn around and I walk away you'll cry cry cry  
You're gonna cry cry cry and you cry alone  
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own you're gonna cry cry cry  
  
I lie awake at night and wait till you come in  
You stay a little while and then you're gone again  
Every question that I ask I git a lie lie lie for every lie you tell you're
gonna cry cry  
When your fickle love gets on oh no one will care for you  
When you come back to me for a little love that's true  
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why why why  
When I remind you all of this you'll cry cry cry  
You're gonna cry cry cry and you'll cry and then  
It'll hurt when you think of a fool you've been  
You're gonna cry cry cry you're gonna cry cry cry
