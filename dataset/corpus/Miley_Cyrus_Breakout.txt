Every week's the same  
Stuck in school, so lame  
My parents say that I'm lazy  
Getting up at eight a.m., is crazy  
Tired being told what to do  
So unfair  
So uncool  
  
Day's too long  
And I'm holding on  
Till I hear the bell ring  
'Cause it's the time when, the time when  
  
We're gonna breakout,  
Let the party start,  
We're gonna stay out,  
Gonna break some hearts,  
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,  
Uh-oh! all over again,  
  
We're gonna wake up,  
Everyone we know,  
We're gonna have some fun,  
Gonna lose control,  
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh  
  
Hangin' out is just something we like to do  
With my friends and the mess we get into,  
These are the lessons that we choose  
Not a buck for the things we'll never use  
  
The day's too long  
And I'm holding on  
Till I hear the bell ring  
Cause it's the time when, the time when  
  
We're gonna breakout,  
Let the party start,  
We're gonna stay out,  
Gonna break some hearts,  
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,  
Uh-Oh! all over again,  
  
We're gonna breakout,  
Everyone we know,  
We're gonna have some fun,  
We're gonna lose control,  
It feels so good,to let go  
  
I wish it would never end  
Spendin' time with my friend  
Oh, with my friends  
  
We're gonna breakout,  
Let the party start,  
We're gonna stay out,  
Gonna break some hearts,  
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,  
Uh-oh! all over again,  
  
We're gonna wake up,  
Everyone we know,  
We're gonna have some fun,  
We're gonna lose control,  
It feels so good,to let go  
  
We're gonna breakout,  
Let the party start,  
We're gonna stay out,  
Gonna break some hearts,  
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,  
Uh-oh! all over again,  
  
We're gonna wake up,  
Everyone we know,  
We're gonna have some fun,  
We're gonna lose control,  
It feels so good, to let go
