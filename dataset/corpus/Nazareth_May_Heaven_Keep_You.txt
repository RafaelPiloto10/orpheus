Beautiful, this love was meant to be  
Innocent, you're always there for me  
I pray you'll stay to share this life with me  
May heaven keep you  
  
I fill your days with my dependence  
You fill my nights with your loveliness  
I would give my soul for your protection  
May heaven keep you  
  
When we're alone  
I make you silent promises  
As time goes on  
I hope we feel the same  
All that we hold  
Here safely in our keeping  
What's mine is yours  
I bless the day you came  
  
Silent now, this moment's tenderness  
Breathless now, you leave me sighin'  
I hold you close to stop your cryin'  
May heaven keep you  
  
When we're alone  
I make you silent promises  
As time goes on  
I hope we feel the same  
All that we hold  
Here safely in our keeping  
What's mine is yours  
I bless the day you came  
  
When we're alone  
I make you silent promises  
As time goes on  
I hope we feel the same  
All that we hold  
Here safely in our keeping  
What's mine is yours  
I bless the day you came  
  
When we're alone  
I make you silent promises  
As time goes on  
I hope we feel the same
