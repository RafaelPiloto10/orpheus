Ain't superstitious,  
Black cat crossed my trail.  
I ain't superstitious,  
But a black cat crossed my trail.  
Bad luck ain't got me so far,  
And I won't let it stop me now.  
The dogs begin to bark,  
All over my neighborhood.  
And that ain't all.  
Dogs begin to bark,  
All over my neighborhood.  
  
This is a mean old world to live in,  
And I can't face it all by myself, at all.  
And, dogs begin to bark,  
All over my neighborhood.  
The dogs begin to bark,  
All over my neighborhood.  
I got a feelin' about the future,  
And it ain't too good, I know that.  
I know, I know, I know.  
  
Ain't superstitious,  
But black cat crossed my trail,  
(I said it so many times before)  
Ain't superstitious,  
A black cat crossed my trail.  
Bad luck ain't got me so far,  
And you know I ain't gonna let it stop me now.  
Come on.
