Is it wrong to talk to myself even when there's nobody else  
I'm just checking out that I'm not gone under the water  
Thrown on the beach like a seal ready for slaughter  
  
Can't you understand that the way things were planned  
It never worked out so I just went crazy  
I took to the drink, like something says its "maybe"  
  
I ain't got no excuse and that's really the news  
Got nothing else to say, that it's my way, it's always my way  
I seem to be running away so often  
  
I'll try anything once and that's the way we should be  
But it's always the same getting caught up again in a habit  
A habit I just can't shake off the way it always turned out  
  
Can you understand it's the way I choose to be  
Everything seems so easy this way but I'm going under fast  
Slipping away  
Am I so crazy
