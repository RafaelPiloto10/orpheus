Just like California was not even there  
Since it's gone I'm so withdrawn, I ain't got no one nowhere  
Right beside the ocean, my darlin' Clementine  
Well the water got high and she never got dry and she was a water sign  
Time is on my bad side  
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair  
So I'm goin' all the way tonight  
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair  
So I'm goin' all the way tonight  
Just like California to make a fool of me  
Steal the sideshow, burn the disco, slide into the sea  
I'm a thinking person and I think that it's wrong  
To keep on saying true love's waiting, when true love is long gone  
Time is on my bad side  
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair  
So I'm goin' all the way tonight  
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair  
So I'm goin' all the way tonight  
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair  
So I'm goin' all the way tonight
