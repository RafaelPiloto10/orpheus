You're my shining star  
More and more I think you've gone too far  
I thought I cried the nite you went away  
You're my shining star  
  
You broke my dreams, you broke my heart  
And now you're tearing us apart (somehow)  
Oh oh oh oh baby you're my shining star  
  
Over and over you string around my heart  
So what's your move cause I'm all a-fire  
Hey you! My shining star  
  
You broke my dreams, you broke my heart  
And now you're tearing us apart (somehow)  
Oh oh oh oh baby you're my shining star  
More and more and more you are (rock it)  
  
You broke my dreams, you broke my heart  
And now you're tearing us apart (somehow)  
  
And since that night you went away  
Love me, leave me baby let me know  
Don't build me up just let me go  
Don't cha know that you're messing with my heart?  
Goodnite
