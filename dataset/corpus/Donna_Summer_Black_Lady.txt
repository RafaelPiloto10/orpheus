It was bad, really mean  
She had the kind of reputation to make any woman scream  
Late one night, when it wasn't right  
And he made a catch and he met his match  
Black lady, black lady  
She was mean, really bad  
She was slender as a cat at night, she made the men go mad  
Well her eyes were green and her skin was soft  
And the lady's heart was as hard as rock  
Black lady, oh black lady  
You better beware, better beware  
Better beware, better beware, better beware, better beware  
You better beware, you better beware, ware  
Black lady's out to get you now  
Better beware, better beware, better beware, better beware  
Well he tried to fight it, tried to win  
But no matter where the poor man turned, the lady halted him  
Her wish was his command, his life in her hands  
And the death was slow 'cause she won't let go  
Oh, black lady, that black lady  
She tried to win, tried to buy  
She was all over him 'cause he played all the cards just right  
He laid out his hand like a winning man  
With a smile so deep, she put him into a sleep  
And you know she won  
Oh black lady, black lady  
You better beware, you better beware  
Ware, ware, ware, ware, ware,  
Ware, ware, ware, ware, ware, ware  
Black lady, you better beware  
Black lady, black lady, black lady, lady  
Well she tried to fight it, she just tried to win  
Black lady, you better beware  
Better beware, better beware, better beware, better beware
