Five to nine  
Early Sunday morning around breakfast time  
I heard a sudden tapping at the kitchen door  
Oh and there was more  
Well it was you I saw  
No mistake  
I knew you'd come around that sad look on your face  
Then you begged me to come in and I said yes  
Oh what a fool I am  
I should have turned away  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
To let it all hang out  
To fight my fear and fight my doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
(get ahold) of love  
Spoken words don't mean enough  
No mistake  
Remember not to break the promise that you make  
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now  
And I won't back out  
There'd better be no doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love was on our side  
I love you you know I  
You know I always will love you now  
I know I do love you  
You know I'll always be true to you my love  
Here you stand  
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand  
I wanna love you now  
Oh forget the past  
I wanna make love last  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Let it all hang out  
Love will bring you back again  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that I love will bring you back again
