When I was a little girl  
I had a rag doll  
The only doll I ever owned  
Now I love you just the way  
I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper, love it stays  
And it gets higher until our day  
  
-Chorus:  
And, do I love you my oh my  
Yeah, river deep, mountain high (ya, ya, ya)  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
When you were a young boy  
Did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No I'll never let you down  
  
Cause it goes on and on like a river flows  
It gets bigger baby heaven knows  
It gets sweeter baby as it grows  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
I had a rag doll  
The only doll I ever owned  
Now I love you just the way  
I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper, love it stays  
And it gets higher until our day  
  
Chorus  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
I love you baby like a robin loves to sing  
I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag  
I love you baby river deep, mountain high  
  
Ah river deep  
Ah river deep  
Ah river deep  
Ah river deep  
  
Chorus
