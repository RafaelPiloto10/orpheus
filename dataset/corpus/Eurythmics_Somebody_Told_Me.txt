Somebody told me  
Somebody told me  
Somebody told me  
  
Something about you  
I didn't believe it  
I couldn't believe it  
I'm still reeling  
  
'cause I just can't take the blow  
Well there's laughter and love  
And there's a lot of pain  
I never wanna see your  
  
Pretty face again  
Full of forgiveness  
You're just twisted  
I'm a silly little saint  
With a halo of smiles  
But it makes no difference
