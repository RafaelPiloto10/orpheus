[Chorus]  
Am I blue  
Yes I'm blue  
It started the day I lost you  
Nobody ever loved somebody like I do  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
  
Just this mornin'  
over coffee  
I sat there cryin'  
cause you're gone long gone  
I didn't know just how much  
I was gonna miss you  
till I spent my first night alone  
Am I blue  
Yes I'm blue  
How could I have been such a fool  
Now look at all the misery I'm going through  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
Tried to call and say I'm sorry  
I couldn't get you on the line  
You'll never know just how much  
I'm wishin' you would show up  
and say you've changed your mind  
  
[Chorus]
