Slippin' and a-slidin', playin' Dominoes  
Leftin' and a-rightin' ain't a crime, you know  
Well, I gotta tell the story before it's time to go  
Well, are you ready for the country?  
Are you ready for me?  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ain't that the sight to see?  
Talkin' to a preacher, said God was on his side  
Talkin' to a butcher, they both were sellin' hide  
Well, I gotta tell the story, boys  
I don't know the reason why  
Are you ready for the country?  
Are you ready for me?  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ain't that a sight to see?  
[Incomprehensible]  
Are you ready for the country?  
Are you ready for me?  
Better get ready for the country  
Ready for me  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ready for me?  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ain't that the sight to see?
