Beautiful Life  
You can do what you want just seize the day  
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way  
Don't you ever consider giving up, you will find, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh  
I just want to be here beside you  
And stay until the break of dawn  
Take a walk in the park when you feel down  
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up  
See the nature in bloom a laughing child  
Such a dream, oooh  
It's a beautiful life, oooh...  
I just want to be here beside you  
I just want to be here beside you  
and stay until the break of dawn  
You're looking for somewhere to belong  
You're standing all alone  
for someone to guide you on your way  
Now and forever  
It's a beautiful life, oooh...  
I just want to be anybody  
We're living in different ways  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you to a place I've never been  
before o yeah  
It's a beautiful life  
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away with you tonight  
It's a beautiful life, oooh...
