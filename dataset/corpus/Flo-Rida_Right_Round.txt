[Chorus]  
You spin my head right round, right round  
When you go down, when you go down down  
You spin my head right round, right round  
When you go down, when you go down down  
  
Hey  
Hopped out of that house with my swagger  
Hop in that with dough, I got places to go!  
People to see, time is precious  
Look at my crowd and they out of control  
Just like my mind where I'm going  
No women, no shorties, no nothing but clothes  
No stopping now, my parolees on role  
I like my jewelry, that's always on gold  
I know the storm is coming  
My pockets keep telling me it's gonna shower  
Call up my homies that's home  
Then pop in the night cause it's meant to be ours  
We keep a fade away shot cause we balling  
It's platinum patron that be ours  
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers  
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found  
It's going down down.  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found  
It's going down down  
  
Hey  
Shawty must know I'm the man  
My money love her like a number one fan  
Don't look at my mouth, let her talk to my fans  
My Benjamin Franklins  
A couple of grands, I got rubber bands  
My paper planes making a dance  
Get dirty all night, that's part of my thing  
Re-building castles that's made out of sand  
She's amazing, the fire blazing  
Hotter than Cajun!  
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?  
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage  
That body belong on a poster  
I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me  
Like damn it I know you  
You wanna show like a gun out of holster  
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found  
It's going down down  
From the top of the pole I watch her go down  
She got me throwing my money around  
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found  
It's going down down  
  
I'm spending my money  
I'm out of control  
Somebody help me  
She's taking my bank roll.  
But I'm king of the club  
And I'm wearing the crown  
Popping these bottles  
Touching these models  
Watching they asses go down down  
  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
When you go down, when you go down down
