I don't know what you want, I don't hear what you said.  
Truth behind the lies.  
'Cause I can't see what's in your head.  
And spread your wings and fly, out in a brave new world.  
Let this be my prayer, to keep you safe when I'm not there.  
  
Can we love and live apart?  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
How can we divide the heart?  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith).  
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word.  
Embrace.  
  
Through the mists of time, lovers can be friends.  
The power of the human heart.  
The secrets in the souls of men.  
All my blessings in disguise.  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
Reunited we will rise.  
I don't know, no, I don't know.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
And in the cold night, under the street light,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives, I have faith in you, away from you (I have faith).  
Like a lonely child, I will hang on every word.  
  
And when the night falls, and when the sky falls,  
I long for your embrace.  
Another daybreak, another heartache,  
I long for your embrace.  
  
Living separate lives,  
Away from you.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely life.  
Lonely days and nights (away from you).  
We can live our life  
(embrace, embrace)  
With our separate lives.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Lonely days and nights.  
I will never send away.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Embrace the child inside  
The lonely, lonely lives.
