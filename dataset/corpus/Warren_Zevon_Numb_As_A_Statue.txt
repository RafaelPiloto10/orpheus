I'm numb as a statue  
I may have to beg, borrow or steal  
Some feelings from you  
So I can have some feelings too  
  
I'm pale as a ghost  
You know what I love about you  
That's what I need the most  
I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal  
Some feelings from you  
I'm gonna beg, borrow or steal  
So I can have some feelings too  
  
I don't care if it's superficial  
You don't have to dig down deep  
Just bring enough for the ritual  
Get here before I fall asleep  
  
Ain't nothing special  
When the present meets the past  
I've always taken care of business  
I've paid my first and last
