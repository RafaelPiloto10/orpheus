I walked through the city limits  
Attracted by some force within it  
Around a corner where some profit lay  
A wire fence where the children play  
And I was looking for a friend of mine  
Yeah, looking for a friend of mine  
  
Down the dark streets  
The houses looked the same  
I walked round and round  
They nailed me to a train  
  
Had to get away  
Trying to find a way  
Had to get away  
Trying to find a way to get out  
  
Car screeched - hear the sound of dust  
Metallic blue turned red with rust  
Stood apart all forgotten youth  
Turned on to a knife-edged view  
  
And I was looking for a friend of mine  
Yeah, looking for a friend of mine  
  
Saw twelve windows - ten in a row  
The lights shine like a neon show  
No place to stop - no place to go  
I guess they died some time ago  
And I was looking for some friends of mine  
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine
