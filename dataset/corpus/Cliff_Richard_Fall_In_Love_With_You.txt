[Chorus]  
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with you  
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with you  
  
Falling in love again, falling in love again  
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you  
Why must you lead your heart and keep we two apart  
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you  
  
Don't tell me, I know  
Its late, our date  
Is almost over, its time to go  
  
Please, give me one more chance, this is my first romance  
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you  
  
(Fall, Fall, Fall)  
Don't tell me, I know  
Its late, our date  
Is almost over, its time to go  
  
Please, give me one more chance, this is my first romance  
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you  
  
[Chorus]
