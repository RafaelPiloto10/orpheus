And I'm talking with my eyes  
and I walk in different styles

Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman  
  
Kneel down Inhale my odor  
Come kiss my hand angel  
dare to explode my higher ground  
stike ti desearve me  
Ma chrie  
  
And my winds surpass perfum  
I'm a charismatic and fool boom  
I'm a genuine man  
  
Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman  
Yes I am, I am a perfect gentleman
