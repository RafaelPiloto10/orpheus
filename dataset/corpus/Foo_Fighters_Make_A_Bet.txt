I'm hangin around, I not puttin down the state I'm in  
I've never been proud, And now I'm allowed to she'd my skin  
  
I'm driving away, I know if I stay I'll sit and spin.  
Imagine the day, I'm drowing that they can reel me in  
Pick up where I left off  
  
Lets make a bet  
We'll make a bargain and call this truce  
Let's make a bet  
I'm in loss and win or lose with you  
  
I see it all now, I'm taking my bow in every sense  
I'm scratchin around, it's getting too loud the space I'm in  
  
So now I can leave, Too decent of me so evident  
The one that relieves, The other's disease like medicine  
Pick up where I left off  
  
Lets make a bet  
We'll make a bargain and call this truce  
Let's make a bet  
I'm in loss and win or lose with you  
  
Speakin in tounges I can't get through  
Think of runnin but  
I'm tired of runnin into you  
Speakin in tounges the way I do  
Found that you understand quite well  
Cause that's your language too  
  
I'm hangin around, I'm not puttin down the state I'm in  
In love with the sound, it's gettin too loud  
  
Lets make a bet  
We'll make a bargain and call this truce  
Let's make a bet  
I'm in loss and win or lose with you  
  
Lets make a bet  
I never wanted to call this truce  
Lets make a bet  
Always lost and win or lose with you
