I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids  
But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid  
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me the bread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge  
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge  
And then she comes down the thruway, ready to sew me up with a thread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much  
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch  
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead  
I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head  
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed
