I'm on the old dirt road  
Without a care  
Gotta sixpence in my pocket  
Oh I'm a millionaire  
  
Oh and I would do anything to go back there  
On the old dirt road  
Oh my brother and me  
We make a mess all weekend  
  
'Til Sunday eve  
Oh and I am traveling through the past  
Oh and I can see myself  
Face to face in the looking glass  
  
Playing in the dust  
I haven't got a care  
And nobody makes a fuss  
'Cause there's no one there  
  
On the old dirt road  
I got no name  
Build a castle wall  
And knock it down again  
  
Oh and I am a child again  
Oh and I have no need to pretend  
Oh I hear you cry  
Go back to sleep  
  
But I can't make it stop  
'Cause it's not a dream  
Playing in the dust  
I haven't no cares  
  
And nobody makes a fuss  
''cause there's no one there  
I'm a millionaire  
  
Down the old dirt road  
I'm a millionaire  
Gotta sixpence in my pocket  
I haven't got a care  
  
On the old dirt road  
I ain't got no name  
I build a castle wall  
And knock it down again  
  
Oh and I would do anything to go back there again  
Oh and I  
I'm a child again
