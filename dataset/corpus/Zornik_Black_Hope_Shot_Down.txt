Get get get get your widowmaker  
And put your children back inside.  
Yet yet yet yet another failure  
In this life of the free.  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
There's a hole in his head.  
Back back back back off for I break you  
And that's how everything goes down.  
Run run run run away don't stay here  
Or they'll say it's your time.  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
There's a hole in his head.  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand.  
Shot down  
  
Black hope shot down  
There's a gun in his hand  
That souls divine  
There's a hole in his head.
