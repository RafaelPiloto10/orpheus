I had no reason to believe that love was true  
Infatuation was a game for lonely fools  
I wanted freedom but I guess I always knew  
You love would entangle my emotions  
I feel the power when I hold you close  
Got to feel you near me, baby  
You take me higher than I thought I could go  
Can't hide it any longer, I need you to know  
Now I'm touched by your magic  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldn't hide from the feelings here inside  
'cause I've waited so long  
This is some kind of magic  
I know that to lose your love would be  
More than I could bear  
I would follow you anywhere  
I can't imagine I could change the way I feel  
When I paint a picture of love it's you I'm thinking of  
No hesitation, when you call me I'll be there  
You know, we've got something to believe in  
I never knew it was so easy to love  
But I just can't help it, baby  
This love is moving and it's out of control  
Can't try it any harder, I need you to know  
Now I'm touched by your magic  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldn't hide from the feelings here inside  
'cause I've waited so long  
This is some kind of magic  
I know that to lose your love would be  
More than I could bear  
I would follow you anywhere  
Even when the clouds drift across the sky  
I know that you'll make it somehow  
Together we'll share our dreams  
I know we'll survive if we only believe in love  
This love is moving and it's out of control  
Can't try any harder, I need you to know  
Now I'm touched by your magic  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldn't hide from the feelings here inside  
'cause I've waited so long  
This is some kind of magic  
I know that to lose your love would be  
More than I could bear  
I would follow you anywhere  
At last I can breathe in all of your love  
I couldn't hide from the feelings here inside
