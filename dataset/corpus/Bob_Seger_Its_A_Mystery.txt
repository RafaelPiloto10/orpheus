It's a Mystery  
How the heart beats  
How the sun shines  
How our eyes meet  
  
It's a Mystery  
Lt's a wonder  
How we keep from  
Sinking under  
  
It's A Mystery  
  
All the nonsense  
Set before us  
Supposed to shock us  
But it bores us  
  
All the ennui  
All the replays  
All the rewrites  
All the "can't says"  
  
It's A Mystery  
  
Electron guns fire images  
They end in interstellar space  
Within the year  
  
And through it all  
We dance and starve and  
Burn and clear  
  
It's A Mystery  
How they con us  
How they sneak til  
They're upon us  
  
All the anchors  
With their helmets  
Getting ratings  
With their zealots  
  
All the pundits  
All the salesmen  
Setting snake oil  
To the nation  
  
All the specials  
Every rerun  
All the penguins  
Getting well-done  
  
It's A Mystery  
  
It's A Mystery  
How the heart beats  
How the sun shines  
How our eyes meet  
  
It's A Mystery  
It's a wonder  
How we ever  
Find each other  
  
It's A Mystery
