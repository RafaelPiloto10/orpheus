I could be king of kings, wear a crown and all the things  
I'd want I'd never need.  
I'd be an ace in an aeroplane and every year I'd fly to Spain.  
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, tell me how to say goodbye.  
I see her face in myself.  
Why, tell me why I made her cry  
If only had my mind on something else.  
  
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen.  
A hero with a medal for everyday.  
I find me fame,reach the top.  
I keep on pushing never stop.  
If I could just forget her name.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If only had my mind on something else.
