Last night you gave me a kiss  
You didn't know it, but I was awake when you did  
You were quiet, you were gonna let me sleep  
So I just laid there pretending to be  
  
You said some things you didn't  
Know I could hear  
And the words "I love you" never  
Sounded so sincere  
  
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving  
Now that I know just how much you care  
You finally gave me one good reason not to go  
But staying here is my worst fear  
  
This morning I rolled out of bed  
Recalling all the sweet things you said  
This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad  
Called out your name, but you  
Didn't answer back  
I searched the house to find out what was wrong  
Like a ton of bricks, it hit me you were gone  
  
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving  
Now that I know just how much you care  
You finally gave me one good reason not to go  
But staying here is my worst fear  
  
All along I knew that there was  
Something missing  
And only one thing left to do  
I had to leave behind this life that  
We'd been living  
But the only thing that left was you  
  
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving  
Now that I know just how much you care  
You finally gave me one good reason not to go  
But being alone is my worst fear  
And staying here is my worst fear
