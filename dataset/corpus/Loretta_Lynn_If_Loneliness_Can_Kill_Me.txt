I walk the floor here in my lonely room  
The silence nearly kills me and I guess that it will soon  
He left because of things I've done and said  
And if loneliness can kill me then I'm just as good as dead  
If loneliness can kill me then I might as well lay down  
A girl who could die anytime shouldn't be a walkin' round  
I'd better find a place to lay my head  
For if loneliness can kill me then I'm just as good as dead  
[ piano ]  
If loneliness can kill me...
