At night they would go walking 'till the breaking of the day  
The morning is for sleeping  
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in their own way  
Save the nighttime for your weeping  
Your weeping  
  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
And the night over London lay  
  
So we rode down to the river, where the toiling ghosts spring  
For their curses to be broken  
We'd go underneath the arches, where the witches are in the saying  
There are ghost towns in the ocean  
The ocean  
  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
And the night over London lay  
  
God is in the houses and God is in my head  
And all the cemeteries in London  
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said  
For my heart it wasn't open  
Not open  
  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
And the night over London lay  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
There's no light over London today.
