Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her lovin' arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I bin out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I bin stood up I bin shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Well I bin up tight most every night  
Walkin' along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail  
Won't carry me home to the one I love
