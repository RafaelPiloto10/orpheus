I've got a ticket, no turning back  
My destination,  
The sea of trouble, the land of pain  
You're sending me where it always rains  
Oh reconsider, I'm begging you, some hesitation  
I'm holding on to my sanity  
I feel the beginning of emergency  
My hands are slipping, oh please don't let me fall into  
  
[Chorus]  
This hole in my heart that goes all the way to china  
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of,  
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China  
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down  
  
I'm on a planet without a plan  
It's oh so lonely  
I need to see you to get out of here  
There's something deadly in this atmosphere  
I'm in a desert, without a drink of your sweet water  
You're my oasis in the burning sand  
I'm out of danger when you touch my hand  
Throw me a lifeline, I'm standing on the edge of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The gun was loaded, I didn't know  
I pulled the trigger,  
I heard a noise then the room went dark  
I felt the bullet going in my heart  
I feel so dizzy, oh please don't let me fall, don't leave me in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got a hole in my heart  
You've got to fill it up with love
