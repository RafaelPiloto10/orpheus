I made the Spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday  
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar  
The spikey leather guys were foolin with the denim dudes  
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, Fire Island  
  
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes  
  
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'  
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled "Give me a bourbon"  
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting  
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action  
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact  
Then there he was, saw me and knew that  
  
I'd had too much, foolin' around  
Statues alive, seconds are hours  
  
Sex is like a hurricane it grabs and then it shatters  
I was barely holding on to this fine body symphony  
I guess I dream in pictures, not colors  
The true free expression I demand is human rights - right?  
  
I came the light, I am immortal  
  
I'm going, no loss  
I'm going, no loss  
I'm going, no loss  
I'm going, no loss  
  
Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming, raw  
Deal
