Beautiful doom  
Bang! Pow! Boom!  
Beautiful doom  
Bang! Pow! Boom!  
Beautiful doom  
Wonderful doom  
Beautiful doom  
  
Everybody dies, gargoyle skies  
Main attraction is your own treachery and lies  
Carnival arise, facing your demise  
Cuz the acid rain came with a Boom! Pow! Bang!  
And the purpose of the circus is definitely clear  
Get you in the mirror cuz soon you'll be here  
Sweat with the boom, don't forget to assume  
Time catches up with some beautiful doom  
  
Beautiful doom  
Bang! Pow! Boom!  
Beautiful doom  
Bang! Pow! Boom!  
Beautiful doom  
Wonderful doom  
Beautiful doom  
  
Time catches all of us  
Surpassing everything  
Time catches all of us  
Surpassing everything  
Time catches all of us  
Surpassing everything  
Time catches all of us  
Surpassing everything  
Time catches all of us  
Surpassing everything  
Time catches all of us  
Surpassing everything  
  
Tents pop up cuz the show's in town  
And everybody knows what goes around  
You're a three ring act, let's hope it suits ya  
Your past and your present will determine ya future  
No White Witch can save ya, no potion  
And six times deeper than the Indian Ocean  
Life goes by with a Bang! Pow! Boom!  
And then look out! Here come the beautiful doom  
  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter  
Tear your ticket, then you enter

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado  
The throat chokers, cut-throat jokers  
Juggalotus and you know this  
Most hated band on the planet  
So fresh they can't stand it  
Dark Carnival minions  
The Duke of the Wicked  
And the Southwest-side Stranglord himself  
Big Violent J, and Sugar Shaggy2dope  
Wicked-wicky-wocked-wicky-wicked Clowns, bitch!  
Boom!  
A beautiful doom  
Boom!  
A beautiful doom  
Boom!  
A beautiful doom  
Boom!
