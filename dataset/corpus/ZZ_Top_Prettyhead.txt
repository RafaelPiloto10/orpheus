Don't send me no bag, don't send me no skag  
A pin-headed ho won't do  
Don't send me no square without some beehive hair  
She got to have her rhythm with blues  
  
Gotta have a prettyhead, gotta have a prettyhead  
Gotta have a prettyhead, I said pretty head  
  
Don't send nothin' lame, don't send nothin' tame  
A scatter-brained ho won't do  
Don't send me no skang, don't send me nothin' rang  
I want it hot, righteous and blue  
  
Gotta have a prettyhead, gotta have a prettyhead  
Gotta have a prettyhead, I said pretty head  
  
Play the guitar  
Drop-dead, big red, icy head, pretty pretty head  
Don't send me no twig, don't send nothin' big  
With a sideways thing-a-majig  
Don't send me no pro, don't send nothin' low  
Down and out, holdin' out ho  
  
Gotta have a prettyhead, gotta have a prettyhead  
Gotta have a prettyhead, said pretty, prettyhead
