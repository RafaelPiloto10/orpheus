Livin' way up now in a penthouse high  
Our steaks are rare and our martini's dry  
Folks below they say it ain't fair  
Hell with them, I really don't care  
Joie de vivre, mon amie  
Ain't this the life  
Having a party on a big jet plane  
I got so drunk that I could feel no pain  
Hangin' out in acapulco,  
Drinkin' rum and sniffin' co-co  
Pretty senorita look this way  
Dancing through the night  
Everything's alright  
Girlfriend and a wife  
Ain't this the life, ain't this the life  
Ain't this the life, baby, baby, baby . . .  
Tropical island in the deep blue sea  
The natives are friendly and the lobster's free  
Sipping cognac like a french king  
Plenty of room, I own the whole thing  
Joie de vivre, mon amie  
Ain't this the life  
Think I'll go out now on a shopping spree  
Breakfast in new york, dinner in parie  
Hangin' out with lynn and suzie  
Have a massage and a ja'causezi  
Climb into bed and see what's on tv  
Dancing through the night  
Everything's alright  
Girlfriend and a wife . . .  
Ain't this the life, ain't this the life  
Ain't this the life, tell me, tell me, tell me . . .
