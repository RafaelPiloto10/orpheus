It's been a month or two since I was sleepin' with you  
I'm comin' home again  
I've been to east and west, but baby I like best  
The road that leads to you  
Oh girl, it seems the whole wide world seems to say  
Hotels that all look the same  
Just seem to drive me insane  
But I can't get away  
Until I receive a call that tells me that will be all  
And then I hop a plane  
It's true, I'm not sure if you knew  
I'm comin' home to you  
Oh girl, it seems the whole wide world seems to say  
Hotels that all look the same  
Just seem to drive me insane  
But I can't get away  
Until I receive a call that tells me that will be all  
And then I hop a plane  
It's true, I'm not sure if you knew  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home, baby
