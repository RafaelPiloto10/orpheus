These days it's hard to make love last, so hard to do, it  
Seems these days it comes and goes so fast,  
So easy to lose it  
  
Promise me now, promise with you I'll find,  
One love to stand the test of time...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
  
We've got to make a solemn vow, keep it forever,  
Know whatever happens that somehow, we'll keep it together  
  
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand, and say that you...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
  
That you're gonna stand beside me  
Always be there,  
If you really care,  
Just stand here beside me and swear  
  
(Swear)  
(Swear)  
  
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand, and say that you...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart
