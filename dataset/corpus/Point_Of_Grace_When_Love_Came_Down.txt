Close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believed  
The child was born, the star shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
And love came down at Christmas time  
Christmas Eve, 2 a.m.  
Heavy snow is falling down  
And the streets clothed in white  
Echo songs that were sung by candlelight  
We're alive, we can breathe  
But do we really care for this world in need?  
There's a choice we must make each and every day  
So close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believe  
The child was born, the stars shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
And love came down at Christmas time  
Ahh, oh yeah yeah  
Ahh, oh yeah yeah  
So Merry Christmas everyone and peace throughout the year  
The time has come to celebrate, so let your voices fill, the air  
Everyone, watch and pray that the sun will shine on a brighter day  
Join your hands, lift them high for this gift of life  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
So close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believe  
The child was born, the stars shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
Close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believe  
The child was born, the stars shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
And love came down at Christmas time
