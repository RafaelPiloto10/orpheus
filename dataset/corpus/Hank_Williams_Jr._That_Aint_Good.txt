A different boss at work  
That might do me well  
'Cause I'm kinda mad at someone  
Who thinks that they can tell me what to say and do  
Everybody's got a butt and a point of view  
  
Well I used to like to go fishin'  
Watch that hook and line  
But I sold my boat and motor  
And everybody wondered why  
  
That ain't good  
No, that ain't good ('cause that ain't me)  
  
My wife went to a lawyer  
I never dreamed she would  
Now my address is rock bottom  
And they know me in this neighborhood  
  
That ain't good  
No no, that ain't good (I need to get out of here)  
  
Watchin' these nuts on TV  
Blowin' themselves to hell  
So they can all get to heaven  
And my kids want me to tell  
Tell 'em why  
Did all those people have to die  
  
No, that ain't good  
'Cause I don't know why  
  
Went to church Sunday morning  
Never thought I could  
Prayed to the man to help me  
Get back to being myself like I should  
  
It done me good  
Yeah it done me good  
You gotta look for the good in this world
