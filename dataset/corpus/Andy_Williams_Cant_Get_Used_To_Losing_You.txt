Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round  
Guess I'll get dressed and do the town  
I'll find some crowded avenue  
Though it will be empty without you  
  
Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thorough-loving you  
  
Called up some girl I used to know  
After I heard her say "Hello"  
Couldn't think of anything to say  
Since you're gone it happens every day  
  
Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life through-loving you  
  
I'll find somebody, wait and see  
Who am I kiddin', only me  
Cause no one else could take your place  
Guess that I am just a hopeless case  
  
Can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thorough-loving you  
  
I can't get used to losin' you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thorough-loving you
