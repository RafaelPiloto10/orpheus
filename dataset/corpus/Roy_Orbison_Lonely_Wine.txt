The night is bright and gay but I'm so blue  
My heart must have it's way and dream of you  
That's why I sigh and sip my lonely wine  
  
Your picture on the wall your smiling face  
Brings back the memory of your embrace  
I start to cry into my lonely wine  
  
Teardrops fall but all they bring is heartache  
It's better if I never think at all  
Still they soothe the pain my lonely thoughts make  
I never quite succeed in hiding all, so let them fall  
  
Where ever you may be, I'll still be true  
And when the clouds roll by I'll come to you  
But until then I'll drink my lonely wine
