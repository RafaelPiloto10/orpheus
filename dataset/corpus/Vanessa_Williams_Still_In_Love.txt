You look so sorry, please tell me what's wrong  
Just what are you thinking you look so forlorn  
Maybe you're thinking that I have been untrue  
So let me assure you and tell you the truth  
I'm not one to fool around  
The mistake that I made was not meant to hurt you  
I needed somehow to try and find out  
How I really felt inside  
And I know I'm  
  
Still in Love I'm so  
Still in Love  
I'm gonna be all you want me to be, cause I am  
Still in Love ooh  
Still in Love yeah  
I'm gonna do all you want me to do  
  
Don't ask no questions won't tell you lies  
It's something that happened in which I can't disguise  
I needed somebody to take me away  
From feelings of doubt which in my mind delay  
But you've always been the one  
And there are days when I know I should have told you  
  
So please don't cry  
'cause I'm gonna try  
To make you believe in me  
And I know I'm  
  
Still in Love I'm so  
Still in Love  
I'm gonna be all you want me to do  
  
You must be the one for me  
'cause as hard as I try  
I just can't you go  
So that you know baby  
Please, please don't go  
'cause you are just all that I need  
And I know I'm...  
  
Still in Love I'm so,  
Still in Love  
I'm gonna be all you want me to be, cause I am  
Still in Love ooh  
Still in Love yeah  
I'm gonna do all you want me to do
