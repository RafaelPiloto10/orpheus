House Of Horrors  
"Hey there, do you like excitement?" (yeah)  
"Do you like suspense?" (uh huh)  
"Do you like Nel Carter?" (no)  
"Good 'cause you won't find her here, this is the house of horrors  
And for you it's absolutely free, step right in" (thanks)  
"Say no more stupid ass, your face says enough"  
[Violent J]  
Woboogawoo WAAA!! Welcome to the House of Horrors  
Were you born in a barn, shut the fuckin door  
You see, damn, 'cause I'm about to scare you  
Blubablubabluba, okay now I dare you  
Close your eyes, open up your mouth, and count to ten  
Don't want to, huh, 'cause you know my nuts are going in  
I'm twisted, I'll cut your finger off, and stick in your butt  
Awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and glue it shut  
This is when I get crazy, lemme show you something  
Brrrr! You know what that means, it don't mean nothin, haha  
But it scared you 'cause people don't be doing that shit  
But me brrr! bitch brrr! I'm all about it (brrrr!!!)  
Guess what I'm a serial killer, it's a bad habit  
I killed Tony, Lucky Charms, the silly rabbit, UH!  
Cut the lights, see that shit, I'm glowing  
Alright, I'm done, turn em back, wait, where you going?  
Welcome to the house of horrors  
[Chorus (1x)]  
Comes from within me  
Comes from within me, horrors, eh  
"Honey, I'm not having a good time"  
"I know. Come on, this must be the way out."  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Hey, what the fuck, come here guys, grab a chair  
Don't mind me drinkin' my beer in my underwear  
Come on, let's play some cardback, I just gotta story  
"Hey keep it down in there Shaggs, what the hell?" sorry  
Look at that shit, "what?", you almost got me grounded  
I'm a have to take your forehead and pound it  
I'll bend you over and tie you up to a pole  
And stretch your nuts back and fling em up your butthole  
I'm a phantom, listen to me, ahhhhh  
That didn't do it? How about this? AHHHH!!!!  
I'm so scary, they call me Joey Terrifying  
Did you know that?, "yeah", no you didn't I was lying  
"I represent Igors  
I'm yelling in town  
I'm coming out of southwest  
WICKED CLOWNS!!!"  
[Violent J]  
Bathroom? yeah, it's right there down the hall  
Don't flush it though, I'll make dinner for you all  
(mumbles) I'm possessed too  
Wait a minute, eh, don't leave me yet, hey!  
Welcome to the House of Horrors  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"Honey?"  
"What?"  
"I'm scared"  
"I know, sweety, come on"  
[Violent J]  
Jump Steady, Nate the Mack, lemme tell you something  
With Billy Bill and Rude Boy, what about em, nothing  
They're my boys, I just had to give em props  
And together we form the cyclops  
Hahahahaha look at you, haha, you're a bitch  
Should I let your ass go? hahahaha, no  
I'll let your bitch out, but you get the bone  
Run along sugar tits, he ain't coming home  
"Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you, bitch"
