[Puffy] (Mario)  
I've seen a lot of things in my life  
Alot of ups and downs  
Made a lot of mistakes  
No matter what, you've always been by my side  
You've always been my best friend  
You're the love of my life (Oh)  
You're everything to me (Oh)  
You never left my side (You're my best friend)  
I love you so much (Yes, you are)  
You're my best friend  
  
[Puffy]  
Since the beginning of time  
All you did was bless men  
Too young to understand but now you my best friend  
How could they doubt you, never think about you  
Don't they know nothing's possible without you  
  
Faith without fear that's how they raised me  
Words of man kill but never phase me  
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me  
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?  
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living  
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in  
Gotta be more than just to lust women  
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen  
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due  
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew  
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through  
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord  
  
1 - [Mario Winans]  
Lord, you mean the world to me  
Before I was born you chose me  
You always hear me when I'm calling  
Even catch me when I'm falling  
You're the closest one to me  
I surrender all to thee  
I want the whole wide world to see  
That we've always been and we'll always be  
Best friends  
  
[Puffy]  
Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far  
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star  
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight  
Then give it to you and let it shine bright  
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth  
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit  
Can't you see that He spread love for you  
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you  
Willies with mac millies know how you get down  
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town  
Just remember when you pray, God is love  
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs  
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him  
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him  
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him  
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Puffy]  
Been two and a half years since my man Big passed  
Been two and a half years since my world crashed  
I needed help, God gave me the power  
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour  
Looked me in the eyes and ask "What you doing unhappy?"  
"Don't you know why I'm here?" and started shooting at me  
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out  
Never wavered once, gave me no way out  
Your time to die, don't even stress the date  
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take  
I told him "I'm too much blessed with faith"  
"And living for Christ" and then he said "Manifest the great"  
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering  
Ground started to shake, everything trembling  
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands  
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on  
  
Repeat 1 While:  
  
[Puffy]  
You mean everything to me  
You've been with me from day one  
Even when I thought nobody was there  
You were there  
You're my best friend  
I love you like no other  
There is no feeling like this in the world  
If you can relate to what I'm feeling  
Put your hands in the air for me  
Let me see you  
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me  
Clap your hands, come on  
Thank you Jesus  
You always hear me when I'm calling  
Always catch me when I fall, yeah  
I surrender all to thee  
I want the whole world to see  
That you've always been, you'll always be  
My best friend  
I love you Jesus  
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses  
As I forgive those who trespass against me  
Thank you
