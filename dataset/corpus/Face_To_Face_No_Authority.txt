there is someone who knows everything there is to know  
there is someone who is too afraid to let it show  
we live by consequences  
we never seem to get it right  
conflict of circumstances  
and sometimes we may lose a fight  
  
wouldn't you know  
something is going wrong  
wouldn't you know  
something is really wrong  
and you can't do a thing about it  
  
no, no, no you have no authority  
no, no, no I am who I want to be  
  
there are those of us who just sit back and never try  
there are those of us who just sit back and wonder why  
we live by consequences  
we never seem to get it right  
conflict of circumstances  
and sometimes we may lose a fight  
  
wouldn't you know  
something is going wrong  
wouldn't you know  
something is really wrong  
and you can't do a thing about it  
  
no, no, no you have no authority  
no, no, no I am who I want to be
