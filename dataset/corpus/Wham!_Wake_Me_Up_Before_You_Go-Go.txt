You put the boom boom into my heart,  
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts.  
Jitterbug into my brain,  
Goes bang bang bang till my feet do the same.  
  
But something's bugging me  
Something ain't right  
My best friend told me  
Where you were last night.  
  
Left me sleeping  
In my bed.  
I was dreaming  
But I should've been with you instead.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up before you go go,  
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo.  
Wake me up before you go go,  
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high  
Wake me up before you go go,  
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo.  
Wake me up before you go go,  
Take me dancing tonight.  
I want to hit that high  
  
You get the gray skies outta my way,  
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.  
Turn a mere spark into a flame,  
My beats per minute never been the same.  
  
'Cause you're my lady,  
I'm your fool.  
Makes me crazy  
When you act so cruel.  
  
C'mon baby,  
Let's not fight.  
We'll go dancing  
And everything will be alright.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuddle up baby,  
Move in tight.  
We'll go dancing tomorrow night.  
  
It's cold out there  
But it's warm in bed.  
They can dance,  
We'll stay home instead.
