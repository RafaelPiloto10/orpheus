Some fellows look at the eyes  
Some fellows look at the nose  
Some fellows look at the size  
Some fellows look at the clothes  
I don't care if her eyes are red  
I don't care if her nose is long  
I don't care if she's underfeed  
I don't care if her clothes are wrong  
First I look at the purse  
Some fellows like the smiles they wear  
Some fellows like the legs that talk  
Some fellows like the style of their hair  
They want the waist line to be small  
I don't care if their legs all vein  
I don't care if their teeth are big  
I don't care if she wears a ring  
Why waste time looking at the waist line  
'Cause first I look at the purse...yeah!  
A woman can be as fine as can be  
Kisses sweeter than honey  
That don't mean a thing to me  
If you ain't got no money, baby  
'Cause if the purse is fat, that's where it's at yeahaa...  
Some fellows like the way they walk  
The way they swing and sway  
Some fellows like the way they talk  
If they can talk talk all day  
I don't care if she waddles like a duck or talks with a lisp  
I still think I'm in good luck if the dollar bills are crisp  
'Cause first I look at the purse...yeah yeah  
Keep an eye on the money  
Woman's got to have some fine greenbacks hah  
I ain't greedy guys  
Oh I don't want to work no more
