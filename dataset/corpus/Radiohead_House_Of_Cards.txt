I don't want to be your friend  
I just want to be your lover  
No matter how it ends  
No matter how it starts  
  
[Chorus]  
Forget about your house of cards  
And I'll do mine  
Forget about your house of cards  
And I'll do mine  
  
Fall off the table,  
Get swept under  
Denial, denial  
  
The infrastructure will collapse  
Voltage spikes  
Throw your keys in the bowl  
Kiss your husband goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fall off the table,  
And get swept under  
  
Denial, denial  
Denial, denial  
Your ears should be burning  
Denial, denial  
Your ears should be burning  
Denial, denial
