What a pathetic stray of words  
Just leave them laying on the floor  
The one posted on the door  
Not over here, not anymore  
  
There I was a place I could have been  
Step over where it used to be  
Since you have let yourself  
Come in  
Some things I'd rather you not see  
  
See I keep lying to myself  
Don't know what else there is to do  
If I can be somebody else  
Well I think I would for you  
  
Didn't it seem like something more  
So long I can't remember when  
All this has happened all before  
And this will happened all again  
And I only have myself to blame  
And I only have myself to blame  
  
See I keep lying to myself  
Don't know what else there is to do  
If I can be somebody else  
Well I think I would for you  
See I keep lying to myself  
Don't know what else there is to do  
If I can be somebody else  
Well I think I would for you
