There is a flower within my heart  
Daisy, Daisy  
Planted one day by a glancing Dad  
Planted by daisy bell  
Whether she loves me or loves me not  
Sometimes it's hard to tell  
Yet I am longing to share the lot  
A beautiful daisy bell  
  
Chorus:  
Daisy, Daisy give me your heart to do  
I'm half crazy, hopeful in love with you  
It won't be a stylish marraige  
I can't afford the carriage  
But you look sweet upon the street  
On a bicycle built for two  
  
We will go tandem as man and wife  
Daisy, Daisy  
Peddling our way down the road of life  
I and my daisy bell  
When the roads and we both dispise  
Please men the lambs as well  
There are bright lights in those dasling ice  
A beautiful daisy bell  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I'll stand by you in wear or well Daisy, Daisy  
You'll be the bell we'll try to rip you know  
Sweet little daisy bell, You'll take the lead in each trip we take  
And if I dropped out, I will say here's the drink by beautiful daisy bell  
  
Repeat chorus (x2)  
  
But you look sweet upon the street  
On a bicycle built for two  
On a bicycle built for two  
On a bicycle built for two  
For two, For two, For two, For two
