At the temple of black gods I failed again  
For you - a chilvarous end for a man  
Clandestine enthralling haze  
A docile sacrifice for your grace  
resurrect from the ban they put on you  
Fall again - you will - what they foreknew  
Only gods illuminate  
And just a slave to be is my fate  
and you will hear me  
Siren's calls of temptation  
Teasing you  
No limit will be  
No taboo of imagination  
I'll fill your void  
I will always savour you  
As I will always be your fool
