This here ain't no love song  
And it ain't for you  
It's for the folks that relate to  
What I've been going through  
  
It's for the 40 hour overtime  
Workin' man  
And too the good women out there  
I know you'll understand  
  
Why don't you run off to L.A.  
And lose your mind  
And get some energy docter to tell  
You everything is fine  
  
We can still be friends like you talk about  
But first give me back them pearls  
And the keys to my fuckin house  
Get out  
  
They say all wee need is just a little patience  
But what do you do when your woman  
Is too high maintenance yea  
I'm hatin to admit it  
Even if its your wife  
Tell her pack your shit  
And take the first train out of my life  
  
It's a classic line baby  
I just want to be friends  
But baby my friends don't haver the keys to my mercedes benz, no  
I think I know what you mean  
  
You want to talk and such  
Tell me all your problems  
But we don't fuck  
Ain't that right  
  
I had plenty of friends before I met you  
I don't need no more  
So now I thinks its time you started headin out for that doorand even tho I
feel real bad tonight  
Please pack your shit  
And take the first train out of my life  
  
They say all we need is juat a little patience  
Yea  
But what do you do when your woman is too high maintenance  
I know  
I'm hatin to admit it even if its your wife  
Tell her to pack your bags  
And take the first train out of my life  
  
Why don't you run off to L.A.  
And lose your mind  
You've got 15 minutes and  
I think your wasting time yea  
  
It's easy to see when you've lost your mind  
But here ill be when you decide to come back blind  
You were a midwest girl who says  
She liked to drink beer and hang  
  
And now your walkin red carpets talkin new york hip hop slang  
And even though I might break down  
And cry tonight  
Please pack your shit  
And take the first train out of my life oh yea yea  
  
Why don't you run off to L.A.
