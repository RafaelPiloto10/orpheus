Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,  
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you  
Falling  
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,  
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all  
Tonight  
  
When the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand  
That holds the knife,  
And the knife that cuts the cable, kills the spark that  
Feeds the life.  
  
[Chorus]  
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we  
Were able,  
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that  
Rocks the cradle.  
  
The oath you take is sacred, to save not steel a life,  
Like the passing of the sweetest soul, that looked  
Through human eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,  
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you  
Falling.  
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,  
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all  
Tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that  
Steals the life.
