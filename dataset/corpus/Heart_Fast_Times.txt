Fast times  
Fast times  
Bell, bell ringing me out of my sleep  
Make the world on time  
Make a little money, little money to keep  
When you see the light turn green  
You better be the first off the line  
You gotta move and move right now  
Or you gonna get left behind  
Fast times  
Fast times  
Same old school bee  
I don't care too much  
About making those grades  
Every day, every single day  
I only come here just to see my babe  
Night shift, cash it out  
Time clock punching me out of the door  
Fire it up come on rev it, rev it up  
Shoot my care into the freeway war  
Fast times  
Fast times  
At the end of one day's race  
I just got to see my darling's face  
Before the day starts in again  
Before the morning rings and rings  
My baby's waiting anxiously  
Pouring kisses over me  
Always makes my nights so warm  
In the loving power of his arms
