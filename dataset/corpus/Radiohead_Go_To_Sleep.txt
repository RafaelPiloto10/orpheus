Something for the rag and bone man  
Over my dead body  
Something big is gonna happen  
Over my dead body  
  
Someone's son or someone's daughter  
Over my dead body  
This is how I end up sucked in  
Over my dead body  
  
I'm gonna go to sleep  
Let this wash all over me  
  
We don't want to wake monster taking over  
Tiptoe round, tie him down  
We don't want the loonies taking over  
Tiptoe round, tie them down  
  
May pretty horses  
Come to you  
As you sleep  
I'm gonna go to sleep  
Let this wash all over me
