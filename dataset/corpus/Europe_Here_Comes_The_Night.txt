Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright  
  
As I walk down this dusty road  
My heart weights down like a heavy load  
My spirit finds its way across the ocean  
  
And my soul cries out for leaving now  
I have got to get back home somehow  
She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried  
Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside  
  
Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
I see tomorrow in a different light  
This long and lonely night  
  
I've got a weary head and worn out shoes  
A bottle of rum and as I sing the blues  
The bitter wind sends shivers down my spine  
  
I'm a ramblin' man with a ramblin' mind  
I left my loved ones far behind  
She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried  
Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside  
  
Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright  
This long and lonely night  
  
Oh bless my soul, what have I done  
I'm bound to face this world alone  
A drifter I was meant to be  
With no one there for company  
But if one day down there road I can,  
Would you look my way  
Would you take me back again  
  
Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright  
This long and lonely night  
  
As my souls cries out for leaving
