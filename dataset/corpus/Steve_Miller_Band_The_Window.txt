Ask my baby what she wants to be  
She'll say a monkey swingin' in a tree  
Ask my baby what she's thinkin' of  
She'll say there's nothing greater than love  
  
Well, look through the window  
Tell me what do you see  
A beautiful planet  
Peace and harmony  
  
Think love you're surrounded  
We are one you and I  
Gather your leaves together  
There's only love until we die  
Until we die  
  
Ask my baby what she's goin' through  
She'll say the same thing, the same thing as you  
Ask my baby what she's thinkin' of  
She'll say there's nothing greater than love  
  
Look through the window  
Tell me what do you see  
A beautiful planet  
Peace and harmony  
  
Think love you're surrounded  
We are one you and I  
Gather your leaves together  
There's only love until we die  
Until we die
