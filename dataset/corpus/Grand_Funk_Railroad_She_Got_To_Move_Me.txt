Feelin' kind of down 'cause I needed some female company.  
Suddenly I felt this pair of eyes starin' at me.  
She got to move me, she got the soul,  
Never should have told me she was only fourteen years old.  
How was I to know?  
  
She said ...  
Chorus  
Get it up baby, don't you want me to shake that thing?  
Get it up baby, drive me crazy, I'll do anything.  
Get it up baby, I came even to make you say, shake that thing.  
  
Oooo ...  
  
Make me want to yell, make me want to shout, make me want to scream.  
I didn't have to fantasize, she made me dream.  
She got to move me, she got the soul,  
Her eyes could tantalize for fourteen years old.  
How was I to know?  
  
She said ...  
Chorus  
  
Owww ...  
  
Chorus
