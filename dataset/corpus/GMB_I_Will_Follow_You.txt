How long have I been I'm the valley  
While You are walking near me?  
How far have I stepped in the shadow  
'Til Your stretched hand pulled me?  
  
More and more each day  
I long to see Your face  
And the deeper I learn  
Of Your sweet love for me  
I am amazed, amazed  
  
I will follow You that's my promise  
I will follow You 'till the end  
I will follow You for no other  
Have love me more  
I will follow You with my whole heart  
I will follow You with my strength  
I will follow You 'till my whole life  
Bring fragnance and glory to Your name  
  
How high can I stand on a mountain  
When it's Your hand that lifts me?  
How great can my words ever be  
For with Your breath You formed me
