I've put it all behind me  
Nothin' left to do or doubt  
Some may say  
  
But every silver linin'  
Always seems to have a cloud  
That comes my way  
  
Anticipated pleasure  
Or unexpected pain  
No choice I feel  
  
Love is hard to measure  
Hidden in the rain  
That's why you'll find me  
  
Here all alone and still wonderin' why  
Waitin' inside for the cold to get colder  
And here where it's clear that I've wasted my time  
Hopin' to fly 'cause it's almost over now  
  
People come together  
People go their own way  
Love conquers few  
  
And I'll do whatever  
I'll say what I need to say  
Just not for you  
  
How many days should I smile with a frown  
'Cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders?  
And how many nights must I wake up alone  
And know in my soul that it's almost over now?  
  
Love is like a paper airplane  
Flyin' in the folded dent  
Ridin' high, dippin' low  
But innocence is fair game  
I'm hopin' I can hold it in  
Our love will die, I know
