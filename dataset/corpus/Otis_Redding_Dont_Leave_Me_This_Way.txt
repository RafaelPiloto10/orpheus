Um-hm-hm aah ah ah  
Don't leave me this way  
I can't survive, can't stay alive  
Without your love, oh baby  
Don't leave me this way, no  
I can't exist, I'll surely miss your tender kiss  
Don't leave me this way  
(A broken man with empty hands  
Oh baby please, don't leave me this way)  
Aaah baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you  
Now come on down and do what you gotta do  
(Now come on girl and do what you gotta do)  
You started this fire down in my soul  
Now can't you see it's burning out of control  
Come on (now) satisfy the need in me  
Only your good lovin' can set me free hey  
Don't, don't you leave me this way, no  
Don't you understand I'm at your command  
Oh baby please, please don't leave me this way  
Aaah baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you  
Now come on down and do what you gotta do  
(Now come on girl and do what you gotta do)  
You started this fire down in my soul  
Now can't you see it's burning out of control  
Come on (now) satisfy the need in me  
Only your good lovin' can set me free hey  
Need your lovin' baby, need need your love right now  
Your love is so important to me got to have it  
('Cause it would be wrong  
To string me along a love so true)
