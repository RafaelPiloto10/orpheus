You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize all others above  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
  
And we would be so grand at the game  
Carefree together that it does seem a shame  
That you can't see your future with me  
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love  
  
You'd be so easy to love  
Easy to idolize all others above  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep all the home fires burning for  
  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together that it does seem a shame  
That you can't see your future with me  
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love  
  
Easy to love  
Easy to love
