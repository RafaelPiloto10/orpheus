I can feel the raindrops  
Slowly falling  
And they calling for  
They keep calling for  
My knight in shining armour  
Come and save me  
Cause I'm drowning in pain  
  
I've been hurt  
By his mistakes  
So come and take me away  
I put him first  
I thought he'd stay  
But he couldn't weather the storm  
So he left me the rain  
  
Over time, pictures fade  
All that's left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights, and stormy days  
I've got proof that people change  
And all that's left are these empty frames  
All that's left are these empty...  
  
Can you hear these teardrops  
In my pillow?  
They keep falling cause  
I kept falling for your dozen thorny roses  
Now I'm bleeding  
And I'm lonely again  
  
Now I'm hurt  
It's my mistake  
I should have known right away  
I put him first  
I thought he'd stay  
But he couldn't weather the storm  
So he left me the rain  
  
Over time, pictures fade  
All that's left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights, and stormy days  
I've got proof that people change  
Long after the smiles all fade away  
All this endless pain  
All this empty space  
  
Sleepless nights, and stormy days  
I've got proof that people change  
Over time, pictures fade  
And all that's left are these empty frames  
  
Over time, pictures fade  
All that's left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights, and stormy days  
All that's left are these empty...  
  
Over time, pictures fade  
And all that's left are these empty frames  
Sleepless nights, and stormy days  
I've got proof that people change  
  
All that's left are these empty frames
