Do you wanna wind up in a graveyard?  
Like a number on a scorecard  
They're gonna wrap you up in corn silk  
They're gonna cry like you were spilled milk  
You'd better take another Quaalude  
And get yourself corkscrewed  
I understand that you got cold feet  
Why'd you have to take 'em down a side street?  
I must be dumber than a spit curl  
'Cause I got hung up on a showgirl  
Now I look like I'm a scarecrow  
I might as well go on a talk show  
And this ain't a home anymore  
Well, it's just four walls and a floor  
Home is where you get the girls for free  
This is just the house that used to be  
Oh, the house that used to be  
Do you wanna wind up in a graveyard?  
Just another girl who co-starred  
They're gonna wrap you up in corn silks  
They're gonna cry like you were spilled milk  
And in the far off wail of freight trains  
And in the lonely howl of great danes  
I hear the girl I lost forever  
I hear the girl I lost forever  
And this ain't a home anymore  
Well, it's just four walls and a floor  
Home is where you get the girls for free  
This is just the house that used to be  
Oh, the house that used to be
