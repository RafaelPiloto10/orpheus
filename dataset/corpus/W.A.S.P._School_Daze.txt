My eyes are burning, bells are ringing in my ears  
Alarm clocks wailing, class bells screaming, I can't hear  
A text book mad-house, twelve years I'm here in a rage  
A juveniles jail, and I'm here locked up in their cage  
  
[Chorus]  
School daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time  
School daze, school daze, my age is my crime  
School daze, school daze, I'm here doin' time  
School daze, school daze, I'm attending hell high  
  
A blackboard jungle toed the line the rulers made  
A homework hell-house screams at me "make the grade!"  
Tick tock, three o'clock, I'm sitting here and counting off the days  
A fire bell is ringin' hell and I'd sure love to see it blaze  
Burn it down!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pledge no allegiance and I bet  
They're gonna drive me crazy yet  
Nobody here is understanding me  
I pledge no allegiance and I bet  
They're gonna drive me crazy yet  
I'm dying here and trying to get free  
  
[Chorus]
