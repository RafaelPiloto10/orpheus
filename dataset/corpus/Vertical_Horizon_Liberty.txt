We met as two total strangers  
As many lovers often do  
But who could have ever seen the danger  
I didn't know I'd fall in love with you  
  
[Chorus]  
You are this lonely picker's daydream  
Like a wish that's wishing to come true  
So Liberty just now I'm waiting  
To share this love song with you  
  
But do you think about me when you're lying in his bed  
Won't you take the time to explain  
Do you ever think you'd rather be with me instead  
Or do you only think about me when it rains  
  
We shared some special nights together  
We said we'd watch the morning rise  
But when the sun was all around us  
Wasn't nothing I hadn't seen in your eyes  
  
I try so hard to keep it hidden  
But I am hurting deep inside  
For every time I've seen you smile  
There are two times that I have cried  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now and forever my love will be the same  
I will be waiting underneath the pouring rain
