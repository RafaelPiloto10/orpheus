Hey! Just stop your domination  
You can't move on my personality  
Unconcerned, you use manipulation  
Shamelessly  
  
Well, you know you've got ??an?? education  
It simply fails to satisfy my needs  
It's a fool's game  
Nobody's gonna rule me  
  
Oh, those blind sheep  
Lead 'em to the slaughter  
Blind sheep  
Mothers, hide your daughters  
Love's cheap  
Look at the smile on their faces  
Oh, ho  
Blind, leadin' the blind, leading the blind  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
I'm tired of suffocation  
Oh, but for talk  
You never follow through  
What I want is some hot and hard persuasion  
Endlessly  
  
It's so sad, the sleazy innuendos  
They've brought so many victims to their knees  
Chain reaction  
Half-assed satisfaction  
  
You've got me but a blind sheep  
Lead 'em to the slaughter  
Blind sheep  
Mothers, hide your daughters  
Love's cheap  
Look at the smile on their faces  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Blind, leading the blind, leading the blind  
  
Deprivation just don't work on me  
Even affliction, it just don't do it  
All I want is  
What I need is  
(Blind sheep)  
  
It's not fashion to you  
You're just malicious  
Don't get trying  
Simply not judicious  
  
All I want is  
What I need is  
(Blind sheep)  
  
Such a city, something exotic  
You autocrat  
I'm simply not turned onto that  
  
All I want is  
What I need is  
(Blind sheep)  
  
???debility???  
I'm by the side of the station
