it was a day like this and my house burnt down  
and the walls were thin and they crashed to the ground  
it was a day like this and my life unwound  
you could've struck me a line and that's okay now  
we could always put it together again  
you could've told me a lie, and a lie so thin, so thin  
now everything's clear  
day after day and the life goes on  
and I try to see the good in everyone  
if I ever find myself here again  
I'll give everything
