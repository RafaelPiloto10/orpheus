Say what you need to say  
Make it clear  
Make it great  
Cause it's not too late  
And there's no mistake  
When you shine  
Shake it for me anyway  
Now we crash the gate  
To investigate  
Your fate  
  
Pleasure to meet you  
Got so much more  
To offer the world  
See what's in store  
Stay all day  
Someone to love  
That's my boy chip chop  
Open the doors  
And we never close shop  
Stay all day  
  
And you shine as you redefine  
Your time, just another time of day  
Do you feel the spark  
When you play the part?  
Superstar  
Fake it for me anyway  
Time to tell them all  
Without hem or haw  
No applause  
Tell them how to generate  
How to raise the bar  
How to keep it hard  
To be alive, make it for me anyway  
If you care at all  
You will bare it all  
You will grind, shake it for me anyway  
Born to play the part  
Dying for your art  
Cause it's time  
Take it for me anyway  
You will clear the air  
With a single stare  
Your fate  
  
Take what you need to take  
To forsake  
Make it for me anyway  
When we fill the void  
That is Pink As Floyd  
To destroy  
Records that we file away  
And I clean the slate  
As we calculate  
Your fate
