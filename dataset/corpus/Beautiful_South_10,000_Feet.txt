The part of love that I'm scared of  
is the actual taking off  
I can take a bumpy landing  
But the start must be soft  
soft, soft, soft  
It must be soft  
  
Some men need your attention  
every minute, every hour  
Some women need the proof  
in every chocolate, every flower  
Are you asking me down your runway?  
I'm asking you to be watchtower  
tower, tower, tower  
to be watchtower  
tower, tower, tower  
  
  
Some men just like the journey  
don't care if it's incomplete  
Some women like a long trip  
Some women short 'n' sweet  
But if we lift each other up  
Let's make it 10,000 feet  
feet, feet, feet  
10,000 feet  
feet, feet, feet  
  
  
The reason I'm still down here  
and I've never taken off  
Is I never had the courage  
To rummage through love's loft  
loft, loft, loft  
The highest loft  
loft, loft, loft  
  
  
Cos when we're finally up there  
and the engines have been stopped  
the landing won't be fatal  
if love's parachute's been dropped  
dropped, dropped, dropped  
love's been dropped  
dropped, dropped, dropp
