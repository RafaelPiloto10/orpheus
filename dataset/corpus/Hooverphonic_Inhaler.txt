Water falling down a hundred meters  
Colored by the sun  
In rainbow colors  
Paul is driving me around  
Through fields of light  
Blinded by the sun  
Fight the clouds  
Be an inhaler  
Have no doubts  
  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
  
Water falling down a hundred meters  
Colored by the sun  
In rainbow colors  
Paul is driving me around  
Through fields of light  
Blinded by the sun  
Fight the clouds  
Be an inhaler  
Have no doubts  
  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
  
As I was saying, stereo is full of surprises  
A new stereophonic sound spectacular  
A new stereophonic sound spectacular  
  
We're able to tell, in an instant, where a particular sound is coming from  
A new stereophonic sound spectacular [Repeat x5]  
As I was saying, stereo is full of surprises
