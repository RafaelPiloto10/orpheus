When you need a friend  
Don't look to a stranger  
You know in the end  
I'll always be there  
  
And when you're in doubt  
And when you're in danger  
Take a look all around  
I'll be there  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I proise you I will  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if I have to walk to world I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will.  
  
When your day is through  
And so is your temper  
You know what to do  
I'll always be there  
  
Sometimes if I shout  
It's not what's intended  
These words just come out  
With no cross to bear  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I proise you I will  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if I have to walk to world I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will.  
  
I gotta tell ya  
  
I gotta tell ya  
  
I gotta tell ya  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if you wait around awhile I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will  
  
I'm sorry I'm just thinking of the right words to say  
I know they don't sound the way I planed them to be  
But if I have to walk to world I'll make you fall for me  
I promise you, I promise you I will.
