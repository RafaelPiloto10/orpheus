How I miss that Old Fashioned Christmas!  
Carols being sung by the tree,  
Window's candlelight shining bright for the whole world to see  
Children's eyes of sweet expectations  
  
Wondering what each present will hold  
Lying in their beds and impatient  
On long Christmas Eves of old  
It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night  
It used to be that special feeling shared together knowing Christmas was here
one night a year  
  
How I miss that Old Fashioned Christmas!  
Memories that last the years  
Call me sentimental
