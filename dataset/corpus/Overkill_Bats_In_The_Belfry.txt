Sick as the sickest only can be  
Armies of crazy crawling' all over me  
Shaky at best is the ground where I stand  
A frozen moment I just don't understand  
Bats, in the belfry  
Bats, in the belfry  
  
C'mon now, let me feel you get on it  
C'mon now, let me have it my way  
C'mon now, when you can't really stop it  
Open up the window got bats in the belfry  
Bats, in the belfry  
Bats, in the belfry  
  
Pasted and wasted, taller than God  
Burning my churches and blowing my wad  
Quakin' beneath me, the ground that I own  
A frozen moment that I'll always call home  
Bats, in the belfry  
Bats, in the belfry  
  
C'mon got bats in the belfry  
Hold on rats on the way  
C'mon got bats in the belfry  
Open up the window  
Bats in the belfry
