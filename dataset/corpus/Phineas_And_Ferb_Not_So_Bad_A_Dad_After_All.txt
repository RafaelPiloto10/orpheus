You were a sub-standard dad,  
But the only one I had  
I grew up hearing your evil scheming down the hall,  
  
But when I look at this thing  
It makes me wanna sing:  
Maybe you're not so bad a dad after all...  
  
At my first ever swim meet,  
You stepped on the other team's feet  
At my recital, you clapped louder than you should.  
  
But when you taught me how to drive  
We actually made it home alive,  
I guess it's possible, not every part of you isn't good.  
  
I know at times I would cringe,  
Like when you wore all that fringe  
And when you went out of your way to catch that foul ball... (boos)  
  
But this piece of plastic in my hand  
Makes me finally understand:  
Maybe you're not so bad a dad,  
Not so bad a dad after all.
