Too much anger trapped inside  
It's so hard to let it go  
Hope is fading  
I'm tired of waiting  
And I'm moving much too slow  
  
The stars above I'm cursing  
And it still seems I'm rehearsing  
But the cameras have been  
Rolling all the while  
This story's getting boring  
And the spectators are snoring  
I suggest you turn the dial  
  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
  
I saw a headline in the paper  
Of another ticker taper  
For a war which has barely just begun  
We'll be waving our flag silly  
As we're chopped into piccalilli  
And that's not my idea of fun  
  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Should've been canceled long ago
