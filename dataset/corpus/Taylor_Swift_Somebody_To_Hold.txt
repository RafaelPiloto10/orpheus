(Verse)  
I'm falling down low,  
No hand that I can hold,  
I'm left behind,  
They don't see the tears I cry.  
  
I cuddle up,  
Writing a song,  
About how I feel,  
They say that's crazy.  
  
(Hook)  
They don't understand my life,  
And the ways that I cry,  
Mmm-mmm  
Things are getting really hard,  
Can't search on google for my love  
  
(Chorus)  
These nights are sleepless,  
These nights are cold,  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Don't care if it's for one night,  
I'll make do,  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
(Verse 2)  
They treat like me like I'm,  
A mental patient,  
Wish somebody,  
Could be in sync with me.  
  
(Hook)  
They don't understand my life,  
And the ways that I cry,  
Mmm-mmm  
Things are getting really hard,  
Can't search on google for my love  
  
(Chorus)  
These nights are sleepless,  
These nights are cold,  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Don't care if it's for one night,  
I'll make do,  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
(Slow part)  
I hug the air,  
When reality hits me  
And no one's there.  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I hug the air  
When reality hits me  
I wish some one was there  
  
(Chorus)  
These nights are sleepless,  
These nights are cold,  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Don't care if it's for one night,  
I'll make do,  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold
