You tell me to be strong  
You tell me to be strong  
Goodbye ain't no reason to cry  
It ain't no big deal  
You say I'll get along  
Sure I'll get along  
You're so nonchalant  
That it's unreal  
Well I thought this love would be all I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you, you say sorry babe  
It didn't work out that way  
But don't let that ruin your day  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
Just my world your taking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Don't you worry about me  
No don't worry babe  
I'll be alright  
Whoa yeah  
Don't act so concerned  
No don't be concerned  
Don't know how much more  
Of your kindness that I can bear  
Guess I had to learn  
I just had to learn  
That after all this  
You just don't care  
But don't let that worry your mind now  
I'll be OK  
Baby I'll be fine now  
It's just I'm watching my world walking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
Just my world your taking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Don't you worry about me  
No don't worry babe  
I'll be alright  
Whoa whoa  
(Don't lose any sleep now babe)  
Oh  
(Don't lose any sleep now babe)  
Whoa no no no no no no  
Don't lose any sleep now  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
Just my world you're taking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Don't you worry about me  
No don't worry babe  
Don't lose any sleep now  
Just my heart you're breaking  
Just my world you're taking away  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Don't you worry about me  
No don't worry baby  
It's just my heart you're breaking  
(Can't you see it's breaking baby)  
Don't lose any sleep now baby
