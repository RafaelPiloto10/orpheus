In the eye of the storm  
Looking out through the rain  
Gabriel, blow your horn  
They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane  
  
[Chorus]  
Catch the right ride in the nick of time  
Soldiers stay affronted then they blow your mind  
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war  
No idea what we're in for  
Powerful, magnificent and so divine  
Soldiers stay affronted it'll blow your mind  
  
Hear a thunderous voice  
Shouting there will be no peace  
Until our people rejoice  
When every boy and girl is freed  
You see it's going down  
The wars and the mysteries  
But my friends, there'll be better days  
And a better way  
According to the prophecy  
  
[Bridge]  
It would be so nice  
To look up at paradise  
By all means we must go  
Or are you in the know  
Like all the way up, so child,  
  
You been a friend of mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You been a friend of mine  
  
[Bridge]
