Well you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Well we think that you are john or dave  
But you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Jumbled mass of preconceived ideas  
  
From our birth we were given an identity  
People told us we were great or small  
From our birth we were given rules of right or wrong  
Not forgetting the bullies at school  
  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
And as the world makes us feel great  
And as the world makes us feel small  
Oh so convinced of our identity  
If we only knew it we just can't believe it we just won't believe it  
  
Leading us to think that we are such a success  
Conning us to think that we are just a failure  
Leading us to think that we are so intelligent  
Conning us to think that we are just a do-do do-do  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Er, sorry, ha ha  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning  
Who is to say what is what  
Welcome to conditioning
