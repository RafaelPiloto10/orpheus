Over the hills lies a new beginning, over the hills  
Over the hills there is a way I know it, over the hills  
You can't bring all the gloom  
(Your heart is frayed and so empty)  
You glorify the future  
(Living in a different world than me)  
The journey ends in death  
(You are giving up so easily)  
You are the other half of me  
Over the hills, over the hills  
Over the hills, over the hills  
We are drifting apart  
(Chilled to the marrow 'cause you don't want to go)  
'Cause we've got a different wish at heart  
(The amulet guides us to the other side)  
When I go down it's you who'll bleed  
(I'm not scared to die, as long as I'm with you)  
You are the other half of me  
Over the hills lies a new beginning, over the hills  
Over the hills there is a way I know it, over the hills
