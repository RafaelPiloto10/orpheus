Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she always gone too long anytime she goes away  
  
Wonder this time where she's gone  
Wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
  
And I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know  
  
Hey I'll leave the young thing alone  
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness everyday  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away
