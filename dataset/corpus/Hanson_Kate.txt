She plays Wipeout on the drums  
The squirrels and the birds come  
Gather round to sing the guitar  
Oh I...Have you got nothing to say?  
  
When all words fail she speaks  
Her mix tape's a masterpiece  
Walks through the garden  
So the roses can see  
Oh I...Have you got nothing to say?  
  
And you can see the daisies in her footsteps  
Dandelions, butterflies  
I wanna be Kate  
Kate...Kate...Kate  
  
Everyday she wears the same thing  
I think she smokes pot  
She's everything I want  
She's everything I'm not  
Oh I...Have you got nothing to say?  
  
She never gets wet  
She smiles and it's a rainbow  
And she speaks  
And she breathes  
I wanna be Kate  
  
Down by Rosemary and Cameron  
She hands out the Bhagavad-Gita  
I see her around every couple days  
I wanna meet her so I can say...hey Kate  
  
ooh la la la  
ooh la la la  
ooh la la la la  
  
She never gets wet  
She smiles and it's a rainbow  
You can see  
I wanna wanna wanna be Kate  
Kate...Kate...Kate  
Na Na Kate  
Kate...Kate...Kate  
Na Na Na Na Na Na
