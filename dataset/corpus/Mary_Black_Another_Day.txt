Hey little brother the winds of the world  
Have ruffled your soft and weakened wings  
And though I can't hold you as I look into your eyes  
I can see the film that disappointment brings  
I know it's rained upon your childhood dreams  
The games you've been playing  
Weren't quite what they seemed  
How can I tell you don't bang your head against the wall  
The wall I've been banging and praying might fall  
  
[Chorus]  
Your time will come on another day  
And your dreams will flame and in the fire play  
On another day  
  
I know it's hard for you to understand  
There are no flying angels come to lend a hand  
No smiling faces lined for you to meet  
It looks like that in twisted glass  
From the kind side of the street  
  
[Chorus]  
Repeat 1st verse  
[Chorus]
