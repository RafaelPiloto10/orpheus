When you come back I won't be here  
She said and gently pulled me near  
If you want to talk you can call  
I know it's not your fault  
  
I just smiled and said let go of me  
But there's something that I've just gotta know  
Did someone else steal my part?  
She said it's not my fault  
  
Then my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
I was drifted in between  
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah  
In my dreams you are still here  
Like you've always been  
  
Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
I gave myself away completely  
But you just couldn't see me  
Though I was sleeping in your bed  
'Cause someone else was on your mind  
In your head  
  
When I came back she wasn't there  
Just a note left on the stairs  
If you want to talk give me a call  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
When the one that you want doesn't want you  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
Siberia, Siberia  
When the one you want doesn't want you too
