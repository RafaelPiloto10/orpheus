Ain't no way  
To get you out of me  
Baby, there ain't no way  
In the whole wide world  
  
I'm about to see  
By and by  
You're all I ever need  
Baby, when I forget how good life is  
  
You bring it home to me  
And I say hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Hey Hey  
Ain't no way  
Good time come  
Ain't no doubt on it  
  
Tomorrow sure looks somethin' else  
No matter where I sit  
Good time here  
Big plum without no pit  
  
And baby, there ain't no way to forget  
That you're the why of it  
And I say hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Hey Hey  
Ain't no way  
And I say hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Ain't no way  
Hey Come on, hey  
  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
Come on, hey  
  
Ain't no way
