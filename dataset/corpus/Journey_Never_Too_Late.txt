Her head is filled with doubt  
Search her heart for faith that can't be found  
He's running desperate now  
All that he's become is just not working anymore  
He's needing something more  
  
Someone that he used to be  
Part of her is a mystery  
Spinning around in an empty place  
Lie to themselves till they're blind with rage  
  
It's never too late to feel the world come crashing down  
It's never too late  
It's darkest just before the dawn  
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain  
Never thought they'd fall this far  
You know it's never too late to change  
  
So much to understand  
So much to feel and finally now you can  
They'll see a different day all because they faced themselves  
And now I hear them say they're gonna be okay  
  
She found who she used to be and now there is no mystery  
Open his eyes in a brand new place  
A different soul in a different place  
  
It's never too late to feel the world come crashing down  
It's never too late  
It's darkest just before the dawn  
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain  
Never thought they'd fall this far  
  
Love is waiting, love is patient, love is kind  
Love is falling into places in their minds  
They love enough to know the difference  
The dream they had today, don't throw it all away  
  
It's never too late to feel the world come crashing down  
It's never too late  
It's darkest just before the dawn  
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain  
Never thought they'd fall this far  
You know it's never too late to change  
  
To rise above it all, never question, never fall  
There is no mystery they are who they used to be  
They're in a brand new place,  
A different soul and a different face  
The dreams they had today, don't throw it all away
