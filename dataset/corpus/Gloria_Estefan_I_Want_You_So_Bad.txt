You're the only one to make me tremble  
The one to show me how to laugh and cry  
In your arms I feel complete surrender  
Why baby why  
To feel no need for lies or alibis  
  
(I want you so bad)  
Ooh baby  
I really, really want you  
(What should we do)  
What should we do  
You know I want you  
Should I stay, should I go  
I really don't know  
I'm so scared, I'm afraid  
I can't find a way  
To say I love you  
  
No one's ever touched me like you've touched me  
I swear that's no lie  
I never thought I'd feel like this inside  
Can't control this feeling deep within me  
I can't keep inside  
Yet I can't seem to let it go, oh no  
  
(I want you so bad)  
Ooh baby  
I really, really want you  
(What should we do)  
What should we do  
You know I want you  
(I want you so bad)  
(What should we do)  
Ooh baby, baby  
I really, really, really want you
