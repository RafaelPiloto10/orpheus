I believe for every drop of rain that falls  
A flower grows,  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night  
A candle glows,  
I believe for everyone who goes astray,  
Someone will come to show the way,  
I believe, I believe.  
  
I believe above the storm a smallest prayer  
Will still be heard,  
I believe that someone in the great somewhere  
Hears every word,  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,  
Or touch a leaf, are see the sky,  
Then I know why,  
I believe.  
  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,  
Or touch a leaf, are see the sky,  
Then I know why,  
I believe.
