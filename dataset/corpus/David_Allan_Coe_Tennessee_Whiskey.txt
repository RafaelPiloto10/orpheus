I used to spend my nights out  
In a bar room  
Liquor was the only love I'd known  
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom  
Brought me back from being too far gone  
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I looked for love  
In all the same old places  
Found the bottom of the bottle's  
Always dry  
But when you poured out your heart  
I didn't waste it  
Cause there's nothing like your love  
To get me high  
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I stay stoned on your love all the time
