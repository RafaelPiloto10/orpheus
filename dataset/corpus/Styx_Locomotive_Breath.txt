In the shuffling madness of the locomotive breath  
Runs the all time loser, head long to his death  
He feels the piston scraping, steam breaking on his brow  
Old Charlie stole the handle and the train  
It won't stop going, no way to slow down  
He sees his children jumpin' off at stations, one by one  
His woman and his best friend in bed and havin' fun  
Oh, he's crawling down the corridor on his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle and the train  
It won't stop going, no way to slow down  
Hey, hey, [Incomprehensible], ooh  
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie  
He hears the silence howling, catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner, has got him by the balls  
Oh, he picks up Gideons Bible, open at page one  
But, God, he stole the handle and the train  
It won't stop going, no way to slow down  
No way to slow down, no way to slow down  
No way to slow down, no way to slow down, yeah  
Charlie stole the handle, no way to slow down  
No way to slow down, Charlie stole the handle
