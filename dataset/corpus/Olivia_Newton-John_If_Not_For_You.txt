If not for you, babe I couldn't even find the door  
I couldn't even see the floor  
I'd be sad and blue, if not for you  
  
If not for you, babe, the night would see me wide awake  
The day would surely have to break  
It would not be new, if not for you  
  
[Chorus]  
If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all, I'd be lost, if not for you  
  
If not for you, the Winter would hold no Spring  
Couldn't hear a Robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If not for you, the Winter would hold no Spring  
You couldn't hear a robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you  
If not for you
