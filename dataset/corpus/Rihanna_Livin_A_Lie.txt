Aw, Aw, Aw, Rihanna  
Ey, Ey Dreamer  
Of far far  
Aw, Aw, Ey, Ey, Ey  
  
I wanna tell the world that your my girl  
And that I'm your man, Aw baby  
And I wanna tell the world that you got me  
Why can't we be, Aw baby  
I can't put my name on your kiss  
And I can't speak your name from these lips  
We froze and nobody knows  
  
Have to walk out the room everytime you call  
Tellin everybody I ain't seen you in so long  
It feels like I ain't breating  
This feels worser than cheating  
  
Cuz we out here livin' a lie,  
Out here livin' a lie,  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
We out here livin' a lie,  
Behind these smiles I'm really hurting  
Inside-side-side, Inside-side-side,  
Inside-side-side, Inside-side-side  
  
Everytime I wanna put us on display  
Time takes a breathe, Aw Baby  
I hear about other relationships that ain't true  
I wanna set it right, Aw Baby  
And I can't tell nobody how I feel, oh  
And I can't tell nobody how we is, oh  
  
I wanna hop on the first thing smokin  
Tell our agent to book us a plane  
  
I wanna be near you  
I wanna be near you too  
I wanna wake up (wake up)  
Right next to you baby  
  
Cuz we out here livin' a lie,  
Out here livin' a lie,  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
We out here livin' a lie,  
Behind these smiles I'm really hurting  
Inside-side-side, Inside-side-side,  
Inside-side-side, Inside-side-side  
  
Rihanna Baby, Dream Baby  
What on this circ will we do?  
Assume that I'm not a sume  
And everything in this world has got us crazy  
I'm so through, You too?, We Alone  
What the worst that could happen baby if they know?  
Won't be nothing,  
Cuz your inpecable, your everything that I love  
  
Cuz we out here livin' a lie,  
Out here livin' a lie,  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry  
We out here livin' a lie,  
I'm out here livin' a lie,  
We out here livin' a lie,  
Behind these smiles I'm really hurting  
Inside-side-side, Inside-side-side,  
Inside-side-side, Inside-side-side  
  
I wanna be with you
