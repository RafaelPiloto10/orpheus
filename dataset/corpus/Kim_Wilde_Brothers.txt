Here we are  
Late in the hours that start another day  
Here am I  
Skirting around what I really want to say  
  
Brothers  
Well they hold a place in your heart  
They're something apart  
But then...  
Lovers...  
Well that's a different thing to talk about  
  
All this world  
You know I'd give you my love - if there were more  
But these words  
Cover the roads that we've walked so long before  
That's another feeling  
That's a different story  
When we've really nowhere to start  
That's another feeling  
That's another place in your heart - when I say brothers  
  
We've got really nowhere to start  
That's another feeling  
That's a different story  
They're simply just two worlds apart  
That's another feeling  
That's another place in my heart - when I say brothers  
  
When ever we two get talking about love  
It always ends up  
Ends up in tears  
I would have thought by now you'd know me  
So please stop cryin'  
And wasting those tears
