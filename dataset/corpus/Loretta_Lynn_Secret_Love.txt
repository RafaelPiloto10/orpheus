Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free  
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you  
Now I shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils  
And now my heart's an open door and my secret love's no secret anymore  
Now I shout it from the highest hills
