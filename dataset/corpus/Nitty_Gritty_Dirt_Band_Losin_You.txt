There's no such thing as sleep for jealous fools  
And being jealous about someone like you  
Is sort of foolish too  
The life you choose is the life you want I guess  
Losin' you might be the best thing yet  
  
The longest day I live I'll still be sufferin' from the shame  
While in the gutter you were makin' yourself quite a name  
The loneliness is all that I regret  
Losin' you might be the best thing yet  
  
Patiently I sit at home and wait,wonderin' where you are  
And what you are doin' has turned my love to hate  
I wanted you and you wanted anyone you could get  
Losin' you might be the best thing yet
