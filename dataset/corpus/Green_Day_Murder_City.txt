Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the murder city  
  
I'm wide awake  
After the riot  
This demonstration  
Of our anguish  
This empty laughter  
Has no reason  
Like a bottle  
Of your favorite poison  
  
We are the last call  
And it's too pathetic  
  
Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the murder city  
  
Christian's crying  
In the bathroom  
And I just want to  
Bum a cigarette  
We've come so far,  
We've been so wasted  
It's written  
All over our faces  
  
We are the last call  
And it's too pathetic  
  
Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the murder city  
  
Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the.
