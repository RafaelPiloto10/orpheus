If I ever were to lose you,  
I'd surely lose myself  
Everything I have found here,  
I've not found by myself,  
Try and sometimes you'll succeed,  
To make this man of me  
All of my stolen missing parts  
I've no need for anymore  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me  
  
Back when I was feeling broken,  
I focused on a prayer  
You came deep as the ocean  
It's something something out there here  
All the complexities and games  
No one wins, but somehow, they still play  
All the missing crooked hearts  
They may die, but in us they live on  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me  
  
When hurricanes and cyclones rage,  
When wind turned dirt to dust,  
When floods they came or tides they raised ever,  
Closer became us  
  
All the promises at sundown,  
I meant them like the rest,  
All the demons used to come around,  
I'm grateful now they've left  
  
So persistent in my ways,  
Here a angel, lying here to stay  
No resistance, no alarms, please this is just too good to be gone  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me,  
You and me,  
It's you and me
