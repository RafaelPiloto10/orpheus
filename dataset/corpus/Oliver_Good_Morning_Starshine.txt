Good morning starshine  
The earth says hello  
You twinkle above us  
We twinkle below  
Good morning starshine  
You lead us along  
My love and me as we sing  
Our early morning singing song  
Gliddy glub gloopy  
Nibby nabby noopy  
La la la lo lo  
Sabba sibby sabba  
Nooby abba nabba  
Le le lo lo  
Tooby ooby walla  
Nooby abba naba  
Early morning singing song  
Good morning starshine  
The earth says hello  
You twinkle above us  
We twinkle below  
Good morning starshine  
You lead us along  
My love and me as we sing  
Our early morning singing song  
Gliddy glub gloopy  
Nibby nabby noopy  
La la la lo lo  
Sabba sibby sabba  
Nooby abba nabba  
Le le lo lo  
Tooby ooby walla  
Nooby abba naba  
Early morning singing song  
Singing a song  
Humming a song  
Singing a song  
Loving a song  
Laughing a song  
Singing a song  
Sing the song  
Song song song sing  
Sing sing sing sing song  
  
Good morning starshine  
The universe rings  
With milky way music  
Our blue planet sings  
Good morning starshine  
And someday so strong  
They'll hear the song we sang  
Our early morning singing song
