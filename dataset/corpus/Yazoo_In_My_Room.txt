I stand alone and watch the clock  
I only wait for it to stop  
And in the room locked up inside me  
The cutout magazines remind me  
I sit and wait alone in my room  
  
And in my room against the wall  
There is picture very small  
A photograph I took some years ago  
It shows a picture of the room I know  
I sit and wait alone in my room  
  
[Chorus:]  
The walls are white and in the night  
The room is lit by electric light  
  
I stand and watch the clock  
I only wait for it to stop  
The doors are shut and all the windows lock  
The only sound is from the clock  
I sit and wait alone in my room  
  
[Chorus]
