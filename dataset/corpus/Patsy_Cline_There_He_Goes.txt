There he goes, he's walkin' away  
Each step he takes brings heartache my way  
She won his heart, I lost him someway  
There he goes, he's walkin' away  
  
If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied  
I'd be the one, walkin' by his side  
I love him still and I guess that it shows  
He's walkin' away, there he goes  
  
Oh, if I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied  
I'd be the one walkin' by his side  
I love him still and I guess that it shows  
He's walkin' away, there he goes
