Don't you know you get back what you give out  
Yeah God takes care of your kind  
Oh God takes care of your kind  
No I won't waste a single finger on you  
Yeah it might not be on my time  
Oh, But God takes care of your kind  
  
I let you in where I never let anyone  
You cut me open just to watch the blood run  
For a while now I felt forsaken  
I know one thing and I'm not mistaken  
In the end I'll be fine  
'Cause God takes care of your kind  
  
You're a real big boy but you have a real small  
Mind my manners and hush  
That's a judgment I won't touch  
'Cause God takes care of your kind  
Yeah God takes care of your kind  
  
I let you in where I never let anyone  
You cut me open just to watch the blood run  
For a while now I felt forsaken  
I know one thing and I'm not mistaken  
In the end I'll be fine  
'Cause God takes care of your kind  
  
Oh, I would hate to be you  
When the devil comes to get his due  
Stop pretending you have no clue  
'Cause I've stopped being your fool  
Yeah why waste pity on you  
'Cause God takes care of your kind  
Yeah God takes care of your kind  
You won't even be a thought in my mind  
'Cause God takes care of your kind
