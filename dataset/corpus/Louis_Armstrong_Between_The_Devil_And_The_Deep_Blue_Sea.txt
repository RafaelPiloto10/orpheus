I don't want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You've got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You've got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come knockin' at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I come running back for more  
  
I should hate you  
But, mama, I guess instead I love you  
You've got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea
