You've heard songs about the bright lights of the city  
And songs about the heroes of our land  
But there's one guy around who never lets us down  
The every day family man  
He works hard to pay the mortgage and the taxes  
And there's lots of things that he don't understands  
While we spend millions on the moon when the world may blow out soon  
The every day family man  
You won't read it in the headlines of the papers  
The things he does with his two calloused hands  
But every night when he comes home he's a king of his Rome  
The every day family man  
[ piano ]  
He won't be there when awards and all are given  
But he's close by when his neighbor needs a hand  
When he tells his kids goodnight the whole world for him is right  
The every day family man  
Yeah you won't read it in the headlines...  
The every day family man
