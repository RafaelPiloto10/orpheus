There's a light  
A certain kind of light  
That never shone on me  
I want my life to be  
Lived with you, lived with you  
There's a way  
Everybody say  
To do each and every little thing  
But what does it bring  
If I ain't got you, ain't got you?  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
The way I love you  
  
In my mind  
I see your face again  
I know my frame of mind  
You ain't got to be so blind  
And I'm blind, so very blind  
I'm a man  
Can't you see what I am?  
I live and breathe for you  
But what good does it do  
If I ain't got you, ain't got you?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah  
You don't know what it's like  
Baby, you don't know what it's like  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
To love somebody, oh yeah  
  
To love somebody  
The way I love you  
You don't know, you don't know  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
You don't know, oh  
To love somebody, to love somebody  
The way I love you
