I guess I just must be a daredevil  
I don't feel anything until I smash it up  
I'm caught on the cold, caught on the hot  
Not so with the warmer lot  
And all I want's a confidante  
To help me laugh it off  
  
And don't let me ruin me  
I may need a chaperone  
  
Say I'm an airplane  
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak  
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing  
And I use them to give me lip  
Hip hip for the lift  
Hip hip for the drag  
I want them all in my bag  
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift  
  
But don't let me ruin me  
I may need a chaperone  
  
Seek me out  
Look at, look at, look at, look at me  
I'm all the fishes in the sea  
Wake me up  
Give me, give me, give me what you got  
In your mind, in the middle of the night  
  
Maybe you let me look out for you  
Protect that I found in you  
And never let it starve  
Then that way, you let me stay  
Skirt in my the skirt like I want to  
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms  
  
But don't let me ruin me  
I may need a chaperone
