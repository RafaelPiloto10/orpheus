Leo Sayer and Les Davidson  
Rambling 'round your city streets  
I feel no earth beneath my feet  
And I feel my life  
  
Is crumbling into, into the sea  
But I can't swim  
Three thousand miles  
So all I have is lonely nights  
  
I'm an Englishman  
Lost in the U.S.A  
And it's a long way back home  
Such a long way back home  
  
And I'm wondering  
Where am I gonna go  
Line's dead -- operator's gone  
And now the fear is coming on  
  
And I hear my love  
Wondering where have I gone  
So I'm gambling bucks for pounds  
Yeah, but lady luck  
  
Just won't come around  
For an Englishman  
Who is stuck in the U.S.A  
And it's a long way back home  
  
Such a long way back home  
And I'm wondering  
Will I ever get away  
So here I am and there are you  
  
Where wishful thoughts  
Don't serve no use  
And all the worrying in the world  
Won't pull me through  
  
So I think of love that  
Might have been  
And an airline ticket  
That's like a dream  
  
For an Englishman  
Who is lost in the U.S.A  
Such a long way back home  
Such a long way back home  
  
And I'm wondering  
Will I ever get to go  
And I'm waiting for you  
To take me home
