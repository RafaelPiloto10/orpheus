I look around for faces I know  
I never ever want to go home  
My friends are in bed but I'm best on my own  
I'm terrified of driving a car  
  
Afraid I'm afraid of the dark  
But it happened before in a different bar  
And I know it's late but won't you take me home  
I must have thought of getting out now  
  
But how am I gonna get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
  
It's easier to stare at the sun  
Than look at all the things that you've done  
Intentions were good but so was the fun  
And you know it's wrong it can't go on for long  
  
I must have thought of getting out now  
But how am I going to get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
Just the faces change  
  
I must have thought of getting out now  
But how am I going to get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
Just the faces change
