Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home, sweet, home to me  
Blue Mesa.  
  
Moonlight shines as  
Purple shadows fall  
Silence broken by the lonesome  
Cototes call on:  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home, sweet, home to me  
Blue Mesa.  
  
Herds of buffalo  
Graze peacefully  
I can almost hear  
Those black hills callin' me to:  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home, sweet, home to me  
Blue Mesa.  
  
Ridin' high above the prairie floor  
With every passin' day  
I swear I love you more:  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home, sweet, home to me  
Blue Mesa.  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home, sweet, home to me  
Blue Mesa.  
  
You will always be  
Home, sweet, home to me  
Blue Mesa
