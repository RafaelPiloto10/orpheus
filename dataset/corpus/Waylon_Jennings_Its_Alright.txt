J. J. Cale's my hero, best I ever heard  
But you gotta sing a little louder, hoss, 'cause I can't hear the words  
Some folks call it rock and roll, others call it blues  
But I detect a country soul, when I seen his cowboy shoes  
And it's alright  
It's alright  
It may not be right, but it's alright  
  
George might show up flyin' high, if George shows up at all  
But he may be, unconsciously, the greatest of them all  
From the Beatles and me in Nashville, to the billies and the Rolling Stones  
If we all sounded like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones  
And it's alright  
It's alright  
It may not be right, but it's alright  
  
Jesse she's my woman boys, poor little ugly thing  
She tells me just how smart I am, so I'll teach her how to sing  
When I'm wrong and then she nails me, I get her with the same old line  
And it's alright  
It's alright  
It may not be right, but it's alright
