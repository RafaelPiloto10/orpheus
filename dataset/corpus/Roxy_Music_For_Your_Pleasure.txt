For your pleasure  
In our present state  
Part false part true  
Like anything  
  
We present ourselves  
The words we use tumble  
All over your shoulder  
Gravel hard and loose  
There all night lying  
With your dark horse hiding  
Abhorring such extremes  
You're rubbing shoulders  
With the stars at night  
Shining so bright  
Getting older  
  
But you'll wake up soon  
And fight  
In the morning  
Things you worried about  
Last night  
Will seem lighter  
I hope things  
Will turn out right  
Old man  
  
Through every step a change  
You watch me walk away  
Tara Tara
