Daddy, daddy, come and look  
See what I have found  
A little ways away from here  
While digging in the ground  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
It's nothing, just a picture-book  
They had before the war  
  
Daddy, daddy, come and see  
Daddy, come and look  
Why, there's four or five  
Little Melinda girls  
Inside my picture book  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
There were lots of little girls like you  
Before they had the war  
  
Oh Daddy, daddy, come and see  
Daddy, hurry do  
Why, there's someone  
In a pretty dress  
She's all grown up like you  
Won't you tell me why  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
That someone is your Mummy  
You had before the war  
  
Daddy, daddy, tell me if you can  
Why can't things be  
The way they were  
Before the war began  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
The answer lies in yesterday  
Before they had the war
