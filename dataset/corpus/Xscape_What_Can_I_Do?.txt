My man done left me on a midnight train,  
He said he wasn't thinking of ever coming back again.  
He told me he wanted me to find somebody else,  
He done left me here all by myself.  
Tell me...  
  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  
  
When it first started it was all good,  
The things you done to me I never thought that you would.  
Didn't give me a reason why it had to end,  
I can't believe you left me for another ladyfriend.  
  
You know I've been searching for someone,  
Who could share that special love with me.  
  
I thought you was the one, I gave my trust to you,  
I'm such a fool, I want you back,  
Tell me what am I to do?  
  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  
  
I'm sitting by the phone, all alone,  
Tell me what can I do, tell me, tell me...  
  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.  
What can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you.  
Tell me what can I do?  
What, I'm still in love with you baby.
