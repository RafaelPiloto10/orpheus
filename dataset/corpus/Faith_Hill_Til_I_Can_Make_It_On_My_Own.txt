i'll need time to get you off my mind.  
and i may sometimes bother you,  
try to be in touch with you.  
even ask too much of you from time to time.  
now and then.  
lord, you know i'll need a friend.  
til i get used to losin you,  
let me keep on usin you til i can make it on my own.  
i'll get by, but no matter how i try.  
there'll be times you know i'll call  
chances are my tears will fall,  
and i'll have no pride at all from time to time.  
but they say there'll be brighter days.  
but til then i'll lean on you thats all i mean to do  
til i can make it on my own.  
surely someday i'll look up and see the mornin sun,  
without another lonely nite behind me.  
then i'll know i'm over you  
and all my cryin's done.  
no more hurt and memories can find me.  
but til then lord, you know i'm gonna need a friend.  
til i get used to losin you,  
let me keep on usin you til i can make it on my own,  
til i can make it on my own
