'No matter how much you think you want or need it, the past has to remain just
that, the past'  
  
Could've given you everything that you need  
But I cannot turn back the years  
The perfect love was all you wanted from me  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard  
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try  
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth  
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you  
  
Sometimes. hits me in the morning, hits me at night  
That I cannot turn back the years  
So I look out my window, turn off my light  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
Can't make it seem easy, when you're all that I see  
Can't live in a dream and I won't serenade the truth  
People are hurting and they're looking to me  
And I look at you there's nothing more to say, it's too bad I love you  
  
But I'm never gonna give it up  
  
All that I lived for, all that I dreamed  
But I cannot turn back the years  
You're the water I drink, you're the air that I breathe  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
So we have to be strong, and I'm finding that hard  
We have to move on, but no matter how hard I try  
If your heart's in pieces, you look for the truth  
And when I look deep down inside I know, it's too bad I love you  
  
But I'm never gonna give it up
