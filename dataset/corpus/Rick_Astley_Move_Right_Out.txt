She comes home in the morning light  
Tries to hide the secret of last night  
Tells a tale of working late  
Says the things she knows I hate  
Why should I convince myself  
That she loves me and no one else  
Feels like time to break the chains  
I wont be fooled again  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out yeah  
  
When we kiss there's no flame  
But I believe I'm not to blame  
When we touch its by mistake  
Tenderness she just can't fake  
Who does she think I am  
To let her love another man  
I won't take another day  
I just refuse to stay  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out yeah  
  
Oh I love her I really care  
The days so long when she's not there  
But I believe it just ain't right  
To see her with someone else tonight  
Hear me now  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out  
  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna take what's mine  
I'm gonna move right out  
Gonna take my time  
Gonna keep my pride  
Gonna move right out yeah
