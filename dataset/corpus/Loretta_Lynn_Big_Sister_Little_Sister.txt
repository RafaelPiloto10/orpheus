(Give up to the baby that's what they'd always say)  
And big sister would let her path away  
We shared a sandbox little sister and me I was her big sister and she was only
three  
Give up to the baby that's what they'd always say  
And big sister would let her path away  
All through our childhood and our high school days  
My little sister always had to have her way  
Now I can't hurt the baby and I can't let him go  
Be brave big sister this time and say no  
Now all that I remember as they drove out of sight  
Just married and her holdin' the ones I love so tight  
Now all I do is rock my darling I just can't let her cry  
So rock a bye baby rock a bye  
Give up to the baby and I'd lose every time  
Now they're saying big sister is losin' her mind
