Two of hearts, lace and satin, something in the air  
Feel like another crok that's been captured by your stare  
  
Uh-oh, uh-oh  
Falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, and I don't wanna no, no, no  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling, falling  
  
Jealous feelings, reappearing, such a wicked dare  
I'm just so damned confused and I wonder, do you care?  
  
Uh-oh, uh-oh  
Falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, and I don't wanna no, no, no  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling, falling  
  
Like walking in the park  
Or dancing in the dark  
Just wanna hold you through out the night  
  
Prince of fire, sweet desire, with devil may you care  
Release me from your spell  
I don't want this, love ain't fair  
  
I'm falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh  
Falling in love  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling, falling  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again uh-oh, uh-oh, and I don't
wanna no, no, no  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling in love, falling in love again  
Uh-oh, uh-oh, falling, falling
