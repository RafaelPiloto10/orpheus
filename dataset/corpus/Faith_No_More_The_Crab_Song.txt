'and after all the feelings go, I see I still love you so,  
I just thought I'd let you know now that everything's okay,  
And you are on your way back, back to where you came,'  
She said with pain in her heart, it was there from the start.  
Now I know why everything turns grey, but it's our own world we paint  
And I want the brightest, I want flourescence every day and night  
For the rest of my life, open your eyes, won't you?  
Can't you see you're so beautiful to me?  
Don't look back as a matter of fact there's  
A ten foot jack wants to break your back  
You stole his girl, you wrecked his world  
Now it's your your head that he's gonna twirl  
He won't think once, he won't think twice  
Cause he knows just what he's gonna do tonight  
He will commit a crime, a crime of love  
And he won't be happy till he sees your blood  
Looking back on when you left me  
Standing in the rain  
Don't look back as a matter of fact there's  
A son of a bitch and he's digging a ditch  
For you my friend, my lucky one  
So grab your things it's time to run to the other side  
Where love takes pride, and your souls  
The only thing that stays alive  
Ma maooba goo goo ga ga  
Hey! quit talkin that terminal jive!  
Looking back on when I left you...  
Crying in pain  
Don't look back...[1st verse]  
Looking back on when you left me  
Standing in the rain, in-credible pain  
I understand. you have to be your own person. and that's ok with me.  
Hurts, hurts, hurts, like a like a motherfucher  
Love. it hurts. it kills. like a sonofabitch.  
That feeling. it gets me. down inside. deep down there  
No further. keep going. oh man that's right out my system
