The boys in the back room  
Billy shooting pool  
Trading dirty glances  
With pretty boys playing cool  
  
They're putting down their whiskey  
Getting loaded tonight  
It's gettin' kind of risky  
They're lookin' to fight  
  
If you want action  
If you want a thrill  
Then take it down to Jimmy's bar and grill  
  
[Chorus]  
And play dirty  
And dirty games too  
Play dirty  
Like dirty boys do  
  
Tattoo Willie's happenin'  
He really makes a scene  
He's got anything you like  
If you know what I mean  
  
Troubles up when the heat comes down  
Cause down at Jimmy's  
They don't mess around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on, man, let's take this right outside  
Come on, sucker, hit it  
  
The place is gettin' restless  
There's trouble in the air  
All hell's about to break loose  
The dirty punks just don't care  
  
If you want action, if you want a thrill  
Then take it down to Jimmy's bar and grill  
  
[Chorus]
