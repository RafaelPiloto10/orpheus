Cry!  
Cry baby  
Oh oh  
Cry baby  
  
Put yourself around me babe  
Never let me go  
Wrap yourself around me  
Take it easy, make it slow  
Come a little closer.  
Is there something i should know?  
What goes on inside your head  
I'll never, never know  
  
But now if good is good  
And bad is bad  
If bad is good and good is bad  
Then you're the best  
I've ever had  
  
Baby, maybe you just never tried  
To be in love so  
  
Takin' and fakin' and breakin'  
And makin' me cry baby  
Cry baby!  
Oh  
  
Put your hands around me babe  
Never, never let me go  
What goes on inside my head  
You'll never, never know  
  
Where does all the precious time go?  
Maybe if you didn't mind so baby  
Baby you just never tried  
I'm in love so  
  
Takin' it, just can't believe  
You're makin' me cry  
Baby  
  
Cry baby  
Cry cry baby  
Oh  
Cry cry baby  
Oh baby  
  
Cry baby  
Cry cry baby  
Oh  
Cry cry baby  
Oh baby  
  
You make me so lonely  
I'm feelin' so lonely  
Oh
