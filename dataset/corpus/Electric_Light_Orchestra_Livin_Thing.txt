Sailin' away on the crest of a wave  
It's like magic  
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'  
It's magic  
  
And you, and your sweet desire  
You took me higher and higher  
It's a livin' thing  
It's a terrible thing to lose  
It's a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Making believe this is what you conceived  
From your worst day  
Moving in line then you look back in time  
To your first day  
  
And you, and your sweet desire  
You took me higher and higher  
It's a livin' thing  
It's a terrible thing to lose  
It's a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Takin' a dive 'cos you can't halt the slide  
floating downstream  
So let her go Don't start spoiling the show  
It's a bad dream  
  
And you, and your sweet desire  
You took me higher and higher  
It's a livin' thing  
It's a terrible thing to lose  
It's a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose
