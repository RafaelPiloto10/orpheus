This is one of those moments  
When all that really matters  
Is crystal clear  
  
We are woven together  
By whatever threads of life that have  
Brought us here  
  
We are stripped of all our layers  
We are getting to the core  
Tell me something real  
And nothing more  
  
'cause I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is love  
  
So I'm here between the bookends  
Of everything that was and What will be  
  
There's a wealth of every nation  
Not so many answers  
It seems to me  
  
So I face the unfamiliar  
And nothing's clear  
Only blinding faith can carry me can carry me from here  
  
And I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is love  
  
Hold my hand and hold this moment  
Time sure feels precious don't it  
Life is always changing  
This I know  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is now  
Baby all I know is now
