So the pain begins  
As the music fades  
And I'm left here with  
With more than I can take  
  
If you lift me up  
Just get me through this night  
I know I'll rest tomorrow  
And I'll be strong enough to try  
  
When the static clears  
And all is said and done  
I will realize  
That we all need someone  
  
If you lift me up  
Just get me through this night  
I know I'll rest tomorrow  
And I'll be strong enough to try  
  
So when you see me crashing  
And there's nowhere left to fall  
Will you lift me even higher  
To rise above this all  
  
If you lift me up  
Said if you lift me up  
  
Whoo-yeah, ah-yeah  
Whoo-yeah, ah-yeah  
  
Said if you lift me up  
Will you lift me higher  
  
When you see me crashing  
And there's nowhere left to fall  
Will you lift me even higher  
To rise above this all  
  
If you lift me up  
Said if you lift me up  
If you lift me up  
Just get me through this night
