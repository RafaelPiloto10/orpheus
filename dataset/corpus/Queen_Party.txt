We had a good night jamming away  
There was a full moon showing  
And we started to play  
But in the cold light of day next morning  
Party was over - huh  
The party was over  
We got love and we got style  
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes  
Woah woah woah woah woah  
Woah woah woah  
Why don't you come back and play  
Come back and play - hey hey - come back and play  
We got all night all day  
Everybody's gone away  
Why don't you come back and play - play play, come back and play  
Come back and play, come back and play play play play, aah  
Go get 'em boy - let's party  
Yeah - ha ha ha ha haaa - give it, give it  
We had a food fight in somebody's face  
We were up all night singing - singin'  
And giving a chase  
But in the cold light of day next morning  
Everybody was hung-over  
Hey, come back and play, come back and play, come back and play  
We got all night all day  
Everybody's gone away  
Why don't you come back and play - and play  
Come back and play  
We got all night, we got all day  
We got all night to play  
Ah, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play  
Hey hey hey  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over
