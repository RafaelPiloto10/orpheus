If you were born in heaven girl, I'd understand so well  
But ever since I've met you child, you've made my life such hell, hell, hell  
With every day that passes I fall nearer to the ground  
It seems that I've been looking for something that won't be found  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye, bye, bye, bye  
  
Could this be the new answer then to all the dreams we've made  
Could there be some solution, please, to rid me of this grace  
But every single second that you held me in your arms  
You build me up, you raise me up  
You kill me with your charms  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye, bye, bye, bye  
  
(Trying to catch your eye)  
Would you stay with me tonight?  
Won't you make these feelings last?  
Can we start this all again?  
Would that be just to much to ask?  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye
