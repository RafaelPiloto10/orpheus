Take to the highway wont you lend me your name  
Your way and my way seem to be one in the same  
Momma don't understand it  
She wants to know where I been  
Id have to be some kind of natural born fool  
To want to pass that way again  
But you know I could feel it  
On a country road  
  
Sail on home to jesus wont you good girls and boys  
I'm all in pieces, you can have your own choice  
I could seen a heavenly band full of angels  
And they're a comin to set me free  
Don't know much about the wild wind  
But I can tell that it's bound to because I could feel it  
On a country road  
  
Guess my feet know where the want me to go  
Walking on a country road  
  
Walk on down, walk on down, walk on down  
Walk on down, walk on down a country road yeah  
La la la la la la la  
Country road  
Yeah walking on a country road  
Country road  
Yeah  
Walking on a country road
