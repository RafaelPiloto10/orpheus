There's snowflakes in the sky  
And geese are flying high  
But it's April in my heart again  
The devil got his due  
Love's holiday is through  
Love and I have made a happy start again  
Through leaves lie on the ground  
The world just turned around  
It isn't Fall at all you see  
It's Spring that I have found  
  
There's frost in Central Park  
At five it's almost dark  
What's the difference  
When you've heard love's sweet amend  
There's snowflakes in the sky  
And geese are flying high  
But there's April in my heart again
