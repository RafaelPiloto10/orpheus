I live my life in the city  
There's no easy way out  
The day's moving just too fast for me  
I need some time in the sunshine  
I gotta slow it right down  
The day's moving just too fast for me  
  
I live my life for the stars that shine  
People say it's just a waste of time  
Then they say I should feed my head  
That to me was just a day in bed  
I'll take my car and drive real far  
They're not concerned about the way we are  
In my mind my dreams are real  
Now we're concerned about the way I feel  
  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

You're not down with who I am  
Look at you now you're all in my hands tonight  
  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star  
  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll  
It's just rock 'n' roll
