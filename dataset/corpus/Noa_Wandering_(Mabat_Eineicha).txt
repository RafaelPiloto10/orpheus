Et reyach metar-he'aviv  
Shealah me'avnei-hamirtsefet,  
Et manginat orot hapanasim, et agadat hakinor,  
Et kochvei-hamarom shetavu  
Bechosi hamavreket-  
Et hakol, et hakol, ezkor.  
  
Rak eini yoda'at I'm hayah zeh mabat einecha,  
Shehitsit bi brakim lirvavah.  
Lo eda I'm halachti itcha ve'eleicha  
Birchovot halumei ahavah.  
  
Hayah aviv vehatschok  
Nistar bechol nitsan poke'a,  
Uvrit dam veyain krutah,  
Ulechol echad shehe-if bi mabat  
Mishtokek vekameha,  
He'emanti shehu - atah...  
  
Translation:  
  
The fresh smell of spring rain that  
Rose from the sidewalk,  
Street lamps and violins, tales that they tell,  
The stars that plunged into my sparkling glass,  
I remember these things,  
I remember them well  
  
But I cannot recall- was it really your eyes  
That sparked off this thunder from heavens  
Above?  
I know not if it was with you, and to you  
That I walked in these streets that howl of love  
  
Spring it was  
Flowering buds impregnated with laughter  
An oath of blood and a wine is taken  
Sworn to be true  
And every stranger's glance I got  
Of longing and of passion,  
I believe with all my heart  
That it was you
