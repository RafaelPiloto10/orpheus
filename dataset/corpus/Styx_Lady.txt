Lady when you're with me I'm smiling  
Give me all your love  
Your hands build me up when I'm sinking  
Touch me and my troubles all fade  
  
Lady from the moment I saw you standing all alone  
You gave all the love that I needed  
She's so shy like a child who has grown  
You're my  
  
Lady of the morning  
Love shines in your eyes  
Sparkling, clear and lovely  
You're my lady  
  
Lady turn me on when I'm lonely  
Show me all your charms  
Evenings when you lay down beside me  
Just take me gently into your arms  
You're my.  
  
Lady of the morning  
Love shines in your eyes  
Sparkling, clear and lovely  
You're my lady
