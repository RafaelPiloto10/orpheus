Went back home again  
This sucks gotta pack up and leave again  
Say goodbye to all my friends  
Can't say when I'll be there again  
It's time now to turn around  
Turn my back on  
Everything (turn my back on) everything....  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.  
  
Start back at this life  
Stretch myself back into the vibe  
I'm waking up to say I've tried  
Instead of waking up to another TV GUIDE  
It's time now to turn around  
Turn and walk on this crazy ground oh oh oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile  
Everything's changing out of what I know everywhere I go I'm a mobile  
I'm a mobile  
  
Hanging from the ceiling life's a mobile spinning round  
With mixed feelings crazy and wild...  
Sometimes I want to scream out loud...  
  
Everything's changing  
Everywhere I go  
All out of my control  
Everything's changing  
Everywhere I go out of what I know  
  
La la la la la la (la la)  
La la la la la la (la la)  
La la la la la la (la la la)  
La la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile  
Everything's changing out of what I know everywhere I go I'm a mobile  
I'm a mobile
