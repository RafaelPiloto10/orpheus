Go away from my world,  
Let me dream alone.  
And you see it never worked from the start,  
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart.  
Go away from my world,  
And let me dream alone.  
I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair,  
And I'll pretend you're never there.  
Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly  
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly.  
Go away from my world,  
And let me walk all alone.  
All alone in my room,  
All alone and so sad.  
I can dream of how I wanted us to be  
Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be.  
Go away from my world.
