Good times and bum times, I've seen them all  
And, my dear, I'm still here  
Plush velvet sometimes  
Sometimes just pretzels and beer, but I'm here  
  
I've stuffed the dailies in my shoes  
Strummed ukuleles, sung the blues  
Seen all my dreams disappear but I'm here.  
I've slept in shanties, guest of the W. P. A., but I'm here  
Danced in my scanties  
Three bucks a night was the pay, but I'm here  
  
I've stood on bread lines with the best  
Watched while the headlines did the rest  
In the depression was I depressed?  
Nowhere near, I met a big financier and I'm here  
  
I've been through Gandhi, Windsor and Wally's affair, and I'm here  
Amos 'n' Andy, Mah-jongg and platinum hair, and I'm here  
I got through Abie's, Irish Rose, Five Dionne babies, Major Bowes  
Had heebie-jeebies for Beebe's, Bathysphere  
I got through Shirley Temple, and I'm here  
  
I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover  
Gee, that was fun and a half  
When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover  
Anything else is a laugh  
  
I've been through Reno, I've been through Beverly Hills, and I'm here.  
Reefers and vino, rest cures, religion and pills, and I'm here  
Been called a 'Pinko', commie tool, got through it stinko by my pool  
I should've gone to an acting school, that seems clear  
Still someone said, "She's sincere", so I'm here  
  
Black sable one day, next day it goes into hock, but I'm here  
Top billing Monday, Tuesday, you're touring in stock, but I'm here  
First you're another sloe-eyed vamp  
Then someone's mother, then you're camp  
Then you career from career to career  
I'm almost through my memoirs, and I'm here  
  
I've gotten through, "Hey, lady, aren't you whoozis?  
Wow, what a looker you were"  
Or better yet, "Sorry, I thought you were whoozis  
Whatever happened to her? "  
  
Good times and bum times, I've seen 'em all  
And, my dear, I'm still here  
Plush velvet sometimes  
Sometimes just pretzels and beer, but I'm here  
  
I've run the gamut, A to Z  
Three cheers and dammit, C'est la vie  
I got through all of last year, and I'm here  
Lord knows, at least I was there, and I'm here  
Look who's here, I'm still here
