You know I can be found sitting home all alone  
If you can't come around at least please telephone  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well baby, if I made you mad something that I might have said  
Please just forget the past the future looks bright ahead  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well I don't want no other lover  
Baby it's just you I'm dreaming of  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Ah let's go to a preacher and let us say I do  
Then you'll know you have me and I'll know I got you  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well I don't need no other lover  
Baby it's just you I'm dreaming of  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well I don't want no other lover  
Baby it's just you I'm dreaming of
