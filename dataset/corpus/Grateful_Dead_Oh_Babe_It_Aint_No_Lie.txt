Been all around this whole round world,  
Lord, I just got back to day.  
Worked all the way honey and I gave it all to you  
Honeybabe, what more can I do?  
Oh babe, it ain't no lie.  
Oh babe, it ain't no lie.  
Oh babe, it ain't no lie.  
You know this life I'm living is mighty high.  
One more woman, Lord in this town.  
Keep her telling her lies on me.  
Wish to my soul that old woman would die.  
Keep her telling her lies on me.
