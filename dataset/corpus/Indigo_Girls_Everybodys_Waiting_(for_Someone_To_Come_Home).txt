Through the wind and the rain  
I hear my mother's cry  
She says I know my baby's out there  
Just couldn't bear to ask her why  
From my womb into the world  
Lord I wish the child would call  
You know I'm needing some company  
She makes my life so full  
Take my advice  
Go ahead and live your own life  
But everybody's waiting  
For someone to come home  
  
Like the fire waits for the sand  
This world is burning  
With the tension of human hands  
Waiting to be cleansed  
Waiting for their ace of spades  
They say I sure hope he's coming  
'cause I feel like I've just been saved  
Take my advice  
Go ahead and live while you're alive  
Everybody's waiting  
For someone to come home  
  
Come to me and cleanse my soul  
I'm free, I'm free  
Only with you am I whole  
Can't you see that I am me  
I'll be waiting by the window  
I'll be heading for the door  
  
I was driving down highway 85 yeah  
Had to pull off the road  
Just to hear my radio coming in clearer  
Lord this life's so full I said  
Why do we ask for more  
While we're waiting for the man to come  
We forgot what he's coming for  
Won't take my advice  
Go ahead and live while you're alive  
Everybody's waiting  
For someone to come home  
I'll be waiting by the window  
Everybody's waiting  
For someone to come home  
I'll be waiting by the window  
Everybody's waiting  
For someone to come home  
Come home
