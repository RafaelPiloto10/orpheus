He's standin' tall at 5 foot 4,  
With the sharpness of a troubadour.  
I dare you look him in the eye.  
His stench would make a buzzard cry.  
  
He likes burt in white lightning.  
Camelback cinema.  
  
In the dark she sat and wait  
For her steady random date.  
Reflecting back to a time  
When eager boys would stand in line.  
She likes Burt in White Lightning.  
He's standin' tall at 5 foot 4.  
Lurking in the corridor.  
He came to buy his weekly whore  
At camelback cinema.
