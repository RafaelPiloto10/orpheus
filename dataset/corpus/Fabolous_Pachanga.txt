A thug changes and love changes  
And best friends become strangers, Pachangas  
Pa-Pa-Pachangas , Pa-Pa-Pachangas  
  
Yo everything ain't love, love cause if it is  
My definition of love must differ his  
I mean every friendship has its differences  
But these 'Young Bucks' remind me of 'Fif' and his  
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is  
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-vileges  
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his  
He a funny lil nigga like Eddie Griffin is  
Between smokin' and chokin' then you got to live  
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give  
We 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross  
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast  
Fifteen years, fifteen years  
And now when we say 'what's up' the shit seem weird  
But there's a question I prepared for you  
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?  
A thug changes  
  
A thug changes and love changes  
And best friends become strangers, Pachangas  
Pa-Pa-Pachangas , Pa-Pa-Pachangas  
A thug changes and love changes

There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies  
And whenever you cross it you make friend-emies  
There's no remedies for these sick memories  
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emmales  
Had a crush on you now we Kim and Cease  
We don't even talk no more it's no biggie  
I was so Biggie, you was Faith  
I let you slide in my home, you was safe  
I thought my ability to provide you stability  
Was what was really G, okay silly me  
I was Billy D, smooth cappa really street  
Really she attract niggaz like the a Milli beat  
And I happen to rap but somethin' 'bout this beat strange  
Soon as I try to flow with it the beat change  
Never thought she'd change  
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change

See when the love is gone then it's just B.S. left  
Just niggas with chains on tryna be S.F. (Street Fam)  
That's when your ace become ya B.F.F.  
Pa-Pa-Pa-Pachange ya like they was a P.F. chef  
Da-Da-Da-Danger, it just feels 'Mystikal'  
I miss the cool nights sittin in the Coll-O  
Now it's like boo we sittin' in Apollo  
It used to be all good then shit just went mile low  
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad  
Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss  
They do some bitch shit gotta give ya man a divorce  
End up watchin' Friends like Joey, Chandler and Ross, ya see  
Most of these niggas ain't never love 'em  
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em  
So maybe playin' dumb was kinda clever of 'em  
And less friends are your best friends become strangers
