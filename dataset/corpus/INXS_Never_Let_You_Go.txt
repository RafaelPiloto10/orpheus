Everything's good when it's sunshine, you should see me in the rain  
Everyone knows what it feels like to have to start over again  
But I can't start over again, again, again, again  
  
If someday I find me the answer, move down south and marry a dancer  
I could never let you go  
And when he's holding you, you remember the day I met you, one cold December  
I could never let you go  
Oh, I could never let you go  
  
Everything I see around me reminds me of why you were numb  
This bed is too deep to be empty, I'm swimming in oblivion, I'm drowning in
oblivion  
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on  
  
And if someday I find me the answer, move down south and marry a dancer  
I could never let you go  
And when he's holding you, you remember the day I met you, one cold December  
I could never let you go  
Oh, I could never let you go, could never let you go  
  
Everything's good when it's sunshine, you should see me in the rain

Oh, I could never let you go  
  
And if someday I find me the answer, move down south and marry a dancer  
I could never let you go  
Oh, I could never let you go  
Could never let you go, could never let you go, could never let you go  
  
Could never let you go
