Sing sweet and low a lullaby,  
Till angels say Amen.  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem.  
  
While wisemen follow through the dark,  
A star that beckons them.  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem.  
  
A little child shall lead them,  
The prophets said of old.  
And storm and tempest heed them  
Until the bell is tolled.  
  
Sing sweet and low your lullaby,  
Till angels say Amen.  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem.  
  
Sing sweet and low your lullaby  
Till angels say Amen.  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem...
