Women seem to like me  
They seem to like what I have to say  
When they see me out in public  
Women seem to look my way  
Women seem to treat me so gracious  
They sing me to sleep with a song  
But there always seems to be a problem  
Women don't seem to like me long  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Women seem to want me  
To stay with them all night  
We have so much in common  
Our futures really do seem bright  
Women seem to forgive me  
They seem to become my very good friends  
But when it comes time for a commitment  
The romance always seems to end  
  
They tell me all their stories  
We lay awake and talk all night  
Maybe it's me I don't know  
But in the morning there always seems to be some kind of fight  
  
La la la la la  
Well women seem to be so clever  
I love all the jokes that they tell  
Like my last boyfriend really hurt me in bed  
Hey but you seem to fit so well  
Women sure can hurt your feelings  
They can burn you down and not make a sound  
And then they call me up and say hey come over  
My husband has just left town  
  
They tell me all their stories  
We lay awake and laugh all night  
Maybe it's me I don't know  
But in the morning there always seems to be some kind of fight  
  
Women seem to love houses  
I've bought a couple for one or two  
Women seem to think all men are louses  
And I guess I think so too  
Women seem so much smarter  
Than your average Joe  
Women seem to be a little more intuitive  
And when they lie nobody knows  
  
Well women seem to know how to keep a secret  
They don't blabbermouth just for show  
Fifty percent of their charm is illusion  
And that is a good thing to know
