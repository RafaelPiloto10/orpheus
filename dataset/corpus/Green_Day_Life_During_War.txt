Yeah, we say making changes  
Starts in the little things you do  
"Revolution begins at home"  
But for most of us it ends there, too  
We're doing something  
We're making changes  
Like changing the brand of crap we buy  
We say it makes a difference  
But that's just another lie  
It used to be us and them  
And you and me  
And now we can't reach our potential  
Without a common enemy  
A real war to fight against  
Instead of our petty disagreements  
But how can I rationalize  
My life during wartime lie  
A call to action and a reaction  
Taking our lives in our own hands  
Instead of sitting around and talking  
About the same old shitty bands  
But war is going on right now  
And I'm not doing anything about it  
Without a crowd I'm not so loud  
I can't do anything by myself  
But that's just another lie
