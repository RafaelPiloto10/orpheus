They're really rockin' in boston  
Pittsburg, pa.  
Deep in the heart of texas  
And down in frisco bay  
Way over in st. louis  
Down in new orleans  
The cats they wanna dance with  
Sweet little sixteen  
Little sixteen  
Well, she's gotta have  
About half a million  
Half a million autographs  
Oh, but tomorrow morning  
She's got to change her trend  
To be back in the classroom  
She's gotta be back in school again
