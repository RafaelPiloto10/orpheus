Whoever we are  
Wherever we're from  
We shoulda noticed by now  
Our behavior is dumb  
And if our chances  
Expect to improve  
It's gonna take a lot more  
Than tryin' to remove  
The other race  
Or the other whatever  
From the face  
Of the planet altogether  
They call it the earth  
Which is a dumb kinda name  
But they named it right  
'cause we behave the same...  
We are dumb all over  
Dumb all over,  
Yes we are  
Dumb all over,  
Near 'n far  
Dumb all over,  
Black 'n white  
People, we is not wrapped tight  
Nurds on the left  
Nurds on the right  
Religious fanatics  
On the air every night  
Sayin' the bible  
Tells the story  
Makes the details  
Sound real gory  
'bout what to do  
If the geeks over there  
Don't believe in the book  
We got over here  
You can't run a race  
Without no feet  
'n pretty soon  
There won't be no street  
For dummies to jog on  
Or doggies to dog on  
Religious fanatics  
Can make it be all gone  
(I mean it won't blow up  
'n disappear  
It'll just look ugly  
For a thousand years...)  
You can't run a country  
By a book of religion  
Not by a heap  
Or a lump or a smidgeon  
Of foolish rules  
Of ancient date  
Designed to make  
You all feel great  
While you fold, spindle  
And mutilate  
Those unbelievers  
From a neighboring state  
To arms! to arms!  
Hooray! that's great  
Two legs ain't bad  
Unless there's a crate  
They ship the parts  
To mama in  
For souvenirs: two ears (get down!)  
Not his, not hers, (but what the hey? )  
The good book says:  
("it gotta be that way!")  
But their book says:  
"revenge the crusades...  
With whips 'n chains  
'n hand grenades..."  
Two arms? two arms?  
Have another and another  
Our God says:  
"there ain't no other!"  
Our God says  
"it's all okay!"  
Our God says  
"this is the way!"  
It says in the book:  
"burn 'n destroy...  
'n repent, 'n redeem  
'n revenge, 'n deploy  
'n rumble thee forth  
To the land of the unbelieving scum on the other side  
'cause they don't go for what's in the book  
'n that makes 'em bad  
So verily we must choppeth them up  
And stompeth them down  
Or rent a nice french bomb  
To poof them out of existence  
While leaving their real estate just where we need it  
To use again  
For temples in which to praise our god  
("cause he can really take care of business!")  
And when his humble tv servant  
With humble white hair  
And humble glasses  
And a nice brown suit  
And maybe a blond wife who takes phone calls  
Tells us our God says  
It's okay to do this stuff  
Then we gotta do it,  
'cause if we don't do it,  
We ain't gwine up to hebbin!  
(depending on which book you're using at the  
Time...can't use theirs... it don't work  
...it's all lies...gotta use mine...)  
Ain't that right?  
That's what they say  
Every night...  
Every day...  
Hey, we can't really be dumb  
If we're just following god's orders  
Hey, let's get serious...  
God knows what he's doin'  
He wrote this book here  
An' the book says:  
He made us all to be just like him,"  
So...  
If we're dumb...  
Then God is dumb...  
(an' maybe even a little ugly on the side)
