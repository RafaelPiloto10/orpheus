Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot  
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land  
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band  
Now have you seen the harbor cried Marie Christine  
Have you seen the jagged rocks in the waters in between  
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh save me if you can  
For if you do I promise you I'll never sail again  
Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched lot  
Now gather all your photographs and don your coats of blue  
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you  
When at first I saw Marie Christine the woman that she was  
I signed aboard to man her sails and honor well her cause  
I christened her with old champagne and I drove her to the west  
Of all the men who sailed on her, in truth I sailed her best  
Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock  
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot  
Now have you seen the lighthouse, oh we are close to land  
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band  
Now come all you would be sailors  
All you would be sailors, oh, all you would be sailors  
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you  
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine it is you
