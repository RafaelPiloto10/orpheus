Oh, oh, do  
New thoughts  
Will purify my mind  
And clean my body  
New lives  
Will fall together like an endless story  
  
All the love of the universe  
Will be shared by all that's living  
  
And I don't really care  
About tomorrow  
Today  
Is all I really need to find the answers  
  
I'll find the constant flow  
Of all the harmony  
  
Everybody needs a helpin' hand  
Everybody needs a helpin' hand
