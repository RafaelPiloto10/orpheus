Overnight oh, Overnight oh  
  
Verse 1:  
I wish the pain would go away  
I wish they'd find a cure today  
I asked the doctor what it means  
He said "Things ain't as bad as what they seem."  
My heart is working overtime to mend what's broke inside  
And it's hard for me to see the light  
Cause I'm stuck  
At least that's what it feels like  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
So I'm slower to heal  
  
Verse 2:  
It's like I'm in a traffic jam  
(A traffic jam)  
Being pulled out of quicksand  
(Outta quicksand)  
It's like a newly planted tree  
I wish that you could find it in yourself to be patient with me  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
I'm slower to heal  
Slower to heal  
Don't wanna feel the way I feel  
(Don't wanna feel)  
I wish I could kill this pain that I feel  
(Right away)  
But it don't happen that way, never  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
It's not gone happen overnight, overnight, overnight  
I won't get better overnight, overnight, overnight  
So I'm slower to heal
