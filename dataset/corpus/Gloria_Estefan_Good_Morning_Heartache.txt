Good morning, heartache, you ole gloomy sight  
Good morning, heartache, thought we'd said goodbye last night  
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Wish I'd forget you  
But you're here to stay  
It seems I met you  
When my love went away  
Now everyday I start by saying to you  
Good morning, heartache, what's new?  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you, no how  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues  
  
Good morning, heartache, here we go again  
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when  
Might as well get used to you hangin around  
Good morning, heartache, sit down  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you, no how  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues  
  
Good morning, heartache, here we go again  
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when  
Might as well get used to you hangin around  
Good morning, heartache, sit down
