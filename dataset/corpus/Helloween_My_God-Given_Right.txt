Why should i wait, what is left there for me?  
I come to claim  
To win the game  
Why should i plea for my fair and right move?  
I come to play  
I come to stay  
  
I don't wanna bitch around no more  
I don't wanna stand back anymore  
  
Its my god-given right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
It's my god-given brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
There's nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
There's nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
It's my right  
My god-given right  
  
Why should i lose if i am meant to win?  
I know i can  
I've got a plan  
All that they told me is right and so wrong  
I went through schools  
Found my own rules  
  
I don't wanna bitch around no more  
I don't wanna stand back anymore  
  
It's my god-given right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
It's my god-given brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
There's nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
There's nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
It's my right  
  
My god-given right  
It's my god-given right  
My god-given right  
It's my god-given right  
  
It's my god-given right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
It's my god-given brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
There's nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
There's nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
It's my right  
My god-given right
