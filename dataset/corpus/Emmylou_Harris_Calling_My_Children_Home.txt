Those lives were mine to love and cherish  
To guard and guide along life's way  
Oh God forbid that one should perish  
That one alas should go astray  
Back in the years with all together  
Around the place we'd romp and play  
So lonely now I oft' times wonder  
Oh will they come back home some day  
  
I'm lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling, calling  
and come back home some day  
  
I gave my all for my dear children  
Their problems still with love I share,  
I'd brave life's storm, defy the tempest  
To bring them home from anywhere  
I lived my life my love I gave them,  
to guide them through this world of strife,  
I hope and pray we'll live together  
In that great glad here after life  
  
I'm lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling, calling  
and come back home some day
