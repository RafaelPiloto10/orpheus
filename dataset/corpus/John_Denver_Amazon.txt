There is a river that runs from the mountains  
That one river is all rivers  
All rivers are that one  
  
There is a tree that stands in the forest  
That one tree is all forests  
All trees are that one  
  
There is a flower that blooms in the desert  
That one blossom is all flowers  
All flowers are that one  
  
There is a bird that sings in the jungle  
That one song is all music  
All songs are that one  
  
It is the song of life  
It is the flower of faith  
It is the tree of temptation  
It is the river of no regret  
  
There is a child that cries in the ghetto  
That one child is all children  
All children are that one  
  
There is a vision that shines in the darkness  
That one vision is all of our dreams  
  
It is a vision of heaven  
It is a child of promise  
It is the song of life  
It is the river of no regret  
  
Let this be a voice for the mountains  
Let this be a voice for the river  
Let this be a voice for the forest  
Let this be a voice for the flowers  
Let this be a voice for the ocean  
Let this be a voice for the desert  
Let this be a voice for the children  
Let this be a voice for the dreamers  
Let this be a voice of no regret
