At the end of the rainbow there's happiness,  
And to find it how often I've tried,  
But my life is a race, just a wild goose chase,  
And my dreams have all been denied.  
Why have I always been a failure?  
What can the reason be?  
I wonder if the world's to blame,  
I wonder if it could be me.  
Chorus:  
I'm always chasing rainbows,  
Watching clouds drifting by,  
My dreams are just like all my schemes,  
Ending in the sky.  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine,  
I always look and find the rain.  
Some fellows make a winning sometime,  
I never even make a gain, believe me,  
I'm always chasing rainbows,  
I'm watching for a little bluebird in vain.
