[Verse 1]  
First you love me and I let you in  
Made me feel like I was born again  
You empowered me, you made me strong  
Built me up and I could do no wrong  
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms  
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms  
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark  
I was blind to your game  
You fired a shot at my heart  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Took me to heaven, let me fall down  
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on  
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble  
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
Living for love, I'm living for love  
I'm not giving up  
I'm gonna carry on  
Living for love, I'm living for love  
Not gonna stop  
Love's gonna lift me up  
  
[Dance Break]  
Love, lift me up  
Love's gonna lift me up  
Love, lift me up  
  
[Verse 2]  
I could get caught up in bitterness  
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess  
I found freedom in the ugly truth  
I deserve the best and it's not you  
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down  
That have fallen apart, what was lost, now I'm found  
I picked up my crown, put it back on my head  
I can forgive, but I will never forget  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Took me to heaven, let me fall down  
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on  
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble  
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
Living for love, I'm living for love  
I'm not giving up  
I'm gonna carry on  
Living for love, I'm living for love  
Not gonna stop  
Love's gonna lift me up  
  
[Dance Break]  
Love, lift me up  
Love's gonna lift me up  
Love, lift me up  
  
[Bridge]  
Love's gonna lift me up  
Lift me up...  
Love's gonna lift me up  
Up-up-up-up  
Lord help me up-up-up-up  
Love's gonna lift me up  
Up-up-up-up  
Lord help me up-up-up-up  
Love's gonna lift me up  
Lord help me up-up-up-up  
  
[Chorus]  
Living for love, I'm living for love  
I'm not giving up  
I'm gonna carry on  
Living for love, I'm living for love  
Not gonna stop  
Love's gonna lift me up  
  
[Outro]  
(Love, love, love, oh-oh)
