I thought that you'd be loving me  
I thought you were the one who'd stay forever  
But now forever has come and gone  
And I'm still here alone  
Cause you were only playing  
You were only playing with my heart  
I was never waiting  
I was never waiting for the tears to start  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
It was you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was, it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh, I never should've trusted you  
  
I thought that I'd be all you need  
In your eyes I thought I saw my heaven  
And now my heaven's gone away  
And I'm out in the cold  
Cause you had me believing  
You had me believing in a lie  
Guess I couldn't see it  
Guess I couldn't see it 'til I saw "Good-bye"  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
It was you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was, it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh, I never should've trusted you  
  
Cause you were only playing,  
You were only playing with my heart.  
I was never waiting, I was never waiting for the tears to start.  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me.  
It was you who, it was you who put those clouds around me.  
It was you who made the tears fall down.  
Only you, who broke my heart in pieces.  
It was you, it was you who made my blue eyes blue.  
  
Oh, I never should've trusted you. [Repeat x4]
