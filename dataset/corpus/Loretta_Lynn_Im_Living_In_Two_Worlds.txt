I'm living in two worlds dividing my time  
Unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine  
  
When I'm in your world I just pretend  
That I'm really happy though I don't fit in  
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone  
I'm living in two worlds where do I belong  
I'm living in two worlds...  
  
Old friends in your world are new friends to me  
So I can't take part in your old memories  
Our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same  
We both have our own worlds and neither can change  
I'm living in two worlds...
