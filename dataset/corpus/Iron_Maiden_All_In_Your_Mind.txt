Look inside your head and find, tell me now and it's all in your mind  
Look inside your head and find a way deep inside and it's all in your mind  
  
It's all in your mind  
It's all in your mind  
  
Revolution, air pollution, Chairman Mao Tse Tung is in your mind  
"But he's dead pal... He's not very well anyway..."  
A new day breaking-people hating  
Love's a dream and it's all in your mind  
  
Segregation, preservation, politicians all are in your mind  
Pewter suta, Karma Sutra, even Blanckenheimer's in your mind  
  
Yes...  
  
It's all in your mind  
It's all in your mind
