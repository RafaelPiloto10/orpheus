You don't know how bad it's been  
Since you been gone  
Let me tell you how bad it's been  
Since you been gone  
People speak but I don't hear  
Things all around seem to be unclear  
I don't know  
What will become of the love you turned off  
What will become of the need you turned off  
  
Loneliness is just a word  
That's very cold  
People stare but they don't see  
All of the hurt that's inside me  
I don't know
