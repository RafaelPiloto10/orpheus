You called me country Willie  
The night you walked away  
With the one who promised you a life of joy  
You thought my life too simple  
And your was much too gay  
To spend it living with a country boy  
I'm writing you this letter  
I write you every day  
I hope that you've received the ones before  
But I've heard not one word from you  
And every day I pray  
That you will not forget your country boy  
While you're living in the city  
With riches round your door  
Is this your love  
Is this your kind of joy  
Or do you find  
There's something missing  
Does your heart cry out for more  
And do you sometimes miss your country boy  
  
A cottage in the country  
With roses round the door  
Could not compete  
With flashing city lights  
But it's all I have to offer  
Except for one thing more  
A heart so filled with love  
That it could die  
Well it's time to end this letter  
The light of dawn is near  
A lonely night has passed  
But there'll be more  
Just one more thing in closing  
For all the world to hear  
Come home I love you  
Signed your country boy
