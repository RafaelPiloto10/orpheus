Calling all angels  
I need you near to the ground  
I miss you dearly  
Can you hear me on your cloud?  
  
All of my life  
I've been waiting for someone to love  
All of my life  
I've been waiting for something to love  
  
Calling all angels  
I need you near to the ground  
I have been kneeling  
And praying to hear a sound  
  
All of my life  
I've been waiting for someone to love  
All of my life  
I've been waiting for something to love  
  
Day by day  
Through the years  
Make my way  
  
Day by day  
Through the years  
  
Day by day  
Through the years  
Day by day  
Through the years  
Day by day  
Make my way  
  
Day by day  
Through the years  
Day by day  
Day by day
