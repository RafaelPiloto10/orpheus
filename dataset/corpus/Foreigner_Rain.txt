Brother, always reaching far too high  
But I can see the tragic side, and it ain't easy  
And brother you won't let anybody help  
Why do you sacrifice yourself?  
You can't go on this way  
  
Tell me why, oh why?  
Why don't you open up your heart?  
Let the light from inside  
Show us who you are  
  
And when it looks like rain  
And when the dark clouds fill your sky  
There ain't no good reason why  
You've got to feel the pain  
  
Even when it looks like rain  
Just hold your head up high  
I know the sun's gonna shine  
Even when it looks like rain  
  
Hey sister, another story must be told  
Just count the blessings you still hold  
What's done is done  
Hey sister, you can find the one you need  
Don't have to live the life you lead  
Don't be the lonely one  
  
Tell me why, oh why?  
Why don't you open up your heart?  
Let the light from inside  
Show us who you are  
  
And when it looks like rain  
And when the dark clouds fill your sky  
There ain't no good reason why  
You've got to feel the pain  
Even when it looks like rain  
Just hold your head up high  
I know the sun's gonna shine, oooh  
  
Don't get down and don't get washed away, oooh  
Just remind yourself every day  
That into each life  
A little rain must fall  
  
So let it rain  
Rain, oooh  
Even when it looks like rain  
Just hold your head up high  
  
I know the sun's gonna shine  
Even when it looks like rain  
Rain, rain, rain  
When it looks like rain...
