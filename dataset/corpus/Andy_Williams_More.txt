More than the greatest love the world has known  
This is the love I give to you alone  
More than the simplest words I try to say  
I only live to love you more each day  
More than you'll never know my arms long to hold your soul  
My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping  
Longer than always is long long time,  
But far beyond forever you'll be mine  
I know I never live before and my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more  
I know I never live before and my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more
