Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
  
Sometimes you love her  
Sometimes you don't  
Sometimes you need it then you don't and you let go  
  
Sometimes we rush it  
Sometimes we fall  
It doesn't matter baby we can take it real slow  
  
'Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny  
And the way that you move oh you make me feel alive  
Come on  
  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
You try to hide it  
I know you do  
When are you ready? Need up come and get to  
  
You move me closer  
I feel you breathe  
It's like the rose disappears when you around me, oh  
  
'Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny, oh yeah  
And the way that you move oh you make me feel alive  
So come on  
  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
  
Say you want, say you need  
I can do by your face know the way it turns me on  
  
I say you want, I say you need  
I will do all your things, I would never do you wrong  
  
'Cause the way that we love is something that we can't fight, oh yeah  
I just can't get enough, oh you make me feel alive, so come on  
  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Say you want say you need  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Ring my bell, ring my bells  
Say you want say you need  
Ring my bell, ring my bells
