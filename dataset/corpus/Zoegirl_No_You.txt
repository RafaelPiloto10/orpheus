Feeling so crazy lately  
When it seems that You're not around  
The sun and the moon shine bright  
But my eyes are all Yours now  
Don't know how I lived with out You  
I don't remember how it used to feel  
Lord, I can't imagine if I had no You to hold me  
  
[Chorus]  
Where would I go with no You to run to  
No You to hold me when I am afraid?  
Who would I be with no You beside me?  
I ought to know it by now without You there's no me  
Oh, there's no me  
  
Lord, when I need You, You're always here  
To play through the laughter, love through the tears  
And when my heart seems so far away  
Into Your arms is where I wanna stay  
I try to find the words to tell You  
All the things my heart's been telling me  
I don't wanna know how it feels to have no You to love me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where would I go with no You to run to?  
No You to hold me when I am afraid?  
Where would I be with no You beside me?  
I ought to know it by now without you  
  
[Chorus]
