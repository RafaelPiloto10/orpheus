Back in the tomb, Lucy is sitting on the floor  
I am, I am standing by the door  
  
The door to freedom the door that I shut so close  
And as I take another look at my mind  
I seem to think the sun has arrived, no  
  
McKenzie you better realize, now it's just you and I  
  
Back against the wall  
McKenzie's on the stone cold floor  
Hands tied together, nowhere to go for Mr. Mayor  
  
The door to freedom the door that I shut so close  
And as I take another look at my mind  
I seem to think the sun has arrived  
  
This court is now in session  
  
You stand accused of child abuse  
Of stealing innocence and freedom too  
  
I am the only Judge, I am the only Jury  
I am your lawyer too, so tell me what to do  
  
What's it gonna be ?  
Are you guilty or are you guilty!  
Yes, you just go ahead and cry  
  
Back against the wall  
McKenzie's on the stone cold floor  
Hands tied together, nowhere to go for Mr. Mayor  
  
The door to freedom the door that I shut so close  
And as I take another look at my mind  
I seem to think the sun has arrived  
  
But oh no, there is no sun here  
There's only darkness  
  
I, the jury and the judge  
Find you guilty of stealing the innocence of a child  
And therefore we sentence you to die slowly, die  
Die die die die die die die
