The heart of the ocean told me, you're the only one  
You're like a rose in the snow, and you need the sun  
And my heart is crying, when your love is dying  
What have I got to do  
And I'm tossing and turning, my heart is burning  
We're more than two  
  
You're my cosmic girl, you are in my mind  
And a girl like you, is so hard to find  
You're my cosmic girl, from rainbow two  
And to hell and back, I will go for you  
Oh cosmic girl come hear my heart  
I'll never try to break apart  
Oh cosmic girl, give me some time  
I swear you're always on my mind  
  
You are like the sunshine and I kiss away the rain  
I tell you I miss you baby can't we be friends  
Let's stay together, here and forever  
It's good for me, good for you  
The heart of the ocean, is always in motion  
What can I do?
