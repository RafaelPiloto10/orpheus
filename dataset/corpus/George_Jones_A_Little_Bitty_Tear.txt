When you said you were leaving tomorrow that today was our last day  
I said there would be no sorrow then I'd laugh when you walked away  
But a little bitty tear let me down spoiled my act as a clown  
I had it made up not to make a frown oh but a little bitty tear let me down  
  
I said I would laugh when you left me full of funny as you went out the door  
That I'd have another was a waiting yes to wave goodbye as you go  
But a little bitty tear let me down...  
  
Everything went like I planned it and I really put on quite a show  
And in my heart I felt I could stand it till you walked with your grip through
the door  
And a little bitty tear let me down...  
A little bitty tear let me down a little bitty tear let me down
