Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.  
  
Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,  
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.  
  
I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.  
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see  
the doctor anyway.  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.  
  
I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow  
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,  
And that would never never do  
  
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.  
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.
