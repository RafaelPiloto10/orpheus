I've been up all night, you've been puttin' up a fight.  
Seems like nothin' I say gets through.  
How did this old bed fit a world between me and you.  
We said "Goodnight" but the silence was so thick  
You could cut it with a knife.  
We've hit the wall again and there's nothin' I can do.  
You're the one, yea, I've put all my trust in your hands.  
C'mon and look in my eyes, here I am, here I am  
  
You don't understand me, my baby.  
You don't seem to know that I need you so much.  
You don't understand me, my feelings,  
The reason I'm breathin', my love  
  
The mornin' comes and you're reaching out for me  
Just like everything's the same  
And I let myself believe things are gonna change.  
When you kiss my mouth and you hold my body close,  
Do you wonder who's inside?  
Maybe there's no way we could feel each other's pain.  
Tell me why it gets harder to know where I stand.  
I guess loneliness found a new friend, here I am  
  
You don't understand me  
  
You don't seem to get me, my baby.  
You don't really see that I live for your touch.  
You don't understand me, my dreams or the things I believe in, my love.  
You don't understand me. You don't understand me. Understand me.
