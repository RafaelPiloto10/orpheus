Listen good  
Don't cry for me  
Don't cry anymore  
  
Now just shut your mouth  
This point of view  
Appeals to me  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
Same old smile  
That cracked a thousand hearts  
But not mine  
  
Same old line  
I've read the book  
And I know you well  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
What's this feeling  
That I don't believe  
No concern on my face  
  
What's it for  
You dream of something  
Like I dreamed of you  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight
