That woman will take you, that woman will break you  
That woman will make you something you've never seen  
That woman's got claws, that woman's got laws  
Now look out man, you're gonna loose your mind  
  
I had a friend, his name was Frank  
He walked on the water and lord he sank  
We used to go stag, now he's got a hag  
It looks like Frank's got a new bag  
  
That woman will take you, that woman will break you  
That woman will make you something you've never seen  
That woman's got claws, that woman's got laws  
Now look out Frank, you're gonna loose your mind  
  
What happened to Frank, can happen to you  
Just find you a woman and watch what she'll do  
That woman will take you, that woman's gonna break you  
Look out man you're gonna loose, you're gonna loose your mind
