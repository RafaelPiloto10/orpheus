I see you finally found a set of rules  
That came inside her game, boy  
You were so young and very proud  
It's hard believin' you're the same, boy  
  
Did she take you so deep into the night  
And promise you a piece of her heart  
Make it feel so good, feel so right  
Then turn around and tear you apart?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know  
She did the same thing  
I know  
She did the same thing  
I know  
She did the same thing to me, oh yeah  
  
She plays upon your dreams and fantasies  
As if she's come to stay there  
But in your life you never dreamed  
You'd find the one who'd know the way there  
  
She'll take you so deep into the night  
And promise you'll be satisfied  
Like a fool you believe all her lies  
Words you'll remember till the end of your life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The same thing to me  
She did the same thing to me  
The same thing to me  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
The same thing to me
