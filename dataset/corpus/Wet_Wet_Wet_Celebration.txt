Modern love  
It's a funny thing  
It's full of diamonds  
And a pretty ring  
But it's gonna get me  
Oh it's gonna get me  
Get me so down  
  
Summer loving  
Makes me freeze  
It leaves me standing  
In a cold, cold breeze  
So I'm gonna get me  
Get me outa town and stop wasting time  
  
Everytime I look into her eyes  
They're filled with such emotion  
They're filled with such emotion  
I don't want to keep on waiting starting my own celebration  
  
Sisters loving  
It's a strong, strong thing  
It's never ending  
And I don't need no diamond ring  
But it won't leave them  
In a cold cold time  
These are difficult times to be celebrating
