(Shirley Eikhard)  
Darkness falls and you withdraw  
Your humour disappears  
It's been this way for years  
It's nothing new  
Come around and don't look down  
You'll never see the sun  
You'll never see the one  
Who's loving you  
You've got to hold your head up, darling  
Never let them see  
When you're sad, you look a lot like me  
You've got to want to win my darling  
Or you're bound to lose  
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news  
Now I don't care for sad affairs,  
The outcome's up to you  
If tears are overdue, then let them fall...  
Come around and don't look down  
You'll never see the sun  
You'll never see the one  
Who's loving you  
You've got to hold your head up, darling  
Never let them see  
When you're sad, you look a lot like me  
You've got to want to win my darling  
Or you're bound to lose  
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news  
You've got to want to win my darling  
Or you're bound to lose  
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news  
Good news
