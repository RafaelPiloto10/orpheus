Where were you when it happened?  
Where could you be found?  
Were you at the front of the stage?  
Or in the underground  
  
From SF out to Old Bridge  
NY back to LA  
The world of metal changed forever  
Back in the day  
Well that was back in the day  
  
And if you weren't there  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Because you wouldn't understand  
Live to die and die to play  
Every day and place  
Leave a path of metal  
Across the world from stage to stage  
Well that was back in the day  
  
And if you weren't there  
It doesn't matter anyway  
Because you wouldn't understand  
In denim and leather  
We were all part of one force  
Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass  
And put metal on the course  
  
Higher!  
Higher!  
Higher!  
Higher!  
  
Back in the day  
You weren't there  
It doesn't mater  
Because you wouldn't understand  
This is our way of life  
A life that was born free  
To follow orders how to live  
Was never meant to be  
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  
Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting  
  
The power hits the stage  
The music was exciting  
The mania raged  
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  
We all had the fever  
Our ears started to ring  
Feeding this wildfire  
Consuming everything  
  
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  
Metal's King back then  
And still is this today  
Others imitate or challenge  
But it never goes away  
On, oh-oh, oh-oh
