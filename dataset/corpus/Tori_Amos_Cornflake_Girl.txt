Never was a cornflake girl  
Thought that was a good solution  
Hangin with the raisin girls  
She's gone to the other side  
Givin us a yo heave ho  
Things are getting kind of gross  
And I go at sleepy time  
This is not really happening  
You bet your life it is  
  
Peel out the watchword just peel out the watchword  
  
She knows what's going on  
Seems we got a cheaper feel now  
All the sweeteaze are gone  
Gone to the other side  
With my encyclopedia  
They musta paid her a nice price  
She's puttin on her string bean love  
This is not really happening  
You bet your life it is  
  
Rabbit where'd you put the keys girl  
And the Man With The Golden Gun  
Thinks he knows so much  
Thinks he knows so much  
Rabbit where'd you put the keys girl
