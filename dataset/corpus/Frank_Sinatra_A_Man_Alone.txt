In me you see a man alone.Held by the habit of being on his own.A man who
listens to the trembling of the trees.With sentimental ease. In me you see a
man alone.Behind the wall he's learned to call his home.A man who still goes
walking in the rain.Expecting love again. A man not lonely.Except when the
dark comes on.A man learning to live with. memories of midnights.That fell
apart at dawn. In me you see a man alone.Drinking up Sundays and spending them
alone.Aman who knows love is seldom what it seems.Just other people's dreams
