The earth may change from Summer green to Winter white  
The brightest day can change into the darkest night.  
A grey cloud may change a sky of blue  
But nothing ever changes my love for you  
  
A gentle breeze can blow into a hurricane  
A happy song can change into a sad refrain  
The oak leaf will fall when autumns through  
But nothing ever changes my love for you  
  
Time will alter Gibraltor the seas may run dry  
But you'll see that we'll be the same you and I  
A million things are bound to change as time goes on  
A million springs will come and go and when there gone  
My darling the thrill will still be new  
For nothing ever changes my love for you.  
  
My darling the thrill will still be new  
For nothing ever changes my love for you  
For nothing ever changes my love for you.
