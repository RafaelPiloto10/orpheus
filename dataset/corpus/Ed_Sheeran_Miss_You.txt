Shock horror,  
I'm down,  
Lost your not around,  
There's a lump in my chest that,  
Sends cold through my head and,  
My mind shuts sound out,  
I'm on auto pilot,  
And my tongue's gone silent,  
  
Just switch it off and lay it down,  
Lay it down,  
Next to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
And I miss you,  
  
These words mean nothing to me,  
I'm just sitting on a fence of  
How it used to be,  
These three words,  
Are aching,  
Constrict them, Suffocating  
My mind is racing with the picture I'm painting,  
And my belly's sick to it's stomach,  
When I remember all the times he was with you when you,  
  
Layed it down,  
You lay down,  
Next to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
  
More than I let on,  
And I kissed you,  
For far too long,  
I'll let go,  
As soon as you do,  
But I know,  
That we're not through  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
That I miss you,  
(Woahhh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you.
