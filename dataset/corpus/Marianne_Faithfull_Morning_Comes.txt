When will the morning come?  
I wait in darkness so long.  
Will the sun ever rise again?  
  
Hours flowing over me  
I wait in vain for some change.  
Will light ever pierce this pain?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast.  
  
How will the morning be?  
I watched the dawn in my dreams  
And imagined the day for years.  
Shall I feel warmth again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast.  
  
Tell me please,  
  
How will it come  
This release,  
A crack in the door.  
  
Shall I feel warm again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears?  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea.  
Morning light shine on me.  
  
Oh, tell me please, how will she come  
Surrounding me, the opening door?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea.  
Morning light shine on me.  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east...
