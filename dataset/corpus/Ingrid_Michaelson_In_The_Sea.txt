I feel it in my skin, I feel it through my bones  
Your fingertips are falling far from where I know  
I try to pin you down but you move like a dream  
I want to find you but you dropped me in the sea  
  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
You dropped me  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
No no don't rescue me  
I like the salt water sting  
It feels so good to feel  
It feels so good just to feel something  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
You move so softly in the middle of the night  
Like a cocoon in sheets you wrap you up so tight  
Remember how we used to tangle up and breathe  
Now you're so far away you roll me in the sea  
  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
You dropped me  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
No no don't rescue me  
I like the salt water sting  
It feels so good to feel  
It feels so good just to feel something  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea  
  
Oh oh oh  
  
No no don't rescue me  
I like the salt water sting  
It feels so good to feel  
It feels so good just to feel something  
In the sea in the sea in the sea in the sea
