Lucille, won't you do your sister's will?  
Oh, Lucille, won't you do your sister's will?  
Well, you ran away and left, I love you still.  
Lucille, please, come back where you belong.  
  
Oh, Lucille, please, come back where you belong.  
I been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone.  
Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart.  
Oh, Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart.  
  
I slaved for you, baby, and gave you such a wonderful start.  
I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight.  
I asked her friends about her but all their lips were tight.  
  
Lucille, please, come back where you belong.  
I been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone.
