I'm through with you.  
Don't care what you say or do.  
I'm through with you.  
You saw our shirts on MTV.  
You say how could this be.  
Betrayed you throw yours away.  
You throw it all away.  
  
I've had it up to here  
And now I just don't care  
Don't care what you think of us.  
We're sick of you.  
  
Don't support us anymore  
Cause we played warped tour  
Say we turned our backs on you  
  
That's not the fucking truth  
It's more work then you'll ever know  
Some say we don't have much to show  
There's records, cds and magazines  
That's immortality.  
  
Oh  
What are they thinking  
What a scam I believed in that band  
How could they play for such kids.  
  
Say I'll play when I want  
To who I want fuck you.  
Your not the one to tell me  
What to do what to do.  
  
We're so sick of you
