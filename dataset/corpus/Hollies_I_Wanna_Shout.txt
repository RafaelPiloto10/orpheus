Do you find it hard to tell me  
To tell that you really love me  
'cause I find it hard to tell you  
To tell you that I really love you  
  
And I know what's in your heart  
In your mind, in your body, and your soul  
But it's easy when we whisper  
Not letting people know.  
  
We want to shout it out loud  
But we can't let people know  
We want to shout it out loud  
But our love is not for show  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've got something you've got nothing  
A child, a home of my own  
It's so hard for me to break it  
I can't break it, I can't make it on my own  
  
[Chorus:] x2
