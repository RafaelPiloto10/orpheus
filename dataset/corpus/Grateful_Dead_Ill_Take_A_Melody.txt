I've seen the rain pouring down  
The sky was gray with a speck of blue  
Peek through a hole in the clouds  
The sun was screaming, "Hey, you!"  
  
As you ramble through your sorrow  
Seem like everything come out wrong  
I'm living in yesterdays tomorrows  
I know something's helping me along  
  
I'll take a melody  
And see what I can do about it  
I'll take a simple C to G  
And feel brand new about it  
  
I understand why the old fishermen  
Sail along, sail along, sail along  
Sail along, sail along  
Someday he'll be gone  
  
I hear you talking about your troubles  
Everybody's got their troubles too  
You can make them burst like bubbles  
If you know just what to do  
  
You know I've been called a dreamer  
Dreams that never come true  
But I've been called so many things before  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
  
I'll take a melody  
And see what I can do about it  
I'll take a simple C to G  
And feel brand new about it  
  
I understand why the old fishermen  
Sail along, sail along, sail along  
Sail along, sail along  
Someday he'll be gone  
  
I'll take a melody  
And see what I can do about it  
I'll take a simple C to G  
And feel brand new about it  
  
Shine on, keep on shining  
Shine on, keep on shining  
Shine on, keep on shining  
...
