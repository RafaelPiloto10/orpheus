Feeling light-headed as I caught her eye,  
She was inviting as I passed her by.  
Losing all freedom,  
I fell to the ground.  
She took me home later  
And made me see why.  
When you look through a haze,  
And you're out on a line,  
You just can't satisfy when you're down  
On that moonshine.  
Held back my temptation,  
Trying to please her,  
But still I could not stand.  
As morning dawned,  
The feeling returned  
As I lay alone with the lesson I learned.  
When you look through a haze,  
And you're out on a line,  
You just can't satisfy when you're down  
On that moonshine.
