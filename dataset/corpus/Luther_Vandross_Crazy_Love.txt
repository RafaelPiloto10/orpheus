We can't change the way we were  
But we can change the way we are  
All I really wanted  
From this crazy love  
Was a night so full of stars  
That our hearts could not pretend  
Oh what I wouldn't give  
To have that crazy love again  
I believe in second chances  
And I'm holding on for sure  
To your crazy love  
To your crazy love  
Crazy love  
I lived my l life for you  
But now I'm left with me  
Hanging on to pieces  
Of what used to be  
And no matter how I try  
When I feel another's touch  
It brings me back to why  
I miss our crazy love so much  
I believe in second chances  
And I'm holding on for sure  
To your crazy love  
To your crazy love  
Crazy love  
Yes I believe in second chances  
And I'm holding on for sure  
To our crazy love  
It was crazy love
