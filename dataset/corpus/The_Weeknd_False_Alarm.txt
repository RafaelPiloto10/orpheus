[Verse 1]  
Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (she loves)  
High heel shoes with the open toes (she loves)  
She's got a good time wrapped in gold (she loves)  
For you, for you  
All red dress with the devil eyes (she loves)  
So obsessed with the camera lights (she loves)  
You love her, but you can't deny (she loves)  
The truth, the truth  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She loves everybody  
Can't you tell by the signs?  
She loves everybody  
She gets off all the time  
It's a dark philosophy  
And it haunts her constantly  
It's a false alarm to me  
She's a false alarm  
[Chorus]  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Six inch long, 'bout three inch wide (she loves)  
Dolla, dolla bill is her only type (she loves)  
You love her but you'll never be (she loves)  
The one, the one  
Diamonds and the rings are her fantasy (she loves)  
She chase hearts with the Hennessy (she loves)  
You love her, but you'll never be (she loves)  
Enough, enough  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
She loves everybody  
Can't you tell by the signs?  
She loves everybody  
She gets off all the time  
It's a dark philosophy  
And it haunts her constantly  
She's a false alarm to me  
She's a false alarm  
  
[Chorus]  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
  
[Bridge]  
She always leaves the man she loves  
But the diamonds are forever  
She always seems to be alone  
But the diamonds make it better  
  
[Chorus]  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey)  
False alarm (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
