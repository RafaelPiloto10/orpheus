As a dancer she's undercover  
Won the Big Don to be her lover  
Had to make him tell her his secrets  
About his business and about his street-rats  
  
She had to become his trustful right hand  
The burean needed the files with his brand  
She really was a damn good actress  
Everybody called her 'Big Don's Mistress'  
  
Oh, it's just a show  
Put on for love  
How could he know  
  
Liar, liar  
Sweet desire  
Liar, liar  
Who are you  
  
She sent the messages through her office  
The Don reckoned he will face a judas  
So he told her of a damned deceiver  
Secured, in her he was a strong believer  
  
He confessed to her being sick of all this  
How he suffered in the deepest abyss  
But saw in her the wish for a new life  
To escape from there and make her his wife  
  
No, not just a show  
Put on for love  
How could he know  
  
Liar, liar  
Sweet desire  
Liar, liar  
Who are you  
  
Liar, liar  
Play with fire  
Liar, liar  
Learn the truth  
  
It had turned somehow  
She had not seen how  
Felt the bullet still flying  
Straight went into her heart  
Tore her old world apart  
Now to live on she first had to die  
  
There's a reason to live  
There's a reason to live and let die  
There's a reason to give  
There's a reason to give in a lie  
  
Liar, liar  
Sweet desire  
Liar, liar  
Learn the truth  
  
Liar, liar  
Sweet desire  
Liar, liar  
Who are you  
  
Liar, liar  
Play with fire  
Liar, liar  
You learned your truth now
