I am the voice  
I am the radio  
You hear me loud and clear  
Across the open sky  
  
Into the night  
You hear me loud and clear  
I was thinking you're a part of my mind  
Breathing sleeping talking two of a kind  
  
I'm the voice in your head  
(do you read me)  
The word you just said  
(do you hear me)  
  
Aah - the world goes spinning around  
Aah - and you all join in with the sound  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
  
I feel the pain  
I feel the joy and love  
You hear it loud and clear  
But should the music stop  
  
I'll feel so low  
I'll fade and disappear  
I'm just thinking that we're two of a kind  
Think I know what's going on in your mind  
  
When the red light goes on  
(can you tell me)  
Is your green light still on  
(do your hear me)  
  
Aah - the world goes spinning around  
Aah - and you all join in with the sound  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
The world goes spinning around  
Aah - we all join in with the sound  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
Like a world radio  
  
We join in with the sound  
The world goes spinning, spinning around  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
  
Aah - we sing with one voice  
We're a world radio  
Radio  
Is the green light on  
(can you tell me)  
Don't put your red light on  
(do you read me)  
I know the green light's on  
Don't put, don't put your red light on  
Is the green light on
