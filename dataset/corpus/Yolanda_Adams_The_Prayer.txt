I pray you'll be our eyes  
And watch us where we go  
And help us to be wise  
In times when we don't know  
  
Let this be our prayer  
When we lose our way  
Lead us to a place  
Guide us with your grace  
To a place where we'll be safe.  
  
I pray we'll find your light.  
I pray we'll find your light  
  
And hold it in our hearts  
And hold it in our hearts  
  
And stars go out each night  
Stars go out each night  
  
Remind us where you are.  
Remind us where you are.  
  
Let this be our prayer  
Y: Let this be our prayer  
  
When shadows fill our day  
When shadows fill our day  
  
Lead us to a place  
  
Guide us with your grace  
Guide us with your grace  
  
Give us faith so we'll be safe.  
  
A world where pain and sorrow will be ended  
And every heart that's broken will be mended  
And we'll remember we are all God's children  
Reaching out to touch you  
Reaching to the sky.  
  
We ask that life be kind  
We ask that life be kind  
  
And watch us from above  
And watch us from above  
  
We hope each soul will find  
We hope each soul will find  
  
Another soul to love  
Another soul to love.  
  
Let this be our prayer  
Let this be our prayer  
  
Just like every child.  
Just like every child.  
  
Needs to find a place  
Guide us with your grace  
Give us faith so we'll be safe.
