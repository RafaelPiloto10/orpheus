Here's a song about jellyman kelly,  
He loves jelly the most.  
Ah, but most of all,  
Jellyman kelly loves jelly on toast.  
  
And here's the part about jenny mulhenny,  
She's a fireman's daughter.  
Yeah, but most of all,  
Jenny mulhenny loves to boil hot water  
  
Jenny put the kettle on, jellyman kelly,  
Can he come home, jenny, can he come?  
Jenny put the kettle on, jellyman kelly,  
Can he come home, jenny, can he come?  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, can he come home, jenny,  
Can he come home, jenny can he come?  
Oh, can he come home, jenny  
Can he come home, jenny, can he come?  
  
Yada yada yada voo doo papa  
Yodely doo  
Da voody doo doo doo  
Yaka yaka yaka yaka hum hon no  
(repeat chorus)  
That's the story about jellyman kelly-he still loves jelly!  
And yes and maybe someday you and me, friend,  
We can have tea with him!  
(repeat chorus)
