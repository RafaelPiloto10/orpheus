I see them all smiling  
Those all around me  
Tend to my wounds and alert my senses  
It would be nice  
I'm not here  
I'm dreaming  
Holding on  
  
Time has no meaning  
All of it wasted  
Smothers till there is no more air  
When will it be that I can breathe again  
I'm waiting in the void  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo)  
  
This notion of needing had held me ransom  
And all I can do is avoid my mind  
Don't make me speak or hear or look  
Because I'm hurting  
Help me out  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) I'm in limbo  
Limbo  
  
I'm getting tired  
I'm getting tired  
  
Caught in a crossfire  
Nobody gets it  
I'm finding it hard to contain myself  
Take all my trust and faith and hope  
until I need it once again  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) I'm lost in limbo  
(Limbo) I'm in limbo  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) I'm lost in limbo  
(Limbo) I'm in limbo  
  
Limbo
