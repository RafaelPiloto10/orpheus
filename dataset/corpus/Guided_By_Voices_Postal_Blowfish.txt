Noticing the change we are taking time  
Everybody knows everybody's fine  
And we'll figure out our purpose in the end  
Unless we have to jump, unless we have to swim  
  
Hold you tongue, brace yourself  
Give me a kiss show me what I miss  
  
Can I find a phone can I drop a dime  
Can I get a loan, runing out of time  
And I've have a toast to what it's all about  
[unknown]  
  
Hold you tongue brace yourself  
Give me a kiss you show me what I miss  
[unknown]  
  
Postal blowfish
