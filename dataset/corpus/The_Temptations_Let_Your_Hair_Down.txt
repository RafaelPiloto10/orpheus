Lady luck and a 4 leaf clover  
Wanting this hurt I feel all over  
My life was one special occasion  
Till your leavin' ended the situation  
That's why I'm standin' on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standin' on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
My car got repossessed this morning  
Hardest times I've seen in years  
Lord, you got to throw me a life preserver  
Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears  
That's why I'm standin' on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standin' on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down
