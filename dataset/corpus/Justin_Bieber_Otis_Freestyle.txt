[Verse 1: justin bieber]  
Damn damn j.b, where the hell you been  
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds  
2 big face rollies, no I ain't lyin'  
Making momma so proud that she cryin'  
Yeah you say I'm crazy? guess that makes two  
But I never knew that dreams really came true  
Started playing drums, when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan, kung-fu  
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating  
I swear otis redding will be oh-so ready  
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with kenny  
And we steady getting many, I mean money  
Riding in an all-black benz with the all black rims  
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses  
  
[Justin bieber]  
Wait... I'm not done  
  
[Verse 2: justin bieber]  
I thanked jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell  
Call me zack morris I'm saving you by the bell  
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves them perfect persons  
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect  
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me  
I swear I got honey bee's cause baby I'm a money tree  
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny  
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y  
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible  
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically  
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally  
There's a bigger me inside this little me  
Screaming out, I should make history  
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me  
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory  
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?  
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos  
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot  
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time  
Playing with camera claiming that "it's not mine"  
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry  
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry  
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry
