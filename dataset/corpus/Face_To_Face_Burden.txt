You could say I might find it difficult to show it on the outside from far
away I should seem as ordinary as would seem the truth but all we find
dishonesty and lies it's hard to recognize the truth and why can't I discover
what the reason is that I know there's something left that I should prove I
didn't mean to burden you is there something more to this? I didn't mean to
burden you is there something more to this? was it something that I've already
missed? peel away the fear that I'm not good enough to give back what I've
taken it's hard to say the dissappointment tends to make the optimism fade I'm
still behind and running out of time it's nothing but a trite excuse and why
can't I discover what the reason is that I know there's something left that I
should prove
