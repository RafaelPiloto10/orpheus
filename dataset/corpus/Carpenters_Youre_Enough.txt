You're enough  
If I never had another  
Never hold another lover  
Baby, you're enough  
All the rest are second best  
Compared to you  
  
You're enough  
If I never know another  
After what we've known together  
Baby, you're enough  
I've already had my sweetest dreams come true  
  
Can't you see  
In these eyes that adore you  
I've been waiting here for you  
Baby, can't you see  
Look at me  
See love's greatest non-believer  
Believing that she might be seeing love  
In your eyes  
  
Stars above  
Made for wishin', made for dreamers  
Won't you listen to this heart  
And what it's dreamin' of  
If they'll only shine their lucky starlight down on me  
Make it bright enough for only you to see  
That, baby, you're enough for me
