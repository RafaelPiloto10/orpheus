Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings  
Where the mummified Pharaohs  
Pretend dead in their sleep  
Don't touch, never ever steal  
Unless you're in for the kill  
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs  
Yes, you'll be hit and the curse is on you  
Now if you're breakin' the seals  
And disturbing the peace  
Then you're startin' up a curse  
Bringin' evil disease  
Don't touch, never ever steal  
Unless you're in for the kill  
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs  
Yes, you'll be hit and the curse is on you  
The curse of the Pharaohs can be so deadly  
Or just destroying your future  
Takin' it all shady  
Don't touch, never ever steal  
Unless you're in for the kill  
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs  
Yes, you'll be hit and the curse is on you
