Things are coming down on me  
They never seem to let it be  
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight  
The pressure's building up inside  
  
I gotta let it out tonight  
Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Gonna break it  
And never stop running  
Making nothing from something  
Making nothing from something  
  
Cut me for the lion's share  
It's mindless but I don't care  
'Cause no matter what I say  
I'm in a another fight  
  
Take more shit, I've had enough  
Tonight I'm gonna rip it up  
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright  
  
[Chorus]
