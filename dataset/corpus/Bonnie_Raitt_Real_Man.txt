Don't want no secret agent  
Don't need no long Cadillac  
Don't want nobody with no problems  
I don't need a man with a monkey on his back  
I need a real man  
I said a real man  
I need a real man  
  
Ain't messing with no toy  
I don't need no baby boy  
Don't need to send me no flowers babe  
Sending flowers is real nice  
Way I've been feeling my hearts been a-reeling  
I need a man that loves me once  
I want a man that loves me twice  
Its a sticky situation babe  
Keep me up late at night  
Honey don't know the difference  
Wanna go left when you should of gone right  
  
I want a real man  
I said a real man  
I want a real man  
I've been around the world  
I'm a woman not a girl  
  
I don't want no million dollers  
I don't need no diamond ring  
You can twist and shout  
For to knock yourself out  
I don't care about material things  
  
I want a real man  
I need a real man  
I want a real man  
I said a real man  
I want a real man  
I need a real man baby  
I want a real man  
I want a real man  
Real man  
Real man  
  
Ain't messing with no toy  
Don't need no baby boy  
I been around the world  
I'm a woman not a girl  
I want a real man  
Real man
