With sadness in my heart and joy in my mind  
I thought about the ghost that we left behind.  
With everyone around telling us what to do  
With deafening sound whisper "I love you."  
The fire in your eyes-- may it never go out.  
The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night.  
I see no escape from the roles we always play  
What do we have to prove on this judgement day  
You're missing the whole point-- you're not my little pet  
Don't throw away your life-- The games not over yet  
I do not own your soul--don't want you in a cage  
I only want your heart to find a special place  
You're mine now But you're not my sister  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine But you're not my child  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
With sadness in my heart and clounds in my head  
I thought about us both and the lives we led.  
The pages on a book and pictures on a screen  
We shape ourselves like clay from someone else's dream.  
One second you are cast just like stones at my feet  
But I am not a king please don't worship me.  
With everyone around telling us what to do  
With deafening sound whisper "I love you."  
You're missing the whole point-- you're not my little pet  
Don't throw away your life-- The games not over yet  
I do not own your soul--don't want you in a cage  
I only want your heart to find a special place  
You're mine now But you're not my sister  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine But you're not my child  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine But you're not my sister  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine But you're not my child  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine now But you're not my slave  
You're mine now But you're not my slave
