I woke up with her in my arms this mornin'  
Forgotten how I love her over all  
As she whispered she loved me your memory appeared  
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?  
  
Tonight I lay here touchin' her sleek body  
And a good familiar feelin' I recall  
I close my eyes to kiss her, your memory appeared  
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?  
  
If you were here we'd love but now your gone  
I ask you let bygone all be bygones, yes and stay gone  
You always find the wrong time to come around to call  
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?  
  
Ain't your memory got no pride at all?
