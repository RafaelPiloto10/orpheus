[Verse 1]  
My funny valentine  
Sweet comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable  
Unphotographable  
Yet your my favourite work of art  
  
[Bridge]  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
[Chorus]  
But don't change your hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine, stay  
Each day is valentine's day
