One kiss  
One kiss  
(Made in heaven)  
So many questions needing answers  
  
How will it be with me when it hits me  
Can it happen in a second  
Will it be just like a ringing bell  
When it calls me  
  
Is it just like music and lights  
Or is that just a fairytale  
Will I see it  
Can I hear it  
  
How does it feel  
It's all such a mystery  
But one kiss and I'll know  
If it's really meant to be I won't let go  
  
They say true love  
Is made in heaven  
I'm so full of mixed emotions  
Does it get to you deep inside  
  
All at once you see the changes  
Do you feel like you can face the world  
Hear the music  
See the lights  
  
To know what it means  
When you face your destiny  
Will I see it  
Can I hear it  
  
How does it feel  
It's all such a mystery  
But one kiss and I'll know  
If it's really meant to be I won't let go  
  
They say true love  
Is made in heaven  
One look and I'll see  
No other face for all eternity  
  
They say true love  
Is made in heaven  
On kiss  
True love  
  
One kiss  
True love  
When it calls me  
Is it just like music and lights  
  
Or is love just a fairytale  
Will I see it  
Can I hear it  
How does it feel  
  
It's all such a mystery  
But one kiss and I'll know  
If it's really meant to be I won't let go  
They say true love  
  
Is made in heaven  
One look and I'll see  
No other face for all eternity  
They say true love  
  
Is made in heaven  
But one kiss and I'll know  
If it's really meant to be I won't let go  
They say true love  
Is made in heaven
