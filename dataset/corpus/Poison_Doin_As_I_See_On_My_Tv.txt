When I was a child staring at the tube  
I saw sex, violence and death on the news  
One day I saw the Duke kill someone  
Daddy said don't worry boy, they're just acting son  
  
All I want is attention from somebody  
Somebody pay attention to me  
Like them actors I got no shame  
I want my fifteen minutes of fame  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
Can I get on the news if I kill my wife?  
Would you respect me more if I took my life?  
I tried to act and my career just flopped  
So I beat up my neighbors and I got on "Cops"  
  
All I want's a millions bucks from somebody  
Somebody pay a million bucks to me  
  
I could shoot and rape and kill  
And buy me a house in Beverly Hills, please?  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
I'd even do a porno flick, like all them Hollywood chicks  
I'm doin' it as I see on my TV  
  
Took my girl to rent a porno movie  
I thought that it'd be kinda groovy  
I thought that'd this impress my lover  
And there she was right on the cover!  
  
All I want is attention from somebody  
Somebody pay attention to me  
I'm a man I got no shame  
I want my fifteen minutes of fame  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
Hell I'd even do a porno flick, like my hero Rocky did  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
Whistling, gargling  
  
I am not aware!
