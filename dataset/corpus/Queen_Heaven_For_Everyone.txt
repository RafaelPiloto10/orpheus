In these days of cool reflection (reflection)  
You come to me and everything seems alright  
In these days of cold affections  
You sit by me - and everything's fine  
  
This could be heaven for everyone  
This world could be fed, this world could be fun  
This could be heaven for everyone  
This world could be free, this world could be one  
  
In this world of cool deception  
Just your smile can smooth my ride  
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm  
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind  
  
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone  
This world could be fed, (yeah) this world could be fun  
This should be love for everyone, yeah  
This world should be free, (yeah) this world could be one  
We should bring love to our daughters and sons  
Love, love, love, this could be heaven for everyone  
You know that  
This could be heaven for everyone yes

Listen - what people do to other souls  
They take their lives - destroy their goals  
Their basic pride and dignity  
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity  
When this should be heaven for everyone
