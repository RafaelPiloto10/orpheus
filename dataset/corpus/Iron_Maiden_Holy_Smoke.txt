Believe in me, send us money  
Died on the cross and that ain't funny  
But my so called friends they're making me a joke  
They missed out what I said like I never spoke  
They choose what they want to hear, they don't tell a lie  
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die  
They're saving your souls by taking your money  
Flies around shit, bees around honey  
  
[Chorus]  
Holy Smoke Holy Smoke, plenty bad preachers for  
The Devil to stoke  
Feed'em in feet first this is no joke  
This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke yeah  
making Holy Smoke  
  
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends  
Say they gonna be with you at the end  
Burning records burning books  
Holy soldiers nazi looks  
Crocodile smiles just wait a while  
Till the TV queen gets her make-up clean  
I've lived in filth I've lived in sin  
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy Smoke, smells good  
  
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools  
When Noah built his cadillac it was cool  
Two by two they're still going down  
And the satellite circus just left town  
I think they're strange and when they're dead  
They can have a Lincoln for their bed  
Friend of the president trick of the tail  
Now they ain't got a prayer 100 years in jail  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy Smoke
