Shadows were hiding what I couldn't see  
Out in the dark - she was calling to me  
Calling to me with a voice I'd never forget  
  
She was a vision I couldn't believe  
I held her close wo that she wouldn't leave  
Suddenly hopeless - hopelessly falling in love

I remember the feeling  
I remember the way  
She came and wrapped her arms around me  
Told me that she cared  
Said she'd always be there  
  
Taking me places that I've never been  
She had the beauty that comes from within  
Was I just dreaming was it too good to be true  
  
I was a man all alone in the night  
She came along and she showed me the light  
I was confused then she told me the way  
I was alone and I begged her to stay  
  
She was alive I was caught by the fire  
She brought emotions that filled my desire  
I should have noticed that something was wrong  
When I awoke she was gone

When I awoke, I could see that she was gon
