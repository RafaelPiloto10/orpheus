Come take me down to your heart of gold, and I will hear your song.  
Cover me up in your fantasy world, where I can do you no harm.  
  
  
And hold me now close to you.  
Fear the thoughts I am sending.  
Hold me now close again.  
This dream is almost ending.  
  
  
Come take me down to your victory waltz, and I will break your heart.  
Gaze once again at the promise we made, that I have torn all apart.  
  
  
And hold me now close to you.  
As though we're still pretending.  
Hold me now close again.  
This dream is almost ending.
