Give it up to this planet full of strife  
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife  
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap  
The cups went up like a natural fact  
  
It was our shoulder space  
That made the perfect place  
For the magic of the cup  
To style out with grace  
With a tight turn twist  
And a slight swerve swank  
The brothers cup kissed  
With a kick ass clank  
  
We are the brothers cup  
We like to get it up  
We are the brothers cup  
We like to get it up  
  
Give it up to this planet full of strife  
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife  
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap  
The cups went up like a natural fact  
  
So love all your brothers  
And love all your sisters  
Love all the misses  
And love all the misters  
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses  
The brothers cup kiss  
And we ain't sissies  
  
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion  
Can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion  
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean  
Is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace motion  
  
Give it up to this planet full of strife  
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife  
  
With the power of the cup we are about to astound  
All your preconceptions they will come unbound  
We are the brothers cup coming to your town  
Bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around
