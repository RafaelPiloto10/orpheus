Hemingway's whiskey, warm and smooth and mean  
Even when it burns, it'll always finish clean  
He didn't like it watered down, he took it straight up and neat  
If it was bad enough for him, you know it's bad enough for me  
  
Hemingway's whiskey  
  
Ah, it's tough out there, a good muse is hard to find  
Living one word to the next, one line at a time  
There's more to life than whiskey, there's more to words than rhyme  
Sometimes nothing works, sometimes nothing shines  
  
Like Hemingway's whiskey  
  
Sail away, sail away, three sheets to the wind  
Live hard, die hard, this one's for him  
  
Hemingway's whiskey, warm and smooth and mean  
Even when it burns, it'll always finish clean  
He didn't like it watered down, he took it straight up and neat  
If it was bad enough for him, you know it's bad enough for me  
  
Hemingway's whiskey  
Hemingway's whiskey  
Hemingway's whiskey
