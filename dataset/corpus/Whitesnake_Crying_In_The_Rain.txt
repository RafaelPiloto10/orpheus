A black cat moans  
When he's burning with the fever  
A stray dog howls  
When he's lonely in the night  
A woman goes crazy  
With the though of retribution  
But, a man starts weeping  
When he's sick and tired of life  
  
I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow  
Feel I'm wasting my time  
Lighting candles in the wind,  
Always taking my chances  
On the promise of the future  
But, a heart full of sorrow  
Paints a lonely tapestry  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
Crying in the rain  
  
I can never deny  
All the sweet things I have tasted  
Tho' I've been mistreated  
I keep coming back for more,  
I know where I'm going  
There's no hope of absolution  
I can't seem to separate  
The good times from the bad  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain  
  
Crying in the rain
