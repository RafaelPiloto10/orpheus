Come with me, come with me  
And we shall run across the sky.  
We illuminate the night.  
Ohhhh, I, I will try and guide you  
To better times and brighter days.  
Just don't be afraid.  
  
Come on up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better.  
Let's go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven.  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
And we shall let expression sing.  
Hear freedom ringin'.  
Ohhh, memories of yesterday's broken dreams.  
Hey, don't you know, don't you know  
That they are gonna fade away?  
Don't be afraid.  
  
Come on up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better.  
Let's go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven.  
  
We'll laugh, I'll tell you the story of love.  
How it is, the happiness in it, baby.  
We combine these thoughts and together we will travel  
To the fountain of lovingness.  
I will never, never, never, never,  
Never leave you, baby.  
As we grow older and older and older, babe.  
  
Standing strong we'll say:  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go?  
Say, don't you wanna go  
  
Up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can see heaven much better.  
Let's go up the ladder to the roof  
Where we can be closer to heaven.  
  
Let's go up the, up the, up the ladder to heaven.  
Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven.
