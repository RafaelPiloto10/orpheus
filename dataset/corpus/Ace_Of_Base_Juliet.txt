Juliet  
A girl you never should have met  
Oh, Juliet  
She acted like she's never seen your face before  
It's not funny honey when you try  
And she's not even willing to learn  
It's not funny honey when you're only after money  
Could you ever try to earn?  
  
[Chorus]  
So, Howzat!  
What's up a bright and clear new summer day  
Well, Howzat!  
Wake up and breath the air and sail away  
So, Howzat!  
What's up now, don't you worry night and day  
Always remember, don't you remember me? Yeah  
  
Juliet,  
How could she ever you forget  
Oh, Juliet  
She acted like she's never seen your face before  
It's not funny honey when you try  
And she's not even willing to learn  
It's not funny honey when you're on your own  
And the pages never turn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never meant to hurt you  
But that's just the way it went  
It's not my intention  
Pretending to be Heaven Saint  
Juliet, what's up a bright and clear new summer day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Juliet
