Once in a while  
I see what's going on  
And disappear  
Into the world behind  
The one that's here  
  
It never lasts  
As long as a dream can last  
And then I'm back  
Into the ways that make  
The days go fast  
So grab my hand and make it last  
  
And hold me close, don't leave so soon  
Let all the flowers bloom  
And don't let go or I will blow  
Away into a different room  
  
Is it so strange  
Tell me you feel the same  
Or shut my mouth  
I can't pretend I haven't said it now  
  
Let's just pretend  
Our numbered days won't end  
Infinity - this endless space and time  
For you and me  
And yours and mine, forever we  
  
Will hold me close, don't leave so soon  
Let all the flowers bloom  
And don't let go or I will blow  
Away into a different room.  
  
There's no door to get me back  
To get me back there  
There's no window to see  
I tell myself that it was no  
That it was nowhere  
And all becomes a dream  
  
Hold me close, don't leave so soon  
Let all the flowers bloom  
And don't let go or I will blow  
Away into a different room.
