My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
It's alive its alive rounds kill the eyes  
I had to bring the bitch back like Frankenstein  
I push weight but Gucci don't exercise  
I get extra from whipping up extra pies  
I'm in a hood like the mayor 'round election time  
Here's a suggestion don't park your car next to mine  
I'm a star when the light hit I'm supposed to shine  
Your flow is garbage they let me out just in time  
They got a section but none of the hoes are fine  
They need to exit don't let the grind past you by  
I run laps round lames with my shoes untied  
I jump the line walk in and watch the crowd divide  
Still stuck outside its the ugly side  
Look Medusa in the eye and Medusa died  
This top secret shit classified  
Don't blame me swizz was the mastermind  
Cant breath cant breath tone tony brush the time  
I keep my chain moon walking Michael Jackson time  
I keep on buying ice like I lost my mind  
This little light of mine is supposed to shine  
  
My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
Hurry up hurry up Gucci on the news  
They said he walked out the chair rocking stupid jewels  
They tried to find what it do they made that Jew confused  
Too much cash on my hundred falling out my troops  
A yellow wrist bright as piss bitch I'm the shit  
Big Gucci called swizz lets make a hit  
Two things in this world I ain't never seen  
Are you a foreigner nigga I need to help to get me mean?  
I hope you suffocate me totally baby let me breath  
Cause I don't chase nothing but paper bitches chasing me  
Excuse my french I'm Gucci I'm so fucking gutter  
It don't make no sense to switch for none of these motherfuckers  
  
My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?  
  
So not to say my life is it  
I said no doc my wife is it  
Now I'm back back going like I never never left  
Plus the boy right here I'm fresh to death (whoo)  
Chris Jones on my feet see I can't fall from Suzuki jeeps  
Now I'm jumping off decks  
The word about the haters they can be upset and  
The black card in my back pocket  
The corner sig' is looking like a speeding rocket  
Yeah I'm zooming on a highway  
And you should love me I did it my way  
  
My pockets on swoll' my rims all grown  
When I hit the club everything goes  
Bottles in the air put your lighters in the air  
But when I'm in here I don't really care  
Cause I ride on 'em I style on 'em  
Yea I lean on 'em yea I flash on 'em  
Yea I know that's the way you like it huh?  
Yea that's the way you love me huh?
