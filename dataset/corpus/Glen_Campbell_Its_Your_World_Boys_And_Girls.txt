Well this old lonely lonely street  
Reminds me of a dream that I once had and then I lo-ost my way  
And them years, they just roll and they're takin' their toll  
And I keep payin' the cost  
Well I'm not tryin' to please nobody but me  
But can't you see I tow the line, religiously  
Well you won't be here for ever, so just hang on to your heart  
And don't let them old de-emons tear you apart  
'Cause it's your world, boys and girls  
It's your world 'til your life is through  
If it was gone tomorrow you wouldn't have anything  
It wouldn't be nothi-in' without you, hey, without you  
You can struggle and strive and you can handle your li-ife  
But they still want blood, yeah  
So just stroll like that river and stick to your ground  
A-just like this old mother earth  
Well I was born free and I'll prob'ly die young  
But I'll leave some happy people with some good songs that I've sung  
Well you won't be here forever, so just hang on to your heart, yeah  
And don't let them old de-emons tear you apart  
'Cause it's your world boys and girls  
It's your world 'til your life is throu-ough  
If it was gone tomorrow you wouldn't have anything  
It wouldn't be nothin' without you, hey, without you  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no-o no-othin'  
No, it wouldn't be nothin' without yall  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no-o nothin'  
Well it wouldn't be nothin' without you  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no-o no-othin'  
Well it wouldn't be nothin' without you  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no it wouldn't be nothin'  
No, no, no, nothin', it would be nothin' without you, yeah  
Well it wouldn't be
