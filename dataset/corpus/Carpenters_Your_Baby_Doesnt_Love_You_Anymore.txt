Just take some loneliness  
And add a tear or two  
Throw in some emptiness  
Mix 'till you're bluer than blue  
Keep it all under cover  
Next to your broken dreams  
When you're through  
Then you'll know how I  
Sit alone and cry  
As the nights go by  
Makes you wanta die  
Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
Your baby doesn't love you anymore  
Your baby doesn't love you anymore  
  
You try to make believe  
It doesn't bother you  
For your own sake believe  
You'll make it through  
Just make a vow ev'ry morning  
That today you will change  
Your point of view  
But it's all a game  
That you play in vain  
And you live in pain  
Cuz it's very plain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And there's nothin' that you can do  
But just break down and cry  
It's over for you  
When  
  
[Chorus]
