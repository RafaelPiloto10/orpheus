It's warm tonight  
It rained tonight  
The windows are all open wide  
Can't see the clock to check the time  
Nothing is moving  
When you walk through me  
I turn around  
To switch the scene  
The room dives like a submarine  
I cross the carpet trying to leave  
Sometimes I can do it  
When you walk through me  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you walk through me  
I almost lose me  
It's so confusing  
When you walk through me  
When you walk through me  
Locations change  
The angles change  
Even the streets get rearranged  
While I'm swimming out  
Someone waves across a ??? room  
I take the train  
Or shine a shoe  
A dark horizon comes to view  
I get lost in the crossword clues  
Or check the time again  
  
(Chorus)  
It's warm tonight  
It rained tonight  
The windows are all open wide  
Can't see the clock to check the time  
Nothing is moving  
When you walk through me  
  
(Chorus)
