Oh! plea-ease - don't let me love you  
Just be- cause I'm feelin' blue  
And plea-ease - don't let me kiss you  
'cause I know you'll be untrue.  
  
Because you're sweet dear, I want to love you  
plea-ease - stay away from my heart  
And plea-ease don't let me love you  
'cause I know you- ll break my heart.  
  
Oh! plea-ease don't call me darlin'  
When I know you don't love me  
And plea-ease don't whisper sweetheart  
For I know it just can't be  
  
When I'm lonely, I want you only  
Where is the dream I once knew  
Oh! plea-ease - don't let me love you  
'cause I know you'll be untrue.
