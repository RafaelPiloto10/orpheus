If she knew that I was here with you  
There ain't no doubt about what she would do  
So lets get dressed and ill be on my way  
You knew that I was passing through  
I never meant to stay.  
  
And I think id better go back to Atlanta  
Before my conscience makes a fool of me  
I never should have stepped across loves Mason Dixon line  
And I think its time to go back to Atlanta  
  
I've been on the road for a long long time  
She was out of sight and out of mind  
But she still wears my ring upon her hand  
All that I could be to you is  
Just a one night stand
