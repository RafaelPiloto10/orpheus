Just outside of Austin  
I turned on my radio  
Turned it in to a satellite station  
She was talkin' on a call-in show  
She said it was over, she'd made her choice  
Her mind was made-up by the sound of her voice  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Sounded like he really had it coming  
All the times he'd done her wrong  
She said, I hope he's listening  
And hung-up the telephone  
All of a sudden, I realized  
It was me she was telling good-bye  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Hello DJ, put me on the air  
Give me the chance to tell her I still care  
Get her back on the line, tell her I'm still in love  
Said, "sorry son, but you're breaking up"  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Across America tonight  
  
Across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight
