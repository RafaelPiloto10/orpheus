So you're leaving in the morning on the early train  
I could say everything's alright  
And I could pretend and say goodbye  
Got your ticket  
Got your suitcase  
Got your leaving smile  
I could say that's the way it goes  
And I could pretend and you won't know  
That I was lying  
  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
No I can't stop loving you  
No I won't stop loving you  
Why should I?  
  
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said  
And I saw you walk across the road  
For maybe the last time, I don't know  
Feeling humble  
I heard a rumble  
On the railway track  
And when I hear that whistle blow  
I'll walk away and you won't know  
That I'll be crying  
  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
No I can't stop loving you  
No I won't stop loving you  
Why should I?  
  
Even try, I'll always be here by your side  
Why, why, why, I never wanted to say goodbye  
Why even try, I'll always be here if you  
Change, change your mind  
  
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train  
I could say everything's alright  
And I could pretend and say goodbye  
But that would be lying  
  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
No I can't stop loving you  
No I won't stop loving you  
Why should I even try?
