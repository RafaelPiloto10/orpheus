You're climbing mountains, I'm on a hill  
You're always running I'm standing still  
You live for the moment, no future no past  
I may be a fool to love by the rules and want it to last  
  
[Chorus]  
If you ever have forever in mind  
I'll be here and easy to find  
If your heart isn't ready to lay down with mine  
If you ever have forever in mind  
  
The music has ended still you want to dance  
I know that feeling, I can't take that chance  
You live for the moment no future no past  
I may be a fool to love by the rules, I want it to last  
  
[Chorus]
