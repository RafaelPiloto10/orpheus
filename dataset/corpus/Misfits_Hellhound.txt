Got a hellhound dog  
That hellhound's gonna rip your face off  
Got a hellhound dog  
That hellhound's gonna tear right through  
  
Got a hellhound born  
A hellhound born to the pack  
Got a hellhound dog  
  
And I know that I might be dead  
Those who seek it out  
Those who stand a few  
  
Hell, hell of Satan's pack  
We are born of hate  
Both feet into hell  
  
Take another step  
Towards the bleeding light  
Those who seek it out  
Those who stand a few  
  
We are a part of it  
Got a hellhound dog  
That hellhound's gonna rip your face off  
Got a hellhound dog  
That hellhound's gonna tear right through  
  
Got a hellhound born  
A hellhound born to the pack  
Got a hellhound dog  
That hellhound's gonna rip your face off  
  
Got a hellhound dog  
That hellhound's gonna rip your face off  
Got a hellhound dog  
Got a hellhound born
