Well, I don't care what's wrong or right  
When you're not there by my side  
I just wonder what to do  
Well, if I can't have you  
And I think about nothing much at all  
Nothing but you and me  
And I'm pleading can't we just be  
The way that we used to be  
Honey, wake up, won't you please come back to me  
Honey, think of, think of the way things used to be  
If we make up, well, I won't ever be that bad  
Honey, wake up, and give me just one more chance, just one more chance  
Well, I don't know how I lost control  
But I now know that it's true  
That the hurt I aimed at me misfired  
And came back to hurt you  
I've been wondering where you are tonight  
And wondering where you've been  
Now I'll walk these lonely streets awhile  
And think about it again  
Honey, wake up, won't you please come back to me  
Honey, think of, think of the way things used to be  
If we make up, well I won't ever be that bad  
Honey, wake up, and give me just one more chance, just one more chance  
What can I do? What can I say?  
Honey, wake up, won't you please come back to me  
Honey, think of, think of the way things used to be  
If we make up, well I won't ever be that bad  
Honey, wake up, and give me just one more chance, just one more chance  
I won't ever be that bad, won't you please come back to me  
What can I do? What can I say?
