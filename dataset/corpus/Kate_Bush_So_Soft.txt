Held in your arms in the back seat,  
Cruising down the main street,  
How can anyone have such little defense?  
You're soft.  
In between the sheets, left in limbo,  
Covered me like the pillow  
I can hardly tell the difference.  
You're soft,  
So soft.  
To be, to be with you  
I'd leave everything.  
But I don't know how to deal with you.  
I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.  
Love would melt me like hot butter.  
You're soft,  
So soft.  
To be, to be with you  
I'd do anything.  
Walking down the street, brushing arms,  
You're moonlight dancing.  
I try hard to keep my feelings in.  
You're soft.  
Dancing to the music, so low.  
I knead you like dough.  
How can anyone be so loving  
And soft,  
So soft?  
To be, to be with you  
I'd leave everything.  
But I don't know how to deal with you.  
I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.  
You melt me like hot butter.  
You're soft,  
So soft.  
To be, to be with you  
I'd do anything.
