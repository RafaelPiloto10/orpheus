Touched by thoughts  
As cold as ice  
Like some bathroom floor  
No love can be worth this price  
Still I ask for more  
  
Endless days and restless nights  
And forgotten scenes  
Hopelessly I tried to find  
Escape from this deam  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Love is sweet  
And bitter too  
The taste can leave cold  
You know I hate it  
But I cannot refuse to capture control  
  
How it seems  
There's no way out  
I guess I never knew  
Emptiness has left no doubt  
Now I want you  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
You've been gone for so long  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
Tell me you're coming back
