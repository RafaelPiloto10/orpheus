Five AM in the mornin', whiskey still runnin' through my head  
I could get out of bed and maybe I'll just have another cigarette  
As long as I can remember seems all I've ever done is work  
The boss is a jerk and I ain't payin' the rent  
Spent my whole life shovelin' dirt  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Can't take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for  
Take the road less traveled  
Spend my life behind the wheel  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Freedom made out of steel  
  
There's a knock on the door from the sheriff  
Askin' me where I was last night  
Seems somebody lookin' a lot like me  
Had takin' up with his wife  
He said son if I ever catch him  
There's gonna be some hell to pay  
He'll be gone for good if I see him again  
'cause I just might blow him away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's a poor man supposed to do  
Stuck in the middle and trapped by the blues  
Baby, I'm sick of these blues  
  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Can't take this anymore  
Gonna go downtown pick up my girl  
There ain't nothin' worth waitin' for  
Well I don't care if I'm wrong or right  
Gotta split this town tonight  
Gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
Live my life behind the wheel  
I'm gonna get outta hell in my dodge  
My freedom made out of steel
