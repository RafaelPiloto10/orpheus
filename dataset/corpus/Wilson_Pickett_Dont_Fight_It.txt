There you sit  
All by yo'self  
Everybody's dancin'  
They can't a-help themselves  
  
The mood is much too strong  
You can't a-hold out longer  
So get up  
Don't fight it  
(You got to feel it, feel it)  
  
You better get on up  
And get that groove  
You know what, baby?  
I like the way you move!  
  
Ya do the Thing  
Like you oughta be, alright  
So don't fight it  
Whoa, baby, yeah, yeah  
(Feel it, feel it)  
  
The way you, Jerk  
The way you do The Twine  
You're too much, baby  
I'd like to make you mine  
  
And after the dance  
I'm gonna take you home  
So don't fight it  
Baby, you've got to feel  
(Feel it, feel it)  
  
Don't fight it, oh, no  
(Feel it, feel it)  
  
You got to feel  
(Feel it, feel it)  
  
You can't fight it  
(Feel it, feel it)  
No.
