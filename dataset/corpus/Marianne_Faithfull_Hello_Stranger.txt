Hello stranger, hello stranger.  
Who is that person in the mirror? it's not me.  
Whatever happened to the one that I used to be?  
Is she just another fading memory?  
  
Hello stranger, hello stranger.  
Hello stranger, hello stranger.  
Every night you're always in my bed.  
Every day you stay inside my head.  
  
Oh, how I wish that I was there instead  
Of some sad stranger,  
Some sad stranger,  
Hello stranger.
