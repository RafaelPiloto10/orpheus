Listen to the money talk  
Listen to it scream  
Only lots of paper  
But it haunts them in their dreams.  
  
Doesn't matter who they are  
Doesn't matter where  
Some people can't get enough  
That is their only care.  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill.  
  
Sitting in a darkened room  
Sharing out the land  
Someone holds a document  
And smiles as they shake hands.  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill.  
  
Everywhere you wander,  
Wander where you will  
Someone's making deals  
And going in for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill...
