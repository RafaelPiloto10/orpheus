Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand  
Take me to some twilight land where all but love is gray  
Where time just slips away without her as my guide  
  
Night falls, I'm cast beneath here spell  
Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell  
Am I left to burn and burn eternally?  
  
She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl  
She's a mystery girl  
  
In the night of love, words tangled in her hair  
Words soon to disappear, a love so sharp it cuts  
Like a switchblade to my heart, words tearing me apart  
  
She tears again my bleeding heart  
I want to run she's pulling me apart  
Fallen angel cries then I just melt away  
  
She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl  
She's a mystery girl, she's a mystery girl  
  
Haunted by her side the darkness in her eyes  
But that so enslaves me, if my love is blind  
Then I don't want to see, she's a mystery to me  
  
Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell  
Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell  
Am I left to burn and burn eternally?  
  
She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl  
She's a mystery girl, she's a mystery girl  
She's a mystery girl, she's a mystery girl  
She's a mystery girl, she's a mystery girl
