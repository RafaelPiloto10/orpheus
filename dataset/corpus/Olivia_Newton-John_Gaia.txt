(Olivia Newton-John)  
I am your mother--born of the sun  
I gave you shelter--what have you done?  
Your heart's in turmoil--my world's in pain  
I need to turn you back home again  
I am a woman--I am the rain  
And like your father--I feel the betrayed  
What you are doing--can be undone  
You know the answers--tell everyone  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fate's in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
I am the forest--now I'm a tree  
The air is dirty--I cannot breathe  
My streams run empty--my tears run dry  
My children call me--don't let us die  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fate's in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
I love my children and I've been your home  
But I'll survive this--if I'm alone  
I'm survivor--but you will be gone  
Let's start a new world--from this day on  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fate's in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
Oh respect me  
Oh respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see
