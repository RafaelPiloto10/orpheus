Just beginning to take that love away  
Just beginning to take that love away  
In a minute I'll wash that love away  
Even now we remember what we used to say  
Takes a minute to wash that love away  
Take a clean break: wash that love away  
  
Even now we remember what we used to say  
Even now we remember what we used to say  
We'll be together if we wash that love away  
  
What's tha matter ?  
Have to clean up ?  
That's true  
That's true  
And it's taken  
To extreme extent  
That's why we  
Work so hard to  
Take that love away  
Take that love away  
Take that love away  
Take that love away
