You and I - we may look the same  
But we are very far apart  
There's bullet-holes where my compassion used to be  
And there is violence in my heart  
  
Into fire you can send us  
From the fire we return  
You can label us a consequence  
Of how much you have to learn  
  
You can try, but you'll never understand  
This is something you will never understand  
Can you hear it now?  
Hear it coming now?  
Can you hear it now?  
  
On hands and knees  
We crawl  
You cannot stop us all  
Our bones, our skin  
We will not let you in  
  
You have set something in motion  
Much greater than you've ever known  
Standing there in all your grand naivety  
About to reap what you have sown  
  
Time will feed upon your weaknesses  
And soon you'll lose the will to care  
When you return to the place that you call home  
We will be there, we will be there  
  
On hands and knees  
We crawl  
You cannot stop us all  
Our blood will stay  
We will not go away  
  
On hands and knees  
We crawl  
You can not stop us all  
Our blood, our ways  
Will never leave this place  
  
We crawl  
We crawl  
We crawl  
We crawl
