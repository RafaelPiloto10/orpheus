Don't lose your temper  
Don't lose your temper  
Don't lose your temper  
'Cause I love you when you're wild  
Don't lose your temper  
Don't lose your temper  
Don't lose your temper  
'Cause I'd hate you to grow mild  
Since you took that job with a company  
You've changed so much you just won't recognise me  
They have you dressed up like a secretary  
You mustn't change the things that make you what you are  
Since you've been listening to that linguaphone  
You're speaking in a voice that is not your own  
I'm not sure if it's you when I call home  
You mustn't change the things that make you what you are  
Whatever happened to my fighting, biting, lightning lioness  
Little girl, little girl, little girl, little girl  
I think I preferred it when your hair was in a mess  
Brittle girl, brittle girl  
They're not your real curls  
Don't lose it  
Don't lose it  
Don't lose it  
Don't lose it
