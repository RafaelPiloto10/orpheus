Please stay  
Please stay  
Two words I've thought I'd never learn to say  
Don't go away  
Please stay  
  
Don't leave me here  
When so many things so hard to see are clear  
I need you near to me  
  
Will you stay with me to the end?  
When there's nothing left  
But you and me and the wind  
We'll never know till we try  
To find the other side of goodbye  
  
Please stay  
Please slay  
Two words I've thought I'd never learn to say  
Don't go away  
Please stay
