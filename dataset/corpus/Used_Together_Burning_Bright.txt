Feel the pain wash over me  
Feel the salt that's burning from my eyes  
Feel the world move underneath me  
Know there is no need for my disguise  
Feel the screams as you take my hand  
  
I understand the terror in your eyes  
Feel I've lost myself completely  
I need to know you're right here by my side  
I won't pretend that we could live forever  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
Just we are just sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I see the daylight start to fade  
I see the cold move softly with the night  
I feel the darkness stop to take me  
Now I know there is nowhere to hide  
  
Feel the world start caving in  
I feel the hollow nothing left inside  
No, I've lost myself completely  
I need to know you're right here by my side  
I won't pretend that we could live forever  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
Yeah together burning bright  
(dah dah dah)  
We are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I won't pretend that we could live forever  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
Together burning bright  
  
I get the feeling it's alright, now  
I get the feeling it's okay  
Just close your eyes  
Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright  
  
I think it's gunna be alright, now  
I think it's gunna be okay  
Just close your eyes  
'Cause we are only sparks  
But together burning bright
