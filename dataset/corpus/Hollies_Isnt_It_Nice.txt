Isn't it nice to be someone  
Someone you dream that you are?  
Isn't it such a nice feeling  
The feeling you wished on a star?  
  
You have slipped down a rainbow  
Discovered your own pot of gold  
You are living your wildest dreams  
Use them, you'll never grow old  
  
Just like Cinderella  
But your clock will never strike twelve  
You have something to envy  
That everyone wants for themselves  
  
You have slipped down a rainbow  
Discovered your own pot of gold  
Chasing moonbeams and catching the wind  
And living stories you've been told  
  
You have slipped down a rainbow  
Discovered your own pot of gold  
You are living your wildest dreams  
Use them, you'll never grow old  
  
Isn't it nice to be somewhere  
In places you've dreamed that you've seen  
Isn't it such a nice feeling  
Being where you've never been  
  
Isn't it nice to be someone  
Someone you dream that you are?  
Isn't it such a nice feeling  
The feeling you wished on a star?  
  
Isn't it nice to be someone  
Someone you dream that you are?  
Isn't it such a nice feeling  
The feeling you wished on a star?
