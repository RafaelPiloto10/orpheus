(I love you)  
(I love you)  
(More than words can ever say)  
(You're the one who made this world of mine)  
  
If I knew how much I really love you  
If I knew how much I really care  
I'd sing it and I'd shout it again and again  
To show the world this precious love of mine  
Every dream begins and ends beside you  
Every joy is only ours to share  
I'll sing and I'll shout it again and again  
To show the world this precious love of mine  
  
My rainbow's end, I find in your dress  
You satisfy my hungriness  
All I can find are words to say  
  
All of the things you mean to me  
  
Ooh, I love you  
Ooh, I care  
I'll sing it and I'll shout it again and again  
To show the world this precious love of mine  
Oh, if I knew how much I really love you  
If I knew how much I really care  
I'd sing it, I'd shout it again and again  
To show the world this precious love of mine  
Oh, if I knew how much I really love you  
If I knew how much I really care  
I'd sing it and I'd shout it again and again and again  
To show the world this precious love of mine
