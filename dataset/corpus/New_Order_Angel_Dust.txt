What shall I say  
I fear you will betray me  
How many ways  
Can you prolong this tragedy  
Who told you that I would be back  
You came here to seize my freedom  
I will send you falling slowly  
To the earth I see below me  
  
You never knew  
With open arms I came to you  
Judging me so safe to be with  
Mistakes you made that you can't live with  
What you get is what you need  
When you watch the blood but you don't bleed  
You make me feel like a masked delusion  
A man whose life's became illusion
