Cover of Pixies song played in Texas in 1995  
  
There was a guy  
An under water guy who controlled the sea  
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge  
From new york and new jersey  
This monkey's gone to heaven  
  
The creature in the sky  
Got sucked in ahole  
Now there's a hole in the sky  
And the ground's not cold  
And if the ground's not cold  
Everything is gonna burn  
We'll all take turns  
I'll get mine, too  
This monkey's gone to haven  
  
Rock me joe!  
  
If man is 5 [3x]  
Then the devil is 6 [5x]  
Then God is 7 [3x]  
This monkey's gone to heaven
