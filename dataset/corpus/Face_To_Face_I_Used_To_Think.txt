I've tried to fake it  
I've tried to lie about it  
I've tried to take it  
There's nothing new about it  
I can't take a thing from you  
Because I want what I want and it wouldn't do  
I've tried to make it  
There's nothing you can say  
  
I used to think that things were going to be ok  
I never wanted to think  
There would be another way  
Is there another way?
