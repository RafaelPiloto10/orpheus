Rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
But she said, daddy, don't leave me here to whine  
You're breakin' my heart right half in two  
By rollin' on down the line  
But I kept on rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
Now she said, baby, won't you please change your mind  
There's nothin' you could say or do  
That would ever make me change my mind  
And I kept on rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
  
And she said, honey, don't leave me here alone  
'Cause if you do and you get back, you won't find me at home  
And I kept on rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The worst mistake that I ever made  
Was leavin' that gal behind  
And I kept on rollin'... And I kept on rollin'
