[Verse 1]  
Saturday night, The club was packed, But I can't get no action  
The girl I want is frontin hard, I can't get no satisfaction  
Thousand people up in the club and the music's thumpin hard  
I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card  
Pooled by a girl in a nice tight dress  
The kind that makes ya body wet, Hmm, I must confess  
I tryed and she said no, But fellas yo, I can't get no  
[Chorus]  
I can't get no [Yeah]  
I can't get no [Ya know what I'm sayin?]  
I can't get no [Yep, Yep]  
Satisfaction, Ah hey hey hey  
You know what I say  
That's what I say  
Yeah  
[Verse 2]  
Girlie at the bar, Lookin mighty fly  
She look so fly at the time  
I had to make up, You know, My mind  
So I walked up to her gently, Just so I can speak  
Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak  
I tryed all I could, I even said please  
She moved my hands off her booty, Cause she was a skeeze  
Man, I had to escape, So I could get away  
I told her what was up, She said come back another day  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
The party's almost over, The club's about to close  
I saw this girl who rocked my world, So I suppose  
I'll take another chance, A try at romance  
I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants  
I moved very smoothly, A nice conversation  
The perfume she was wearing, Ooh, Sensation!  
She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong  
Tyson at my back, I had to move along  
[Chorus]  
[Repeat chorus till fade]
