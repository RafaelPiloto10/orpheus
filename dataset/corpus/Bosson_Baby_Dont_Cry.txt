Baby don't cry over me, save your love  
Baby don't cry over me, don't want you to live like that  
Baby, help yourself stop living in a lie, ahh  
Lady, it's your life 'till the moment that you die, ahh  
I won, i won, i wonder 'bout tender lovin' to me  
They say, they say, to stay away from me  
I know, i know, i know i do the right thing  
[Chorus:]  
Baby don't cry over me, save your love  
Baby don't cry over me, don't want you to live like that  
You're all alone, yeah  
You're all alone, don't want you to live like that  
Baby, just for you i'm givin' it a try, ahh  
Lady, seems to be a definite goodbye, ahh  
2 pe, 2 pe, 2 people out on the unsafe ice  
you see, you see, you seem to keep your lies  
Our me, our me, our memories will delight our life  
You'll be, you'll be forever in my mind...  
[Chorus]  
Don't talk about, forget about  
Don't talk about  
Things go up, and things go down  
Say you won't cry and i'll sing to you now  
Things go up, and things go down  
Say you won't cry and i'll sing to you now  
[Chorus]
