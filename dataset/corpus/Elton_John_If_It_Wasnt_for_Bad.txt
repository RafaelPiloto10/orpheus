I knew from the first night I met you  
Something just wasn't quite right  
Loving like an innocent stranger  
But somethin' was just out of sight  
  
How could I know that you abused me  
Fill out some plan of your own  
I couldn't know you'd abuse me  
Leave me here hurt and alone  
  
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy  
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true  
I know that you could be just like you should  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good  
  
I only saw what I wanted to see  
You were a dream in my mind  
I'll never know how you really could be  
It didn't take long for me to find  
  
I guess that it's my fault for seeing  
Only what I wanted to see  
I couldn't know you were being  
A player just acting for me  
  
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy  
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true  
I know you could be just like you should  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good  
  
I knew from the first night I met you  
Something just wasn't quite right  
Loving like an innocent stranger  
But something was just out of sight  
  
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy  
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true  
I know you could be just like you should  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good
