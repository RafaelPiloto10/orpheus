Every day, you crawl into the night  
A fallen angel, with your wings set alight  
When you hit the ground  
Everything turns to blue  
I can't get through the smoke  
That's surrounding you  
  
'Cause when you're fallin'  
I can't tell which way is down  
And when you're screaming  
Somehow I don't hear a sound  
  
And when you're seeing things  
Then your feet don't touch the ground  
'Cause when you're falling  
I can't tell which way is down  
  
I can see through the clouds  
I can walk right through the walls  
Hang me off the ceiling  
But I can't take the fall  
  
Should I cross the river  
When I may get swept away  
Out there on the water  
You can still see me wave  
  
'Cause when you're falling  
I can't tell which way is down  
When you're falling  
I can't tell which way is down  
  
I can see all those things  
My feet don't touch the ground..  
  
'Cause when you're falling  
I cant tell which way is down  
And when you're screaming  
Somehow I don't hear a sound  
  
And when you're seeing things  
Then you're feet don't touch the ground  
'Cause when you're falling  
Somehow I can't hear a sound  
  
Somehow I don't hear a sound  
Falling...
