I can see clearly now, the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
  
I think I can make it now, the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
  
Look all around, there's nothin' but blue skies  
Look straight ahead, nothin' but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
Oh, what a bright, (bright)  
Sun-shiny day
