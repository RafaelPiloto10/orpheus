  
It doesn't take a lot to confuse me  
I'm not aware of the passing of time  
And I'd like to say to those who accuse me  
Could you do it while you looked in my eye  
  
If you hold on primitive notion  
And if you think you'd like to try  
You can drink this magic potion  
And you can do it 'til the day that you the day that you die  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
I'm doing my best to confound you  
Your behaviour is so volatile  
Not even a zoo would impound you  
Don't look at me with your criticle smile  
  
Well I've been driving in the wrong gear  
It's been a long and lonely ride  
It's been winter for a whole year  
But you couldn't hurt me if you tried  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to be like it was at the start  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
I've got a message that I need to send  
It's coming to you straight from a friend  
I wanted to see what's inside my heart  
I wanted to be like it was in the start
