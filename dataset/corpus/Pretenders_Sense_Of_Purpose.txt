Everybody chokes  
When they see someone cut down in their prime  
It may not show when you look at me  
But I know I'm in mine  
I'm potent, baby, I'm potent  
Dangerous to the naked eye  
Rest your head on this bed of mother's pride  
And find out why  
  
Don't you want to take me home?  
Don't you want to take me home?  
  
[Chorus]  
Give me a sense of purpose  
A real sense of purpose now  
Give me a sense of purpose  
A real sense of purpose now  
  
Bully boys don't bother me  
I purse my lips, and they run away  
Guys like you who are gentle and true  
Don't come around here everyday  
I'm potent, baby, I'm potent  
Just one swig of me would get most guys smashed  
But a drop of yours makes me stagger and swerve  
I guess I'm outclassed  
  
Everybody chokes  
When they see someone cut down in their prime  
Take this plea to your heart  
Lift me in mine  
  
Don't you want to take me home?  
Don't you want to take me home?  
  
[Chorus x 2]
