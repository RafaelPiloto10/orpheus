Well I met girl named Lady Cobra  
Her black heart beats screams sinning clover  
She gives me chills and fever blisters  
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes  
  
She just wants to get me high  
Stick a needle in my eye  
Reeks like a loss to temptation,  
Living on my inner demons  
  
I don't wanna suicide,  
I don't want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
  
Cuddle up with me real tight  
Talk to me by candlelight  
Do you wanna play a game of twister  
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter  
  
I don't wanna suicide,  
I don't want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
  
I don't wanna make you cry  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Drawin' blood and lonely stars  
Drink and kiss for cheap guitars  
  
I don't wanna suicide,  
I don't want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
Ah, your friend
