There will never be,  
Another one like you  
There will never be,  
Another one who can  
Do the things you do, oh  
Will you give another chance?,  
Will you try, little try?  
Please stop and you remember,  
We were together, anyway, all right  
And if you have a certain evenin',  
You could lend to me  
I'd give it all right back to you,  
A how it has to be with you  
I know your moves and your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
Will you stop and think and wonder?  
Just what you'll see  
Out on the train yard  
Nursin' penitentiary  
It's gone, I cry out long  
Go head, brother  
Did you stop it to consider?,  
How it will feel  
Cold, grinded grizzly bear jaws,  
Hot on your heels  
Do you often stop and whisper?  
It's Saturday's shore  
The whole world's a savior  
Who could ever, ever, ever  
Ever, ever, ever,  
Ask for more?  
Do you remember?  
Will you stop?,  
Will you stop?,  
The pain  
And there will never be  
Another one like you  
There will never be  
Another one who can  
Do the things you do, oh  
Will you give another chance?  
Will you try, little try?  
Please stop and you remember  
We were together, anyway, all right  
How you must of think and wondered  
How I must feel  
Out on the meadows  
While you run the field  
I'm alone for you  
And I cry  
The sweat, look at it,  
Optical promise  
Heh, heh, heh,  
You'll be dead and in hell  
Before I'm born,  
Sure thing  
Brides maid,  
The only solution  
Isn't it amazing?
