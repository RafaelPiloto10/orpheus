Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
Next year all our troubles will be  
Out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the yule-tide gay  
Next year all our troubles will be  
Miles away  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who were dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
Someday soon, we all will be together  
If the Fates allow  
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow  
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
