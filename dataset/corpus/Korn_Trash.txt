How did it start?  
Well, I don't know.  
I just feel the craving.  
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.  
And it's just there for the taking.  
These little girls they make me feel so goddamn  
Exhilarated.  
I feel them up, I can't give it up.  
The pain that I'm just erasing.  
I tell my lies and I despise.  
Every second I'm with you.  
So I run away and you still stay.  
So what the fuck is with you.  
  
Your feelings I can't help but rape them.  
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.  
My heart inside is constantly hating.  
I'm sorry I just throw you away.  
  
I don't know why I'm so fucking cold?  
I don't know why it hurts me.  
All I want to do is get with you.  
And make the pain go away.  
Why do I have a conscience?  
All it does is fuck with me.  
Why do I have this torment?  
All I want to do is fuck it away.  
  
I tell my lies and I despise.  
Every second I'm with you.  
So I run away and you still stay.  
So what the fuck is with you.  
  
Your feelings I can't help but rape them.  
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.  
My heart inside is constantly hating.  
I'm sorry I just throw you away.  
  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.
