There's a road that I remember leading to a special place  
Where the door was always open to a smiling face  
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me  
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name  
  
And a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window  
  
Maybe it's just wishful thiking I can hear the sleigh bells ring  
Almost taste teh pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve  
  
And there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart  
  
Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go  
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
