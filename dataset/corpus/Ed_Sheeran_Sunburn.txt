You're not her, though I try to see you differently  
I tow the line  
You see I'm searching for what used to be mine  
I saw your eyes  
And then I saw her staring back at me  
And I will try to find another one  
Who suited me as well as her  
  
I moved far away from you  
And I want to see you here  
Beside me, dear  
But things aren't clear  
When we never even tried  
We never talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you  
  
She was mine  
I was hers and all that's in between  
If she would cry,  
I would shelter her  
And keep her from the darkness that will be  
  
If I moved far away from you  
And I want to see you here  
Beside me, dear  
But things aren't clear  
When we never even tried  
We never even talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you  
  
Don't drop me in it's not my time  
If you cut deep then I might find  
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn  
  
Don't drop me in it's not my time  
If you cut deep then I might learn  
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn  
  
We never even tried  
We never talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you.
