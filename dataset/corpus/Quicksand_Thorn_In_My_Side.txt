Thorn in, my side.  
And you live just to pull me down.  
Rusted, nail I stepped on.  
This infection.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You're full,  
I think so,  
of anger.  
You need to sit down,  
stay down.  
  
The things you, want but don't get.  
Is that fair, I don't think so.  
A sure thing, you can count, on.  
A big depression.  
  
A thorn in my side.  
You're full,  
I think so,  
of anger.  
You need to.  
  
Your praise, is two faced,  
And you're  
you're cut down,  
my friend.  
Cut Down.  
  
A thorn in my side, thorn in.  
A thorn in my side, thorn in.
