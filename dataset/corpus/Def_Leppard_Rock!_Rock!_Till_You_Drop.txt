Hold onto your hat, hold onto your heart  
Ready, get set to tear this place apart  
Don't need a ticket, only place in town  
That'll take you up to heaven and never bring you down  
Anything goes, anything goes  
  
Women to the left, omen to the right  
There to entertain and take you through the night  
So grab a little heat and come along with me  
Cause your mama don't mind what your mama don't see  
Anything goes, anything goes  
  
I said rock rock till you drop  
Rock rock never stop  
Rock rock till you drop  
I say rock rock to the top  
  
Ridin' into danger, laughin' all the way  
Fast, free and easy, livin' for today  
Gotta lip service, get it while you can  
Hot, sweat 'n' nervous love on demand  
Anything goes, anything goes  
All night long  
  
I said rock rock till you drop  
Come on rock rock never stop  
You gotta rock rock till you drop  
I say rock rock to the top  
  
Rock rock give it to me  
It's what i got goin' through' me  
Don't ever stop do it to me  
Yeah, rock rock you really move me  
  
Here we go  
Rock rock till you drop  
Rock rock never stop  
Come on and rock rock till you drop  
We gonna rock until you drop  
Gonna take you to the top  
  
Rock rock till you drop  
Rock rock never stop  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold tight  
We're gonna rock tonight  
Too right  
Too loud man, too loud
