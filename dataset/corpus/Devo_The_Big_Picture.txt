Going 'round the world  
Don't know where we're going  
We don't even care  
But you just can't be from someplace else  
Unless you go somewhere  
And we're in the same boat  
So as long as it floats  
We might as well stop n' stare  
At the big picture  
The big picture (repeat)  
Get the B-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-g picture  
  
We're almost there  
We're gonna keep on going  
'til that new age dawns  
Always keeping an eye on the stars in the sky  
In case one starts to fall  
And we're in the same boat  
As the ones who can't float  
So they might freak out and sink us all  
And miss the big picture  
(going round the world)  
The big picture  
(got to get it now)  
Like a fish in the water  
You don't know where you've been  
'til you jump out and take a look around  
At the B-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-g picture
