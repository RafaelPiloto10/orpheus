[Chorus:]  
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?  
If you want it, come and see me  
I aint got nothing but time  
One day you're gonna set me free  
But first you gotta let me shine  
Niggas aint high as I be  
See, look momma I'm flyin'  
  
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland  
I'll probably never land  
Neverland, Neverland, noo, I'll never never land  
  
[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Check my fortune cookie, it's that Cole World  
Could that mean it's meant to be?  
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur  
This life is f-cking with me mentally  
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me  
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies  
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me  
My bad girl sayin' f-ck all that, enter me  
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies  
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee  
Anything to take my mind off  
I logged on and made them muthaf-ckas sign off  
I got the on my dick they'll never climb off  
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)  
I don't know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans  
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
I'm sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together  
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever  
I gotta make it to the top, it's either now or never  
These other niggas can't adapt because they not as clever  
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better  
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter  
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather  
And, so sick they can't fix this with medi-cine  
We at yo door and she gotta let us in  
It's what you want, I whet your appetite  
Cole hit the scene now I'm what everyone rapping like  
Shame you feel you have to bite  
Still aint nobody snapping right  
Pedal to the metal as I'm speeding through the traffic lights  
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already  
Still fight like I'm the underdog, I'm on already  
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, ya'll already already  
  
[Chorus:]
