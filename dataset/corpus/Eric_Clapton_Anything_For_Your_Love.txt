God's got a plan, he's making it clear  
Sweet little love song in your ear  
Like hearts made of diamond, love will prevail  
Put a little wind in your sail  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of  
I'd do anything, anything for your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
Listen now baby, I'll tell you true  
Just how much that I love you  
I got a sweet feelin' I know is real  
This kind of love you can't conceal  
  
[Chorus: x2]
