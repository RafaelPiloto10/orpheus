I had a match  
But she had a lighter  
I had a flame  
But she had a fire  
I was bright  
But she was much brighter  
I was high  
But she was the sky  
  
Oh baby  
I was bound for Mexico  
Oh baby  
I was bound to let you go  
  
I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo  
I'm never sure what it's all about  
But I say I want you  
And you don't believe me  
You say you want me  
But I've got my doubts  
  
Oh baby  
I was bound for Mexico  
Oh baby  
I was bound to let you go  
  
I had a match  
But she had a lighter  
I had a flame  
But she had a fire  
I was bright  
But she was much brighter  
I was high  
But she was the sky  
  
Oh baby  
I was bound for Mexico  
Oh baby  
I was bound to let you go  
  
(All right)
