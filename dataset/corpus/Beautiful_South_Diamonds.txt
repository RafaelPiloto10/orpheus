Little sister don't you cry  
Lay your head down, close your eyes  
Your heart is aching, mine is aching for you  
  
Little sister don't you cry  
Lay your head down close your eyes  
and dream of when before your man looked at you  
diamonds always shine  
  
you'll find true love again  
the mud gets washed off with the rain  
diamonds always shine  
  
little sister look at me  
do you see the lines around my eyes?  
they trace the tracks of the tears, i cried inside  
for a boy who loved me true  
who found some how like you  
he could not see the point in going on  
diamonds always shine  
  
you'll find true love again  
the mud gets washed off with the rain  
diamonds always shine  
diamonds always shine
