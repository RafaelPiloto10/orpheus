A diamond sun cuts down a frozen winter sky  
As the world and I go screaming into the phantom night  
It doesn't matter where it leads, I got nowhere left to go  
If there's any chance at all, it's somewhere down this road  
  
[Chorus]  
To be wild again, no one's child again  
Yeah I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again  
Oh to be wild again  
  
The fading light is cold on the shoulders of the trees  
Oh the star wind blows right through me, and I never felt so free  
Oh there had to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line  
And it came down to the question, is this life I'm livin' mine  
  
Had to be wild again, no one's child again  
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin  
I want to find the edge, risk it all to win  
I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again (Fire again)  
I want to be wild again (Wild again)  
  
There has to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line  
And it comes down to the question, what is theirs and what is mine  
  
Wild again, no one's child again  
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin  
I want to find the edge, risk it all to win  
I want to see those eyes in the mirror, burn with life again (Life again)  
Yeah  
I want to be wild (Wild again), let the change begin  
I want to find the edge, risk it all, want to burn with life again  
want to be wild again, yeah, I want to be wild again  
Wild again
