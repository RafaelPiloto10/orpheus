So much pain and no good reason why  
You've cried until the tears run dry  
And nothing here can make you understand  
The one thing that you held so dear  
Is slipping from your hands  
And you say  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
Why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere down the road  
There'll be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
Somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
And they will hold the answers at the end of the road  
  
Yesterday I thought I'd seen it all  
I thought I'd climbed the highest wall  
Now I see the learning never ends  
And all I know to do is keep on walking  
Walking 'round the bend, saying  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
And why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, keep on walkin' now  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
And why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
All I know to say now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, they will hold the answers at the end of the road  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, keep on walkin' now  
Ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh walkin' down the road  
Walkin' down the road  
Somewhere down this lonely road  
Can't see it now  
Down the lonely road  
Somewhere down the lonely road
