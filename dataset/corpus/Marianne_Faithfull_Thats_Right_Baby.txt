That's right baby,  
It seems to me you've won.  
Slip tight, baby,  
You had a lot of fun.  
  
You tried to make a fool of me  
And I'm the fool who just couldn't see.  
  
That's right baby,  
Laugh until you cry.  
Good night baby,  
But may I ask you why?  
  
I gave you everything I had  
Babe, that couldn't be so bad?  
  
I wonder why there's no tear in your eye.  
I wonder why there's love left for me.  
  
That's right baby  
Get it while you can.  
Look right baby  
You'll see with another man.  
  
While you're waiting all alone  
You'll try to call but I won't be home.
