(Michelle)  
The building turned it's back ignored my call,  
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall,  
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene,  
I counted people as I neared the street below,  
Whoa-oa-oa  
Below  
Whoa-oa-oa  
  
(Avril)  
I saw it all I saw it all go down,  
The shadow grew as he approached the ground,  
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene,  
They turned away as he came near the street below,  
Whoa-oa-oa  
Below  
Whoa-oa-oa  
Below

Lets forget this all move on  
  
(Avril)  
Lets forget this all move on  
  
(Michelle)  
Lets forget this all move on

Lets forget this all move on
