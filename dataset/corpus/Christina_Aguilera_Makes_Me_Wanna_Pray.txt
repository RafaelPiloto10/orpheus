He-hey, he-hey, oh  
Oh yeah  
Well, all right  
He-hey  
  
What is this feeling coming over me?  
I'm taken back in disbelief  
Is this really me, ha, in the mirror I see  
Staring back at me?  
Could it be? A new reflection of a woman complete  
  
All of a sudden I'm so carefree (well, all right)  
'Cause love is doing something strange to me (well, all right)  
Got a new flame, ha, haven't been the same  
Something in me's changed, rearranged  
And I feel that I've been saved  
  
You got me feeling like you're that something I've been missing  
Everything's heaven 'cause life with you has been a blessing  
  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah  
(Who knew, who knew)  
It'd be you to restore my faith?  
Everyday, I'm amazed  
And it makes me wanna get down and pray  
Makes me wanna get down and pray  
Said, it makes me wanna get down and pray  
Yeah, hey  
  
I've kept some company I shouldn't have (well, all right)  
Made some mistakes, but that's in the past (well, all right)  
I'm professing here to you  
Proof that I am through  
  
I'm coming clean  
Now I can breathe  
And I finally believe, yeah  
  
You got me thinking I'll be all right, and you're the reason  
Oh, I can feel it: we're moving in a new direction  
  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah  
(Who knew, who knew)  
It'd be you to restore my faith?  
Everyday, I'm amazed  
And it makes me wanna get down and pray  
Makes me wanna get down and pray  
Said, it makes me wanna get down and pray  
Makes me wanna get down and pray  
Makes me wanna get down and pray  
  
Oh  
Where would I be, where would I be  
Without you by my side?  
Where would I be, where would I be  
Without you standing by?  
  
Makes me wanna (pray)  
Makes me need to (pray)  
When I'm feeling low and all alone  
You're the light in my day, yeah  
  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Your love has brought me into a higher place, oh yeah  
(Who knew, who knew)  
It'd be you to restore my faith?  
Everyday, I'm amazed  
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray  
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray  
Makes me wanna get down and pray  
  
Woo, thank you father!  
  
Wanna lift my hands up and pray  
'Cause every time I'm hearing your name  
Wanna reach out and rejoice  
Sound of your voice, yeah  
  
Hey, yeah  
All right  
That's it
