His blood's on stone  
It's running down the frozen wall  
His hand's so cold  
He's trying not to fall  
Oh, will he make it now  
One slip and he's lost  
It's his last chance for freedom  
It's all that he's got  
He feels good, so right  
Hot sweat on a cold night  
Breaking free into the wind  
He's got nothing to lose, just win  
He's just a runaway  
He's free now and on his way  
He's almost home  
Just one push and  
He'll take this wall  
It's blood on stone  
From trying not to fall  
He's made it now  
Where others have not  
Just one last jump to freedom  
Is all that he's got
