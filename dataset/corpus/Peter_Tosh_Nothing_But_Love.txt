Mash it up now  
That's exactly what we gonna do  
Make it good  
  
You are so beautiful  
You are so wonderful  
And you can make your dreams  
Make them come true  
  
You get through everything  
And cast a laugh and sing  
You can do anything  
That you want to  
  
You bring the sunshine when it's dark  
With nothing but love sweet love  
And make me smile and say it's fine  
When I haven't got a dime  
Love, true love  
And when things are going wrong  
We can fix it with a song  
I know we can now  
  
We gonna do it  
You don't need expensive furs  
You don't need no diamonds and pearls  
You don't need that witchcraft world  
To make your dreams come true  
  
You don't need no Cadillac car  
You don't have to be no movie star  
Just what you are  
And I know that you make it through  
  
You are the essence of  
Everything I love  
Oh baby oh baby  
  
It's a positive vibration  
Going in circulation  
We gonna give it to the nation  
Through this evaporation  
  
I feel it deep, deep down inside
