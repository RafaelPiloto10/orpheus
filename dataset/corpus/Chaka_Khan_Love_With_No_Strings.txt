I, I can't explain  
How ya got inside my system  
But I feel the sweetest pain  
I, I can't do that  
But I got to break this tension  
If it makes you feel the same  
  
An ordinary woman  
That's all I am  
And I think I'm falling  
For an ordinary man  
  
Take me to your heart  
When the love begins  
You and I can only try  
To make a love with no strings  
Take me to your heart  
When the story ends  
You and I we can't deny  
We're making love with no strings  
No conductor  
Could've played this situation  
Better than a fool or millionaire  
I won't tie you down  
With a little love and affection  
All I want to do is share  
  
A little time together  
Maybe holding hands  
An ordinary woman  
And an ordinary man  
  
Take me to your heart  
When the love begins  
You and I could say goodbye  
And we'll always be friends  
Take me to your heart  
When the story ends  
You and I we can't deny  
We got a love with no strings
