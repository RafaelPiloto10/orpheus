Try to remember, the echoes and embers  
Are heavy on my mind  
The pictures are broken, the front door is open  
The scars are left behind  
Tables turn you once they burning  
Leaving me undone  
A vision shaking till I break I  
Swear to God more words, could you just hear me  
Just really hear me  
  
I've been drowning in the sea  
Of tryna please you  
It's all I'll ever be, it's all I ever knew  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
  
Music is hurting, the drugs aren't working  
Walls come crushing down  
Another rejection, my insurrection  
It's crawling back somehow  
Tables turn these words they burn I  
Never should have come  
A vision shaking till I break I  
Swear to God more words, could you just hear me  
No, really hear me  
  
I've been drowning in the sea  
Of tryna please you  
It's all I'll ever be, it's all I ever knew  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
I'm not how I used to be,  
I'm changing 'cause of you  
I'm screaming just to breathe  
It's all I can do  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
Anymore, find a way, hey, hey  
Anymore, find a way to bear  
It's all that I can see, it's all that I can do  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
  
I've been drowning in a sea  
Of tryna please you  
It's all I'll ever be, it's all I ever knew  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
I'm not how I used to be,  
I'm changing 'cause of you  
I'm screaming just to breathe  
It's all I can do  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you
