Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
Everywhere I wanna go, you don't wanna go  
Everything I wanna do. You don't wanna do  
Hy are you so hard to please?  
Must I wear out my knees?  
  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
I'll do anything to help you get your kicks  
But I'm scrapin' the bottom of my bag of tricks  
Oh, and I have needs to fulful an occasional thrill.  
  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
Woh, Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'  
  
Woh, Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you...
