Like a million little doorways  
All the choices we made  
All the stages we passed through  
All the roles we played  
  
For so many different directions  
Our separate paths might have turned  
With every door that we opened  
Every bridge that we burned  
  
Somehow we find each other  
Through all that masquerade  
Somehow we found each other  
Somehow we have stayed  
In a state of grace  
  
I don't believe in destiny  
Or the guiding hand of fate  
I don't believe in forever  
Or love as a mystical state  
  
I don't believe in the stars or the planets  
Or angels watching from above  
But I believe there's a ghost of a chance  
We can find someone to love  
And make it last  
  
Like a million little crossroads  
Through the back streets of youth  
Each time we turn a new corner  
A tiny moment of truth  
  
So many different connections  
Our separate paths might have made  
With every door that we opened  
Every game we played  
  
Somehow we find each other  
Through all that masquerade  
Somehow we found each other  
Somehow we have stayed  
In a state of grace
