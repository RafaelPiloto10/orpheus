How can I be drunk?  
You strike with dry poison  
I am possessed  
Still engaged in some kind of advanced shackling  
  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out, Bad Medicine  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out, Good Medicine would say  
  
You got you a fast horse darlin'  
But all you do is complain it ain't a Maserati.  
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis  
But your mama ain't New York she is pure  
Tennessee  
  
On a desert highway  
I am struck by my own rage  
Time-bomb in his palm a finger-apple  
Augments this advanced shackling  
  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out, bad medicine  
Girl you got to find you the man who  
Can smoke this out, good medicine would say  
  
You got you a fast horse darlin'  
But all you do is complain it ain't a Maserati.  
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis  
But your mama ain't New York she is pure  
Can't you see your mama ain't New York  
She is pure Tennessee  
Tennessee
