He killed many a man  
And he roamed over the Scarsdale range  
Robbin' from the rich  
And givin' to the poor  
He was dark and cold and full of rage  
Oh yes he was, sing with me  
Poor Jesse had a wife  
To mourn for his life  
And three children  
They were oh so brave  
But that dirty little coward  
He went and shot Mr. Howard  
Laid poor Jesse in his grave yeah  
  
It was on a Saturday night  
When Jesse was at home  
Talking to old railroad Jed  
Along come Robert Ford  
Like a thief in the night  
And he shot poor Jesse in the back  
  
Poor Jesse had a wife  
To mourn for his life  
Three children  
They were oh so brave  
But that dirty little coward  
He went and shot Mr. Howard  
Laid poor Jesse in his grave yeah  
He lays  
Six feet under the ground
