How the mind does shout for rest  
When the bodies shaken, yeah  
Oh the tightness in my chest  
Still your leaves I'm raking  
  
Lord is this a test  
Was it fun creating, yeah?  
My god's a little sick  
And he wants me crazy  
  
Who  
Are you  
Who can say  
It's ok to live through me?  
  
Live to be  
Part of me  
You're a wrinkled magazine  
Yeah  
  
Was it something that I said?  
Was it how they're breaking, yeah  
I'm so selfish, paying your rent  
While your blood I'm taking  
  
You  
Spend me  
Like a tree  
Dirty dollar bills for leaves  
Dark in a sea  
Of my seeds  
And the tears on which you feed  
  
You feed  
  
The body is a temple  
A dormant alter  
To where infantile men lie around  
Itching and nibbling  
For a small piece of sanity  
Of which you can not give  
  
Shit!  
  
Individuality  
Buying pennies with my soul  
And a little Heaven spent  
While the Hell I'm taking  
  
Thieves  
Parasites  
Hide from life  
You know they'll remember me  
  
They are abhored  
In self-worth  
All that matters much to me
