I've got you under my skin  
I've got you deep in the heart of me  
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I've tried so not to give in  
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well  
So why should I try to resist, when darling I know so well  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of having you near  
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night  
And repeats, repeats in my ear  
  
Don't you know little fool, you never can win  
Use your mentality, wake up to reality  
But each time I do, just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin
