Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch  
Just half-past noon, trying to figure out just what he's doing  
Why he had to grow up so soon  
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?  
There's got to be some way out of here  
He says, "Man, this life is cruel"  
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life  
She changed her name, her face  
Because the grass looked greener on the other side  
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night  
Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything  
My next door neighbor Donnie  
Died in his room just the other day  
His brother come home  
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein  
Cops come down with a body bag  
They said Donnie was a casualty  
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out  
He couldn't handle reality  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr. I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything
