Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
Led on their way  
By this triumphant sign,  
The hosts of God  
In conquering ranks combine.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
Each newborn servant  
Of the Crucified  
Bears on the brow  
The seal of Him who died.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
O Lord, once lifted  
On the glorious tree,  
As Thou hast promised  
Draw the world to Thee.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
So shall our song  
Of triumph ever be:  
Praise to the Crucified  
For victory.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name...
