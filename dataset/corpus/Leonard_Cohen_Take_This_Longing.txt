Many men have loved the bells  
You fastened to the rein,  
And everyone who wanted you  
They found what they will always want again.  
Your beauty lost to you yourself  
Just as it was lost to them.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
Whatever useless things these hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one you love.  
  
Your body like a searchlight  
My poverty revealed,  
I would like to try your charity  
Until you cry, "Now you must try my greed."  
And everything depends upon  
How near you sleep to me  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue  
All the lonely things my hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one your love.  
  
Hungry as an archway  
Through which the troops have passed,  
I stand in ruins behind you,  
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.  
I love to see you naked over there  
Especially from the back.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Untie for me your hired blue gown,  
Like you would do for one that you love.  
  
You're faithful to the better man,  
I'm afraid that he left.  
So let me judge your love affair  
In this very room where I have sentenced  
Mine to death.  
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves  
That he's shaken from his head.  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Let me see your beauty broken down,  
Like you would do for one you love.  
Like you would do for one you love.
