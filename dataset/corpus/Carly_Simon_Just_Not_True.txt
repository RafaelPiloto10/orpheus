You stick to me when I wish you gone  
You hammer on my thoughts through dreams  
Your plot is thick with saucy schemes  
And ways to reach my balconies  
But I say I'm not turned on by the way you look  
I say I'm not turned on by the way you act  
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you need me  
But sometimes, just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know, It's just not true  
  
You're in my blood, a Holy Ghost  
I scream, but it's a hollow plea  
The thoughts I swallow leave me thirsty  
You do a very fine imitation of me  
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you laugh  
I'm not turned on by the way you smile  
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you love me  
But sometimes, just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know, it's just not true  
  
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you dance  
I'm not turned on my the way you laugh  
I'm not turned on when you need me  
But sometimes, just sometimes  
You can see the softness in my eyes  
And you know, it's just not true.
