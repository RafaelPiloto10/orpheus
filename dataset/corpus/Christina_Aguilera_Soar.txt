When they push when they pull  
Tell me you can hold on  
When they say you should change  
Can you lift your head high,  
And stay strong  
Will you give up, give in,  
When your hearts crying out,  
That it's wrong  
Will you love you for you  
At the end of it all  
  
In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin' that  
The one thing we should know is  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be scared to fly alone  
Find a path that is your own  
Love will open every door  
Its in your hands  
The world is your  
Don't hold back and always know  
All the answers will unfold  
What are you waiting for  
Spread your wings and soar  
  
The boy who wonders  
Is he good enough for them  
Keeps tryin' to please em' all  
But he just never seems to fit in  
Then there's the girl who thinks  
She'll never be good enough for him  
Keeps tryin' to change  
And that's a game she'll never win  
  
Now In life there's going to be times  
When you're feeling low  
And in your mind insecurity  
Seems to take control  
We start to look outside ourselves  
For acceptance and approval  
We keep forgettin' that  
The one thing we should know is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the mirror  
Is where she come face to face  
With her fears  
Her reflection-so foreign to her  
After all these years  
All of her life she has tried to be something  
Besides herself  
Now time has passed  
And she's ended up someone else with regret  
  
What is it in us that makes us feel the need  
To keep pretending  
Gotta let ourselves be  
  
[Chorus: x2]
