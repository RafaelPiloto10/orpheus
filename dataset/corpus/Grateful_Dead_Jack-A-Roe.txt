There was a wealthy merchant, in london he did dwell  
He had a beautiful daughter, the truth to you well tell  
Oh the truth to you well tell  
  
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree  
But none but jack the sailor, her true love ever be  
Oh her true love ever be  
  
Jackies gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind  
Hes left his native country and his darling girl behind  
Oh his darling girl behind  
  
She went down to a tailor shop and dressed in mans array  
She climbed on board a vessel to convey herself away  
Oh convey herself away  
  
Before you get on board sir, your name wed like to know  
She smiled on her countenance, they called me jack-a-roe  
Oh they called me jack-a-roe  
  
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small  
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball  
Oh to face the cannonball  
  
I know my waists to slender, my fingers they are small  
But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall  
Oh to see ten thousand fall  
  
The war soon being over she went and looked around  
Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found  
Oh her darling boy she found  
  
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town  
She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds  
Oh to quickly heal his wounds  
  
This couple they got married so well they did agree  
This couple they got married so why not you and me?  
Oh why not you and me?  
Oh why not you and me?
