Don't give up when you feel you are far away  
You can lose yourself in the sound like it's yesterday  
When the world won't stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on, we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone,  
  
Bring us back in time, to what we love.  
Chorus:  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
Don't give up, don't believe it could ever change  
You're not alone and everybody it feels the same  
When the world won't stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on, we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone,  
Bring us back in time, to what we love.  
Chorus:  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
Keeps us together and keep us strong  
When we're together music plays on and on.  
[Chorus:]  
When we ahh, when we ahh  
When we ahh, when we ahh  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
And he's what we all belong
