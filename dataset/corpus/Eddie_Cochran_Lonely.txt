Lonely (lonely), lonely (lonely)  
Lonely is the man, who walks alone  
And lonely is the man, who has no home  
And lonely, lonely, lonely am I  
I am so lonely, wish I could die (lonely)  
I asked the Lord up above (lonely)  
What is this thing, mortals call love  
And why can't I have one of my own  
I am so lonely, so all alone  
  
Lonely is the bird, without a tree  
And lonely is the sailor, without the sea  
I asked the Lord up above (lonely)  
What is this thing, mortals call love  
And why can't I have one of my own  
I am so lonely, so all alone
