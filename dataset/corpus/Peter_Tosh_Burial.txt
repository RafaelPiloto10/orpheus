You're only acting like  
You are somebody  
But I don't no say  
You know nobody  
  
You're only a show off  
Your painted face, yeah  
But underneath that face  
Your just a disgrace  
  
[Chorus]  
You're just a brand new second hand gal  
No man no wan' no  
Brand new second hand gal  
You better go back around so  
You're just a brand new second hand gal  
  
You think it's the dress you wear  
That make you a lady  
Get that out of your mind gal  
You must be crazy  
  
Mama used to tell me  
Long time ago yeah  
Not everything you see glitter is gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See you watch them pass I  
Well hidy-tidy  
But them no-no say  
You very nasty  
  
Look 'pon you foot back  
Look how them tough, yeah  
And you chaw bone favor  
Spanish town handcuff  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dick know 'bout you  
And tom do  
And harry just 'round the corner  
Know 'bout you too  
  
He got a police buk  
Them want I

Of taking people's business on your head,yeah  
So might as well you be dead  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let the dead bury the dead now  
And who is to be fed, be fed  
I ain't got no time to waste on you, no,no

That the rich man heaven is the poor man's hell  
You must see want I fe com'a com'a funeral
