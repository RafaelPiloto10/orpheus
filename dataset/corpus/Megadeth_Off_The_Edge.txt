Lately, it seems the world is going crazy  
It won't be long till they replace me  
And nothing seems to faze me, anymore  
  
I can't take it, I get the feeling I won't make it  
I'm feeling bad and I can't shake it  
And now I'm living just to fake it, what's more  
  
Which way is right? Come with me  
Which way is wrong? Come with me  
Which way is up? Come with me  
Which way is down?  
  
Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy  
I'm falling off the edge  
  
Lately, I wake each morning feeling beat  
And now there's panic in the street  
Someone keeps turning up the beat everywhere  
  
Every day, I'm like an actor on the stage  
I'll never let you see my rage  
I'm not at peace out of my cage anywhere  
  
Which way is right? Come with me  
Which way is wrong? Come with me  
Which way is up? Come with me  
Which way is down?  
  
Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy  
I'm falling off the edge  
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy  
We're falling off the edge  
  
Lately, I can't believe the things I see  
This ignorance and apathy  
Brings out the lunatic in me, if you care?  
  
It blows my mind, when you sneak off into the night  
Maybe it's better that you lie  
Just don't forget to say goodbye, if you dare?  
  
Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy  
I'm falling off the edge  
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy  
We're falling off the edge
