[Chorus:]  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
  
I'm a lonely hunter, a hungry ghost  
When you call a passion you must pay the host  
Look upon me as I thunder, I wonder if you wonder  
How it feels to be the lonely hunter  
  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
The wind blows clouds across my cheek  
My collar's up and my coat is sleek  
  
Look upon me as I blunder, I wonder if you wonder  
How it feels to be the lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]
