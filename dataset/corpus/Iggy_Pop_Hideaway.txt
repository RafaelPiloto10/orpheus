I need to touch  
A live unbeaten earth  
So that's where I'm going  
I know a town in N.W. Mexico  
Where the sun is gold and life exists  
Hideaway hideaway truly  
Hideaway hideaway truly  
  
My country got  
Raped by big industry  
We'll just have to wing it  
The concrete strips raw greed and king tv  
They say 'so what' I say 'so this'  
Hideaway hideaway truly  
Hideaway hideaway truly  
  
I can hear children voices playing in a yard  
When I hear children voices my feelings aren't so hard  
  
Your honest face  
Your quiet simple grace  
You are one thing  
I will not waste  
Hideaway hideaway truly  
Hideaway hideaway truly
