I said I'd leave you anytime I'm ready  
Some April when all the land is wet  
Some summer, some fall, or maybe winter  
I'll go someday, but I'm not ready yet  
I should've left the day your love was dyin'  
I passed up every date I ever set  
I know I'll leave you when my heart is ready  
I'm still around, 'cause I'm not ready yet  
Well, I've left a hundred times, but you don't know that  
Because I'm ashamed to tell how far I get  
You didn't, you don't, you'll never love me  
And someday I'll go, but I'm not ready yet  
I should've left the day your love was dyin'  
I passed up every date I ever set  
I know I'll leave you when my heart is ready  
I'm still around, 'cause I'm not ready yet
