If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?  
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?  
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?  
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?  
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad  
Smile with me when I'm glad  
And always be as you are with me tonight  
  
Think it over and be sure  
Please don't answer 'til you do  
When you promise all these things to me  
Then I'll give my heart to you  
  
If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care?  
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair?  
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love?  
Will you swear that you'll be true to me by the light that shines above?  
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad  
Smile with me when I'm glad  
And always be as you are with me tonight  
  
Think it over and be sure  
Please don't answer 'til you do  
When you promise all these things to me  
Then I'll give my heart to you
