Hello again hello  
Just called to say hello  
I couldn't sleep at all tonight  
And I know it's late  
But I couldn't wait  
Hello my friend hello  
Just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
While I'm here alone  
And you're there at home  
Hello  
  
Maybe it's been crazy  
And maybe I'm to blame  
But I put my heart above my head.  
We've been through it all  
And loved me just the same  
When you're not there  
I just need to hear  
Hello my friend hello  
It's good to need you so  
It's good to love you  
Like I do  
And to feel this way  
When I hear you say  
Hello  
  
Hello my friend hello  
Just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
And I know it's late  
But I couldn't wait  
Hello...
