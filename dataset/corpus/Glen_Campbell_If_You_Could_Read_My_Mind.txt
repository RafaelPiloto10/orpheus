If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like and o-old time mo-ovie 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well  
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet  
You know that ghost is me  
And I won't ever be set free as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see  
  
If I could read your mind, love, what a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paper back novel, the kind the drug store sells  
When you reach the part, where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me, but heroes often fail  
And you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take  
  
I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script  
Enter number two  
A movie queen to play the scene f bringing all the good things out in me  
But for now, love, let's be real  
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't
get it  
I don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just can't get it
back  
  
If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like and o-old time mo-ovie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well  
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet  
Girl, but stories always end  
If you could read between the lines you'd know that I'm just tryin' to
understand  
The feeling's that you lack  
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't
get it  
I don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just can't get it
back
