I'm goin' out to Denver  
See if I can't find  
I'm goin' out to Denver  
See if I can't find  
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine  
  
The promise in her smile  
Shames the mountains tall  
The promise in her smile  
Shames the mountains tall  
She bring the sun to shining  
Tell the rain to fall  
  
It's been a long time, mama,  
Since I heard you call my name  
Ah, been a long time  
Since I heard you call my name  
I got to see my Colorado girl again  
  
Be there tomorrow  
Mama, don't you cry  
Be there tomorrow  
Now, mama, don't you cry  
I got to kiss these  
Lonesome Texas blues good-bye  
  
I'm goin' out to to Denver  
See if I can't find  
I'm goin' out to to Denver  
See if I can't find  
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine  
That lovin' Colorado girl of mine
