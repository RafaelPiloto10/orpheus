Lie to me  
Tell me that everything will be all right  
(Who-o-a) Lie to me  
Don't say it didn't mean anything  
1-2-3 GO!  
I should have known when my kicks  
Crossed the hinge on your door  
That you had something more in store  
Implore  
Do not push my back up to the wall  
Do not push my back up to the wall  
This is a set up  
Rush adrenaline  
Fake, phony, fed up  
Bass, Alkaline  
This is a set up  
Waste everything  
You never told me  
'Til the pressure started building  
You never told me  
I was wrong  
I was right  
I was right  
You never told me  
'Til the building started shaking  
Now I'm surrounded on all sides  
Lie to me  
Tell me that everything will be all right  
(Whoa) Lie to me  
Don't say it didn't mean anything  
Lie to me  
Killing joke cause your smile was the calm to the storm  
And the ties that bind have been torn  
I said  
Do not push my back to the wall  
Do not push my back to the wall  
[Repeat Chorus]  
You take this for granted  
Right?  
And I never wanted anybody else  
You took this all for granted  
You took it all
