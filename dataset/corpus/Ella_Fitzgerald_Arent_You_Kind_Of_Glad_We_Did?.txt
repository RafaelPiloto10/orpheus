Oh, it really wasn't my intention  
To disregard convention  
It was just an impulse  
That had to be obeyed  
Though it seems convention we've been scorning  
I'll still not go in mourning  
Though my reputation  
Is blemished, I'm afraid  
With just one kiss  
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss  
Honestly, I thought you wouldn't  
Naturally, you thought you couldn't  
And probably we shouldn't  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Actually, it all was blameless  
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless  
So let's keep the lady nameless  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Socially, I'll be an outcast  
Obviously, we dined alone  
On my good name there will be doubt cast  
With never a sign of any chaperon  
No matter how they may construe it  
Whether or not, we have to rue it  
Whatever made us do it  
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?  
  
Whatever made us do it  
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?
