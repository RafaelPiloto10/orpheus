Once I knew a man, showed me the sleight of hand  
In the blink of an eye he danced across the strings  
He played a song I'd never heard, poignant and absurd  
And to this day it leaves me wondering  
  
Don't let tomorrow find you wishing  
Boy, you got a mission to shake it, rattle and roll  
Oh now, just use your intuition  
You'll get less competition from the clock upon the wall  
  
You are what you are, you dream what you dream  
Play on your blue guitar for me  
Play me a serenade, a simple masquerade  
Play on your blue guitar for me  
  
Was he real or make believe or someone to deceive  
That time is just a folly we can't see  
You only know one song, play it right or wrong  
Cause the truth is always somewhere in between  
  
You and I, we can't change the weather  
And we're all in this together so let the strong wind blow  
Oh now, things will be much better  
If you don't become a prisoner to the reason you should know you know  
  
Are what you are, you dream what you dream  
Play on your blue guitar for me  
Play me a serenade, a lover's masquerade  
Play on your blue guitar for me
