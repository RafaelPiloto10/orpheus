You couldn't dance at all  
But now you're over ball  
The way Texas hop  
The way you jump and rock  
(Talk to me, baby)  
  
You're doin' fine, Henry  
The way you jump and rock  
(Alright)  
You're doin' fine, Henry  
The way you do the bop  
But how am I doin' now?  
And everything is alright  
  
But when we do the boogie woogie  
Shake it all night long  
When we do the boogie woogie  
Shake it all night long  
Shake it, shake it, Henry  
Till the band goes home  
  
Henry, oh, Henry  
Love the way you jump and rock  
(Alright)  
Henry, oh Henry  
Love the way you Texas hop  
But how am I doin' now?  
And everything is alright  
  
Well, well, well, well, baby  
The dance you're doin' is movin' me  
Well, let's dance and rock till the rooster crows  
And we'll rest a while, dance some more  
  
You're doin' fine, Henry  
The way you jump and rock  
You're doin' fine, Henry  
The way you do the bop  
But how am I doin' now?  
And everything is alright  
  
Well, well, well, well, baby  
The dance you're doin' is movin' me  
Let's dance and rock till the rooster crows  
And we'll rest a while, dance some more  
  
You're doin' fine, Henry  
The way you jump and rock  
(Alright, baby)  
You're doin' fine, Henry  
The way you do the bop  
(Okay)  
  
But how am I doin' now? Alright  
How am I doin' now? Alright  
How am I doin' now?  
Everything is alright
