Your eyes say  
You've been heartache and more  
I know 'cause girl  
I've walked that road before  
But baby,  
You can just forget  
That word called cry  
'Cause I'll be there right beside you  
  
And, I got love for you,  
Baby all I got to give.  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
Let me see your smile now, girl  
  
Baby don't look back  
To where you've been  
It won't ever be that way again  
There's not a lot of things  
That I got plenty of  
But love believe what I'm sayin',  
  
Cause, I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
It's gotta be alright now  
  
There'll be no one doin' you harm  
No, don't be afraid, child  
Love, you're safe in my arms  
Gonna be no hurt, never no more  
No pain, not like before  
No fears, baby, for sure  
Just love forever more  
  
Cause, I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
So hold me tight now  
So hold me tight now,  
Baby......
