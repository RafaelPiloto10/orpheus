[Verse 1]  
I don't have much to give but I don't care for gold  
What use is money when you need someone to hold?  
Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road  
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You'll never know the endless nights  
The rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind  
And watch you call his name  
  
[Chorus]  
Pack up and leave everything  
Don't you see what I can bring?  
Can't keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight terror free and I will give you all of me  
Just leave your lover, leave him for me  
Leave your lover, Leave him for me.  
  
[Verse 2]  
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old  
I'm in love with you and you will never know,  
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone  
Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You'll never know the endless nights  
The rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name  
  
[Chorus]  
Pack up and leave everything  
Don't you see what I can bring?  
Can't keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight terror free and I will give you all of me  
Leave your lover, leave him for me  
Leave your lover, leave him for me.
