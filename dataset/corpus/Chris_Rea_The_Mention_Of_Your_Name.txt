Time goes by and every single tear  
It must have well run dry  
And the lonely nights  
Become a strange accepted way  
  
And the years go past  
Just like the old song says  
The pain with time has healed, it couldn't last  
But oh a friend like a fool  
Mentions your name  
  
Sunny days, drunken nights  
You smile and say, it's alright  
But oh the cold cold rain  
At the mention of your name  
  
Forgive me please  
If I shrug my shoulders  
When I put my friend at ease  
As I get older  
  
It's not that I don't feel colder than before  
Oh I've become so good at hiding  
What I feel without confiding  
It's still the same, darling still the same  
At the mention of your name
