When dormant eyes burst open  
So we can see the way  
Destiny has spoken  
And there's hell to pay  
The sceptics light the candles  
For the eternal right  
Blinded faith's are broken  
Ghosts of father's die  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day  
The message burns the answer  
On the bones of the dead  
Without the necromancers  
Hope hangs from a thread  
The chaos devastation  
Licks immortal sin  
Mother earth is now ridden  
Of those who pray to win  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day  
In distant darkened orders  
The prophets read the signs  
The overlords move over  
To let the blood move over  
To let the blood life shine  
Erasing false deceptions  
An antidote for lies  
Religious rigormortis  
When man as beast arise  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day
