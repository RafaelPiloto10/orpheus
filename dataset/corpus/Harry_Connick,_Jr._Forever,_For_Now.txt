Meet me on the corner of close and soon  
I'll have a song in my head  
And my hands on a tune  
Nothing lasts forever  
So I figure I better  
Take you forever  
For now  
  
Meet me in the lobby of destiny  
I'll have a ribbon on my shoulders  
And a halo over me  
If nothing lasts forever  
I guess I better  
Take you forever  
For now  
  
Under a clock  
By an information desk  
I'll be there will bells on  
By an old oak  
A fountain in the park  
Just don't be long  
  
By the ticket counter for love in spring  
I'll be standin' there with cupid  
And he can aim that thing  
Nothing lasts forever  
It's not a question of whether  
I'll take you forever  
For now
