I don't give a fuck if yor man is dead  
He fuckin' deserved it! One to da head!  
Niggaz on my block dyin' all time it's natural  
You gon be next and they stay comin' at you!  
What tha fuck? I'm too real for this shit!  
Snitches run like rats and hop up on dick!  
I'm too real for this shit! Like I said before  
And next thing you know cops at my fuckin' door  
So now I gotta live life by tha gun and fire one shot  
And watch yo ass drop!  
Yeah! And let that be a lesson for you bastards  
Takin' ovah tha rap game! The greatest rapper!  
Rest in peace biggie!
