"I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire.  
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his
arms  
And raced through the burning building out to the pavement.  
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in
flames.  
And when it was all over I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to a fire?'"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.  
  
"And when I was 12 years old, my father took me to the circus,  
The greatest show on earth.  
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears  
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.  
And as I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle,  
I had the feeling that something was missing.  
I don't know what, but when it was over I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to a circus?'"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.  
  
"Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world.  
We would take long walks by the river  
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes.  
We were so very much in love. Then one day, he went away.  
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't.  
And when I didn't, I said to myself,  
'Is that all there is to love?'"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
  
"I know what you must be saying to yourselves.  
'If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?'  
Oh, no. Not me. I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment.  
For I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you,  
When that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath,  
I'll be saying to myself"  
  
Is that all there is?  
Is that all there is?  
If that's all there is, my friends,  
Then let's keep dancing.  
Let's break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If that's all there is.
