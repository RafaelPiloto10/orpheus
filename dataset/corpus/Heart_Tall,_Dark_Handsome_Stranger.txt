I'm so tired of these men trying to  
Impress me with nothing  
The same old routine and the smooth  
Fancy talking  
Now I know and believe that I found  
It for real  
'Cause you're good and you're kind and  
You care how I feel  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes  
You're so beautiful  
  
I've been pushed I've been pulled  
I've been put out and trod on  
Just by taking my chances I finally  
Caught on  
When I see in your eyes all the love  
Shining through  
I'm so glad I held out for somebody  
Like you  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes  
  
Heaven must have sent you I know  
You're so good to me  
I feel good with you  
I'd be such a fool to let you go  
There's something about you  
I can't live without you  
  
I've had fast talking good looking men  
At my door  
Now I'm a wiser woman than I was before  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes
