I don't know if I told you, but I'm seeking sanctuary  
You'll never guess the things that I do  
I'll have the devil round for tea  
Don't you know that I'm here beside you  
Can't you see that I can't relax  
When I saw you in my rearview  
You could've stopped me in my tracks  
  
I'll be there for you when you want me to  
I'll stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night it'll be alright  
''cause I'll be there for you when you want me to  
  
You can take me to an island, ride across the stormy sea  
We can worship pagan idols, there together you and me  
Why don't you run over here and rescue me?  
You can drive down in your car  
Why don't we both take a ride and turn that key  
We'll drive at 60 miles an hour  
  
I'll be there for you when you want me to  
I'll stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night it'll be alright  
''cause I'll be there for you when you want me to  
  
I'll be there for you when you want me to  
I'll stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night it'll be alright  
''cause I'll be there for you when you want me to  
  
I'll be there for you when you want me to  
I'll stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night it'll be alright  
''cause I'll be there for you when you want me to  
  
I'll be there for you when you want me to  
I'll stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night it'll be alright  
''cause I'll be there for you when you want me to
