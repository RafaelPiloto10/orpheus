I know you wanna leave me  
But I refuse to let you go  
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy  
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me  
  
Aint to proud to beg, sweet darling  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Now I've heard a crying man is half a man  
With no sense of pride  
But if I have to cry to keep you  
I don't mind weeping  
If it'll keep you by my side  
Aint to proud to beg, sweet darling  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
(Don't you go away)  
Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Aint to proud to beg, sweet darling  
Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
INSTRUMENTAL  
(Don't you go away)  
(Don't you go away)  
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day  
Just to keep you from walking away  
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand  
'Cause I wanna keep you any way I can  
Aint to proud to beg, sweet darling  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Aint to proud to beg, sweet darling  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby  
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go  
Put yourself in my place  
I only for a little while  
Come on, try it, come on, try it  
Come on, try it (try it, try it, try it)  
Put yourself in my place  
I only for a little while  
Come on, try it, come on, try it  
Come on, try it (try it,
