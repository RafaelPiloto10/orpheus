In my life there's places I've seen,  
Places I've been in my life.  
In my life there's things I have done,  
Times I have won in my life.  
  
Ships I have known,  
Winds that have blown.  
  
In my time were people who cared,  
People who shared in my time,  
Welcomed the good accepted the bad,  
Enjoyed what I had in my time.  
  
People I've known  
Times on my own  
  
And now I'm growing old,  
In memory I can hold  
My picture book unfolds and I  
Can feel myself grow cold.  
  
In my life there's times to forget,  
Things to regret in my life,  
May have done wrong but tried to do right  
I followed the light in my life,  
But now the lights grow dim,  
My days are closing in.
