A breakin' these rocks in the hot sun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I wanted money 'cause I had none  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I left my baby and it feels so bad  
Guess my race is run  
She was the best thing, I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
Robbin' people with a six-gun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I left my little baby in good fun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
If I left my baby and it feels so bad  
I guess my race is run  
She was the best thing, I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
If I left my baby and it feels so bad  
And I guess my race is run  
She was the best thing, I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law, law won  
I fought the law, the law won  
I fought the law, the law won  
  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won
