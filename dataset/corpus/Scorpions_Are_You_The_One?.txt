Another rainy morning  
People rushing by  
My head is still in the clouds  
I dream with open eyes  
Suddenly out of nowhere  
She came into my life  
Like we know each other  
For quite a while  
  
In the sound of silence  
Time is standing still  
There's some kind of bond between us  
That's givin' me the chill  
Do you really wonder  
That we can burn the sky  
It's written a thousand years ago  
In the book of life  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's always in my dreams  
The one who keeps me goin'  
When I can't go on  
The one that I've been waiting for  
For so long  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
Suddenly out of nowhere  
She came into my life  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's always in my dreams  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's mine eternally  
The one who keeps me dreamin'  
When I'm sad and tired  
Who gives my life a meaning  
'Til the day I die  
  
Are you the one  
Are you the one
