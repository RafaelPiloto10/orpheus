Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Don't sit around gossiping, explaining what your good man really can do  
Some women nowadays, Lord they ain't no good  
They will laugh in your face, Then try to steal your man from you  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Your best girlfriend, she might be a highbrow, she changes clothes 3 times a
day  
What do you think she's doing now, while you're so far away  
She's loving your man in your own damn bed  
You better call for the doctor, mama, try to investigate your head  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Don't sit around, girl, telling all your secrets,  
Telling all those good things he really can do  
If you talk about your baby, you tell me he's so fine  
Lord honey, I just might sneek up and try to make him mine  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Don't be no fool, don't advertise your man (baby don't do it)
