You come around here  
Trying to make your demand.  
You've got a need, darling,  
I've seen it grow and expand.  
Yeah, you want to reveal my life  
With your own two hands.  
Well, tell me now  
What are you trying to do ?  
Those holes in your life  
Show what you require.  
You're needin' new eyes,  
Oh Lord, honey take any wire ?  
Yeah you've gotta save us all  
Before the next big fire.  
Tell me now  
What are you trying to do ?  
Walked in my life,  
Child, and I don't even know your name.  
You put others around behind ya  
As if they were lame.  
You insist a simple feeling  
Will be all the same.  
Well, tell me now  
What are you trying to do ?  
Now I look like I'm suffering,  
N-n-n-n-n-n-now I'm doing fine.  
One look at yourself baby,  
Child, I got you alive.  
Yeah, you're gonna take care of yours,  
I'll take care of mine.  
What are you trying to do ?
