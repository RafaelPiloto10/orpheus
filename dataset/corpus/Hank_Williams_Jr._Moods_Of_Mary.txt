She speaks with the voice of an angel she smiles a heavenly smile  
Soft as the warm winds of April and pure as the heart of a child  
But that's just one of the moods of Mary one of her faces that I see  
I know about the moods of Mary 'cause one of her moods is me  
  
Mary will lie and deceive me she can be fickle and cold  
She'll offer her lips just to tease me and then give me heartaches untold  
But that's just one of the moods of Mary part of her personality  
I don't mind the moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me  
  
Mary can change like the seasons she can be tender and kind  
Then she hurts me without any reason and drives me out of my mind  
But I can live with the moods of Mary if that's the way it has to be  
I forget the other moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me
