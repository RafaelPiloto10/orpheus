My eyes with your vision  
My choice but always your decision  
My play with your direction  
Well it's my lead but always your connection  
  
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me  
B  
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe  
  
My words, your expression  
My land, always your possession  
My song, your production  
Moby expense is always your deduction  
  
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me  
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe  
  
And the face I see before me  
Is both sides of a mirror  
You really know you've got a hold on me  
And the face you're looking into  
Is both sides of a window  
And any way you look you see through me  
  
My fame, your reflection  
My weakness always your protection  
Well it's my terms on your conditions  
And they're my tunes but they're your compositions  
  
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me  
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe
