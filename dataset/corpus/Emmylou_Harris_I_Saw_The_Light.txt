I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin  
I wouldn't let my dear savior in  
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.  
  
Just like a blind man I wandered a long,  
Worries and fears I claimed for my own.  
Then like the blind man that God gave back my sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I was a fool to wander and stray,  
Straight is the gate and narrow the way  
Now I have traded the wrong for the right  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more in darkness no more in night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light
