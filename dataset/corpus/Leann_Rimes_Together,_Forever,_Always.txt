Life can be distance between us  
Days even years could pass on  
But the love that lies between us will  
Always be worth holdin' on  
  
Together, forever, always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are we're  
Together, forever, always  
  
I could try to forget you but the  
Memories keep lingering on  
But the dreams I dream about  
You keep me holdin' on  
  
Together, forever, always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are we're  
Together, forever, always  
  
Together, forever, always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are we're  
Together, forever, always
