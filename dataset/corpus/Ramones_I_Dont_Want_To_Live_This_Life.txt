Now that you're gone i feel the painmy heart trembles i call your name  
I miss your touch your soft blonde hair i keep searching for an answer  
It just ain't there  
  
And i don't want to live this life and i don't want to live this life  
And i don't want to live this life anymore  
  
Everywhere i turn, the finger points on me you'll never understand i'm in
misery  
'cause baby without you i have no one oh, my sweet darling what have i done  
  
And i don't want to live this life and i don't want to live this life  
And i don't want to live this life anymore  
  
She smiled at me as i held her carefully her last words were "i love you"  
Thought it ser me free and i can't forget that look on her face  
It looked like an angel as she died in my prayers  
  
And i don't want to live this life and i don't want to live this life  
And i don't want to live this life anymore
