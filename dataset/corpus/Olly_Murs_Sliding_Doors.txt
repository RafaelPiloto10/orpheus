He's right in the crossroad so he doesn't notice me  
I'm staring 'cross the room and so is she  
Looking at you I wonder,  
If there's somewhere else you'd rather be  
  
He pays her no attention as he takes another call  
I just want to rescue her from it all  
I wanna rock right over  
Say you don't need him anymore  
  
Let's just pretend  
We're somebody else  
And I was someone  
That you want for yourself  
No secrets that hide  
And we leave the past behind  
Yeah  
  
Why don't we just go  
Walk right out the door  
When we're leaving  
We won't look back anymore  
Why don't we just go, go, go  
Go, go, go  
  
If I was to gamble would I win or would I lose  
Tell you where my thoughts are racing to  
Is it too much to handle  
Or would I be the one you'd choose  
  
Let's just pretend  
We're somebody else  
And I was someone  
That you want for yourself  
No secrets that hide  
And we leave the past behind  
Yeah  
  
Why don't we just go  
Walk right out the door  
When we're leaving  
We won't look back anymore  
  
All these sliding doors  
That we could explore  
All the lifetimes  
When you were mine  
That we lived before  
We've come so close  
But you're so far  
Still I can feel everything that you are  
You're in my head  
You're in my heart  
No happy end if we don't even start
