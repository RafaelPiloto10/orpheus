When I was a young boy I tried to listen  
And I want to feel like that  
Little white shadows blink and I missed em  
Part of a system I am  
  
If you ever feel like something's missing  
Things you'll never understand  
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten  
Part of a system plan  
  
All this noise, I'm waking up  
All this space I'm taking up  
All this sound is breaking up  
  
Whoa oh  
  
Maybe you'll get what you wanted  
Maybe you'll stumble upon it  
Everything you ever wanted  
In a permanent state  
  
Maybe you'll know when you see it  
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it  
And when you find it you'll keep it  
In a permanent state  
A permanent state  
  
When I was a young boy I tried to listen  
Don't you want to feel like that  
  
You're part of the human race  
All of the stars and the outer space  
Part of the system plan  
  
All this noise, I'm waking up  
All this space I'm taking up  
I cannot hear, you're breaking up  
  
Whoa oh  
  
Maybe you'll get what you wanted  
Maybe you'll stumble upon it  
Everything you ever wanted  
In a permanent state  
  
Maybe you'll know when you see it  
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it  
And when you find it you'll keep it  
In a permanent state  
A permanent state  
  
Swimming on a sea of faces  
A tide of the human race  
So, an answer now is what I need  
  
I see it in the new sun rising  
I see it break on your horizon  
Oh come on love, stay with me
