Who maddest one on the M1  
Who hasn't stopped sucking his thumb  
Who very straight and never grins  
Who cares what car he's driving in  
  
He is because he saw it on a commercial break  
And if he doesn't get what  
He wants then he'll get a headache  
Because he needs it, wants it, almost loves it  
He's here on his own, on globe alone  
  
Who joined health club to glisten  
Into hi-fi precision  
Whose mobile phone gives him the bone  
Who very keen on Sharon Stone  
  
Who only eats at the new brasserie  
Who only ever gets merry  
Who wouldn't be seen at bedtime  
Without putting Calvin Kleins on
