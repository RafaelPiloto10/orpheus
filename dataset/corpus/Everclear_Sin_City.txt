Diamonds and dust  
Poor man last, rich man first  
Lamborghinis, caviar  
Dry martinis, shangri-la  
I got a burnin' feelin' deep inside of me  
It's been burnin'  
But I'm gonna set it free  
  
I'm going in to sin city  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
Where the lights are bright  
Do the town tonight  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
  
Ladders and snakes  
Ladders give, snakes take  
Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief  
You ain't got a hope in hell, yeah that's my belief  
  
Fingers freddy, diamond jim  
They're gettin' ready, cause I'm comin' in  
So spin that wheel, cut the crap, and roll those loaded dice  
Bring on the dancin' girls and put the champagne on ice  
  
I'm going in to sin city  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
Where the lights are bright  
Do the town tonight  
I'm going in to sin city
