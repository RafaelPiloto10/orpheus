I'm waiting for the rain  
I'm waiting for you  
I'm waiting for the rain  
To clean my soul  
I'm waiting for the rain  
Nothing's gonna be better  
Without you  
  
The day you left me  
The day you came  
I'll never forget you  
Feel you in my pain  
The time stood still  
The time was flying  
I wonder why  
I'm not dying  
  
I'm waiting for the sun  
I'm waiting for a new day  
I'm waiting for the night  
To close my eyes  
I'm waiting for the dark  
Oh it's gonna be harder  
Without you  
  
The way we danced  
I'll always miss  
I'll never forget  
The way we kissed  
The time stood still  
The time was flying  
I wonder why  
I'm not dying  
  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na
