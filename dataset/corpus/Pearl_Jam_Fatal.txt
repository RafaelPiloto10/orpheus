How good is he?  
How warm are his eyes  
You'll see it's not a reprise  
Did he arrive  
  
Too late and too tethered away  
To put on his suit and his tie?  
How good is he?  
How warm is his heart  
  
Or ego telling him which place to park  
Did he relate, the message is clearly hardly  
Grounds for dismissal outright  
Grounds for dismissal outright  
  
I wake up and wait up  
When anger's in fashion  
I wake up and wait up  
It echoes through the mansions  
  
I wake up and wait up  
When April's in may, oh uh oh  
I wake up and wait up  
The answers are fatal  
  
The answers are fatal  
When I wait up and wake up  
The answers are fatal  
If he's truly out of sight  
  
Is he truly out of mind?  
If he's truly out of sight..
