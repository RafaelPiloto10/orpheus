It was the last day of summer  
It was the first of a new romance  
He walked into her on the corner  
She said, 'I don't dance'  
  
He said, 'Baby let me teach you'  
She said, 'O.K., when?'  
He said, 'How can I reach you baby  
I'd really like to see you again'  
  
He picked her up on a Friday night  
He took her for a bite to eat  
His heart was beating and his hands were shaking  
She thought he was sweet  
  
And he stood on her shoes on the dance floor  
Well, they were doing it cheek to cheek  
And he walked her home and he kissed her  
He was walking on air all week  
  
Well, they couldn't stand to be apart  
They couldn't leave one another alone  
Her mama used to say, 'It's getting late sweetheart  
It's time that boy went home'  
  
And upstairs papa kissed mama  
And she gave him a sweet caress  
He said, 'Here's to the two young lovers  
Let's wish 'em every happiness'  
  
It was the last day of summer  
They came walking home hand in hand  
They went and told her mama  
They showed her the wedding band  
  
Mama cried and poured the wine  
Papa just said God Bless  
Now, here's to the two young lovers  
Let's wish 'em every happiness
