I've been searching and you've been gone  
Out looking for the shortest path to the one that you're on  
And I've already seen all I want to see  
Come on, let's take the long cut  
I think that's what we need  
When we were younger, we were strong  
We felt a lot better than the things that we'd done  
Now if it's to be, if you still believe  
Come on let's take the long cut  
I think that's what we need  
If you want to take the long cut  
  
We'll get there eventually  
I've been searching and you've been gone  
Out looking for the shortest path to the one you're on  
Now if it's to be, if you still believe  
Come on let's take the long cut  
I think that's what we need  
We've been in a deep rut  
And it's been killing me  
If you want to take the long cut  
We'll get there eventually
