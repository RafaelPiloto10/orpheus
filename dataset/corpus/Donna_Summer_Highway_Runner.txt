Highway lead him to where he's never been  
Show that drifter what he's never seen  
Introduce him to this  
Acquaint him with that  
Gotta keep searching like a stray stray cat  
  
Highway runner chasing time since the day he was born  
Highway runner racing time around the world one more time  
For one more time  
  
It ain't even me can hold him down  
Country just a breath from town to town  
He got restless feet and a restless mind  
Never want to travel through the same place twice  
  
Highway runner chasing time since the day he was born  
Highway runner racing time around the world one more time  
For one more time  
  
One more time  
One more time  
One more time  
You're gonna meet your match...
