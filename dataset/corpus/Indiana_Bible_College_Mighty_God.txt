Chorus  
He's a mighty God  
Powerful and holy God  
He's a mighty God  
Powerful and holy God, yeah  
He's a mighty God  
Powerful and holy God  
He's a mighty God  
Mighty, Mighty  
  
Verse  
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood  
But against principalities  
In the heavenlies  
And we will stand and hold our ground  
For we have all authority and power in Jesus Name  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
  
Vamp  
Powerful, mighty, and holy  
King of Kings, his name is worthy  
Only one, the Lord of Glory  
Mighty God, He's a mighty God  
  
Ending  
Powerful, King of Kings, Only One  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
