Out!  
  
Out in the street  
I'm talkin' 'bout slowly  
I'm not gonna rest  
Woman, you don't know me  
  
Yeah, you don't know me, no  
Know me, no  
Know me, no  
Yeah, but I'm a-gonna know you  
  
Hey listen, woman  
You just can't throw me  
I won't stand it  
If you don't know me  
  
If you don't know me, no  
Know me, no  
Know me, no  
Yeah, but I'm a-gonna know you  
  
Listen to me  
I'm telling you  
You look at me, woman  
Yeah, tell the truth  
  
I know your mind  
I can see that you're in need  
I'll show you woman  
Yeah, that you belong to me  
  
You're gonna know me, no  
Know me, no  
Know me, no  
Yeah, I'm a-gonna know you  
  
Give me no reasons  
Said you'd go free  
It's not gonna be now  
If you gotta know me  
  
You're gonna know me now  
Know me now  
Know me now  
Yeah, you're gonna know me
