It's an ill wind that blows no good  
And it's a sad heart that won't love like it should  
Oh how lonesome you must be  
And it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me  
  
It's a heartache when love is gone  
And it can get even worse if it keeps on  
Blinder than he who won't see  
And it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me  
  
I can't help it  
If he (she) is gone  
You must try to forget  
You must live on  
It's a good thing to love someone  
But it's bad and even sad  
When it's not returned  
Oh how lonesome you must be  
And it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me  
And I said it's a shame  
If you don't share your love with me
