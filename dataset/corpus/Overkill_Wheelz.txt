What you going to do when the walls come down  
When the searchlights flash and the sirens sound  
If your name is called will you be around  
Will you keep a' rolling  
Where you going to hide when they look for you  
Will you march in time, will you see it through  
Make me proud, the least you can do  
Wheelz will keep us rolling  
  
Now to a fault can I speak the name  
From where we go and whence we came  
Standing tall to share the blame  
Time only knows tolling  
Count out the scars, that pollute the mind  
Where the critics lay and the enemy find  
They find, no one  
We are burning more than just a moment  
  
Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are  
Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far  
Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust  
Wheelz to our moment, the best of us  
  
When the price is high and betrayal ripe  
Would you rather run, or will you stay and fight  
Will you give me hope, will you give me light  
You have to keep me rolling  
And if I fall, right next to you  
Will you lift me up, will you see me through  
You know I'd do the same for you  
You have to keep me rolling  
  
Where you going to stand, when the bastards drool  
When the bitches cry, in the line of fools  
Will you give me strength, so I can too  
Never stop the rolling  
I am honored to have known your name  
So proud I am that you feel the same  
As we go from whence we came, rolling  
We are burning more than just the moment  
We are living more than in a moment  
  
Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are  
Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far  
Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust  
Wheelz to our moment, the best of us  
  
Take up arms, stand in a line  
Listen to the march that takes you through time  
Find what you need in the sound of the drum  
And feel in your heart, what only few have done  
  
Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are  
Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far  
Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust  
Wheelz to our moment, the best of us  
  
The best of us
