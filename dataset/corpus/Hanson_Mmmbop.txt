Oh oh oh oh oh  
Yeah  
  
You have so many relationships in this life  
Only one or two will last  
You go through all the pain and strife  
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast  
Oh yeah  
And they're gone so fast, yeah  
Oh  
So hold on the ones who really care  
In the end they'll be the only ones there  
And when you get old and start losing your hair  
Can you tell me who will still care  
Can you tell me who will still care?  
Oh care  
  
[Chorus]  
Mmmbop, ba duba dop  
Ba du bop, ba duba dop  
Ba du bop, ba duba dop  
Ba du, yeah  
Mmmbop, ba duba dop  
Ba du bop, ba du dop  
Ba du bop, ba du dop  
Ba du, yeah  
  
Said oh yeah  
In an mmmbop they're gone  
Yeah yeah  
  
Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose  
You can plant any one of those  
Keep planting to find out which one grows  
It's a secret no one knows  
It's a secret no one knows  
Oh, no one knows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In an mmmbop they're gone  
In an mmmbop they're not there  
In an mmmbop they're gone  
In an mmmbop they're not there  
Until you lose your hair  
Oh  
But you don't care, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you tell me? oh  
No you can't 'cause you don't know  
Can you tell me? oh yeah  
You say you can but you don't know  
Can you tell me? oh (Which flower's going to grow?)  
No you can't 'cause you don't know  
Can you tell me? (If it's going to be a daisy or a rose?)  
You say you can but you don't know  
Can you tell me? oh (Which flower's going to grow?)  
No you can't 'cause you don't know  
Can you tell me?  
You say you can but you don't know  
You say you can but you don't know  
You don't know  
You don't know, oh  
  
Mmmbop, duba  
Du bop, du  
Yeah, yeah  
Mmmbop, duba  
Du bop, du  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Can u tell me? oh  
No you can't 'cause you don't know  
Can you tell me?  
You say you can but you don't know  
Say you can but you don't know
