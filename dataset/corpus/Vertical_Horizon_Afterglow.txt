I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't dreaming  
I kept my head down, I kept my head down  
I wasn't laughing, I think I was crashing  
Cause I always fall down, I always fall down  
  
Now everything I've ever known just fades into the the afterglow  
This light surrounds you, and the light pulls me through  
And even though the best is gone, I've got you here-I'm holding on  
Look up from below  
And stay with me here in the afterglow  
  
I wasn't breathing, my heart had stopped beating  
Frozen in time, frozen inside.  
Now everything I've ever known just fades into the the afterglow  
This light surrounds you, and your light pulls me through  
And even though the best is gone, I've got you here-I'm holding on  
Look up from below  
And stay with me here in the afterglow  
  
You saved me from this hiding place  
Where I waste away  
  
You take this winter's night into  
A perfect summer's day  
  
Now I'm believing  
The pain is receding  
You're like water to wine  
Water to wine  
  
Now everything I've ever known just fades into the the afterglow  
This light surrounds you, and the light pulls me through  
And anywhere you wanna go I'll take you there, just let me know  
  
Stay with me here  
Stay with me here  
Just stay with me here in the afterglow
