I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until I'm free  
You are the sun, you are the flower  
You are the wind across the sea  
And I will kneel here at your altar  
And pray you'll take my soul to keep  
Oh, precious one, you are the mountain  
You are the earth beneath my feet  
In you we're one now and forever  
In you I find the love in me  
Through your love my eyes are open  
Through your love I'll learn to see  
And in your name my bread is broken  
By your grace I'll rest in peace  
I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until I'm free  
Through your love my eyes are open  
Through your love I'll learn to see  
And in your name my bread is broken  
By your grace I'll rest in peace  
I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until I'm free  
I will not rest until I'm free  
Until I'm free
