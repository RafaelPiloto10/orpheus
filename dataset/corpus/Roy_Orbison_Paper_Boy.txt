I walk down to the blue side of town  
Where there's no happiness, no joy  
Down at the end of a long dark street  
I saw a little paper boy  
Paper boy paper boy  
I've got bad news for you  
Paper boy paper boy  
Me and my baby are through  
She was my love my one and only  
I feel so bad I'm oh so lonely  
I'm looking for my love  
I've got my own headlines for today  
They've been the same since she went away  
"One dark haired angel disappears  
Seems like She's been gone a million years"  
Paper boy Paper boy  
So long goodbye  
Paper boy paper boy  
Thanks for listening while I cry  
I feel a little better now that someone knows  
But I will go on looking forever, I suppose  
I'm looking for my love  
Extra extra read all about it  
My baby's gone and I wanna shout it  
I'm looking for my love  
I'm looking for my love  
I'm looking for my love  
I'm looking for my love....
