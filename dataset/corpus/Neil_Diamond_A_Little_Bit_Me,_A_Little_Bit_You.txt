Walk out  
Girl don't you walk out  
We've got things to say  
Talked out, let's have it talked out  
Thinks will be okay  
  
Girl,  
I don't want to fight  
I'm a little bit wrong  
And you're a little bit right  
  
I said Girl,  
You know that its' true  
It's a little bit me (a little bit me)  
And it's a little bit you.... Too  
Don't know....  
Just what I said wrong  
But girl I apologize  
Don't go... Here's where you belong  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
  
Girl I don't want to fight  
I'm a little bit wrong  
And you're a little bit right  
I said girl,  
You know that it's true  
It's a little bit me  
And it's a little bit you... Too  
  
Oh girl  
I don't want to fight  
I'm a little bit wrong  
And you're a little bit right  
I said girl,  
You know that it's true  
It's a little bit me  
And it's a little bit you.... Too  
  
It's a little bit me  
It's a little bit you  
Girl don't go  
No no no no no  
Girl don't go  
No no no no no  
Hey girl, please don't go
