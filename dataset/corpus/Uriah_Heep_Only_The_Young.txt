I haven't' listened to a word you've said  
I've been wandering inside my head  
Don't care what you think of me  
You only see what you want to see  
So here I am in my paradise  
In my heaven everything is alright  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young - only the young  
Only the young - only the young  
I've been around for a long time  
Losing my way but not my mind  
So I drink and play you along  
But who cares when the fire burns on  
So I'm out here in my paradise  
It's my heaven and it feels so right  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young at heart  
Only the young - only the young  
Only the young - only the young  
Live your life - in this time  
We've only today - drink life's wine  
Don't be fooled  
Don't believe what they say  
Don't believe what they say  
I haven't' listened to a word you've said  
Say what you like  
You're not in my head  
Time goes with each breath we take  
It rules the world the day we awake  
So here I sit here in my paradise  
Don't give a damn everything is alright
