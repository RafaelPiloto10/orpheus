Hush little baby, don't you cry  
When we get to Tucson you'll see why  
We left the snowstorms and the thunder and rain  
For the desert sun, we're gonna be born again  
What's important in this world  
A little boy, a little girl  
  
Hush little darling, go to sleep  
Look out the window and count the sheep  
That dot the hillsides and the fields of wheat  
Across America as we cross America  
What's important here today  
The broken line on the highway  
  
All the love in the world for you, girl  
Thumbelina in a great big scary world  
All the love in the world for you, girl  
Take my hand and we'll make it through this world  
  
Hush little baby, my poor little thing  
You've been shuffled about like a pawned wedding ring  
It must seem strange, love was here then gone  
And the Oklahoma sunrise becomes the Amarillo dawn  
What's important in this life  
Ask the man who's lost his wife
