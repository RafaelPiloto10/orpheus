What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?  
What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry?  
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you  
If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like I do  
  
I was all wrong, but right or wrong I don't blame you  
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?  
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry, dear  
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?  
  
Tell me, baby  
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry, so, so sorry?  
What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry?  
Oh, I didn't mean to ever be mean to you  
If I didn't care, I wouldn't feel like  
Oh, I wouldn't feel like I do, do, do  
  
I was all wrong, but right or wrong I don't blame you, no, no, no, no  
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?  
I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry, dear  
Sorry I made you cry, boo hoo hoo hoo  
Sorry I made you cry
