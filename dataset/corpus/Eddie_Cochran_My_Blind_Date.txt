Blind date, blind date  
Tonight's the night I've waited for  
I'm all dressed up and I shined my car  
I'm all ready, I can't hardly wait  
For my blind date  
Blind date, blind date, uh-huh  
What should I do, what should I say  
I hope she likes me well, anyway  
I'm all ready, I can't hardly wait  
For my blind date  
  
My friends say she's a looker  
I'm reeling inside  
I got a feelin' I'm gonna be stealin'  
Kisses from my blind date tonight  
Blind date, blind date, uh-huh  
She's a teenage doll, so I've heard said  
Lucky me, I hope I don't lose my head  
I'm all ready, I can't hardly wait  
For my blind date  
  
My friends say she's a looker  
I'm reeling inside  
I got a feelin' I'm gonna be stealin'  
Kisses from my blind date tonight  
Blind date, blind date, uh-huh  
She's a teenage doll, so I've heard said  
Lucky me, I hope I don't lose my head  
I'm all ready, I can't hardly wait  
For my blind date  
Blind date, blind date!
