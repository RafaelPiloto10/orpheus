Time to take your last walk in this world  
Before your journey begins underground  
But not before we torment you from your  
Cell straight to hell with a short detour in-between  
  
Begging for mercy, all alone  
Unable to handle the pressure  
Before his mortification, now let the torture begin  
  
Death by the head crusher, Head Crusher!  
  
The horrific torture device  
For those who fail interrogation  
The most painful technique ever known  
People thirst for the worst, the skull's disintegration  
  
Beaten, broken, in bloody rags  
Adding insult to injury, he recants  
But it's much too late, now let the torture begin  
  
Death by the head crusher, Head Crusher!  
  
On your knees, prisoner, take your position  
Place your chin forward into the restraints  
Your head slowly caves in from the compression  
You faint in a blackout from the infernal pain  
  
Twisting, turning the giant screw  
Your teeth are breaking loose  
Crushed and splintering into your mouth  
  
Winding down, cutting through  
Like broken glass being chewed  
The fragmented skull and shattering bones  
There's nothing you can do
