Staring at my picture book  
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots  
She seemed very regal to me  
Just goes to show how wrong you can be  
  
I'm gonna stop wastin' my time  
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms  
  
Sad song, Sad song, Sad song, Sad song  
  
My castle, kids and home  
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots  
I tried so very hard  
Shows just how wrong you can be  
  
I'm gonna stop wasting time  
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms  
  
Sad song, Sad song, Sad song, Sad song
