Well why do you treat me so mean  
You're the meanest thing I've ever seen  
You won't let a-me hold you tight  
You won't let a-me love you right  
But you know I love you  
So why do you do me like you do  
Say maybe liffle baby, I'm nervous as a bug  
You got me crazy little baby, you know you tear me up  
You're a mean little mama, ah-ah  
Yeah a mean little mama, ah-ah  
Well I'm down on my knees for you  
Well I'm beggin' and a-pleadin'  
Oh please-please love me too
