The lights around the Christmas tree don't burn as bright  
And all around the world it isn't a silent night  
Outside I hear the voices sing the sweetest sounds of caroling  
But somehow there's a sadness in the song  
In our hearts we know that something's wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
In a different kind of world  
Even though it looks the same  
  
Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
  
Children opening gifts with wonder and surprise  
I wish that I could still see through such innocent eyes  
I used to feel so safe inside I had a place to run and hide  
In my daddy's arms I felt secure  
No one can protect us anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
  
Sending cards that talk of peace and love and cheer  
Oh that's what we need if we'd only believe  
It would be!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas
