Written by Warren Zevon 1993 Zevon Music BMI  
I've got a bird that whistles  
I've got a bird that sings  
I've got a bird that . . . I've got a bird . . .  
I'm worried about that bird  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King  
Well. I'm hiding from the mailman  
And I hate to hear the telephone ring  
I'm hiding from the mailman  
And I hate to hear the telephone  
Worried about the women  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King  
I've been up all night  
Wondering what November's gonna bring  
Worried about my country  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King  
Worried about my bird  
And I worry about everything  
And I worry when I see my subjects  
Bow down to the Worrier King
