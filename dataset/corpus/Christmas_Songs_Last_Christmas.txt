Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh  
Ah-ah  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?  
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  
  
Happy Christmas  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

This year, to save me from tears

Oh oh  
Oh oh baby  
  
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice  
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A man under cover, but you tore me apart  
Ooh ooh, now I've found a real love  
You'll never fool me again  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)  
A man under cover, but you tore him apart  
Maybe next year, I'll give it to someone  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Special  
So long
