Falling falling  
The sun is burning black  
Falling falling  
It's beating on my back  
With a fire  
With a fire  
  
Falling falling  
The moon is running red  
Falling falling  
It's pulling me instead  
With a fire  
Fire  
  
But there's a fire inside  
When I'm falling over  
There's a fire in me  
When I call out  
I built a fire  
I'm going home  
  
Falling falling  
The stars are falling down  
Falling falling  
They knock me to the ground  
With a fire  
Fire  
  
But there's a fire inside  
When I'm falling over  
There's a fire in me  
When I call out  
There's a fire inside  
When I'm falling over  
I feel the fire  
I'm going home
