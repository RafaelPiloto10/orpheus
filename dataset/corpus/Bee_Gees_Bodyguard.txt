It hurts me when you cry  
When you feel the love is gone  
Don't give up on us  
When you got so much to believe in  
And I beg you please stay  
Strangers in the night  
A flame that never dies  
In a world of lonely faces  
You need someone to survive  
A heart like yours  
Should never live alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Lost inside  
It's only you and me  
  
There's things you shouldn't do  
You lose your self control  
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger  
Take you down to a new sensation  
Just turn back to me  
Don't wait till its gone  
Don't go where you don't belong  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours  
Should always find a home  
  
I know the signs and I'm telling you  
You're living on borrowed time  
But a heart needs love  
Like a flower needs rain  
Like I'm making you mine  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
What we had never known all our lives  
I pray its not too late  
I would die by your side my love  
I'm the life that you save  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours should never live alone  
  
I used to dream of a special one  
And now I feel it coming true  
But I could'nt let go, I'm a jealous guy  
What you're putting me through  
I'm begging you  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far  
  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far
