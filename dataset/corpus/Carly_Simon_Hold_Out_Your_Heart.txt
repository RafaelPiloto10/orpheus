Oh my boy, what have you done?  
Did you go out surfing on a frozen sea?  
Did you scare the livin' daylights out of me?  
  
Did you go too far to drive away the demons?  
Did you go too far to know what love really means?  
Did you imagine it was more cause she went away first  
Or did you force her hand to renew your thirst?  
  
[Chorus]  
Well if you ever want an endless night  
Or you need a moon and stars to shine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you some of mine  
  
Oh my girl, what have you done?  
Is it something we can't even talk about?  
Did you silence me, remove me from your faith?  
  
Did you make me all but a stranger to your love?  
Did you look right through me  
Below me and above?  
Did you try to ignore me, make me all but lost?  
Did you cloud up the sky when you needed me most?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be fine  
It's gonna be fine, just fine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you all of mine
