[Diddy]  
I need y'all to hear me out there  
Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh  
  
Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin  
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product  
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic  
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic  
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps  
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at  
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet  
Of the almighty, a God to the black child  
I told moms I would be somethin  
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin  
Listen up, I got a story to tell  
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell  
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire  
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire  
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong  
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone  
But nope, I hold my stance in stone  
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin  
Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto  
It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child  
Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip  
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages  
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush  
Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push  
Thank God for my life I came through the room  
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel  
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil  
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils  
I foiled your plans and made you aware  
And turned America's dream into a nightmare  
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers  
The first B. I., "Ready to Die" muh'fuckers  
So "Who Shot Ya," 9 to 5 muh'fuckers  
"Bad Boy for Life," is I muh'fuckers  
And it's back, better than it ever was  
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was  
So I deliver the truth uncut  
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up  
On top of the statue yellin "Who want what?"  
For the past ten years, the future is us  
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer  
The preview is over, now enjoy the feature  
Niggaz  
  
I wanna thank y'all for believin in me for so long  
Thank y'all for ridin with a nigga  
As we continue on!  
You are now listenin to the sounds  
Of the world famous... You know my name  
You know my name
