Running along on the side of the waterfront  
Someone is looking at me  
Trying to turn me around like an enemy  
Trying to turn me away  
Holding on tight to the side of reality  
Is it a vision I see?  
Leading me on to the pictures that I want to see  
  
Fantasy lovingly restored to me  
Magic moments from the past, magic moments  
Mysteries from the ball  
  
Back at the table it's getting too hot for me  
Ice is afloat on my wings  
Caught in the thunder and lightning of everything  
Caught in the everyday things  
Moving on up is the feeling inside of me  
Losing my grip on the floor  
Holding on tight to the hand that has given me more  
  
Fantasy lovingly restored to me  
Magic moments from the past, magic moments  
Mysteries from the ball
