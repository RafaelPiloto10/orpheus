Well I screamed at mama,  
What's that stuff going on  
Yeah I screamed at mama  
Where did that feeling come from  
She said son I don't know what it is  
But I know that's where you belong  
Mama looked at me,  
She smiled me a sunny day  
Yeah mama looked at me  
Took all my fear away  
She said son now I know for sure  
What you gonna do one day  
  
It's a slow dance,  
Dance of the rhythm and blues  
It's a slow dance,  
Dance of the rhythm and blues  
Now I screamed at mama,  
Mama tell me where did you go  
Yeah I screamed for my mama,  
Mama tells me what you come to know  
I was born with this feeling  
And it ain't going to let me go  
  
It's a slow dance,  
Dance of the rhythm and blues  
It's a slow dance,  
Dance of the rhythm and blues
