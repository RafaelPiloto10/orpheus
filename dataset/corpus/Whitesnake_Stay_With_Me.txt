Where did you go  
When things went wrong, baby,  
And who did you run to,  
To find a shoulder  
To lay your head upon.  
Baby, wasn't I there,  
Didn't I take good care of you.  
  
Oh no, I can't believe you leaving me  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on  
  
Who did you touch  
When you need tenderness.  
I gave so much  
And in return I found happiness.  
Baby, what did I do  
Maybe I was too good, too good for you.  
  
No, no, I can't believe you leaving me.  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby.  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on.  
  
Remember,  
You said you're always gonna need me,  
Remember,  
You said you'd never, ever leave me,  
Remember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you.  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, baby  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on, can't go on  
  
Stay with me, baby,  
Stay with me, stay with me, baby.  
Won't you stay with me, baby,  
I can't go on
