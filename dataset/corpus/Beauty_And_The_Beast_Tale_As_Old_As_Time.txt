[Intro]  
Tale as old as time  
True as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Then somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
[Verse 1]  
Just a little change  
Small to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the beast  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will rise  
  
[Chorus]  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bitter sweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  
  
[Bridge]  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
  
[Chorus]  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as rhyme  
Beauty and the beast x2  
  
[Outro]  
Off to the cupboard with you Chip it's past your bed time  
Goodnight love
