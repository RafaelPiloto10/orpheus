Hush-a-bye my baby soft and new  
Ooh her loveliness, gypsy dance in the rain  
Hush-a-bye my baby what you do  
Ooh, the baby cries, the wind she's a-callin' your name  
Mia  
  
Where you came from you ain't alone  
Live and loved from the old jaw bone  
Ahh don't you cry, you're home sweet home  
  
Rock-a-bye sweet lady gypsy blue  
Ooh, the nightingale's singin her song in the rain  
Hush-a-bye sweet lady soft and new  
Ooh don't you cry, the wind she's a-screamin' your name  
  
Come too soon that sunny day  
You give your heart away  
No divorcee, no repouise
