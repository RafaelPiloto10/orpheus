There's a certain something in the way  
You looked at me and said you'd stay  
That let me know that I was out of line  
But I didn't know what else to do  
And like a fool I tested you,  
By demanding things of you which weren't mine  
  
And now I feel like such a fool  
For making you crawl back to me  
But you did it with such love  
That you're standing far above  
Me and all I did to you  
I'm sorry now, what can I do?  
  
I know that never in the world  
That I have found me such a girl  
Who's there to pick me up before I fall  
And if in the end we should go  
Both our separated ways I know  
The lesson I've learned here is worth it all.  
  
Cause now I feel like such a fool  
For making you crawl back to me  
But you did it with such love  
That you're standing far above  
Me and all I did to you  
I'm sorry now, what can I do?  
  
I know that never in the world  
That I have found me such a girl  
Who's there to pick me up before I fall  
And if in the end we should go  
Both our separated ways  
I know the lesson I've learned here is worth it all.
