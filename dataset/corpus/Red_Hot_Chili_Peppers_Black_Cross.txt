All I got is a Black Cross,  
And two crabs in my left eye,  
What you say you want you want,  
Like a lump in your right thigh.  
  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend,  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend.  
  
You the users of the wheel,  
Stink of oil and electric eels,  
Users of forbetten tools,  
We must be the fools.  
  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend,  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend.  
  
Cancel the world,  
Erase history,  
There is no future,  
As far as I can see,  
  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend,  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend.
