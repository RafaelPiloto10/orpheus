(This I swear...)  
Each and every way I can  
I will prove to you  
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you  
Never want to let you go again  
And that's the truth  
I will try and answer all your prayers  
This I swear  
  
There's always a danger  
There's always a fear  
Love's not gonna make it out of here  
I'm not asking for perfection  
Just want a love that's true  
And in return  
I'll do my best for you  
It seems the higher we climb  
The further we fall together  
But right here, I'll vow  
Baby, I promise you know  
  
Each and every way I can  
I will prove to you  
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you  
Never want to let you go again  
And that's the truth  
I will try and answer all your prayers  
This I swear  
  
We each have our moments  
Our times of doubt  
But I know deep down  
Don't want to live without you  
You're the exception to the rule  
'cause where love's concerned  
I guess I've been a fool  
I know it's a long, long road  
But as long as we stand together  
Right here, I'll vow  
Baby I promise you now  
  
Each and every way I can  
I will prove to you  
I've got a fortune in my hands when I'm holding you  
Never want to let you go again  
And that's the truth  
I will try and answer all your prayers  
This I swear
