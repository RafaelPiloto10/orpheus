Boogie Woogie Wu  
  
"The beast lives out of the raging storm in the dead of night  
The ravenous, blood-sick creatures searches for it's sacrifice  
Through the hideous darkness, it lurches, driven by death itself  
Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to  
The darkness from which it came"  
  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu(2x)  
  
Boys and girls, it's nighty night time  
Happy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme  
It's about, The Boogie Woogie Man  
Keep your light on as long as you can  
Cause when it cuts off, so does your head  
Boogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed  
With a shank, splah!, up through the bottom  
Little Jimmy Jimmy, uh, got em  
  
"It's the one and only Boogie Man  
He creeps, he hides, he sneaks, he slides  
If you little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed  
You're running on stumps motherfucker!!!"  
  
Well, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in  
Things go bump in the night, me creeping  
Ouch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe  
If you'd just quit leaving your shit all over the fucking floor  
Fuck it, you're dead anyway  
And I'm gonna leave your head smack dab in the hallway  
In the morning, when your daddy walks out  
AAAAHHH!!! His foots in your mouth, thanks to the Boogie Man  
  
[Chorus]  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (here comes the boogie man)  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (haha haha haha haha)  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (make way for the boogie man)  
Boogie woogie woogie woogie wu (mom! dad! ah! no!)  
  
"Does the Boogie Man really exist?"  
Well, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? yes  
You fall asleep and you wake up dead  
With a broken broom sticking out your forehead  
I sing lullabies till you dose off  
Tie you down and chew your fuckin toes off  
And then spit em out back in your face  
Splat! Fuck, wash your feet bitch!  
  
"The world's famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you  
Slumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights  
What the occasion for the midnight hour  
He will gladly come and fuck that shit up"  
  
I don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (no no)  
But I'll cut her fucking neck and think nothing of it  
"I bet you didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown  
But when you see the juggla, your holding your jugular"  
With a swing, chop, stab, swing, chop  
You're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop  
And the cops do the best they can  
They pull the axe out your face and say  
"Was it the Boogie Man?"  
What was he wearing?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Please don't let me fall asleep  
Cause the Boogie Man will creep  
Through my window in my room  
Stab me with a broken broom  
Please don't let me fall sleep  
Cause the Boogie Man will creep  
Through my window in my room  
Stahhh, Boogie Woogie Woogie!"  
  
"It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man  
Go ahead, pull the covers over your head  
Hide under them, he don't give a fuck  
It'll just make it that much more easier  
For him to suffocate your face!"  
  
There's three ways to stop me from doing what I do  
What? you think I'm a tell you  
"Mom, can you leave the door open a bit?"  
Thanks, an easy way in, you fucking idiot  
Now I stretch your neck out and play in like a banjo  
Boomchicka boomchicka like that shit, yo?  
Then I stretch it out more and fling your head through the wall  
It's the Boogie Man y'all  
  
[Chorus]
