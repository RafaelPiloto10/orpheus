I open my arms to hold you, you turn away you turn away.  
I feel it just like I told you, how can you turn away?  
The things that we said last Saturday night, you turn away you turn away,  
Now you want to throw that away, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And now your eyes won't meet mine, you turn away you turn away.  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.  
I'll dry these tears that I'm weeping for you and take my turn to turn away,
yeah.
