I've been down so many roads before  
I've seen it all and I've seen a whole lot more  
I never had a feeling like this  
I never lost my heart with one kiss  
I feel it in my heart, feel it in my soul  
Girl, you got me now, got to let you know, I wanna  
  
Shout it to the world  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the world about it  
I've found a love so deep  
Shout it to the world  
Nothing's going to stop us now  
I can't stop loving you  
  
Couldn't believe the magic in your eyes  
One look at you and I was hypnotised  
Don't know how all my dreams came true  
I only know that heaven sent you  
I feel it in my heart  
I feel it in my soul  
Girl, you knock me out, I just wanna lose control  
I've gotta  
  
Shout it to the world  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the World about it  
I've found a love so deep  
Shout it to the World  
Nothing's going to stop us now  
I can't stop loving you  
  
It's so mysterious, I feel delirious, I'm touching the sky  
This thing you're giving me, your spirit's lifting me  
I'm feeling so high  
Can't stop this feeling now, my heart is spinning round  
I'm losing control  
It's like a miracles, It's unbelievable  
I'm ready to go  
  
Shout it to the World  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the World about it  
I've found a love so deep  
Shout it to the World  
Nothing's going to stop us now  
I can't stop loving you
