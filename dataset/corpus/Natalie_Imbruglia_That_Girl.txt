All eyes on her center of all attention  
All eyes can do is trying to make a conversation  
She shines, shines so bright  
All the frames are give to silver  
Her life seem so fine I'm just making conversation  
With myself  
  
And who's that girl living in my head  
She looks like me but she talks like someone else  
Her eyes look a lot like mine when she smiles  
Right back from the other side  
She moves with confidence  
Not afraid of every consequence  
Her eyes look a lot like mine when she smiles  
Right back from the other side  
Right back from the other side  
  
She's wine and dine  
She knows important people  
Cannot always turn and smile  
Without a hesitation  
She's someone else  
  
But who's that girl living in my head  
She looks like me but she talks like someone else  
Her eyes look a lot like mine when she smiles  
Right back from the other side  
She moves with confidence  
Not afraid of every consequence  
Her eyes look a lot like mine when she smiles  
Right back from the other side  
Right back from the other side  
  
That girl  
That girl  
That girl
