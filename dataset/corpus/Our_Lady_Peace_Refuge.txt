I picked you up, I held you out.  
I love you. I love you.  
I placed you down, I held my breath.  
I wonder. Yeah, I wonder.  
What'd I do? You're not around.  
  
It's a fall.  
I've got to tell you,  
That this wall, was not meant for you.  
I see sides all, sides all around.  
Get through.  
You'll get through this.  
  
The moon strikes one. You rest your head.  
This refuge, oh this refuge.  
The sun comes up, and life begins.  
There's danger, oh there's danger.  
What'd I do if you weren't around?  
  
It's a fall.  
I've got to tell you,  
That this wall, was not ment for you.  
I see sides all, sides all around.  
You'll get through, you'll get through.  
  
The human condition, needs a hiding place.  
This human condition, needs a hiding place.  
A hiding place.  
  
It's a fall.  
I've got to tell you,  
That this wall, was not meant for you.  
I see sides all, sides all around.  
You'll get through, you'll get through,  
You'll get through, through, you'll get through.
