Girls, we come and we go  
We kiss, come and we go  
Like a breeze, brushing your cheek  
Like pain, like the tears on a face  
  
Girls, we come and we go  
Like spirits, we vanish at dawn  
My heart, suspended in time  
Like you, vanish like tears in the rain  
  
Girls, we take our loves away  
Like spirits living so far away  
Girls, pretending to break down and cry  
Girls, whispering wind, what are we giving away  
  
We used to be so happy  
Remember, remember, so happy  
I never knew how lonely  
Could feel
