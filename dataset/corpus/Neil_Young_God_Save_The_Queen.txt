God save our gracious Queen,  
Long live our noble Queen,  
God save the Queen  
  
Send her victorious,  
Happy and glorious,  
Long to reign over us  
God save the Queen.  
  
(Long may she reign)  
  
O Lord, our God, arise,  
Scatter the evil lies  
And make them fall.  
  
Confound their politics,  
Frustrate their empty tricks,  
On thee our hopes we fix  
God save the Queen.  
  
(Long may she reign)  
(God save the Queen)  
  
My country dissipates  
Sweet land of liberty  
On thee I see  
  
Land where my fathers died  
Land of the ? cry  
From every mountainside  
Let freedom reign  
  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign
