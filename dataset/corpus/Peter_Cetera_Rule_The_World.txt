There's a garden of hope  
In a town called faith  
And the state of Happiness  
Is not far away  
From the country of wants and the sea of needs  
I'll take you there with me  
Someday when I rule the world  
Gonna stand by you  
Love you all I can  
You're beautiful  
The reason I believe  
Don't give up on me  
I'll make it wonderful  
When I rule the world  
When I look into your eyes  
Oohh it just amazes me  
And the way I feel inside  
When your changing me  
Through the sweat and the tears  
Moving step by step  
I'll do anything for you  
Someday when I...  
High, High above it all  
In the sky you promised I choose to stand  
Stand by you I'll stand by you  
Someday when I....  
the reason I believe  
Oh don't give up on me  
I'll make it wonderful when I rule te World
