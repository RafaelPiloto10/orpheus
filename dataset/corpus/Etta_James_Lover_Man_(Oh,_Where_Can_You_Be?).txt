I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad  
I'd long to try something I'd never had  
Never had no kissing, ooh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
  
The night is cold and I'm so all alone  
I'd give my soul just to call you my own  
Got a moon above me but no one's here to love me  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
  
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
And I'll go to bed with a prayer  
That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems  
  
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears  
And whisper sweet, little things in my ear  
Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing baby  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
  
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance  
Could be like a heavenly dream  
And I'll go to bed with the prayer  
That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems  
  
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ear  
Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
