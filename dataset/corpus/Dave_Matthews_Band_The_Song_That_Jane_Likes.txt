And in plays to write the wire in  
I'll come back again  
Torching time talking rhymes in  
I'll come back again  
  
Would you like to play  
With the thought of a friend  
In a distant passing stage  
While you lie around  
With your hands up and out  
So resigned you will fall down  
  
While you around here play  
Wild on the warm and far away  
While you around here play  
The days keep scribbling themselves in tidy lines  
  
Would you like to play  
With a fool holding hands  
With a one-eyed jack of spades  
While on the deck they sing  
All of the captain's cards are kings  
Still he and the queen are lost at sea  
I hope it isn't you or me  
  
And I'll be back 'round again  
Yes I'll walk in time with you old friend  
And we'll find that place  
That we had danced in so long ago  
And in plays to write the wire in  
I'll come back again  
Torching time talking rhymes in  
I'll come back again  
With this resigned the letter I sign
