You feel the thirst  
But none can make you drink  
The answer's waiting for you here but  
It's not what you think  
It won't steal your soul or leave you blind  
It was just a cup of kindness all the time  
  
And when Mother Mary finally comes to cal  
She could pass right through your heart  
And leave no trace at all  
While you were reaching for  
The sacred and divine  
She was standing right beside you  
All the time  
  
And the emptiness  
You can't seem to fill  
Beauty fades and pleasures cannot  
Take away the chili  
And the glamor lures you down into a lie  
O but the cup of kindness  
Never will run dry  
  
You hear the vandals  
Howlin' down your walls  
And arm yourself against the ones  
Who want to see you fall  
Till some Holy Grail reveals  
The grand design  
Well it was in a cup of kindness  
All the time
