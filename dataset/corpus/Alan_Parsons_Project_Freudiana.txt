I was alone in my room feeling sorry for myself.  
Call me a prophet of doom, I could think of nothing else.  
I found a freudian book gathering dust upon my shelf.  
I thought I'll give it a look, would it hurt or would it help?  
  
Freudiana, do you want to be somebody?  
Freudiana, do you want to change the world?  
  
I met the wolfman and the ratman, anna-o and little hans.  
They were walking on a tightrope, I never thought they had a chance.  
And then a hand reached out to hold them just before they tumbled down.  
But I was standing in a quicksand and I could not feel the ground.  
  
Freudiana, do you want to be somebody?  
Freudiana, do you want to change the world?  
  
I look back and try to find the part of me I don't know.  
I won't stop till I see the truth. There's such a long way to go.  
  
I saw a picture of a stranger but I don't understand.  
He had a ring around his finger and something burning in his hand.  
And I wanted him to teach me and I needed to believe.  
But the shadows that he threw me were intended to deceive.  
  
Freudiana, do you want to be somebody?  
Freudiana, do you want to change the world?
