I've made some decisions  
Never not the best  
Against my better judgment  
I must confess  
  
I went astray so many ways  
So my dreams fall apart  
And came a day, I'm glad to say  
I followed my heart  
  
That feeling, the one I'm feeling now  
Oh, that feeling, that turned me all around  
That feeling, oh, what love can do  
That feeling, that never let's me down  
  
Oh, that feeling, that always come around  
I never need another  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling, I'm feeling for you  
  
Looking in the mirror  
Reflecting on the past  
Memories or misery  
That's all fading fast  
  
These eyes over my shoulder  
Oh, they made me realize  
I've made the right decision  
The day I recognized  
  
That feeling, the one I'm feeling now  
Oh, that feeling, that turned me all around  
That feeling, oh, what love can do  
That feeling, that never let's me down  
  
Oh, that feeling, that always come around  
I never need another  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling, I'm feeling for you  
  
I never need another  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling, I'm feeling for you
