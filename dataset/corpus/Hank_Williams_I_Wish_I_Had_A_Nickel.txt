They tell me little darlin',  
That to morrow you'll be wed,  
You thought that you would hurt me,  
But you hurt yourself instead,  
  
I'll always be the same old pal,  
Just as in years gone by,  
I'll just set back and watch you,  
While you set alone and cry.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks,  
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep,  
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight,  
I wish I had a nickel, for every tear you shed last night.  
  
I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happiness,  
I hope that you'll forgive me for intruding like this,  
I hope my dear your happiness will follow through the years,  
I'll just set back and watch you, while you shed those bitter tears.  
  
[Chorus]
