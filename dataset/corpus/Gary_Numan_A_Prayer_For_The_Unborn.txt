So, I prayed...  
But you weren't listening.  
Making miracles?  
So, I begged...  
But you were far away.  
Saving souls perhaps?  
So, I screamed...  
But she was very small  
And you have worlds to mend.  
So, she died...  
And you were glorious.  
But you were somewhere else.  
If you are my shepherd  
Then I'm lost and no one can find me.  
If you are my saviour  
Then I'm dead and no one can help me.  
If you are my glory  
Then I'm sick and no one can cure me.  
If you light my darkness  
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question.  
I'd spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in.
