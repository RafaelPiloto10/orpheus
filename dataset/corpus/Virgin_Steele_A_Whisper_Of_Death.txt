[ENDYAMON "Show you no mercy, we're far from the Light in PURGATORY:]  
Sign in the distance, leave it behind . . .  
There is no meaning, when the promises are lies I'll bring you pain,  
far from the Light . . .  
I see the Rings around the Sun, I know their Names I see the  
Colors turn and run, I stay the Same.  
There is no meaning when the promises are lies I'll bring you pain,  
far from the Light . . .  
[ENDYAMON:]

Holy Tomorrow I see where you are I will be there when you die !  
[THE GODS:]  
A WHISPER OF DEATH

The Sons of Tomorrow, I know that they're through

[ENDYAMON:]  
Crush them all, kill their Reign  
See them Fall from the Light Who will know, who will win  
Seven years from tonight Gods in the mirror I know where you are
