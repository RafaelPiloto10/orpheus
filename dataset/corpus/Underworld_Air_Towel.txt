Should I want it? Should I want?  
  
Bunny girl, happy shopper.  
Bouncing ball, telephone dial.  
Shifting sun, are you waiting  
For a bus, effort, effort.  
Women sleep, who knows what  
Happened to be my wish.  
The shop was open now.  
How bout selling some more things.  
Bouncing ball, bunny girl.  
Happy shopper, bouncing ball.  
Telephone dial, setting sun.  
Are you waiting for the bus?  
  
Human pleasure, trust that girl, human wire, I'm the same.  
Human glad, I remember, I come woman, I come women.  
I come one man, I come one man, I come one man  
I come one man, I come one man, I come one man  
  
Bunny girl, happy shopper.  
Bouncing ball, telephone dial.  
Shifting sun, you are waiting  
For a bus, Bedford sun.  
In the end, human pleasure.  
Transmit love, human wire.  
I'm the same, I am glad and  
I come wandering, I come wandering.  
Jane is waiting, in your software.  
In your blouse, in your denim.  
Carrying her new software.  
Little black thing is electric  
In the braid, in the braid. in gray.  
All she says now, and he says  
Come on fuck this, I'm no woman.  
I'm a maniac, I'm on trade.  
I'm no paying senseless geezer.  
Where the doors are opening  
With electric arm or piston  
In the tube hole it is sliding  
Full of moisture, getting on now  
With his both hands on the red poles.  
On the red poles, (you're so ugly)
