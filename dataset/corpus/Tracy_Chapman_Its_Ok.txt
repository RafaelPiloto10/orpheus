It's OK  
Love is only meant for some  
I'm the rock  
The shoulder you can cry on  
I keep the walls from falling down  
I keep the walls from falling down  
I keep the walls from falling down  
  
I'll play it straight  
While you laugh and drink and party all night long  
I'll designate myself  
To be the driver who takes you home  
I keep the walls from falling down  
I keep the walls from falling down  
  
You can be pretty and tragic  
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down  
You can be beautiful and fabulous  
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down  
I can't reach the pain you feel  
But I'll try to keep the walls from falling down  
If you can hold on  
Lose your fear  
I'll try to keep the walls from falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
  
Where is your saint?  
To let you know you're not alone  
To bring you peace  
Help me be your friend your confidante  
And keep the walls from falling down  
Keep the walls from falling down  
Keep the walls from falling down
