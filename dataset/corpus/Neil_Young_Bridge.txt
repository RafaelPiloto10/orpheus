The bridge, we'll build it now  
It may take a lot of time  
And it maybe lonely but  
Ooh baby, ooh baby.  
  
The bridge was falling down  
And that took a lot of lies  
And it made me lonely  
Ooh baby, ooh baby.  
  
The bridge was falling.  
The bridge was falling.  
The bridge was falling.  
  
One day, when you talked to me  
I saw myself again  
And it made me love you.  
Ooh baby, ooh baby.  
  
And love came running down  
Like a river on your skin  
And you let me in.  
Ooh babe, ooh babe.  
  
You let me in  
You let me in  
You let me in  
  
The bridge, we'll build it now  
It may take a lot of time.
