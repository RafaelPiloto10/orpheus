[Intro:]  
Xanadu  
Xanadu  
  
Love isn't easy when it's too far away  
You need a lot of faith and dedication  
I don't have that problem, I see you everyday  
An hour filled with hope and inspiration...  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
Xanadu, I've been waiting my whole life  
For a chance to meet a girl just like you  
And I believe it's gonna be you and me  
If you will get to know me too...  
  
I love all about you, but you don't know who I am  
Sure is a complicated situation  
So what if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming I am your man  
And we wake up in a real life conversation...  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I feel in love with a girl on tv  
She captivates me On reality tv  
  
She's looking at me but she cannot see me.  
I hope she will be more than a fantasy....  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I fell in love with a girl on tv  
She captivates me On reality tvbosson Lyrics Index
