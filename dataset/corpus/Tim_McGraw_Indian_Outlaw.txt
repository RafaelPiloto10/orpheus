[Chorus]  
I'm an Indian outlaw  
Half Cherokee and Choctaw  
My baby she's a Chippewa  
She's one of a kind  
  
All my friends call me Bear Claw  
Village cheatin' is my paw-paw  
He gets his orders from my maw-may  
She makes him walk the line  
  
You can find me in my wigwam  
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom  
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some  
Hey and pass it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't lookin' for trouble  
We can ride my pony double  
Make your little heart bubble  
Like a glass of wine  
  
I remember the medicine man  
He caught runnin' water in my hands  
Drug me 'round by my headband  
Said I wasn't the kind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can kill a deer or buffalo  
With just my arrow and my hickory bow  
From a hundred yards don't you know  
I do it all the time  
  
They all gather 'round my teepee  
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek  
At me in nothin' but my buffalo briefs  
I got em standin' in line  
  
[Chorus]
