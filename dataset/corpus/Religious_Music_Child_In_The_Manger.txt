Child in the manger, Infant of Mary  
Outcast and Stranger, Lord of all  
Child Who inherits all our transgressions  
All our demerits on Him fall.  
  
Once the most holy Child of salvation  
Gently and lowly lived below  
Now as our glorious mighty Redeemer  
See Him victorious o'er each foe.  
  
Prophets foretold Him, Infant of wonder  
Angels behold Him on His throne  
Worthy our Savior of all our praises  
Happy forever are His own...
