I don't care where you came from  
Oh no, I don't care where you've been  
All I know is that I love you  
And I'm going to love you till the end (gonna love you until the end)  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you're my (dream come true)  
You're my (dream come true)  
You're my (dream come true)  
And I love you better than anyone before  
  
For every hand there's a glove  
For every, for every heart there should be love  
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time  
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind  
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, you're my (dream come true)  
You're my (dream come true)  
You're my (dream come true)  
And I love you better than anyone before  
  
(Better than anyone, better than anyone)  
  
I love you (better than anyone)  
Than anyone before (better than anyone before)  
A-do me right because I love you (better than anyone)  
Keep coming 'cause I love you (better than anyone)
