The enemy is at the door  
The enemy within.  
Dressed up in the strangest clothes,  
Smells of drinking Bombay gin.  
  
There's a deadman walking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
  
My father was a Russian Jew  
My Irish mother crazy.  
I see summer, winter, fall.  
When grown men  
Cry like babies.  
  
There's a deadman walking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
  
Solo  
  
Wish I never had to leave.  
Wish I'd never known.  
Wish I could stay here forever.  
Watch my garden grow.  
  
There's a deadman walking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
  
There's a deadman talking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman talking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
There's a deadman walking  
Deadman walking  
Deadman talking
