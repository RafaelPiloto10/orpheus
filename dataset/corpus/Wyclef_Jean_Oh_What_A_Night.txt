It's funny how the Earth rotates, man you never know what's  
going to happen, ya know mean?  
All I said was "Aiight, I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang"  
Then it all got it started for me, man  
Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man  
What it be like, man?  
Yo, bust it, turn me up  
Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can  
make it anywhere else, man  
Somehow I believe that shhhh  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a night  
Late December, 1993 (what happened?)  
Who thought he would rule the industry?  
What an MC on the grind  
  
Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts  
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks  
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro  
Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel  
What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?  
First of the month waitin for that PA check  
Lived on the first floor  
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door
(who is it?)  
I went from boy to man in one night  
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist  
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English  
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas  
So hurry up and come out and play  
I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway  
And I got big plans, so beg your pardon  
Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all  
But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall  
The first rap group, video cost a million  
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians  
And sa fa say, na boolay  
Grammy night, we took 3 away  
22 million sold, I can't believe this  
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this  
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating  
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?  
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said  
"Clef, your on the cover of  
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones"  
No more struggling, good life we loving it  
You could live it too, if you only publish it  
So here we go, so what's the scenario?  
I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos  
  
[Chorus]
