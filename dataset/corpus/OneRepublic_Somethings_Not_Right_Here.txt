Come come my dear, take flight, come near  
I see your fear creeping around you  
First love then hate, then love, no wait  
Your confusion, it's gonna kill me  
  
I broke for you, I woke for you  
You tore me through, god love you  
I see the signs are out of line  
No fault of mine except for  
  
Don't say his name now  
  
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here  
You've fallen out, something ain't right here  
  
You screamed, I begged, what's that you said?  
Your clouded head's telling you lies now  
You hear my voice, you make some noise  
You stole my choice it's over  
  
And I pray for you now  
I speak to you  
  
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here  
You've fallen out, something ain't right here  
I'm breaking out, something ain't right here  
You've fallen out, fallen out for  
Fallen out, you've fallen out!  
Why can't you see it?  
  
I'll pray for you now  
I'm speaking to
