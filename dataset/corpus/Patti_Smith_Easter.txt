Easter Sunday, we were walking.  
Easter Sunday, we were talking.  
Isabel, my little one, take my hand. Time has come.  
  
Isabella, all is glowing.  
Isabella, all is knowing.  
And my heart, Isabella.  
And my head, Isabella.  
  
Frederick and Vitalie, savior dwells inside of thee.  
Oh, the path leads to the sun. Brother, sister, time has come.  
  
Isabella, all is glowing.  
Isabella, all is knowing.  
Isabella, we are dying.  
Isabella, we are rising.  
  
I am the spring, the holy ground,  
The endless seed of mystery,  
The thorn, the veil, the face of grace,  
The brazen image, the thief of sleep,  
The ambassador of dreams, the prince of peace.  
I am the sword, the wound, the stain.  
Scorned transfigured child of Cain.  
I rend, I end, I return.  
Again I am the salt, the bitter laugh.  
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star,  
The ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ  
Dying and drying as I rise tonight.  
  
Isabella, we are rising.  
Isabella, we are rising
