Tell me what you seen  
Was it a dream?  
Was I in it?  
Life seems so obscene  
Until it's over  
Who knows?  
All I want is someone who can fill the hole  
In the life I know  
In between life and death  
When there's nothing left  
Do you wanna know?  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers you've know  
And your friends on your own  
Tell me if it's true  
That I need you  
You are changing  
I've seen this road before down on this floor  
It is hurting me  
All I want is someone  
Who can fill the hole  
In the life I know  
In between life and death  
When there's nothing left  
Do you want to know?  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers you've know  
And your friends on your own  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers you've know  
And your friends you have told  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
I'm coming in on my own  
I'm coming in on my own  
I'm coming in on my own  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
I've got to get rid of this hole inside...
