My heart was so heavy with longing for you  
My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue  
Alone in my sorrow I heard a voice cry,  
A voice in the wilderness  
A voice from the sky.  
  
Have faith in your darling  
The voice seemed to say  
Be true to her memory  
She'll come back one day.  
And though there was no one  
Nobody to see,  
The voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me  
  
We had a quarrel,  
I was unkind  
Why did you leave me  
Love made me blind  
  
My darling forgive me  
I am for your touch  
Have pity come back now  
I need you so much  
  
Believe me and you'll hear it  
That voice from above  
The voice in the wilderness  
The voice of true love  
  
Believe me and you'll hear it  
That voice from above  
The voice in the wilderness  
The voice of true love
