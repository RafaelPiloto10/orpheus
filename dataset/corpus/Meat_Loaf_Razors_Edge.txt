Never callin', unanswered letters,  
How you been, feelin' better?  
Never lookin', but you're hearin',  
Never speakin', but you're feeling  
All the silence, and it's wounding,  
You're not healing, just concealing  
  
Play the game, play the game  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh brother to brother, all the blood runs red  
Don't roll over, don't play dead  
We're all livin' on the razor's edge  
  
Oh brother to brother, all the blood runs ruby red  
We're all victims of the razor's edge  
  
All the rules don't mean a thing,  
They're wasting time,  
The mem'ries sting  
Keep your image, plant that smile,  
Answer questions, don't let on  
Make up stories all put on,  
That's your life, oh,  
Your life is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You see you're losing, yet you still try  
The game just a watches your life go by  
  
You're playin' well,  
You're playin' why?  
Oh, play the game  
  
You see you're losing, yet you still try  
The game just a'watches your life go by  
You're playin' well,  
Oh you're playin' the game  
  
[Chorus]
