Sick of all the games  
This story's getting old  
It's time for a change  
I'm gonna take control  
  
I'm not an object or possession  
You played with the wrong girl  
And you don't own me anymore  
The game of love is overrated  
  
It's not real, I'm tired of playing  
You can try to pull me in with promises  
You don't intend to keep  
You can try to put the pressure on  
  
But baby, I'm not that naive  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
Till the walls fall all around me  
But you can never make me feel unloved  
  
'Cause you're not the one  
I am stronger than you know  
I'm smarter than you think  
Not made of stone  
  
But I stand on my own feet  
I'm not your mother or your keeper  
I'm not your average girl  
'Cause I know what I'm living for  
  
You can try to pull me in with promises  
You don't intend to keep  
You can try to put the pressure on  
But baby, I'm not that naive  
  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
'Til the sky falls all around me  
But you can never make me feel unloved  
'Cause you're not the one  
  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
'Til the sky falls all around me  
Now I know what I'm living for  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
  
'Til the sky falls all around me  
You're not the one, you're not the one
