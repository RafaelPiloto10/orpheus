Everything has a reason  
At least that's what they all say  
And I've lost my count of the seasons  
I don't know what's been makin' me stay  
  
Many's the times that you've hurt me  
That's just the way that you live  
Many a time is forgotten  
But I never said that I can forgive  
  
[Chorus]  
So baby don't cry, cry me a river  
And baby don't try to wash over me yeah  
Baby don't cry my ship is now sailin'  
And I've wasted all my time in your sea  
And I've wasted all my time in your sea  
  
Now that your toys have been broken  
I guess you want company  
There is no point in you callin'  
'cause I'm headed for my own destiny  
  
Now everyone has a problem yeah  
Lord knows you've always been mine  
The nights are always the hardest  
But tonight some how I know I'll be fine  
  
[Chorus]
