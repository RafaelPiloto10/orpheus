It's not easy  
Lettin' go completely  
And fightin' off the jealously  
That comes with losin' you  
You say you wanna be free  
From the promises you made me  
You wanna take the love you gave me  
And give it to your someone new.  
  
You got my green eyes cryin' those blue tears  
Wishin' I could be with you tears  
The whole night through  
You got my green eyes cryin' those blue tears  
Cryin' what will I do tears without you.  
  
This is all wrong  
Losin' love we had for so long  
Can't we try again to hold on?  
Instead of saying it's the end  
I will free you  
But baby if you ever need to  
There's a trail of tears to lead you  
Back into my arms again.  
  
You got my green eyes cryin' those blue tears  
Wishin' I could be with you tears  
The whole night through  
You got my green eyes cryin' those blue tears  
Cryin' what will I do tears without you.  
  
You got my green eyes cryin' those blue tears  
Cryin' what will I do tears without you...
