I want to say yes to what you say  
If there's a movement then i want to sway  
Get a piece of the action, uh huh  
And i want to see you in the crowd  
And i want to point your face out very loud  
Get a piece of the action, uh huh  
  
Don't you want a piece of the action  
Don't you want a piece of the action  
Yeah...oh yeah...  
  
'sex-o-fact' it slips in vogue  
Sells a star, furnishes your home  
You get a piece of the action, uh huh  
Violence on the silver screen  
You got the most fashionable death since james dean  
You get a piece of the action, uh huh
