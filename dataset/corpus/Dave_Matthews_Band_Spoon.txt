Spoon in spoon  
Stirring my coffee  
I thought of you  
And turned to the gate  
On my way came up with the answers  
I scratched my head  
And the answers were gone  
From hand to hand  
Wrist to the elbow  
Red blood sand  
Could Dad be God  
Crosses cross hung out like a wet rag  
Forgive you? Why?  
You hung me out to dry  
Maybe I'm crazy  
But laughing out loud  
Makes the pain pass by  
And maybe you're a little crazy  
But laughing out loud makes  
It all subside  
Holding, I'm holding  
I'm still falling  
Spoon in spoon  
Stirring my coffee  
I thought of this  
And turned to the gate  
But on my way  
Crack  
Lightning and thunder  
I hid my head  
And the storm slipped away  
Well maybe I'm crazy  
And laughing out loud  
Makes it all pass by  
And maybe you're a little crazy  
And laughing out loud  
Makes it all alright  
Laughing out loud  
From time to time  
Minutes and hours  
Some move ahead while  
Some lag behind  
It's like the balloon that  
Rise and then vanish  
This drop of hope  
That falls from his eyes  
Spoon in spoon  
Stirring my coffee  
I think of this  
And turn to go away  
But as I walk  
There are voices behind me saying  
Sinners sin  
Come now and play
