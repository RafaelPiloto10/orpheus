Do you know the people fighting for your head?  
What you think, the things you read and what you see.  
What you hear and how you choose  
Your buy from wrong.  
Yeah I hear the sound of a coming new wave.  
  
Have you ever been lonely?  
Afraid to speak your mind?  
Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?  
  
Now I know the reasons for the other side,  
And I see a different point of view this time.  
I will be a stronger person if I try.  
I will see the other side of this day.  
  
Are they really controlling  
The way you use your mind?  
Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?  
  
Have you ever been lonely?  
Afraid to speak your mind?  
Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?
