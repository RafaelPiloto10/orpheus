If we have to wait forever, that's alright  
If you say, "Let's run away," we'll leave tonight  
I'd do anything you ever asked me to  
Girl, the reason my heart's beating is for you and you alone  
  
There's a price to pay for every choice you make  
We'll have our day no matter what it takes  
I'll be there for you whatever we go through  
Girl, the reason life's worth living is for you and you alone  
  
Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on  
Even if I never see your face again  
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known  
We both know it's just a matter of when  
  
I wish that we could just turn back the hands of time  
And find a way to have your world fit into mine  
I'll keep dreaming that someday it all comes true  
Girl, the reason my heart's breaking is for you and you alone  
  
Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on  
Even if I never see your face again  
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known  
We both know it's just a matter of when
