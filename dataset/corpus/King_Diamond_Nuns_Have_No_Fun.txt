Upon a cross a nun will be hanged, she will be raped by an evil man  
Knock spikes through her hands, things won't come she won't understand  
You're a nun you haven't had no fun, living your life as virgin queen  
I'm gonna change it and I'll get it done, tomorrow you won't be a virgin  
Queen  
C. u. n. t. that's what you are, you're c. u. n. t.yeah  
I get it up, I get it up in the dark, I make her feel I'm not a holy man  
Faster breathing, she's like a shark, she want's more  
I'm gonna give her my cross  
Nuns have no fun, they just have their fathers and sons  
But I'll give them hell, I never fail  
Nuns have no fun, they just have their fathers and sons  
But I'll give them hell, I never fail  
I get it up, I get it up in the dark, I make her feel I'm not a holy man  
Faster breathing, she's like a shark, she want's more  
I'm gonna give her my cross  
C. u. n. t. that's what you are, you're c. u. n. t. yeah.
