Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam.  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
She is sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down at Lover's Lane she strayed, madam.  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love had gone, madam,  
She ran to the man  
  
Who had led her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down.  
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail, madam,  
They strung her up  
On the old willow across the way.  
  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam.  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.
