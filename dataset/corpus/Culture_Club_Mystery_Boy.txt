Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
It's too sad to point the finger  
I told the boy to look at me  
But what you say it never lingers  
It's not what you say, but what you see  
  
Boy look at me  
I couldn't look no better see  
  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
It's too sad that love would sting you  
You told the girl that it would be  
A kind of love that's deep within you  
A boy's a boy, but did they say he'd be  
  
For eternity?  
Or just a mystery  
  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
Ooh mystery boy  
  
Mystery boy  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Mystery mystery mystery boy  
  
It's too sad to point the finger  
I told the boy to look at me  
It's too sad that love might sting you  
You told the girl that it would be  
Some kind of love that's deep within you  
Some dream that's hard to see  
  
Mystery boy
