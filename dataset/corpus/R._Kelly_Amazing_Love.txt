I'm forgiven, because you were forsaken  
I'm accepted you were condemed  
And I'm alive and well your sprit is within me  
Because you died and rose again  
  
(2)  
  
Amazing Love how can it be  
That you my king have died for me  
Amazing Love I know its true  
And its my joy to honor you  
In all I do, I honor you  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Chorus 2 x2  
  
You are my king, you are my king, Jesus you are my king  
Jesus you are my king
