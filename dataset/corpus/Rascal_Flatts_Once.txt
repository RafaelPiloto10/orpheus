Should of been much further than this by now  
A little bit more gone a little less twisted around  
Should of been much better you'd think but I'm not,  
I'm still stuck, I'm still here, in this rut  
  
Looking back on everything that we had  
Holding on to words that we can't take back  
What am I to do with the past, when it's all that I have,  
And I can't get you back  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared  
Once, oh, once  
  
I remember you sayin' I was the one,  
And nothing could change that but you were wrong  
It's funny how life turns on a dime now we don't even talk  
I just stare at these walls  
  
And I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been all we've done and all the love that we shared  
Once, you made the world feel so right  
Once, you were my morning noon and night  
Why'd we slip away, why did it all change,  
How will I ever be the same  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared  
  
Should of been much further then this by now  
A little bit more gone a little less twisted around
