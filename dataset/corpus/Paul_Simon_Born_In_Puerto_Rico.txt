I was born in Puerto Rico  
We came here when I was a child  
Before I made to my sixteenth  
I was running with the gang and we were wild.  
  
He keeps looking but don't recognize me.  
Some guy from Lexington or Park  
Rrd beans and rice from kitchen windows  
It's supper-time and the barrio is dark.  
  
No one knows you like I do  
No one can know your heart the way I do  
No one can testify to all that you've been though  
But I will.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
And my blood is taino  
Spanish Caribbean in my soul  
We came here wearing summer clothes in winter  
Hearts of sunshine in the cold.  
  
Your family rented this apartment  
You'd watch the street lamps from your perch  
In the sacramental house your stepfather in black  
Preached the fire of the pentecostal church.  
  
No one knows you like I do  
Nobody can know your heart the way i do  
No one can testify to all that you've been through  
But this will.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Came here when I was a child.  
Small change and sunlight, then I left these streets for good.  
My days as short as they were wild.  
  
I'm Frenchy Cordero, I'm Angel Soto  
Indio Rivera, 'Baboo' Charlie Cruz  
The faces blurred in every grainy photo  
And fading headline of the Daily News  
  
Judge's Voice  
Wiltwych School for Criminal Children  
Auburn, Brooklyn House of D.,  
Dannemora, Sing-Sing, Attica,  
Greenhaven  
  
Twenty years inside, today you're free  
  
You cannot even read your story  
The pages piling up in shame  
Before the words released you, the  
Guard would kill the light  
The night you took The Capeman for your name.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Yo nacir in Puerto Rico  
All my heart is Puerto Rico  
All my soul is Puerto Rico
