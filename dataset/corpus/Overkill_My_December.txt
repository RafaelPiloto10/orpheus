When I look into your eyes it keeps me together  
When I hear your private lies I don't feel any better  
Clouds will gather over me,  
Rain will soak me down ,  
  
As I remember, my December  
Just to the tell, upon what is tell  
On the left side of the dawn  
Leaving the the traces, forgotten the faces  
  
Of the last December morn  
Nothing but the truth is all I wanted  
Everything I had was always counted  
Clouds will gather over me,  
  
Lightening strike me down,  
As I remember my, my December  
From the hand of god that squeeze me  
To the firestorm that feeds me  
  
In my December  
In a world too much  
For the likes of man  
Who can't remember
