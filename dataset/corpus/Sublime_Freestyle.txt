From under that great stone got to move  
From under that great stone gots to remove  
From under that great stone  
Stone of babylon  
From under that great stone got to remove  
Real real real  
That's so real to me  
I love him  
Because he leads me to victory  
Many people doubt him  
But I can't live without him  
Just because I love him so  
He's so real to me  
It shall be done  
All of my troubles and triumphs  
When I get over  
Over on the other side  
I'm gonna shake my hands with me elders  
I'm gonna tell all the people good morning  
I'm gonna tell all the telephone chalace  
That I will  
Oh ain't got no style and ain't got no fashion  
Elementary  
Ain't got that style and ain't got no fashion  
Walkin' down with your dreads  
The doctor love you so well...  
Now that you're dead  
Oh it's war upon the East  
War upon the South  
War upon the North this is what it's all about  
You can see when they're coming and going  
So I start walkin'  
Night and day I'm walkin'  
Over on the other side  
From under that great stone gots to move
