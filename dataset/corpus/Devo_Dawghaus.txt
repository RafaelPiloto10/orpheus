When I woke up this morning  
I wasn't in my bed  
You know I had an itchy itch feeling  
Running round my head  
  
I looked at my watch  
And this is what it said  
You got them dawghouse blues  
Got them in your shoes  
  
Boy you know you're bound to lose  
Well I got up  
And header home right away  
You know I was wondering  
  
Why my baby would say  
She said wait!  
She said wait!  
Well you been out all night  
  
Got into a fight  
And now you got them dawghouse blues  
I said baby baby baby  
Baby please don't go  
  
I said baby baby baby  
There's something you should know  
Well that trick you do  
It's not so new  
  
Someday them dawghouse blues are gonna  
Get to you  
You know my woman was waitin'  
Stick in hand  
  
She beat me good (whew)  
Now I don't understand  
I thought there was freedom  
In this here land  
  
I got them dawghouse blues  
Got 'em in my shoes  
Man you know I'm gonna lose  
I said  
I said
