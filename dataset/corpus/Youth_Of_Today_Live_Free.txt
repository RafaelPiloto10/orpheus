Waving your flag a blind patriot  
Can no longer see cause your eyes are shut  
Love it or leave it is your sentiment  
Instead of working for improvement  
But I want to live free  
And won't settle for this mediocrity  
Waving your flag, we're number one  
Society's got you under their thumb  
Too ignorant too see through their subtle attack  
To make us content but we must fight back  
You don't love your country  
You just love yourself  
Because you sit complacent  
Like everyone else  
If your fights for freedom  
Then do what's right  
Put down that flag, protest and come join the fight
