Plain gold ring on his finger he wore  
It was where everyone could see  
He belonged to someone, but not me  
On his hand was a plain gold band  
  
Plain gold ring has a story to tell  
It was one that I knew too well  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as he wears a plain gold ring  
Oh, oh  
  
When nighttime comes a callin' on me  
I know why I will never be free  
I can't stop these teardrops of mine  
I'm gonna love him till the end of time  
  
Plain gold ring has but one thing to say  
I'll remember till my dying day  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as he wears a plain gold ring  
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore  
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore  
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
