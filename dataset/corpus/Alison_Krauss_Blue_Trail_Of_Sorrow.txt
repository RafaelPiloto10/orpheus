Blue trail of sorrow  
Lies upon the ground  
And I get so lonely  
Since you let me down  
Well, I used to be so happy  
Walkin' on these streets  
Now there's just sadness  
Everywhere I meet  
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town  
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down  
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around  
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground  
Now when I had a dollar  
You'd stick right by me  
Now I've got nothin'  
But blues for company  
Well, I think I'll leave tomorrow  
I'm tired of this old town  
But it won't be hard to find me  
If you look down on the ground  
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town  
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down  
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around  
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground
