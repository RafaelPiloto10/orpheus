When the night-time creeps on in  
I will be there, I will be there  
Come on and let me in  
I will be there, I will be there  
  
Don't ever be afraid when I say  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
  
Come on, don't shoulder hurt  
Take it on back, don't make it worse  
Come the night and I will call  
I'll take it back, you'll take it all  
  
Don't ever be afraid when I say  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
  
Don't be so scared about it  
And I just can't be without saying  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
  
I love you, I love you  
And I'll take the time to say I love you  
I love you
