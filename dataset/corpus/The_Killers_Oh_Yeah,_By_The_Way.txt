Oh no, oh no oo oo  
I'm going to be left out  
I'm going to break you  
And if you only knew just how I took my time  
I'm going to take it off, I am going to make you  
I gotta dance, gotta dance  
Gotta seem all right  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way I'm going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
Oh oh oh oooohhhhhh  
  
I'm going to see it all, I am going to stay to  
I'm want to take it down, and make it go away  
And if you see my soul, I'm going make you  
I going see, I gotta see, gotta be ok  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way I'm going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy

Oh Yeah and By The Way I'm going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
Oh no oh no oh oo oo  
Yeah who!  
Oh no oh no oh oo oo
