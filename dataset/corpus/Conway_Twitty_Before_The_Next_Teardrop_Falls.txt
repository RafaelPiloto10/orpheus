If he brings you happiness  
Then I wish you both the best  
It's your happiness that matters most of all  
But if he ever breaks your heart  
If the teardrops ever start  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls.  
  
Though it hurts to let you go  
Darling, I want you to know  
I'll stand by you if ever you should call  
And if I should ever hear  
That he's made you she'd a tear  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls.  
  
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side  
To dry away every teardrop that you've cried  
And if he ever leaves you blue  
Just remember that I love you  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls.  
  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls...
