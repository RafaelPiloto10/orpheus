Be my guard just for tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Take me under your wing, I can't make it anymore  
I am so full of fear, may you read a book to me  
And when the shadows grow, won't you stay with me  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I need to know  
Be my guard beside my bed, that is all I need to know  
Will you please hold my hand, don't you ever let it go  
All the wonders of the world  
For a little second more  
I can't speak but can't you see  
It's your touch I'm crying for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I need to know  
Be my guard just until dawn  
When I can hear the birds again  
I'm as helpless as can be  
Will you guard my little flame  
If we never meet again  
You shall always keep in mind  
That you were my guard tonight  
That you were my guard tonight  
Will you be my guard tonight
