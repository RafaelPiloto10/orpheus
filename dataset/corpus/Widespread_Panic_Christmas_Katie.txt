The Cadillacs roll, Katie step to the side  
Tellin' jokes with strangers  
A kind glance at a lonely passer-by  
Jingle bells, electric lights  
Oh, they rattle 'gainst the shopping cart  
Even on the fourth of July  
  
Christmas Katie calls people names  
They're Dancers, and Blitzens, and angels on high  
  
Chilly bones laughin' after the night  
Oh, the hungries come and go  
As he blows with his eyes froze tight  
Slidell boy, big city nights  
Oh, he tips his hat for dinner  
An old stray beggin' for a bite  
  
Oh, Christmas Katie, babe, blow your horn  
Play something happy, leave the sad one's alone  
Crackin' a smile as small as wishes  
Make us some merry, make it last for a while  
  
Hey, puttin' out the dog, put the wheels on tight  
Oh, play another sweet song  
Never want to see Katie cry  
Jingle bells, electric lights  
They rattle 'gainst the shopping cart  
Even on the fourth of July  
  
Oh, Christmas Katie, baby blow that horn  
Play something happy, leave the sad ones alone  
Slidell smiles as small as wishin'  
Make us some merry, make it last for a while  
Oh, make it last all night!
