Another day no peace in sight  
A solution, far away  
The military won the war  
Certainly not for you and me  
  
How many generations will it take  
To cut the stream of blood  
I hear voices that spin inside my head  
It's your voice that counts so much  
  
Here comes the young,  
The new generation  
You are the only ones  
You are the only ones who can make a change  
  
The world looks kind of small from way up there  
Through the window of our time  
The shuttle broke into a million pieces  
In the bluest sky  
  
The world is spinning 'round way too fast  
And New York City went all dark  
There's a message that goes out tonight  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
Here comes the young, the new generation  
You are the only ones  
You are the only ones who can make a change  
Here comes the young, the new generation  
You are the only ones  
You are the only ones who can make a change  
  
Always hold on to your dreams  
Because the world is not the same  
The day your hope will die  
Just carry on for you and me  
'Cause it's the spark inside that flame  
That gives your visions life  
  
Here comes the young, the new generation  
You are the only ones  
You are the only ones who can make a change  
Here comes the young, the new generation  
You are the only ones  
You are the only ones who can make a change  
  
We are we are the new generation  
We are the only ones  
We are the only ones who can make a change
