You had me,  
You lost me,  
You'll never get the chance again,  
We broke up, You messed up,  
It all worked out in the end.  
I didn't know how to tell you,  
That I didn't wanna be yours,  
But you did it for me,  
You opened and shut the same door.  
Not gonna be your doormat,  
Not gonna linger,  
It just ain't like that,  
Don't you click your fingers,  
You said you didn't want me,  
You didn't wanna be my lover,  
Now you're changing the story,  
I'm afraid, man down, It's game over.  
Game over.  
  
You want me, You crave me,  
You're barking up the wrong tree,  
I'll shake you, Coz I won't take you,  
This is how it was meant to be.  
I didn't know how to tell you,  
I'm not in love anymore,  
Even though it was a mistake,  
Telling me to walk out the door,  
And now you're wanting me back,  
I won't comply, You text me saying "I love you",  
You know I won't reply.  
Not gonna be your doormat, Not gonna linger,  
It just ain't like that, So don't you click your fingers,  
  
You said you didn't want me,  
I'm not a pushover,  
Now you're changing the story,  
I'm afraid, man down, It's game over.  
Game over.  
You just can't expect me, To come running everytime,  
Because I'm happier the way I am,  
And I'm doing fine,  
I feel like your obsession,  
Like you want me day and night,  
You shouldn't have let me go, Or at least put up a fight. No, No no, Not  
Gonna run to you, No no.  
Your game's over. Not gonna be your doormat,  
Not gonna linger, It just ain't like that,  
Don't you click your fingers,  
You said you didn't want me,  
You didn't wanna be my lover,  
Now you're changing the story,  
I'm afraid, man down It's game over.  
It's game over, Oh no no,  
Game over, Now you're changing,  
The Story,  
Man down,  
It's game over
