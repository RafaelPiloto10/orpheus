Don't matter what my name is  
Don't matter what my skin is  
Don't matter if I'm black or white  
Don't matter if I'm wrong or... Right  
  
Chorus  
I guess I'm born to lose, ummmm  
'cause execution did draw near  
I got them steel bar blues  
  
Am I innocent or guilty, man  
Dare I say yes, I guess I am  
I don't feel no pain no more  
Ain't no sunshine, that's for sure  
  
Chorus  
I guess I'm born to lose  
'cause execution did draw near  
I got them steel bar blues  
  
Yes I do.......  
  
Don't matter what my name is  
Don't matter what my skin is  
Don't matter if I'm black or white  
Don't matter if I'm wrong or... Right  
Don't matter what time it is  
Don't matter if I'm black or white  
Don't matter if I'm wrong or... Right  
  
Fade
