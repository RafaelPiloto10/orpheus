I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I had a dream, joe  
  
I had a dream, joe  
You were standing in the middle of an open road  
I had a dream, joe  
Your hands were raised up to the sky  
And your mouth was covered in foam  
I had a dream, joe  
A shadowy jesus flitted from tree to tree  
I had a dream, joe  
And a society of whores stuck needles in an image of me  
I had a dream, joe  
It was autumn time and thickly fell the leaves  
And in that dream, joe  
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick  
And pointed his finger at me  
  
I had a dream,  
I had a dream,  
I had a dream, joe  
  
I opened my eyes, joe  
The night had been a giant, dribbling and pacing the boards  
I opened my eyes, joe  
All your letters and cards stacked up against the door  
I opened my eyes, joe  
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack  
In the window, joe  
And I thought of you and I felt like I was lugging  
A body on my back  
  
I had a dream,  
I had a dream,  
I had a dream, joe  
  
Where did you go, joe?  
On that endless, senseless, demented drift  
Where did you go, joe?  
Into the woods, into the trees, where you move and shift  
Where did you go, joe?  
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit  
Where did you go, joe?  
With that strew of wreckage  
Forever at the heel of your boot  
  
I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I had a dream, joe  
I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I had a dream, jo
