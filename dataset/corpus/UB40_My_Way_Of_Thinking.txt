Give me all you have (Come over)  
All you got to give (Come over)  
Save your guilt till tomorrow (Come over)  
Won't be that hard to live with  
Satisfy my need (Come over)  
Won't be that easy (Come over)  
You gonna have to try a little harder baby (Come over)  
A little harder please me  
  
Why tell me no (Come over)  
When what you mean is yeah yeah (Come over)  
You'll have to tell me what you want to do 'cause (Come over)  
You Can't expect me to guess  
Last verse repeats  
My way of thinking
