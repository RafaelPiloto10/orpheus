We still have dreams  
And tears of love  
We make it babe  
We're strong enough  
We still have dreams  
You've got a friend  
Young hearts are free  
Until the end  
  
Baby, I've been lonely for so long  
Lady, I'm tired of being alone  
Save me, 'cause everybody needs some love  
Got a date with an angel, baby  
Be my for ever, lady  
  
Baby, no one can ever love you more  
Lady, I'm the man you're looking for  
Save me, my heartbeat is a loving beat  
Got a date with an angel, baby  
Be my for ever, lady
