There's colours inbetween us,  
Oh, but still it looks the same.  
You stand here before me,  
Waking me up with it's wonderful pain.  
The buzzer's gone before us.  
Then you wake up and your walking in circles.  
Shaking the hand of bad habits again,  
Again....  
  
This is right now,  
Trust me somehow.  
Let it be, just let it be.  
Walk out the door.  
  
Something better,  
Always never,  
'Cause misery loves company,  
You can be sure.  
  
You're looking in the mirror,  
Oh, your scratching off my skin,  
You think I didn't notice,  
The madness and torture is drawing me in,  
The satalite is watching,  
And then you come home,  
And you switch on your sorrow,  
Boil up a bad mood,  
Shaking the hand of bad habits again,  
Again...  
  
This is right now,  
Trust me somehow,  
Let it be, just let it be,  
Walk out the door.  
  
Something better,  
Always never,  
'Cause misery loves company,  
You can be sure.  
  
Always never, always never,  
Let it be, just let it be  
Walk out the door  
Always never,always never,  
'Cause misery loves company,  
You can be sure.
