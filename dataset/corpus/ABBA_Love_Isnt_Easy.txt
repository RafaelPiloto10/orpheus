Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Ain't heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat  
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
Patience  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love isn't just a sensation  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
