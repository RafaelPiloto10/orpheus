Good morning  
Wake up  
  
Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency  
Stuff vitamin pills down your half guarantee  
A kiss and cuddle with a lucky girl  
You get fed and watered  
Makes your hair curl  
  
And when the day draws in  
You put on a record  
Put on something gentle  
And wait for the cows to come home  
  
Wake up a little voice says  
Do you eagerly  
You mustn't let yourself sink financally  
Don't listen to the accusation that you're tight  
You could be the first man on your street to get it right  
  
And when the day draws in  
You going to go into waltz time  
For once it was good time  
Wait for the cows to come home  
  
Ha da de da da  
Ha da de da da  
Ha da de da da  
Ha da de da da da  
  
Wake up in porpuse and polite efficiency  
So you get fed and watered with good company  
And when the day draws in  
You go into waltz time  
Wait for the cows to come home  
All your life
