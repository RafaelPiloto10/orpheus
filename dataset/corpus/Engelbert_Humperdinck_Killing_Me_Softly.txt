I heard she sang a good song  
I heard she had a style  
And so I came to see her  
And listen for a while  
And there she was, this young girl  
A stranger to my eyes  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
  
I felt all flushed with fever  
Embarrassed by the crowd  
I felt she found my letters  
And read each one out loud  
I prayed that she would finish  
But she just kept right on  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Oh, singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
  
She sang as if she knew me  
In all the God despair  
And then she looked right through me  
As if I wasn't there  
And she just kept on singing  
Singing clear and strong  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song
