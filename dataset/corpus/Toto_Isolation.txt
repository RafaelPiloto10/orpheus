I'm stranded here in a dream and there's no ticket back  
I feel a cold wind blowin', my future looks black  
You left me here and you've taken all my yesterdays  
I guess to stand alone is the price that I pay  
Now look what you've done to me  
Because we just disagree  
I'm out here alone and it's you that I'm waiting for  
  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
It doesn't matter what you say or do, girl  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
Isolation  
  
I close my eyes and you're dancin' in the moonlight with me  
I try to touch you, but you, you had to get free  
I turned around and you're nowhere left in sight  
I'm just a lone survivor, you know it ain't right  
Now look what you've done to me  
Because we just disagree  
I'm out here alone and it's you that I'm waiting for  
  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
You know that I'll be waiting here for you, girl  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
Isolation  
  
I remember holding you just yesterday  
But you're memory is all that I have today  
We were talking 'bout promises we once had made  
But you never came back  
Why'd you run away  
(You ran away)  
  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
It doesn't matter what you say or do  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
Isolation  
Girl, I'm so isolated  
Can't go livin' without you, girl, oh  
Girl, you know I'm gonna wait for you  
Can't go livin' without you, girl  
Isolation
