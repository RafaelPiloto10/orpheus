I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes  
When you put me on the Wolverine  
Up to Annandale  
It was still September  
When your daddy was quite surprised  
To find you with the working girls  
In the county jail  
I was smoking with the boys upstairs  
When I heard about the whole affair  
I said oh no  
William and Mary won't do  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I did not think the girl  
Could be so cruel  
And I'm never going back  
To my old school  
  
Oleanders growing outside her door  
Soon they're gonna be in bloom  
Up in Annandale  
I can't stand her  
Doing what she did before  
Living like a gypsy queen  
In a fairy tale  
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go  
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara won't do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
California tumbles into the sea  
That'll be the day I go  
Back to Annandale  
Tried to warn you  
About Chino and Daddy Gee  
But I can't seem to get to you  
Through the U.S. Mail  
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go  
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara won't do  
  
[Chorus]
