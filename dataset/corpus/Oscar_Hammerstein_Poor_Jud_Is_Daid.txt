Poor Jud is daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
All gather round his coffin now and cry  
He had a heart of gold  
And he wasn't very old  
Oh why did such a fella have to die  
  
Poor Jud is daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
He's looking oh so peaceful and serene  
  
And serene!  
  
He's all laid down to rest  
With his hands across his chest  
His fingernails have never looked so clean  
  
And then the preacher'd get up and he'd say: "Folks, we are gathered  
Here to mourn and growl our brother Jud Fry, who hung himself up  
By a rope in a smokehouse, and then we have been weepin' and  
Wailin' within some of the women. " And then he'd say: "Jud was the  
Most misunderstood man in the territory. People used to think he was  
A mean, ugly fella and they called him a dirty skunk and a northern  
Pig stealer.  
  
But the folks that really knowed 'I'm  
Knowed that neath those dirty shirts he always wore  
There beated a heart as big as all outdoors  
  
As big as all outdoors  
  
Jud Fry loved his fellow man  
  
He loved his fellow man  
  
He loved the birds of the forest  
And the bees of the field  
He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn  
And he treated the rats like equals, which he knew was right!  
And he loved the little children  
He loved everybody and everything in the world  
Only he never let on, so nobody ever noticed  
  
Poor Jud is Daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
His friends all weep and wail from miles around  
  
Miles around!  
  
The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell  
Because poor Jud is underneath the ground  
  
Poor Jud is daid, the candle lights his head  
He's layin' in a coffin made of wood  
  
Wood  
  
And folks are feelin' sad cause they used to treat him bad  
Now they know their friend has gone for good  
  
Good  
  
Poor Jud is daid, a candle lights his head  
He's lookin oh so pretty and so nice  
He looks like he's asleep  
It's a shame that he won't keep  
But it's summer and we're runinng out of ice  
  
Poor Jud... Poor Jud
