Hey Creole Darlin'  
Talk that French to me  
You know your love is somethin'  
Like I ain't never seen  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans  
  
Your eyes shine line diamonds  
And those kisses sure make me scream  
There ain't nothin' like love on the bayou  
Honey I know you know what I mean  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans  
  
They got the gumbo and the Creole  
They got the Quarter all night long  
I got my Delta Queen that makes my heart sing  
Man I ain't never goin' home  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down to New Orleans
