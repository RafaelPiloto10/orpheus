From your mothers' breast to the Vatican steps  
It ain't such a long way down no  
Absolution comes with the confession  
But the priest still hangs around  
And I don't want to lose myself  
In some uniform  
No I'm not gonna be reformed  
Me oh my oh  
Fire and ice  
Jet black colors  
I've got a lust for life  
Over the mountains and across the sea  
I'm still roaming free  
From the center stage  
To an early grave  
I'm both hell and heaven bound  
And I'm looking at the sky  
To see who's looking down  
Are my words only empty sounds  
Me oh my oh  
Fire and ice  
Jet black colors  
I've got a lust for life  
Just like diamond strife  
The lust  
And I don't want to lose myself  
In some uniform  
No I'm not gonna be reformed  
No  
Me oh my oh  
Fire and ice  
Jet black colors  
I've got a lust for life  
Like fire and ice  
Like diamond strife  
I'm gonna roll the dice  
I've got a lust for life  
Like fire and ice  
I've got a lust for life  
Like fire and ice  
I'm gonna roll the dice  
I've got a lust for life  
A lust for life
