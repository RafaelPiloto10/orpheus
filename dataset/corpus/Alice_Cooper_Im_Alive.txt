I was just kicking down the street  
And the sun was in my eyes  
So I couldn't see the truck  
That was sixty times my size  
And just seconds off from splattering me  
Let me tell you  
I was so scared I couldn't move  
Like my boots were full of glue  
Then I felt a little tug  
And I thought of good Old Blue  
And he pulled me from that catastrophe  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
I'm alive  
  
I was spitting in the canyon  
Near the cliff up on the mountain  
When an unexpected sneeze  
Hung me in the breeze  
At forty five degrees in the sky  
Suddenly I felt something  
Had me by the belt  
And in between my praying  
Swore I heard a stallion neighing  
Was the ghost of my horse  
And I cried, yes I cried  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
Hey, I'm alive  
  
Things were getting gory  
Got caught on territory  
Belonging to the Crutches  
In an alley in their clutches  
Looking kind of dismal that night  
Well the leader's name was Fats  
Swinging broken baseball bats  
Things got really frantic  
Starting jumping in their panic  
Hallucinating billions of rats  
Lots of rats  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive, I'm alive, real alive  
  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
To save my life  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive  
He's alive, he's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, yeah  
He's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, real alive  
Alive, alive, alive  
Alive, alive, alive, alive  
Alive, alive, alive, alive  
I'm alive
