We the people fight for our existence  
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free  
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance  
Fading like the stars we wish to be  
  
You know I didn't mean what I just said  
But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed  
And it just don't matter now  
  
As little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of  
Little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off  
Little by little you have to give it all in all your life  
And all the time I just ask myself why you're really here?  
  
True perfection has to be imperfect  
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true  
Day has come, now you'll have to accept  
Life inside your head we give to you  
  
You know I didn't mean what I just said  
But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed  
And it just don't matter now  
  
As little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of  
Little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off  
Little by little you have to give it all in all your life  
And all the time I just ask myself why you're really here?  
  
As little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of  
Little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off  
Little by little you have to give it all in all your life  
And all the time I just ask myself why you're really here?  
  
Why am I really here?  
Why am I really here?
