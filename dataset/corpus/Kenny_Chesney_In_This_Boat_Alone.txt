And I love this water  
And I love these waves  
And I love to watch the palm trees  
How they dance and sway.  
  
The cooler's full  
And the sky is clear  
The cool breeze blows  
And all my friends are here.  
  
And I don't wanna be in this boat alone  
When the party's over  
And my friends all gotta get home  
I wanna wave goodbye  
Untie and drift back off holdin' on  
To somebody hangin' on to me  
Oh, I don't wanna be in this boat alone.  
  
They leave tomorrow  
As soon as they do  
I'll pull up anchor  
And fly back too.  
  
Oh, but one of these days  
I'm gonna hang around  
And find the right someone  
Yeah, I'm gonna anchor down.  
  
But I don't wanna be in this boat alone  
When the party's over  
And my friends all gotta get home  
I wanna wave goodbye  
Untie and drift back off holdin' on  
To somebody hangin' on to me  
Oh, I don't wanna be in this boat alone.  
  
I see myself  
In twenty years  
Just lovin' life  
Floatin' round out here.  
  
But I don't wanna be in this boat alone  
When the party's over  
And my friends all gotta get home  
I wanna wave goodbye  
And tie and drift back off holdin' on  
To somebody hangin' on to me  
Oh, I don't wanna be in this boat alone.  
  
In this boat alone...
