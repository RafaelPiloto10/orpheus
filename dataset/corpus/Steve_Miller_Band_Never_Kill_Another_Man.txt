When the wind blows you home  
To the shores of home  
Will you be one of those  
Who killed another man  
When the wind blows you home  
To the shores of home  
Will you be one  
Who killed another man  
Killed another man  
Killed another man  
Killed another man  
If I can make it through this life  
If I can make it through this life  
If I can make it  
If I can make it  
I'll never kill another man  
As my time rolls out  
As my time rolls out  
If I can make it  
If I can make it  
I'll never kill another man with these hands  
Never kill another man
