(Sill)  
Sweet silver angels over the sea  
Please come down flying low for me  
  
One time I trusted a stranger  
'cause I heard his sweet song  
And it was gently enticing me  
Though there was something wrong  
When I turned he was gone  
  
Blinding me his song remains reminding me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
Oh but Jesus was a crossmaker  
  
Chorus  
  
He wages war with the devil  
A pistol by his side  
And though he chases him out my window and  
Won't give him a place to hide  
He keeps his door open wide  
Fighting him  
He lights a lamp inviting him  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
Oh but Jesus was a crossmaker  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear the thunder come rumbling  
The light never looked so dim  
I see the junction get nearer  
And danger's in the wind  
And either road's looking grim  
  
Hiding me I flee desire's dividing me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
Oh but Jesus was a crossmaker  
Yeah but Jesus was a crossmaker
