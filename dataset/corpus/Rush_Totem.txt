I've got twelve disciples and a Buddha smile  
The Garden of Allah, Viking Valhalla  
A miracle once in a while  
  
I've got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul  
Vishnu and Gaea Aztec and Maya  
Dance around my totem pole  
  
I believe in what I see  
I believe in what I hear  
I believe that what I'm feeling  
Changes how the world appears  
  
Angels and demons dancing in my head  
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed  
Media messiahs preying on my fears  
Pop culture prophets playing in my ears  
  
I've got celestial mechanics  
To synchronize my stars  
Seasonal migrations daily variations  
World of the unlikely and bizarre  
  
I've got idols and icons, unspoken holy vows  
Thoughts to keep well-hidden  
Sacred and forbidden  
Free to browse among the holy cows  
  
That's why I believe  
  
Angels and demons inside of me  
Saviors and Satan's all around me  
  
Sweet chariot, swing low, coming for me
