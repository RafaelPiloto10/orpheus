Watership Down, gather around  
There's a story to be told  
It's for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ear's to the ground  
  
Whisper it loud, carry the sound  
Of the footsteps alone  
When they're heading for home  
Through the raining of the dangers  
And the grayness of the dawn  
  
[Chorus]  
I can feel there's better days  
Well, they're coming, they're coming  
I can see them through the haze  
So can you  
  
Watership Down, gather around  
There's a story to be told  
It's for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ear's to the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Watership Down, gather around  
There's a story to be told  
It's for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ear's to the ground  
  
Whisper it loud, carry the sound  
Of the footsteps alone  
When they're heading for home  
Through the raining of the dangers  
And the grayness of the dawn.  
  
[Chorus]
