[Chorus: x2]  
I am hungry  
I am hungry  
Give me something  
I am hungry  
Feed me  
Give me something  
Street crazy  
  
I am nobody, I am nobody, I am nobody  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, they're cropping up now with alarming frequency  
These little group eyes  
Wasted people standing around  
Those who've been kicked ass backwards  
Hard out of our society  
As we try for the better,  
For the higher in man  
They may as well be apes, you know  
Trying to comprehend the way of death  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shovel it up the street, shovel it up the street, shovel it up the street  
And it gets me down  
And it gets me down  
This is the vision I see  
Street crazy
