How can you say. "You torture me" when you're already thinking about someone
else.  
When he comes home you'll be in his arms and I'll be gone.  
But I know my day will come I know someday I'll be the only one.  
So now you wait for a spark you now it will turn you on.  
He's gonna make you feel the way you want to feel.  
When he starts to lie when he makes you cry you'll now I'll be there.  
My day will come, I know someday I'll be the only one.  
  
Call me selfish, call it what you like I think it's right.  
To want someone for all your own and not to share their love.  
But I'll have my way.  
You don't stand a chance anyway.  
Cause I got to you, you don't stand a chance.  
  
So now you wait for his cock, you know it will turn you on.  
He's gonna make you feel the way you want to feel.  
When he starts to lie, when he makes you cry you'll now I'll be there.  
My day will come, I know someday I'll be the only one.  
My day will come, I know someday I'll be the only one.  
  
You say you want perfection, that's your self-destruction.  
You don't know what you want, it's gonna take you a year to find out.  
I am not givin' up.  
And when you've had enough, you take your bruised little head  
And you'll come running back to me  
I know that I will be the only one.
