Shook my head out of dreams reality's calling  
The early bird's been up all morning  
But I've got no notion of moving from where I am  
Though my legs won't move I feel disabled  
I'm on a shelf an article labeled  
Waiting for someone to fetch me from lost and found  
  
I'm down no one to hear me calling  
I'm down no one to see me falling  
  
Had my ways with days of sunshine  
Life came easy it all fell in line  
But then again I didn't realize  
When you're used to one thing it's hard to accept  
Another like the woman who brought you up  
She ain't your mother  
How do you cope with a thing like that  
  
I'm down no one to hear me calling...  
  
Always thought it was my dad who went to war  
Thought it was my sister who fell off the wall  
My pseudo brother Billy emigrated long ago  
Someone went through' pain to have me  
Someone should know I'm down  
  
Folks who brought me up I'm not ungrateful  
Kept the secret from me they thought it was shameful  
It hurt me so to be the last one to know  
Maybe someone's out there looking for me  
Left on their own couldn't afford to clothe me  
And I  
I don't even know my real name  
  
I'm down no one to hear me calling...
