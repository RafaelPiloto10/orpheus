Yeah, gonna tell my tale  
Come on,  
Come on.  
Give a listen,  
Cause I was born lonely  
Down by the riverside.  
Learned to spin fortune wheel  
And throw dice.  
And I was just thirteen  
When I had to leave home.  
Knew I couldn't stick around,  
Had to roam.  
I ain't good lookin',  
But you know I ain't shy.  
Ain't afraid to look a girl  
In the eye.  
So if you need some lovin'  
And you need it right away,  
Just take a little time out  
And maybe I'll stay.  
  
Then I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
Lord I got to gamble,  
Gamblin' man.  
Ahh I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
And I was born a ramblin' gamblin' man.  
  
I hope you got money,  
Sho gonna need some.  
Ain't gonna run on lovin'  
And I got to run.  
I got to keep movin',  
Never gonna slow down.  
You can have your funky world,  
See ya 'round.  
  
I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
Yeah I got to gamble,  
Gamblin' man.  
Ahh I got to ramble,  
Ramblin' man.  
I was born a ramblin' gamblin' man.
