Let's get away from sleigh bells  
Let's get away from snow  
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear  
I know the place to go  
  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray, for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
On Christmas Island your dreams come true
