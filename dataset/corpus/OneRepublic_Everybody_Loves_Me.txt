Well hell sees her shadow in my backseat  
And her friends are standing right in front of me  
World wide from the center burning turkey  
Open up said everybody loves me  
  
And you don't have to make a sound  
'Cause they got what you need  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
God love all the people that have warned you  
God love all your sentimental virtue  
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you  
Lay calls with the lovers that'll hate you  
  
And you don't have to make a sound  
They got what you need  
What you need  
Make you say  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Well I  
Play the music don't stop till I turn gray  
Stars like forever John Sousa never fade,  
He had a beautiful child, named Desiree  
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made  
  
'Cause you don't have to make a sound  
When they got what you need  
Like you say  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me  
  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Oh  
Everybody  
Everybody  
  
Don't need my health  
Got my name and got my wealth I  
Stare at the sun  
Just for kicks all by myself I  
Lose track of time  
So I might be past my prime  
But  
I'm feeling oh so good  
Yeah!  
  
Oh my!  
Feels just like I don't try  
Looks so good I might die  
All I know is everybody loves me  
  
Get down,  
Swaying to my own sound  
Flashes in my face now  
All I know is everybody loves me  
Everybody loves me!  
  
Don't you know you wanna  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Everybody  
Whoa! Yeah!
