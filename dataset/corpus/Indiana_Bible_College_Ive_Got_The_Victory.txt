[Verse:]  
  
I thought I lost, but actually I won  
For by his blood we all have overcome  
There is no failure, our God can never loose  
And that same power, it now belongs to You  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now it, s time to celebrate all banners raised  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
Every situation I face, I win  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
And everything works for my good in the end  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
I was on my way to a burning hell  
The devil, he had my life set up to fail  
But thanks be to my God who causes me to triumph, overcome, tread upon the
enemy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
  
Sombody who's listening right now you think You're losing  
You feel like you can't win 'cause You tried everything  
Greater is He that is within You don't doubt  
'Cause whatever You're in now, God says  
You have to come out  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
  
[Chorus:]
