Hey, did you happen to see my sweet baby?  
He was walkin on down the road  
Tell him for me that if you see him tonight  
Everything is alright  
'cause I know how he gets when he's low  
Oh, he's a beautiful man  
Kinda hard to understand but  
He's the only good man that I know  
Won't you tell him for me  
I'm keepin a light shinin in the window  
Just in case he decides to come home  
Shining in the window just in case he decides to come home  
(he's a beautiful man, kinda hard to understand)  
But he's the only good man that I know  
Won't you tell him for me? (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him)  
I'm keeping a light (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him) shining in the
window  
Just in case he decides to come home (ooh, ah)  
Shining in the window  
Just in case he decides to come home  
Oh, we had quite a spat and that was all that but  
We both said things that we didn't mean  
Won't you tell him for me (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him)  
I'm keeping a light (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him) shining in the
window  
Just in case he decides to come home (ooh, ah)  
Shining in the window  
In case he decides to come home  
I'm keepin (ooh, ah) a light, baby  
Just in case he decides to come home  
Can't (ooh, ah) you see the light?  
Can't (ooh, ah) you see the light?  
Keepin (ooh, ah) a light, baby  
Just in case he decides to come home  
Oh, (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him) just in case, just in case  
I'm keeping a light, baby (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him)  
Just in case, just in case  
Oh say can you see (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him)  
My light, shinin,' shining, (just in case) shining  
I wonder can you see my light shinin, (tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him,
just in case) burnin, shinin, burnin, shinin, burnin
