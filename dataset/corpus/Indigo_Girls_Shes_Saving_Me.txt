We were sitting round a dying fire  
Somebody lit incense  
Somebody lit a cigarette  
And passed a bottle around  
It was just strawberry season  
Backbreaking pickers in the patches  
Everythings burning down to ashes  
And down to the ground  
She's saving me  
I don't even think she knows it  
It's a strange way to show it as distant as  
Last nights dream unravels  
She's saving me  
I'm a very lost soul  
I was born with a hole in my heart  
The size of my land locked travels  
  
I try to put it aside  
But it's too much bigger than me  
There's a big brown hawk in the tree  
Lighting and leaving  
And there's tea leaves tossing  
Heads up pennies in my pocket  
Dead star like a rocket  
The arc of my grieving  
She's saving me  
I don't even think she knows it  
Its a strange way to show it  
As distant as last nights dream unravels  
She's saving me  
I'm a very lost soul  
I was born with a hole in my heart  
The size of my land locked travels  
  
The sky pours out biblical rain  
Then days so still the beauty gives you pain  
The heatwave kills the green  
And she remains unseen  
But colors up my dreams  
With all things blooming  
  
This is not all there is  
It's not a kingdom  
It's not an angry god  
It feels like her  
It feels like no fear  
It feels like no doubt  
It feels like inside out  
The ashes stir  
She's saving me  
I don't even think she knows it  
Such a strange way to show it as distant as  
Last nights dream unravels  
She's saving me  
I'm a very lost soul  
I was born with a hole in my heart  
The size of my land locked travels
