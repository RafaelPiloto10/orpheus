Now you spread your wings to fly  
There are some new things you must try  
No matter where it is you go  
Oh whoa don't forget your way home  
  
I see the leaving in your eyes  
I see no reason I should try  
To hold you back  
And keep you for my own  
Oh whoa don't forget your way home  
  
[Chorus]  
Many roads may lead you back this way  
And you may change your mind someday  
And when you've missed this life we've known  
Oh whoa don't forget your way home  
  
I guess I'll always feel the same  
I'll always be the keeper of this flame  
And it will burn long after you're gone  
Oh whoa don't forget your way home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Darling have you ever cheated on me  
And I said only in my mind
