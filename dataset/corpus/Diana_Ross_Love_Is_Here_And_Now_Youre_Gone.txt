Love is here  
(Love is here)  
And oh my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
Love is here  
(Love is here)  
And oh my darling, now, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
You persuaded me to love you  
And I did but instead of tenderness  
I found heartache instead  
Into your arms, I felt so unaware  
Of the loneliness that was waiting there  
  
(Look what you've done)  
You close the door to your heart  
(Look what you've done)  
And you turned the key  
Locked your love away from me  
  
Love is here  
(Love is here)  
And oh my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
You made me love you  
(You made me love you)  
And oh my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
You said loving you would make life beautiful  
With each passing day  
But as soon as love came into my heart  
You turned and you walked, just walked away  
  
(Look what you've done)  
You stripped me of my dreams  
(Look what you've done)  
You gave me faith, then took my hope  
Look at me now  
  
Look at me  
See, what loving you has done to me  
Look at my face  
(Look at my face)  
See, how cryin' has left it's trace  
(Left it's trace)  
  
After you made me all your own  
(You made me all your own)  
Then you left me all alone  
(You left me all alone)  
You made your words sound so sweet  
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep  
  
(Look what you've done)  
My heart cries out for your touch  
(Look what you've done)  
But you're not there  
And the lonely cry fades in the air  
  
Love is here  
(Love is here)  
And oh my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
Love is here  
(Love is here)  
And oh my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
You made me love you  
(You made me love you)  
Oh, my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
You made me love you  
(You made me love you)  
Oh, my darling, now you're gone  
(Now you're gone)  
  
You made me love you  
(You made me love you)
