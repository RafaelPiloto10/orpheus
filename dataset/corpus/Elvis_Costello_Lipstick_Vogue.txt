Don't say you love me when it's just a rumor  
Don't say a word if there is any doubt  
Sometimes I think that love is just a tumor  
You've got to cut it out  
  
You say you're sorry for the things that you've done  
You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it  
I wouldn't worry, I had so much fun  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
Oh yeah  
  
Get to the slot machine, almost dead on arrival  
Just hit me one more time with that live wire  
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million  
You say I've got no feelings, this is a good way to kill them  
  
Select the control and then insert the token  
You want to throw me away but I'm not broken  
You've got a lot to say--well, I'm not joking  
There are some words they don't allow to be spoken  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
