Not many'd say she's pretty 'cause they don't realize  
That beauty is often hidden from anothers eyes  
But in a quiet moment her beauty starts to shine  
And every night I'm thankful that she's mine  
Oh-oh that she is mine  
  
And she was born to love me in her gentle way  
Born to love me each and everyday  
Born to love me born to hold me tight  
Born to love me everynight, everynight  
  
I've learned it doesn't matter what other people see  
It's what I feel for her and what she feels for me  
She's made my life worth living because she understood  
That love is made for giving, she's so good  
Oh-oh she's so good  
  
And she was born to love me in her gentle way  
Born to love me each and everyday  
Born to love me born to hold me tight  
Born to love me everynight, everynight  
  
Yes, she was born to love me in her gentle way  
Born to love me each and everyday  
Born to love me born to hold me tight...
