I took a taxi form LA to Venus  
In 1985 I was electromagnetically sucked  
Back into a party going on that night  
It was the gory of the 80s with karma drawn up in lines  
And two Bugle Boy models saying "baby it's a freebie  
You sure look deprived." I had the  
Story of O in my bucket seat  
Of my want to be mustang  
Auditioning for reptiles in their  
Raquel Welsh campaign  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
"I'm not afraid to die" I said  
I don't find that remotely funny, even  
On this space cake high  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Silicone party babies to the left  
And Joan of Arcs to the right  
No one feeling insecure  
We were all gorge and famous in our last lives  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
"the end is nothing to fear" I said  
Blow the end  
Now baby who do I gotta shag to get outta here  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Sure you're out there orbiting around  
Wish I had you back now  
I met a drag king called venus  
She had a velvet hologram she said  
"My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am"  
In the glories of the 80's  
I may not have to die  
I'll clone myself like that blonde chick  
That sings Bette Davis eyes and then  
When it all seemed to clear  
Just then  
You go and disappear
