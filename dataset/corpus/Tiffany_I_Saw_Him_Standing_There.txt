Well he was just seventeen  
If you know what I mean  
The way he looked was way beyond compare  
  
I'll never dance with another  
When I saw him standing there  
  
Well, he looked at me  
And I could see that before too long  
I'd fall in love with him  
  
And he'd never dance with another  
When I saw him standing there  
  
Well, my heart went boom  
As I crossed the room  
And I held his hand in mine  
  
Whoa, we danced through the night  
We held each other tight and  
Before too long  
I fell in love with him  
  
Well, my heart went boom  
As I crossed the room  
And I held his hand in mine  
  
Whoa, we danced through the night  
We held each other tight and  
Before too long  
I fell in love with him  
  
I'll never dance with another  
When I saw him standing there
