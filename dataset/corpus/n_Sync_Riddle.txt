What's the riddle of it all  
What's the riddle on her mind  
It's impossible to find  
  
I'm, I'm out to find the solving key  
To this woman's mystery  
I need to see her more than I dream her  
More than two secret eyes  
  
What is going on, what is going on in her life  
(In her life)  
What is showing up, what is showing up in her smile  
(In her smile)

She, she breezes in  
Yes I can win  
It seems I conquer all my soul  
So I can reach her heart  
'Cause she's too far from being touched  
  
What is going on, what is going on in her life  
(In her life)  
What is showing up, what is showing up in her smile  
(In her smile)

I am only scared from wonder  
From delirious I'm running  
Tell me, where's this source of magic  
This hide-and-seek makes me an addict
