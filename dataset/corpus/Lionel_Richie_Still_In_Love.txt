Gonna tell you a story  
Bout a love and all its glory  
Every word I say is true  
Every word is meant for you  
  
As I look across the table  
In your eyes I see forever  
Girl there's no one else but you  
No one else will ever do  
  
I'm, I'm, I'm still in love with you  
  
Got my heart so full of laughter  
I finally found what i was after  
Caught an angel flying low  
Now there's one thing you should know  
  
I've been lost and I've been lonely  
Till I found you, one and only  
You're every song I want to sing  
My joy, my everything  
  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm still in love with you  
  
I want you to know just how I feel  
Now that my search for love is over  
Would be alone in life without you  
  
As the years keep getting longer  
It only makes my love grow stronger  
Just can't go another day  
Until I can hear you say  
  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm still in love with you
