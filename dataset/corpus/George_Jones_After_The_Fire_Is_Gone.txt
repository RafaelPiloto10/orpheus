(Both)  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone.  
  
(George)  
The bottle is almost empty  
The clock just now struck ten  
Darlin' I had to call you  
To our favorite place again.  
  
(Tammy)  
I know it's wrong for us to meet  
But the fires gone out at home  
(Both)  
And there' nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone.  
  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone.  
  
(Tammy)  
Your lips are warm and tender  
Your arms hold me just right  
Sweet words of love you remember  
That the one at home forgot.  
  
(George)  
Each time we say it's the last time  
But we keep hangin' on  
(Both)  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone.  
  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And there's nothin' cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone...
