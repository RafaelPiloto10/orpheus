It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
  
When I 1st met you, how you changed my life that day  
But with each tomorrow you just seem 2 drift away  
Then I discovered that you were cheating  
you were cheating on me  
But I was the last 2 know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
didn't I really love you, you know I gave you all my heart  
When I put my arms around you I never thought we'd ever part  
Then I discovered, I guess you couldn't love me  
Like you said you loved me, oh no  
Why was I the last to know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
All of my life I was looking for someone just like you  
you shattered my dreams, tore me apart, what can I do?  
But I was the last to know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret
