Liar liar with your pants on fire, white spades hangin' on the telephone  
Wire, gamblers reevaluate along the dotted line, you'll never recognize  
Yourself on heartattack and vine.  
  
Doctor lawyer beggar man thief, Philly Joe remarkable looks on in disbelief,  
If you want a taste of madness, you'll have to wait in line, you'll probably  
See someone you know on heartattack and vine.  
  
Boney's high on china white, shorty found a punk, don't you know there ain't  
No devil, there's just god when he's drunk, well this stuff will probably kill  
You, let's do another line, what you say you meet me down on heartattack and  
Vine.  
  
See that little jersey girl in the see-through top, with the peddle pushers  
Sucking on a soda pop, well I bet she's still a virgin but it's only twenty-  
Five 'til nine, you can see a million of 'em on heartattack and vine.  
  
Better off in iowa against your scrambled eggs, than crawling down cahuenga  
On a broken pair of legs, you'll find your ignorance is blissful every goddamn  
Time, your're waitin' for the RTD on heartattack and vine.
