Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes  
And I am taken to a place  
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings  
Take up shelter in the base of my spine  
Sweet like a chica cherry cola  
I don't need to try to explain  
I just hold on tight and If it happens again  
I may move so slightly to the arms  
And the lips and the face  
Of The Human Cannonball that  
I need to I want to  
  
Come stand a little bit closer  
Breathe in and get a bit higher  
You'll never know what hit you when  
I get to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but  
Ooh I'd die to find out  
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but  
Ooh I'd die to find out  
  
I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment  
Getting comfy getting perfect is what I live for  
But a look and then a smell of perfume  
It's like I'm down on the floor  
And I don't know what I'm in for  
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction  
Of a lover and a mate but the time of talking  
Using symbols, using words can be likened  
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat  
  
Come stand a little bit closer  
Breathe in and get a bit higher  
You'll never know what hit you when  
I get to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
  
Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes  
And I am taken to a place  
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings  
Take up shelter in the base of my spine  
Sweet like a chica cherry cola  
I don't need to try to explain  
I just hold on tight and If it happens again  
I may move so slightly to the arms  
And the lips and the face  
Of The Human Cannonball that  
I need to I want to
