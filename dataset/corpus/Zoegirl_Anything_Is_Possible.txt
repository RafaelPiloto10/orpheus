I know that you've been thinking  
I see it in your eyes  
You're holding on to something  
But still you don't know why  
So walk by faith and not by what you see  
Trust your heart and let yourself believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I can do things, things you never knew  
Change your world, make it all brand new  
I can do miracles if you want me too  
Anything is possible for you  
  
Anything, anything, anything, anything is possible  
Repeat  
  
I know your heart's been broken  
You feel so all alone  
But I will never leave you lonely  
I'll never let you go  
So walk by faith and not by what you see  
It's up to you to let your heart believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I can make the Heavens  
IF I can make it rain  
If I can make your heart beat  
Then I can ease your pain  
If I'm the only answer, the only one that's right  
Tell me why are you still searching?  
Why do you still fight?  
When I can do  
  
[Chorus]
