People never change,  
They seem to stay the same.  
They wear different clothes,  
But play the same games.  
  
Many different ways  
To say the same thing.  
Searching for the right words,  
The ones that would make you stay.  
  
Exchanging the way things were  
For they way that they should be,  
Yeah.  
And choosing theses words  
Is saying to her,  
The things that she never heard  
But always deserved.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.  
  
Oh I'm not even really sure  
Who made this mess,  
And who threw what punch,  
But I could not care less.  
All I know is that I'm here  
And you are not, oh  
Once I put this wasted pride aside,  
Nothing's all I got, oh  
  
Exchanging the way things were  
For they way that they should be, yeah  
  
And choosing theses words  
Is saying to her,  
The things that she never heard  
But always deserved.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.  
  
Oh,  
Somebody make it stop  
Yeah  
And pick me up,  
And just dust me off, oh  
The rainy day flood,  
Will drowned all this love.  
Trapped at the bottom now  
Please dig me up.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.  
  
I figured what it is all about.  
It's you that I could never live without.  
Your everything,  
The air that I breathe.  
Stupid not to know it all along,  
And everything I ever did was wrong.  
Sadly it's too late for sorry.
