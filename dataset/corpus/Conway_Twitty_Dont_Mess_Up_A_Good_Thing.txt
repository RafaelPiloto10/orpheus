Good thing, good thing, good thing, good thing)  
  
Well you been cheatin' on me big day you know I know it's true  
But there ain't nobody in the whole wide world could love you like I do  
Don't be no fool (don't you be no fool) don't be no fool (don't you be no
fool)  
You gonna keep on foolin' around now baby you gonna mess up a good thing  
You gonna mess up a good thing  
  
Now I might have been cheated just a little bit baby like all the others do  
Oh but when I get my paycheck mama I bring it on home to you  
Don't be no fool...  
  
(Good thing good thing good thing good thing)  
  
They tell me you got a nighttime lover a livin' away cross town  
And there'd gonna be but a little while baby before you cut me down  
Don't be no fool...  
  
Now don't you come sneakin' across town baby to catch me a doin' you wrong  
'Cause you know everybody's jealous baby we got a thing goin' on  
Don't you be no fool...  
(Good thing good thing good thing good thing)
