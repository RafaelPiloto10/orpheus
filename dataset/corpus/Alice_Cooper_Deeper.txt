We must complete the trip, try not to lose your grip  
No sight of solid ground and never look straight down  
  
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper  
  
Your claustrophobic brain sucking you down the drain  
The walls are closing in, the air is getting thin  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
We're helpless, panic grows, down and down and down we go  
  
Daylight is at an end, you'll never see again  
You'll soon embrace the sight, this cold eternal light  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go  
  
The elevator broke, it went right through the floor  
It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go  
We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in  
Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go
