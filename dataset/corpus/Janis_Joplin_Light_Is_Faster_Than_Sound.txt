Light is faster than sound  
My head to the ground  
Mind going round  
Faster than sound.  
What goes up must go down  
World goes around  
Sun shines around  
Faster than sound.  
Suddenly I see your face  
Faster than sound  
Through the emptiness of space.  
Faster than sound  
You're turning my mind all around  
Faster than sound  
'Cause life is faster than sound.  
Faster than sound  
Faster than sound  
Light is faster than sound  
My head to the ground  
Mind going round  
Faster than sound.  
What goes up must go down  
World goes around  
Sun shines around  
Faster than sound.  
Whoa, suddenly I see your face  
Faster than sound  
Through the emptiness of space.  
Faster than sound  
You're turning my mind all around,  
Faster than sound  
'Cause life is faster than sound.  
Faster than sound  
Faster than sound
