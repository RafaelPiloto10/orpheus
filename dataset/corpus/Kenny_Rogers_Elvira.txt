Elvira, Elvira  
My heart's on fire for Elvira  
  
We look like dough, lips like sherry wine  
She can sure enough make my little light shine  
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine  
'Cause I know that my Elvira's mine  
  
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow  
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow  
Heigh-ho silver, away  
  
Elvira, Elvira  
My heart's on fire for Elvira  
  
Tonight I'm gonna meet her to hungry house cafe  
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can  
She's gonna jump and holler  
'Cause I saved up two dollars  
She's gonna search and find that preacher man  
  
Elvira, Elvira  
My heart's on fire for Elvira  
  
Elvira, Elvira  
Elvira, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
Elvira, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
Elvira, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
