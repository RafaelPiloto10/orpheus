All I'm after is to be on your winning side  
All I need is to be turning back the tide  
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead  
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess  
  
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights  
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights  
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by  
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams  
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways  
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day  
  
All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo  
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through  
This is just a guess but I must confess  
It feels better being certain  
Please excuse my truthfulness  
What I'm seeing's worth believing  
When you thrill me like you do  
So you wonder why my feelings never fade  
I think I got it made  
  
In the evening when the rain begins to fall  
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all  
But you sound so sad, in your special way  
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day  
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways  
Ain't it funny how life changes every day
