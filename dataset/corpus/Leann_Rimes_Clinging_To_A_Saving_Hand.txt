Sing me a song of praise and glory  
Help this wandering child to understand.  
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal  
I'll be clinging to a saving hand.  
I want you to sing to me about the rock of ages  
And sing about eternity so sweet.  
So that when I take my last breath of life  
I'll awaken at my savior's feet.  
I want you to tell me about Paul and Matthew  
And sing about my dear savior's birth  
And tell about his trials and tribulations.  
While he walked upon his heathen Earth.  
Come on and sing me a song of praise and glory  
Help this wandering child to understand.  
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal  
I'll be clinging to a saving hand.  
I'll be clinging to a saving hand.
