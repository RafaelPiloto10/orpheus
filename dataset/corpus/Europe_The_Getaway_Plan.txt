Hey, I'm the voice in your head  
A friend that you once left for dead  
  
I've been busy, did you miss me?  
No, you're not paranoid, I'm back to fill the void  
I think you understand, I'm the getaway plan  
The getaway plan  
  
I'm the shiver that runs up your spine  
A strange kinda piece of your mind  
  
You've been lonely, I'm the only  
I know your damaged goods  
You did the best you could  
I think you understand, I'm the getaway plan  
The getaway plan, the getaway plan  
  
Can you feel me? Can you reach me?  
I've lived a thousand lives, feels like I've just arrived  
I think you understand, I'm the getaway plan  
The getaway plan, the getaway plan
