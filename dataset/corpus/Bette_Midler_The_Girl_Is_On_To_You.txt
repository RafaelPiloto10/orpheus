I'll bet you think you can just use her the way  
You used to do. I've got news for you.  
Your fuse is out. The girl is on to you.  
  
I'll bet you think you can abuse her and say  
You love her too. I remember pain  
You put her through.  
But the girl is on to you.  
  
She's grown much wiser than you realize.  
She will surprise you.  
No more paying for your lies.  
  
And I'll bet you think you can confuse her. But, hey,  
The loser is you. She sees through your eyes.  
You'll soon surmise.  
The girl is on to you.  
  
She's grown much wiser than you realize.  
She will surprise you.  
No more paying for your lies.  
  
Oh, and I'll bet you think  
You can confuse her, but, hey,  
The loser is you. She sees through your eyes.  
You'll soon surmise. The girl is on to you.  
  
She sees through your eyes.  
You'll soon surmise.  
The girl is on to you.  
  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
Oooh. The girl is on to you.  
She's on, she's on, she's on.  
Now she's gone, she's gone, she's gone. Oooh.  
  
I'll bet you think  
She'll come running back to you,  
Just like she used to do.  
But the girl is awful strong.  
That's why the girl is gone, gone, gone, gone,  
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.
