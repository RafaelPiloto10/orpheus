Monday morning  
  
The sun has risen, just above the trees  
The birds are singing, it's just like a dream  
What a perfect morning it...could have been  
Salem's in the kitchen, and that's sin  
Eggs for three and a little tea  
Mixed with the graveyard dirt, from yesterday  
  
Anybody cating Salem's "A la carte" today  
Should be taken ill and, waste away  
  
[Salem thinking to himself:]  
"You used to be so beautiful, but now you're gonna die  
You used to be so beautiful, but now you're gonna die  
Die, both of you, are gonna die  
Die, die, both of you, are gonna die, die, die"  
  
Salem's walking up the stairs to the second floor  
Silver tray in hand...knocking at the door  
  
[Salem thinking to himself:]  
"You used to be so beautiful, but now you're gonna die  
You used to be so beautiful, but now you're gonna die  
Die, both of you...are gonna die  
Die, die, both of you...are gonna die, die...die"  
  
In a fever, sick as Hell  
David's got a snake bite...and all is well  
Salem thinks to himself:  
  
One down, two to go. "Oh Madame he's got the flu"  
One down, two to go. "Oh Madame he's got the flu"  
  
The problem is that Sarah's morning sick again  
That pregnant woman, always something wrong  
  
You used to be so beautiful, but now you're gonna die  
You used to be so beautiful, but now you're gonna die  
Die...Sarah die, Sarah die  
Die, die...Sarah die, Sarah die
