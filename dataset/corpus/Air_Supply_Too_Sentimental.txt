One world, one love, these can never be apart  
Whisper in your words what is in your heart  
How can I stop this emotion knowing that it's true  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  
Midnight, candlelight  
Knowing you are close to me  
So much I have inside  
I've got to set it free  
  
With you silence can be spoken  
If love has broken through  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew that this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  
Ooh, sentimental man  
Am I saying too much too soon  
Cause I love you  
Such a gentle girl  
Waiting for you  
  
One love, two touch, we can never be apart  
I want you so much for what is in your heart  
How can we stop this emotion knowing that it's true  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew that this feeling is part of you too, girl
