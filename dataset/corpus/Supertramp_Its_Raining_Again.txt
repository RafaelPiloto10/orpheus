It's raining again  
Oh no, my love's at an end.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
And you know it's hard to pretend.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
Too bad I'm losing a friend.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
Oh will my heart ever mend.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
You're old enough some people say  
To read the signs and walk away  
It's only time that heals the pain  
And makes the sun come out again  
It's raining again  
Oh no, my love's at an end.  
Oh no, it's raining again  
Too bad I'm losing a friend.  
  
C'mon you little fighter  
No need to get uptighter  
C'mon you little fighter  
And get back up again  
Oh get back up again  
Fill your heart again...
