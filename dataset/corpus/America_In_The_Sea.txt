In the sea the fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night on wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars sail serenely by  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Go, go and ask the magpie  
Where do unicorns go  
  
In the trees the birds have learned to speak  
Gaily colored they keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds playing hide and seek  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Does myth and mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go
