If we left this town, we could walk the earth together  
If you let me down, I will live in you forever  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
  
If we could find a home, we could go through time together  
If we could hold our own, devastate the night forever  
There's no place where we can't go  
There's no place where I have been  
There's no limit I can show  
There's no level inbetween  
Jolene, I could have seen you there,  
Jolene, I need you everywhere  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
Jolene, I could have seen you there  
When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere  
There's no place where you can hide  
There's no place that I can't find  
There's no end to leave me clean  
There's no reason I have seen  
  
If you find me on my own, you could live your life forever  
Shall we leave our world alone, maybe we'll go back or never  
Jolene, I could've seen you there  
When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you
