Not so much that you could notice  
Well, could you estimate how many  
Eight or nine  
Well, will you do it anymore  
I said as you walked out the door  
Yeah, I just wonder did you ever  
All the time.  
  
Could I fix you one small  
No, thanks I just had one  
Then how about this ice cream  
Well, that'll be just fine  
Is there any special way  
Aw no, what ever you say  
I just wondered have you ever  
All the time.  
  
Does he look like  
No, he's taller and more handsome  
Well, is he as old  
Oh no, he's young and in his prime  
Does your mother know I'll bet  
Oh no, I haven't told her yet  
Well, I just wondered do you ever  
All the time.  
  
Just for old times sake  
No, that would make it harder  
Then how about  
Well, are you sure that you don't mind  
Hey, I know just the thing for us  
Oh no, I'm afraid I'd a-missed my bus  
I just wondered did you ever  
All the time.  
  
I just wondered did you ever  
All the time.
