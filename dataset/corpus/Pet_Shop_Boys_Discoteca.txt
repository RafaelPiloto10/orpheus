Hay una discoteca por acqui?  
  
I don't speak the language  
I can't understand the word  
Where angels fear to tread  
I've sometimes walked and tried to talk  
  
But how can I be heard  
In such a world  
When I'm lost?  
I'm doing what I do  
  
To see me through  
I'm going out  
And carrying on as normal  
  
Hay una discoteca por acqui?  
  
Te quiero  
Entiende usted?  
Digame  
Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar?  
  
I don't speak in anger  
Though the chances that I've let  
Pass me by  
And now regret I can't forget  
  
They're haunting me  
Like a score of unpaid debts  
Is it enough  
To live in hope  
  
That one day we'll be free  
Without this fear?  
I'm going out  
And carrying on as normal  
  
Hay una discoteca por acqui?  
  
Te quiero  
Entiende usted?  
Digame  
Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar?
