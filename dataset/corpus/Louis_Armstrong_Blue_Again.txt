Blue again  
Blue again  
And you know darn well  
It's you again  
You said last night  
We were through again  
And now, I'm blue again  
  
I'm alone again  
Alone again  
I'm out around on my own again  
There's a mockingbird that's flown again  
And I'm alone again  
  
Now baby, though I said I hate you  
I love you more every day, babe  
Though I aggravate you  
All that I'm dying to say  
Is that it's new again  
You again  
And we'll meet today at half past two again  
And tonight, we'll fight  
Again  
And I'll be blue again
