The grey of evening fills the room,  
No need to look outside,  
To see or feel the rain.  
I reach across to touch her,  
But I know that she's not there.  
Rain keeps running down the window pane.  
Time is running out for me.  
  
Can't you see what you are doing to me?  
Can't you see what you have done?  
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night,  
A hundred crazy voices call my name,  
As I try to pass them by,  
I almost can believe that she is here,  
In the glow of the night.  
  
Do you know what you have done?  
Do you know what you've begun?  
Do you see we shall never be together again?  
All of my life.  
  
Lonely people, empty rooms,  
Pointless violence, silent tombs.  
Could it be that we shall be together again?  
  
Sheets of double glazing help to keep outside the night,  
Only foreign city sirens can cut through,  
Nylon sheets and blankets help to minimize the cold.  
But they can't keep out the chilling sounds.  
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming  
That she is here with me?  
In the glow of the night.  
  
Do you know what you have done?  
Do you know what you've begun?  
Do you see we shall never be together again?  
Lonely people, empty rooms,  
Pointless violence, silent tombs.  
Could it be that we shall be together again?  
  
In silence and darkness  
We held each other near that night  
We prayed it would last forever.  
  
Blood on the windows  
Millions of ordinary people are there  
They gaze at the scenery  
They act as if it is perfectly clear  
Take a look at the mountains  
Take a look at the beautiful river of blood.  
  
The liquid surrounds me  
I fight to rise from this river of hell  
I stare round about me  
Children are swimming and playing with boats  
Their features are changing  
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone.  
  
Now see what you've gone and done.  
  
Now you never did see such a terrible thing  
As was seen last night on T.V.  
Maybe if we're lucky, they will show it again  
Such a terrible thing to see  
There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line  
You've got to go domino.  
  
Now I'm one with the living and I'm feeling just fine  
I know what I must do  
Play the game of happiness and never let on  
That it only lives on in a song  
There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line  
You've got to go domino.  
  
Do you know what you have done?  
Do you know what you've begun?  
  
In silence and darkness  
Hold each other near tonight  
For will it last forever?  
  
There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line  
You've got to go domino.
