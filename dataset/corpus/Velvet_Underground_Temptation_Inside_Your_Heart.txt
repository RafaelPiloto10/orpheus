Somebody shut the door  
I know where temptation lies  
Inside of you heart  
You can talk during this  
  
I know where the evil lies  
Inside of your heart  
Well get out of here  
  
If you're gonna try to make it right  
You're surely gonna end up wrong  
Wrong wrong wrong wrong  
Ah!  
  
That's the only chord I know  
I know where the mirror's edge  
Is inside of your heart  
Motown  
  
It's no even within five feet  
Well if you're gonna make it right  
You're surely gonna end up wrong  
You don't look like Martha and the Vandellas  
I'm just gonna start it all over again  
  
Somebody get her out of here  
Electricity comes from other planets  
(It's not that a bad solo. Four times is pretty together)  
(You can stay here)  
  
I know where temptation lies  
Inside of your heart  
Yes he's ready  
  
I know where the evil lies  
Inside of your heart  
Is he ready  
  
Well if you're gonna make it right  
You're surely gonna end up wrong  
  
Oh the hole mess start again  
Well New York buildings are very height  
And not all offensive  
Lock the door  
  
Gonna carry on at infinite light, my dear  
The Pope in the silver castle  
Was that awful.  
Hey, that's fine. That's it.
