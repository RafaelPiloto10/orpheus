There must be something I missed  
I wake up in the morning just makin' a fist  
I don't call it living, I just exist  
There must be something I missed  
  
Yeah, there must be something I need  
Something in a cage that wants to be freed  
I should be happy but yes indeed  
There must be something I need  
  
Yeah, we live and learn, crash and burn  
'Til it's our turn again  
It's the way it's always been  
Oh whoa oh  
Why can't I just let go?  
I told me so I oughta know by now  
It all comes down to this  
  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
I wake up in the morning just makin' a fist  
I don't call it living, I just exist  
There must be something I missed  
  
Yeah, there must be something I crave  
I try to be good but I misbehave, well  
Maybe I'm too far gone to save  
There must be something I crave  
  
Yeah, we live and learn, crash and burn  
'Til it's our turn again  
It's the way it's always been  
Oh whoa oh  
Why can't I just let go?  
I told me so I oughta know by now  
It all comes down to this  
  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
Yeah, there must be something I missed
