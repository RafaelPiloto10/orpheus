If I told you that I'd never really cared  
And if I told you that I'd never cried  
You'd know that I lied  
You'd know I lied  
And if I told you that I'd found somebody new  
It wouldn't make it any easier  
And what he doesn't know  
Won't hurt at all  
  
You know just as well as I  
That he's a better man than I  
And I know you know  
  
Guess I never got around to telling you  
I guess that if I told you now  
Then I'd have nothing to lose  
Well, I think of you  
'Cause if I told you that I'd found another girl  
It wouldn't make it any easier  
And what he doesn't know  
Won't hurt at all  
  
You know just as well as I  
That he's a better man than I  
You know just as well as I  
You know just as well as I  
He's a better man than I  
He's a better man than I could ever be
