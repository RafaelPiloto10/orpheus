One warm night I fell in love  
The air was still, the words would flow  
We knew each other oh so well  
And though just met you'd never tell  
Sometimes we're just lonely hearts  
That ride upon a floating card  
Prepared to live those sleepless nights  
For precious time in paradise  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  
There's no regrets, we made the choice  
We listened to that silent voice  
That haunts you 'til you just give in  
And makes you like a child again  
We drifted close then said goodbyes  
Just reading well each other's eyes  
The world had turned while we stood still  
And held on to each other  
And in between the right and wrong  
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I cried for it all  
She never heard me call at all
