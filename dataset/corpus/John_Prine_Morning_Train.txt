I saw you all dolled up  
Singing a song in your pickup truck  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
Hey, hey, Brother Ray  
What'd you mean by, what'd I say  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
If it's gonna rain and I wish that it would  
Just go ahead and rain, get it over for good  
If there's really a hole in that big blue sky  
Then move it on over and let me by  
  
Constantinople is a mighty long word  
Got three more letters than mockingbird  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
I like you with your make-up on  
All dolled up singing a song  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train
