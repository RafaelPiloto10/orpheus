Moves like a soldier

And she's gonna play  
She knows that she's got the hook  
And ya gonna pay

She's under age  
A real bollita  
She loves the stage  
La senorita  
Inside a cage  
You'll find a cheetah  
  
She's all the rage,  
A double feature  
She got that thing take  
The bible from the preacher  
You'll need a sage,  
To find that creature  
  
She knows that she's got the look  
And she's gonna play  
She knows that she's got the hook  
And ya gonna pay  
  
She got attitude  
Rock star city life
