She had on these high heels  
And her hair was like a black sea  
She disappeared, before we had a chance to meet  
  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that she's all that I need  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
Her beauty stars so bright  
You took me and sucked the breath from me  
Just for a second, she was my sunlight  
Then she fell into the crowd like the band of clouds  
Her darkness fell on me  
  
Oh yeah, I see her, somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that she's all that I need  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
She had on these high heels  
And her hair was like a black sea  
She disappeared before we had a chance to meet  
  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me (please come back to me)  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that she's all that I need  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
  
Counting on my lucky star  
I hope they point me where you are  
I hope, I pray to see your face again  
See there's no doubt that you are mine  
May fate bring me to your eyes  
So I can feel the gift of love again  
  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me (come back to me, come back to me)  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know, somehow I know she's all that I need  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
  
London, London
