We've traveled this world over in our day and in our time  
We've heard some songs that made no sense and some that did not rhyme  
We may never sing another song there ain't no way to know  
But let's have one more song for Jesus 'fore we go  
Oh we may not live the letter of the law and live that truth  
Judged and criticized for almost everything we do  
But they cannot stop our singing though they're holier than we  
Let's have one more song for Jesus if you please  
  
They say they're gonna burn us in a not too distant day  
I don't think we should buy that cause it just ain't Jesus' way  
Now they say he's mean and vicious and there's nothing that he won't do  
They must know a different Jesus than we do  
Oh we may not live the letter...  
  
Some atheists may tell us he was just another man  
Some say that he's a superstar and they're his biggest fans  
He means so much to so many that I think you will agree  
We oughta have one more song for Jesus if you please  
Oh we may not live the letter of the law and be that true  
Judged and criticized for almost everything we do  
But they cannot stop our singing though they're holier than we  
So let's have one more song for Jesus if you please  
We oughta have one more song for Jesus if you please  
Let's have one more song for Jesus on our knees  
Let's have one more song for Jesus if you please
