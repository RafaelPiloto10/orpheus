Fading everything to black and blue  
You look a lot like you  
Shatter in the blink of an eye  
You keep sailing right on through  
Every time you say you're learning  
You just look a lot like me  
Pale under the blistering sky  
White and red  
Black and blue  
You've been waiting a long time  
You've been waiting a long time  
  
To fall down on your knees  
Cut your hands  
Cut yourself until you bleed  
Fall asleep next to me  
Wait for everyone to go away  
And in a dimly lit  
room where you've got nothing to hide  
  
Say your goodbyes  
Tell yourself we'll read  
a note that says  
I'm sorry everyone  
I'm tired of feeling nothing goodbye  
  
Wash your face  
Dry your eyes  
Cause you've been waiting a long time  
You've been waiting a long long time  
To fall down on your knees  
  
Cut your hands  
Cut yourself until you bleed  
But fall asleep next to me  
Have a dream I'm falling down  
  
On my face  
Scrape my knees  
Scrape my hands until they bleed  
Cause you're fast asleep next to me  
Next to me, next to me, next to me
