Sounds that can't be made  
  
One day'll play you sounds that can't be made  
They'll sing in you from somewhere inside your head  
You'll never hear them from the earth or the air  
You'll never hear them from the outside world  
  
You'll hear it happen inside you  
You'll hear it happen inside you  
  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
  
Sounds that can't be made  
  
One day'll play you sounds that can't be made  
I'll feel them humming from somewhere inside your hand  
You'll never hear them from the boring ordinary tawdry world  
You'll never hear them from the anywhere you could call anywhere  
  
I'll make it happen inside you  
I'll make it happen inside you  
  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
  
Sounds that can't be made  
  
One day I'll play you sounds that can't be made  
They'll sing in us from somewhere inside our heads  
No One ever heard them but you and me  
  
We'll make it happen inside us  
We'll make it happen inside us  
  
Silent and High  
  
Like the wind blowin'  
In the palms of my mind  
I feel the wind blowin'  
In the palms of my mind  
  
Aurora Borealis shimmering green and blue  
Indigo and violent like phantoms half imagined something unreal but realer  
Than everything seeing all the planet's love floating in the air caressing  
You every day  
If only we can hear them  
  
Sounds that can't be made  
Sounds that can't be made  
  
No it ain't just in your mind babe  
It's inside you dig it out dig it out It's inside you  
Only love can stop you from merely exinsting  
Play me sounds that can't be made
