People raise your voices, don't get caught in that mess  
Like a fly in a spider's web, is it true more is less  
Herded like a happy flock to the big T.V. slaughter  
"Why don't you break that leash," said the heifer to the sheep  
It's a new generation  
It's a hallucination  
It's a mystic vibration  
It's just intimidation  
It's the will of the people  
It's the church with the steeple  
It's the sacred devotion  
To an unhealthy notion  
People raise your voices, don't get into that trap  
If your friends and your neighbors push  
Why don't you push them back  
Don't you think the time has come  
To stand up and be heard  
Ain't no use to try and wait  
For the magic word  
It's a new generation  
It's an infatuation  
It's a beautiful body  
Both erotic and deadly  
It's the fear of the future  
It's just surgeons and sutures  
It's a spandex obsession  
It's a lasting impression  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
Baptized in electronic water  
Prodigal sons and beautiful daughters  
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks  
And the righteous bath  
Death to the freaks  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
From the man whose voice sounds reassuring  
Completely firm and so alluring, Like's he's lived a thousand times before  
And seen the world from shore to shore  
With the calmness and tranquility that oozes credibility  
With the wisdom and the confidence that seem to scream out common sense  
And it makes you feel just like a babe  
Daddy holding you tight and safe  
Hush babe everything's all right, Daddy's gonna stay with you tonight  
Now he's got you by the balls, he can sell you anything at all  
From morality to diamond rings to genocide to magazines  
From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy  
It's a new generation  
It's a divine inspiration  
Always ready to follow  
Ever willing to swallow  
All the doctor's prescriptions  
All the mystic inscriptions  
It's the spandex obsession  
It's a lasting impression  
It's the calm meditation  
Of a tranquilized nation  
It's a hallucination  
It's a new generation
