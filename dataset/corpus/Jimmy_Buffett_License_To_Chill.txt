Work, work, work  
Big pile of it and the boss is a jerk.  
I just want to disappear  
Wishin' I was somewhere other than here.  
  
Livin' for the weekend,  
Jumpin' off the deep end,  
With just enough money to buy  
A license to chill  
And I believe I will  
  
Let the rat race run, roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny, songs get sung  
A little bit of money, the night's still young  
Leave me alone I've got a license,  
A license to chill  
  
Girls, girls, girls  
Ain't nothin' like them in the whole wide world.  
So damn smart and cute,  
And it's amazing what they pass off as a bathing suit.  
Winners and losers  
Sailors and cruisers  
We're all qualified, for a license to chill  
And I believe I will  
  
Let the rat race run, roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny, songs get sung  
A little bit of money, the night's still young  
Leave me alone I've got a license,  
A license to chill  
  
License to chill  
And I believe I will  
Let the rat race run, roll around in the sun until  
Trouble turns funny, songs get sung  
One good song will last all night long  
Leave me alone I've got a license,  
A license to chill  
  
A license to chill  
  
Ramos go rent me a coupe Deville  
Hey KL, where's that barbecue grill  
Head on down to Margaritaville  
Have me a cheeseburger with a big pickle dill  
Jesus, I sound kinda mentally ill  
I guess I better go turn on Dr Phil
