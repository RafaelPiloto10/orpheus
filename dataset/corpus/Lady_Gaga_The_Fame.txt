I can't help myself  
I'm addicted to a life of material  
It's some kind of joke  
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical  
  
All we care about is  
Runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles  
Give me something, I wanna be  
Retro glamor, Hollywood, yes we live for the  
  
[Chorus]  
Fame, doin' it for the fame  
Cause we wanna live the life  
Of the rich and famous  
Fame, doin' it for the fame  
Cause we gotta taste for champagne  
And endless fortune  
  
Fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
We live for the fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
Isn't it a shame, shame baby  
A shame, shame  
In it for the fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
  
I can see myself in the movies  
With my picture in the city lights  
Photograph my mind  
And what else you like to shoot  
You decide  
  
All we care about is  
Pornographic girls on film and body plastic  
Give me something  
I wanna see television and hot blonds in odd positions  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
We live for the fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
Isn't it a shame, shame baby  
A shame, shame  
In it for the fame, fame baby  
The fame, fame  
  
Don't ask me how or why  
But I'm gonna make it happen this time  
My teenage dream tonight  
Yeah I'm gonna make it happen this time  
  
Fame, doin' it for the fame  
Cause we wanna live the life  
Of the rich and famous  
  
[Chorus: x2]
