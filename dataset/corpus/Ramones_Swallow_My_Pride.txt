Winter is here and it's going on two years swallow my pride  
And things were looking very grim but they're looking good again  
Swallow my pride  
  
Loose lips sink ships, they say but isn't it always that way?  
Swallow my pride, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Winter is here and it's going on two years swallow my pride  
And things were looking very grim but they're looking good again  
Swallow my pride  
  
Gonna have a real cool time and everything's gonna be real fine  
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
