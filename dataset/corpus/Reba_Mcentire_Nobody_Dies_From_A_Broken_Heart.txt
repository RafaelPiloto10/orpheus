Nobody told me  
It could ever hurt so bad  
I'm having to learn the hard way  
Now that you're gone  
It's hurting me more  
Than any pain I've ever had  
And I don't know how I can go on  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody dies from a broken heart  
Give it time, and your dreams will start again  
I know love can tear you apart  
But nobody dies from a broken heart  
  
Everyone tells me  
It's gonna take a little time  
Before you find your heartaches  
Slipping away  
I know you mean well  
And they're just trying to ease my mind  
But it doesn't help to hear them say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's nothing anybody's gonna say  
That'll talk me out of feeling this way  
There's nothing anybody else can do  
To take away my love for you  
  
I know they mean well  
And they're just trying to ease my mind  
It doesn't help them to hear them say  
  
[Chorus]
