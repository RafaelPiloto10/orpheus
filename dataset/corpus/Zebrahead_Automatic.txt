We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We won't stop.  
Gonna crush the day  
Take any cheap shot  
Thrown our way  
Get high on top  
Of the world at bay  
And we're never coming down, never coming down, never!  
  
So we'll bleed on through and suffer the bruises  
Take all the blame but no excuses  
First one to blink is the first that loses  
So we're never looking down, never looking down, never!  
  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We're Automatic!  
It's a heart break,  
But it won't be long  
Like an earthquake,  
We kick it strong  
Make your world shake  
Cross the line that's drawn  
And we're never looking back, never looking back, never!  
  
So we'll lick our wounds, rise from the ashes  
Kick down the door and break the latches  
Gasoline dreams so we strike with matches  
So we're never giving up, never giving up, never!  
  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We're automatic like an addict passin' out on the lawn  
When we're chargin' into battle like Genghis Khan  
And you're god damn right we'll prove you wrong  
This block, this city, is where we belong!  
  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We're automatic tonight!  
  
We're automatic tonight!
