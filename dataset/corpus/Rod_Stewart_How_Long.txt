How long has this been going on?  
How long has this been going on?  
  
Well your friends and their fancy persuasion  
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme,  
But I can't help but have my suspicions  
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.  
  
Well you said you was never intending  
To break up our scene in this way,  
But there ain't any use in pretending  
It could happen to us any day,  
  
How long has this been going on?  
How long has this been going on?  
How long and how long has this been going on?  
How long and how long has this been going on?  
How long baby?  
  
Oh, your friends and their gentle persuasion  
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme,  
But I can't help but have my suspicions,  
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.  
  
Well you said you was never intending  
To break up our scene in this way,  
But there ain't any use in pretending  
It could happen to us any day,  
  
Tell me honey  
How long has this been going on?  
How long has this been going on?  
How long and how long has this been going on,  
Going on, going on?  
How long has this been going on?  
  
How long has this been going on,  
Going on, going on, going on?  
How long, honey, oh, has this been going on?  
How long has this been going on?  
How long has this been going on, going on, going on, going on?  
How long has this been going on, going on, going on?  
  
You been treated me mad you been treated me bad  
And it's been going on, going on, going on  
I ain't quite as dumb as I seem.  
I ain't quite the fool you mean  
But it's been going on, going on, going on, going on.
