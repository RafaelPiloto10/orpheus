I do not see the way out  
I do not really know how  
Like a shot in the dark  
Went your hallowed ground  
Had you taken too much  
Kept me well out of touch  
And refused to let me go  
  
I cannot see to you pain  
I do not hear you complain  
You are now but a dot in the pouring rain  
You created this mess now I'm bent to your stress  
And it seems to suit you well  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes the storm surely rising up  
Do do do do  
  
I do not see the way out  
You cannot turn this around  
Like a walk in the dark  
You have weighed me down  
I can't stand in your place  
Can't take this away  
It was all good to be true  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up  
Do do do do  
  
Oh you never talk about it  
No you never scream about it  
You took a spirit young and whole  
You turned this child into an old soul  
Old soul  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up  
Do do do do  
  
Oh you never talk about it  
No you never scream about it  
You covet things that you don't own  
You turn this child into and old soul  
Old sould  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up  
  
One and only two can be lonely  
I'm my own child blessed and unholy  
I your eyes a storm surely rising up
