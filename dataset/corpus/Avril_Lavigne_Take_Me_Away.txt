I cannot find a way  
To describe it  
It's there  
Inside  
  
All I do is hide  
I wish  
That it  
Would just go away  
  
What would  
You do?  
You do?  
If you knew  
What would you do?  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
I feel  
Like I  
Am alone  
All by  
  
Myself  
I need to get around this  
My words  
Are cold  
  
I don't want them to hurt you  
If I  
Show you  
I don't think you'd understand  
'Cause no one understands  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
I'm going nowhere  
On and on and  
I'm getting nowhere  
On and on and  
Take me away  
  
I'm going nowhere  
On and on and  
Up and on and  
Up and on  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
Take me away  
Break me away  
Take me away
