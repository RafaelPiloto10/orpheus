When I woke up this morning  
I was tired as I could be  
I think I was counting my money  
When I should have been counting sheep  
  
My agent he just called me  
And told me what I should be  
If I would make my music for money  
Instead of making music for me  
  
[Chorus]  
I said I know that this may sound funny  
But money don't mean nothin' to me  
I won't make my music for money, no  
I'm gonna make my music for me  
  
He said that people only buy the love songs.  
Rock and roll is not too long  
He said son you got to be commercial  
If you want to turn the people on.  
  
And I said turning on the people  
Now that's a beautiful place to be  
But if I spend my time makin' memorable rhyme  
Well who's gonna turn on me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now, I went up the country  
And I'll tell you all about the scene  
I found a place with much charm and much grace  
That was untouched by the music machine  
Well the people where havin' a good time  
Makin' music all day long  
And nobody cared if they ever got paid  
One penny for playin' a song
