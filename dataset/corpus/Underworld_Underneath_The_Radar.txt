Unknown  
Unseen  
We live underneath the radar  
No sign - on screen  
We dance underneath the radar  
  
Between the walls - well hey  
We're just too small to make a fuss about it  
Did something fall? well hey  
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?  
  
See ya later - see ya later  
Hip-a-no-no-no-no  
Hip-a-no-no-no-no  
See ya later - call me  
  
We dance underneath the radar  
We live underneath the bomb  
When you live underneath the radar  
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far  
(So get hip!)  
  
We speak  
Unheard  
Like ants we dance between the towers  
We sleep  
They move  
Come sailin' over the horizon  
  
Between the walls - well hey  
We're just too small to make a fuss about it  
Did something fall? well hey  
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?  
  
See ya later - see ya later  
Hip-a-no-no-no-no  
Hip-a-no-no-no-no  
See ya later - call me  
  
We dance underneath the radar  
We live underneath the bomb  
When you live underneath the radar  
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far  
(So get hip!)  
  
He says I am the doctor -  
In a be -52  
I come across the horizon -  
Drop my love on you  
I'm gonna W-O-O-O-O-O ya all - Watch out!  
I'm gonna W-O-O-O-O-O ya all  
See ya later!  
  
See ya later - see ya later  
Hip-a-no-no-no-no  
Hip-a-no-no-no-no  
See ya later - call me  
  
Between the walls - well hey  
We're just too small to make a fuss about it  
Did something fall? well hey  
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?  
  
We dance underneath the radar  
We live underneath the bomb  
When you live underneath the radar  
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far  
So get hip!  
  
(All the best)
