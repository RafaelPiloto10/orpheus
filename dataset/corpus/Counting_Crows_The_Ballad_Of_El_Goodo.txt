Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh  
And I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds  
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on  
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God  
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
  
There's people around who tell you that they know  
And places where they send you, and it's easy to go  
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row  
But you know you don't have to, you can just say no  
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
  
I've been built up and trusted, broke down and busted  
But they'll get theirs and we will get ours if we can  
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
Years ago my heart was set to live, oh  
And I've been trying hard against strong odds  
It gets so hard at times like now to hold on  
But I'll fall if I don't fight, and at my side is God  
  
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
There ain't no one going to turn me 'round  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on
