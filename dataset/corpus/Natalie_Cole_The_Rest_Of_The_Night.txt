oh, oh, oh  
Oh, yeah  
Baby, what's your hurry  
Where are you going so fast  
You can keep your motor runnin'  
But don't run out of gas  
Getting there is half the fun  
  
Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me  
And the best of my love's yet to come (yet to come)  
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you  
So take a little longer, my love can only get stronger  
(Stronger, stronger)  
  
If we're gonna climb a mountain  
We gotta take our sweet time  
When you're traveling down love's highway  
Don't you know speeding is a crime  
Listen, getting there is half the fun  
Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me  
And the best of my love's yet to come (yet to come)  
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you  
So take a little longer  
  
My love can only get stronger (stronger, stronger)  
Oh, my Baby, we gotta slow down (ooh)  
Take your time, ease your mind (oh, Baby, mm)  
Stronger, rest of my life, I'm gonna love you  
So just take a little longer, and our love is gonna get stronger  
(Cause you've got the rest of the night) oh, yeah  
(And the best of my love) yet to come (yet to come)  
Oh, baby, for (rest of my life) I'm gonna love you  
I want you to take your time  
  
Love me baby, love me baby, love me, love me (rest of my life)  
Slow down baby, I ain't going no where (best of my love)  
So why don't we just take our sweet time (rest of my life)  
Don't rush me, you're gonna crush me, let the feeling come  
Oh, remember that song about a slow hand (rest of the night)  
  
Now she had the right idea (oh)  
So, Baby, what's the hurry, (best of my love)  
we've got forever  
If we don't use it up too fast (oh, ah)  
Take it slow, calm down, smell the roses  
We'll get there, don't you worry  
(Rest of the night, to hold me) (best of my love, yet to come)
