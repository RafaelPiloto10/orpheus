Take my faith in your hands, we have a lot that hasn't near begun  
Something is calling us, we're breaking free  
I'm curious, I need to see  
  
Like a flash before our eyes, rolling to the night  
And if it feels like you're dreaming  
Believe it, believe it  
  
We'll have to wait to the morning  
The sun will never go down  
And we'll be this way forever  
I guarantee you that  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
You can feel it just the way it goes  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
  
Bring me down, side by side  
While our reflections pick up all this collide  
So full of energy, nothing to hide  
No need to sleep, we come alive  
  
And if we're gonna take this right  
We can go wherever we like  
And if it feels like you're dreaming  
Believe it, believe it  
  
We'll have to wait to the morning  
The sun will never go down  
And we'll be this way forever  
I guarantee you that  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
You can feel it just the way it goes  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
  
Believe it  
  
Take my faith in your hands, we have a lot that hasn't near begun  
Something is calling us, we're breaking free  
I'm curious, I need to see  
  
Our dreams was lower than this  
I flash before our dreams  
  
Like a flash before our eyes, running through the night  
And if it feels like you're dreaming  
Believe it, believe it  
  
We'll have to wait to the morning  
The sun will never go down  
And we'll be this way forever  
I guarantee you that  
Just stay awake, stay awake  
You can feel it just the way it goes  
Just stay awake, stay awake
