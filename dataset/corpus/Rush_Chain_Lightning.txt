Energy is contagious  
Enthusiasm spreads  
Tides respond to lunar gravitation  
Everything turns in synchronous relation  
  
Laughter is infectious  
Excitement goes to my head  
Winds are stirred by planets in rotation  
Sparks ignite and spread new information  
  
Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate  
  
Sun dogs fire on the horizon  
Meteor rain stars across the night  
This moment may be brief  
But it can be so bright  
  
Hope is epidemic  
Optimism spreads  
Bitterness breeds irritation  
Ignorance breeds imitation  
  
Sun dogs fire on the horizon  
Meteor rain stars across the night  
This moment may be brief  
But it can be so bright  
  
Reflected in another source of light  
When the moment dies  
The spark still flies  
Reflected in another pair of eyes  
  
Dreams are sometimes catching  
Desire goes to my head  
Love responds to your invitation  
Love responds to imagination  
  
Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate
