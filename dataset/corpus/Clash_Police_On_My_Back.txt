Well I'm running police on my back  
I've been hiding police on my back  
There was a shooting police on my back  
And the victim well he won't come back  
  
What have I done?  
  
I been running Monday Tuesday Wednesday  
Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday runnin'  
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday  
Saturday Sunday  
  
Yes, I'm running down the railway track  
Could you help me? Police on my back  
They will catch me if I dare drop back  
Won't you give me all the speed I lack
