Angie, Angie  
When will those clouds all disappear?  
Angie, Angie  
Where will it lead us from here?  
With no lovin' in our souls and no money in our coats  
You can't say we're satisfied  
But Angie, Angie  
You can't say we never tried  
  
Angie, you're beautiful  
But ain't it time to say goodbye  
Angie, I still love you baby  
Remember all those nights we cried  
All the dreams we held so close  
Seemed to all go up on a smoke  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Angie, Angie  
Where will it lead us from here? Yeah  
  
Oh Angie don't you weep  
All your kisses still taste sweet  
I hate that sadness in your eyes  
But Angie, ain't it time we say goodbye  
With no lovin' in our souls and no money in our coats  
You can't say we're satisfied  
But Angie, I still love you baby  
Everywhere I look I see your eyes  
There ain't a woman that comes close to you  
Come on baby dry your eyes  
But Angie, Angie  
Ain't it good to be alive  
  
Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried.
