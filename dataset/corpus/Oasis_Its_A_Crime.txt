Well you can say what you want  
But you won't get a thing from me  
And if you don't understand  
That's it's not in your hands you need  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
  
But you can say what you feel  
And it might never steal from me  
And then you must understand  
That it's all in your hands what you need  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
  
And I never knew  
But all the thing's that you've done  
Are coming right back to you  
But everybody know's that it's no crime  
  
But does it make you feel ashamed  
You never said what you done  
And there's no need to blame  
But everybody knows, yeah everybody knows  
Everybody knows that it's no crime, it's no crime  
  
So you can say what you want  
But you'll not get a thought from me  
But if you say what you mean  
Then you might get a thing from me  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
  
If I ever knew  
That all the thing's I've thought  
Are coming right back to you  
But everybody thinks that it's a crime  
  
It never makes you feel ashamed  
You sit around and you sold  
And you're passing the blame  
But everybody knows  
Yeah everybody knows  
Everybody knows that it's a crime  
It's a crime (3x)
