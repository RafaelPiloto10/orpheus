Trippin' out  
Spinnin' around  
I'm underground, I fell down  
Yeah, I fell down  
  
I'm freakin' out  
So where am I now?  
Upside down  
And I can't stop it now  
It can't stop me now  
  
I, I'll get by  
I, I'll survive  
When the world's crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Don't you try to stop me?  
I, I won't cry  
  
I found myself in Wonderland  
Get back on my feet again  
Is this real?  
Is this pretend?  
I'll take a stand until the end  
  
I, I'll get by  
I, I'll survive  
When the world's crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Don't you try to stop me?  
I, I won't cry  
  
I, I'll get by  
I, I'll survive  
When the world's crashing down  
When I fall and hit the ground  
I will turn myself around  
Don't you try to stop me  
I, I won't cry
