I hurt your feelings  
And you hurt mine, girl  
But I still love you  
More than anything in this world  
You got me crying, girl  
I'm going blind, girl  
I'm going up, down, down, up  
Losing weight by the pound  
Here's my love, take it all, girl  
Here's my heart, take it all, girl  
Here's my lips, kiss them again  
And, baby, you'll be feeling  
That mine will never be hurt again  
So let's get clever  
And get together  
And, baby, where you go, I go, you stay, I stay  
Everything will be just great
