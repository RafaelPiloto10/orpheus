Let it go, let it go homie

I done stay on top of my game, Gang controlling my lane  
Paid so much for my frames, put these lil niggas to shame  
Ordered so many of them bottles, so many of them bottles you would think I am
insane  
Already changed the game once I done told you, but now I'm gonna do it another
one do it again  
Tell the club owners we need more sections  
I made these lil' niggas go cop they Rolexes  
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers  
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces  
Hundred grand in a rubber band  
Use to be the kid, now homie I'm the man  
Hundred grand in a rubber band  
Used to be the kid, but now homie I'm the man  
  
Let it go, let it go homie  
You know we can see through the blinds homie  
See through the truth and them lies homie  
Just let it go, let it go, let it go  
Let it go, let it go homie  
You know they can't see what we see homie  
Difference from the real and make believe homie  
So let it go, let it go, let it go  
  
Living my life about peace  
Sharing this money and trying to all of niggas up and off them streets  
Used to look up some niggas, but now it all seem that it come down to me  
Make sure my family gon' eat  
Grinding from up underneath  
Now they just say I'm a now they just say I'm a beast  
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully  
Cause I'm the shit, literally  
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school  
I say fuck the new car, I cop the old school  
  
Let it go, let it go homie  
You know we can see through the blinds homie  
See through the truth and them lies homie  
Just let it go, let it go, let it go  
Let it go, let it go homie  
You know they can't see what we see homie  
Difference from the real and make believe homie  
So let it go, let it go, let it go  
Let let it go, let it go, let it go  
So let them go, let them go, let them go  
Let them know, let them know, let them know  
  
This time I feel like its now or never  
And going nowhere so no matter what they say I be here forever  
Even though some folks will make it so you can't win  
Don't need to take it on the chin  
Remember homie you ain't even gotta hold it in  
  
Let it go, let it go homie  
You know we can see through the blinds homie  
See through the truth and them lies homie  
Just let it go, let it go, let it go

Let let it go, let it go, let it go  
Let them go, let them go, let them go  
Let them know, let them know, let them know
