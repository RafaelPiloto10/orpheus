Watching the days burning out like a cigarette, just a few drags to go.  
You built me up and you broke me down, somehow  
Everything just seemed so clear to me, nothing left to know  
I'll love you right and I'll love you pure, right now  
  
How can you say, that its too late  
To save us now  
  
And I would wait for you, if you would wait for me  
And I will Wait for you, if you will wait for me  
  
Intoxicated, the edge is serrated, so easily torn from the core  
I blushed the first time, but you blushed the last time my eyes hit your mind  
Regenerated these feelings of hatred, I long for your love ever more  
You built me up and you broke me down this time  
  
And I would wait for you, if you would wait for me  
And I will Wait for you, if you will wait for me  
  
How can you say that its too late, to save us now  
How can you say
