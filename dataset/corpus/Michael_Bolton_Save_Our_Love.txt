Our love can last forever  
True hearts can beat as one  
Lost souls--I've seen their faces  
Girl, after the fire is gone  
  
Torn hearts, dreams are broken  
Love shattered before their eyes  
Did they run when runnin' was easy  
Or do they know where the secret lies?  
  
We've got so much more to say  
And far too much to lose  
Girl, if we try to find a way  
Before this night is through  
  
Save our love  
Stay a little longer  
Save our love  
Stay a little longer  
Save our love  
  
Look deep and feel the power  
Rescue love from a stormy sea  
We can reach through the distance between us  
Precious time is all we need  
  
And a dream is not enough  
When it's not worth fightin' for  
For all we've given to our love  
Tonight we've gotta give it more  
  
Save our love  
Stay a little longer  
Save our love  
Stay a little longer  
Save our love  
Stay and make it stronger  
Save our love  
  
Save our love  
Stay a little longer  
Save our love  
Stay a little longer  
Save our love  
Stay and make it stronger  
Save our love  
Save our love  
Save our love
