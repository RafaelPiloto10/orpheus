Sally, she says the sweetest things  
But words won't stop the pain  
She's painting skies of blue  
While I'm standing in the rain  
  
I love her still I always will  
  
Sally, she sings the sweetest songs  
But the melody is a lie  
She's had a change of heart  
I can see it in her eyes  
  
I love her so I can't let go  
  
Save every moment save every hour  
Gone are the golden days we knew  
Someone is lonely in love with the other  
And I'm still in love with you  
  
She was a flower child  
When whe came into my life  
And now the decades gone  
And nothings turned out right  
  
The feelings gone but life goes on  
  
Someone is lonely  
In love with the other  
And I'm still in love with you  
  
Sally, she says the sweetest things  
But words won't ever do  
You're throwing stones at me  
That I can't throw back at you  
  
I love you still  
I always will
