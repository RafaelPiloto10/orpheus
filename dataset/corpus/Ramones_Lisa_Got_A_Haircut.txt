Verse 1:  
Lisa got a haircut  
Another one today  
She stuck a pair of scissors up her butt  
And now she cries all day  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Verse 2:  
She started changing colour  
A new one everyday  
Last week she had it purple  
All the kids thought that was lame  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Verse 3:  
Lisa is a maniak  
She cut off all her hair  
She even had her tounge pierced  
And tatooed ugly stare  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Bridge:  
But the boys in the back don't think she's very pretty  
And the guys in the front will always call her witty  
But when you've got a hair cut that really looks that shitty  
Its no doubt they'd probably spit on both your mittys  
  
Chorus:  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I don't really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys weren't impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
They all thought that was weird (x3)
