You say you want to try again  
Wear it down between the lines  
Well, I have a better end in mind  
It doesn't seem you really have to  
Close your eyes to see, though I know  
You don't mean to be, you are so far from me  
There was something I had caught inside  
Screaming hard to make it known  
In time it died alone  
It doesn't seem you really have to close your eyes  
To see, you have been all you'll be to me  
It's just too late and we can't relate at all  
It doesn't seem you really have to  
Close your eyes to see, though I know  
You don't mean to be, you are so far from me  
This time's the last time I wanna say so long  
This song's my last song for you  
There's nothing to hold on to, nothing to hold on to
