Seven lonely days make one lonely week  
Seven lonely nights make one lonely me  
Ever since the time you told me we were through  
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you  
  
Oh, my darlin' you're cryin', boo-hoo-hoo-hoo  
There's no use in denyin' I cried for you  
It was your favorite pastime, makin' me blue  
Last week was the last time I cried for you  
  
Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears  
Seven letters, too, I filled with my fears  
Guess it never pays to make your lover blue  
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you  
  
Oh, my darlin you're cryin', boo-hoo-hoo-hoo  
Now, there's no use in denyin' I cried for you  
It was your favorite pastime, makin' me blue  
Last week was the last time I cried for you  
Last week was the last time I cried for you
