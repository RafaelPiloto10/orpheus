Living on juice  
Eating out of tuna cans  
Mobile home  
With my dairy queen  
Tied me a knot  
But she had to cut me loose  
I liked her a lot, yeah  
  
Like lovers do, like lovers do  
I liked her a lot, like lovers do  
  
Julia came  
Eating a tangerine  
Friday the third  
Four-thirty  
She tore out a page  
Of my magazine  
Then she went away, yeah  
  
Like lovers do, like lovers do  
She went away like lovers do  
  
Saturday girls  
Keep you warm a while  
But Sunday sunshine  
Kills all conversation  
You look in her eyes  
And you see circles  
Then she lets you get away, yeah  
  
Like lovers do, like lovers do  
You get away yeah, like lovers do  
  
Everyday you're so sad to see me  
And I'm so glad to take the blame  
It's always going to be that way  
  
Living on juice  
Eating out of tuna cans  
Mobile home  
With my dairy queen  
Tied me a knot  
But she had to cut me loose  
Now I'm looking at you yeh  
  
Like lovers do, like lovers do  
I'm looking at you now, like lovers do  
And I'm looking right at you now, just like lovers do  
And I'm looking right at you now girl  
Just like lovers do, like lovers do  
Like lovers do
