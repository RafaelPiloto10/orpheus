It's everything we do while we're here  
A fear or a thought, a feeling or a dream  
Touch it and taste it, breathe it all in  
Say what you feel, things aren't what they seem  
Why live, why breathe,  
Why breed, why die?  
These questions all tied up inside  
It's all or nothing or what you make it  
A prize or a secret, Which path do you take  
Decisions and gambles, a goal to be scored  
Risks and lies We all make mistakes  
Why live, why breathe,  
Why breed, why die?  
These questions all tied up inside  
Thoughts without pictures  
Looks without seeing  
Words without reason  
Touch without feeling  
Life is your reward  
Not to be ignored  
Why ask the questions when there's no answer?  
Why play the game when there's no way to win?  
Why ask the questions when there's no answers?  
Why seek the truth when the truth is within?
