Kind of Woman I Got  
  
(version from Osborne Brothers " Country Bluegrass" tape)  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
Well, the very first thing in the morning is " Get Up."  
  
The last thing I hear every night is " Shut Up."  
  
I found out my own cooking don't tast too hot.  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
Well, when I'm around the house, you're always a fussing.  
  
Nothing pleases you and you start cussing.  
  
I put up with you, and that's a heck of a lot.  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,  
  
But that would do you too much good so I'm not.  
  
Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.  
  
You aint' the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
(Banjo plays a verse)

Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.
