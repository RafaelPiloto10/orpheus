Freedom, keep walkin'  
Keep on your toesand don't stop talkin' 'bout  
Freedom, get goin'  
Lots to be learned and lots to be knowin' 'bout  
People, gotta reach 'em  
Sit 'em right down and then you gotta teach 'em 'bout  
Freedom, gotta win it  
Gotta put yourself smack dab in it  
  
Hey tomorrow  
Now don't you go away  
Cause freedom  
Just might come your way  
  
Freedom, keep tryin'  
People stay alive and people keep dyin' for  
Freedom, so don't lose it  
Ya gotta understand ya just can't abuse it  
Freedom, get movin'  
Never gonna stop till everybody's groovin' on  
Love for, one another  
Callin' some friend and callin' some brother  
  
Hey tomorrow  
You're not so far away  
Mother freedom  
We'll know you well someday
