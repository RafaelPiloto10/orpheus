I tried my best  
I gave my heart  
I took no rest  
Time will tell  
If I left my mark  
But I'll know full well  
  
I did my part  
When I look down that road  
What Do I see  
My children's children looking  
Right back at me  
When they look back at me(and I'm)  
Long gone away  
Will they think kindly of me  
When they hear me say  
  
[Chorus]  
I did my part  
I tried my best  
I gave my heart  
I took no rest  
Time will tell  
If I left my mark  
But I'll know full well  
  
I did my part  
When I look down that hall  
What do I see  
A little baby crawling  
Right back at me  
I cannot walk for him  
I cannot run  
But I can hold his hand  
And show him how it's done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I did my part  
Build a family  
Build a city  
Build a country  
Build a world  
Time will tell  
If I left my mark  
But I'll know full well  
I did my part  
But I'll know full well  
I did my part
