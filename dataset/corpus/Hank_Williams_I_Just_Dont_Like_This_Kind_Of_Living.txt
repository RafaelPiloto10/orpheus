I just don't like this kind of living  
I'm tired of doing all the giving  
I give my all and sit and yearn  
And get no loving in return  
And I just don't like this kind of living  
  
Why do we stay together?  
We always fuss and fight  
You ain't never known to be wrong  
And I ain't never been right  
  
Tell me where you think we're going  
'cause I ain't got no way of knowing  
When things go wrong, you go your way  
You leave me here to pay and pay  
And I just don't like this kind of living  
  
I just don't like the things you're doing  
Your evil heart will be your ruin  
When things start running smooth and free  
You haul right off and you pick on me  
And I just don't like this way of living  
  
They say the road of love is long  
It's rocky, and it's rough  
But if this road don't start to get smooth  
I've traveled it long enough  
  
Why don't you act a little older  
And get that chip up off your shoulder?  
I told you once  
Now I'll tell you twice  
You better start to treat me nice  
'cause I just don't like this way of living
