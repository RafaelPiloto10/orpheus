[Verse 1]  
It's over the line - a shadow of doubt  
From outside looking at the "in crowd"  
Tempting voices are calling you  
They look mighty fine - a sight to behold  
But all that glitters is not gold  
Still those voices are calling you  
  
[Chorus]  
All your missing is a heartache  
A disillusion for a keepsake  
A life of living with your own mistake  
All you're missing in a heartache  
  
[Verse 2]  
The water is high - you're out on a limb  
Well, if you take the fall then it's "sink or swim"  
Clouds of reason will follow you  
You're kissing the dark  
You're courting your pride  
You wonder is it greater on the other side  
But they have nothing to offer you  
  
[Chorus]
