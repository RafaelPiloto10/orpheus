I can't seem to make you mine  
I can't seem to make you mine  
You're flyin' around like a bee  
Hurtin' everything you see  
I tried everything I know  
To make you wanna love me so  
The only thing you do  
Is try to put the hurt on me  
  
Can't you see what you're doin' to me  
You fill my heart with a misery  
With every breath and step I take  
I'm more in love with you  
  
I can't go on like this  
A little bit of love, not one kiss  
I gotta have your love everyday  
A love that's real that will stay  
I can't seem to make you mine  
I can't seem to make you mine  
I can't seem to make you mine  
I can't seem to make you mine  
Can't you see what you're doin' to me  
You fill my heart with a misery  
With every breath and step I take  
I'm more in love with you  
  
I can't seem to make you mine  
I can't seem to make you mine  
Come back, baby, to me  
In my misery  
I give you love, not any day  
Never ever go away  
I can't seem to make you mine  
I can't seem to make you mine
