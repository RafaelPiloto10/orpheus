Everytime, we get together  
Everytime, your lips meet mine  
I start a-shiverin' and a-shakin'  
A quiverin' and a-quakin'  
Ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
Everytime, I look at you  
You don't know, what I go through  
Well, my head starts reelin'  
With a crazy kind of feelin'  
'Cause ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
When we kiss, that's the best of all  
I'm outta my mind, I'm havin' a ball  
I want this feelin' to stay and stay  
So I hold you tight while I push you away  
  
Don't you know, what you do to me  
I'm afraid that you just won't see  
But I'm laughin' and cryin', you got me sighin'  
Ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
Yeah everytime, we get together  
Yeah everytime, your lips meet mine  
I start a-shiverin' and a-shakin'  
A quiverin' and a-quakin'  
Ooh yeah, you give me the willies  
  
When we kiss, that's the best of all  
I'm outta my mind, 'cause I'm havin' a ball  
I want this feelin' to stay and stay  
So I hold you tight while I push you away  
  
Don't you know, what you do to me  
I'm afraid that you just won't see  
But I'm laughin' and cryin', you got me sighin'  
Wow, ooh yeah, you give me the willies
