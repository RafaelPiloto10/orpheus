I don't think you know that I hear you  
That you've been talking in your sleep  
You've been saying crazy things yeah  
As it all unfolds I get a clear view  
Of what you've been doing to me  
You've been lying through you're teeth  
And it makes me want to scream  
  
It's like I don't know who you are  
Feels like a dagger in my heart  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy  
Can't stop replaying the words you said  
You're like a stranger in my bed  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy  
  
What is it she does that I don't do  
Is she far more beautiful  
Does she make you feel at home  
Was it not enough, that I love you  
But you've been giving her your kiss  
And it almost makes me sick  
That I have to hear like this  
  
It's like I don't know who you are  
Feels like a dagger in my heart  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy  
Can't stop replaying the words you said  
You're like a stranger in my bed  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy
