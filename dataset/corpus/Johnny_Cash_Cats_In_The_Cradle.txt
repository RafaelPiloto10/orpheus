A child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
  
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it and as he grew  
He said, I'm gonna be like you, Dad  
You know I'm gonna be like you  
  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home Dad?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
My son turned ten just the other day,  
He said "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play  
Can you teach me to throw?", I said  
"Not today, I got a lot to do", he said, "That's okay"  
  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
He said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm gonna be like him"  
  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home, Dad?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
He came from college just the other day  
So much like a man, I just had to say  
"Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"  
He shook his head, and said with a smile  
  
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See ya later, can I have them please?"  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home Son?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
Now I've retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said, "I'd like to see you, if you don't mind"  
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time  
My new job's a hassle and the kids got the flu  
But it's nice talkin' to you Dad, it's sure nice talkin' to you"  
  
As I hung up the phone it occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me  
My boy was just like me  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home, Son?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then Dad  
You gonna have a good time then
