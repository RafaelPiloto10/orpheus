I know that hearts were loving  
Long before I was here.  
And I'm not the first to ever cry  
In my bed or in my beer.  
There were songs before there was radio  
Of love that stays  
And love that goes.  
They were writing melancholy tunes  
And tearful words that rhyme.  
  
[Chorus]  
Before my time.  
Before my time.  
  
There were songs in old dusty books  
Of love that's always been.  
Sweet lovers in their glory  
Who are now gone with the wind.  
Old fashioned love words spoken  
Then keep coming back around again  
Nothing's changed except the name,  
Their love burned just like mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And in the dim of yesterday  
I can clearly see  
That flesh and blood  
Cried out to someone  
As it does in me.  
And there was some old song that said,  
"I love you til I die."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But what the old time master's had  
Is what I feel for you.  
Love is love and doesn't change  
In a century or two.  
If someway they had seen and knew  
How it would be for me and you  
They'd wish for love like yours  
And they would wish for love like mine.  
  
[Chorus]
