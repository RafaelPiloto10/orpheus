Fool that I am,  
For falling in love with you.  
And a, fool that I am,  
For thinking you loved me, too.  
  
You took my heart,  
Then played the part of little coquette.  
And, all my dreams just disappeared  
Like the smoke from a cigarette.  
  
Fool that I am,  
For hoping you'd understand.  
And thinking you  
Would listen, too,  
And, oh, the things I had planned.  
  
But we couldn't see eye to eye  
So, darling, darling, darling,  
This is goodbye.  
But I still care, but I still care,  
And oh, fool that I am.  
Oh, but I still care,  
Fool that I am.
