Sitting on an angry chair  
Angry walls that steal the air  
Stomach hurts and I don't care  
  
What do I see across the way, hey  
See myself molded in clay, oh  
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid heeey  
Changing the shape of his face, ooh... yeah  
  
Candles red I have a pair  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Burning on the angry chair  
  
Little boy made a mistake, hey  
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh  
All that I want is to play, hey  
Get on your knees, time to pray, oh  
  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
Lost my mind, yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
Can't find it anywhere  
I Don't mind, aaah  
  
Corporate prison, we stay hey  
I'm a dull boy, work all day ooh  
So I'm strung out anyway heey  
  
[GUITAR SOLO]  
  
Loneliness is not a phase  
Field of pain is where I graze  
Serenity is far away  
  
Saw my reflection and cried heey  
So little hope that I died, oh  
Feed me your lies, open wide heey  
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh  
  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah  
Lost my mind, yeah  
I don't mind  
Can't find it anywhere  
I Don't mind aaah  
  
Pink cloud has now turned to gray  
All that I want is to play  
Get on your knees time to pray, boy
