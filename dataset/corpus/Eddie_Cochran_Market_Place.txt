Walkin' to the market place in New Orleans  
I saw the cutest little queen  
A pair of eyes I couldn't miss  
Lips that were beggin' to be kissed  
  
I went flyin' out in space  
When I saw that pretty face  
And I found that warm embrace  
At the market place, market place  
  
I didn't even know her name and didn't care  
I was glad I took a walk and saw her there  
In my arms she began to dance  
That was the start of a big romance  
  
Now that we are married up and settled down  
I like to sit and think of ol' New Orleans town  
The Mardigras, the happy fun  
Thankful for that good love I won
