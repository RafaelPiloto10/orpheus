We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
Let the river run,  
let all the dreamers  
wake the nation.  
Come, the New Jerusalem.  
  
Silver cities rise,  
the morning lights  
the streets that meet them,  
and sirens call them on  
with a song.  
  
It's asking for the taking.  
Trembling, shaking.  
Oh, my heart is aching.  
  
We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
We the great and small  
stand on a star  
and blaze a trail of desire  
through the dark'ning dawn.  
  
It's asking for the taking.  
Come run with me now,  
the sky is the color of blue  
you've never even seen  
in the eyes of your lover.  
  
Oh, my heart is aching.  
We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.

It's asking for the taking.  
Trembling, shaking.  
Oh, my heart is aching.  
We're coming to the edge,  
running on the water,  
coming through the fog,  
your sons and daughters.  
  
Let the river run,  
let all the dreamers  
wake the nation.  
Come, the New Jerusalem.
