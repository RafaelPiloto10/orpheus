When I'm at the pearly gates  
This will be on my videotape, my videotape  
Mephistopheles is just beneath  
And he's reaching up to grab me  
  
This is one for the good days  
And I have it all here  
In red, blue, green  
Red, blue, green  
  
You are my center  
When I spin away  
Out of control on videotape  
On videotape  
On videotape  
On videotape  
  
This is my way of saying goodbye  
Because I can't do it face to face  
I'm talking to you after it's too late  
From my videotape  
  
No matter what happens now  
You shouldn't be afraid  
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
