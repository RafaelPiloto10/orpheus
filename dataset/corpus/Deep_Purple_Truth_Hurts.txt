You know my will is broken  
You've got my heart on hold  
I'm lying here in pieces, so cold  
  
It gets so hard to handle  
All the things you need to say  
But I guess I heard it all before anyway  
Is love such a blessing or a curse  
Either way  
Truth hurts  
  
Well there'll be no more running  
Now I've got you face to face  
I want to know who you've been loving in my place  
  
You say I had it coming  
Try to hold my head up high  
Love gave me wings and left me paralyzed  
  
There's nothing left alive  
As we watch the spirits die  
The world keeps turning  
My heart keeps learning  
Do you know where the guilty sleep  
  
Babe I've got my pride  
Somehow I will survive  
The world keeps turning  
My heart keeps learning  
Do you know where the lonely sleep tonight  
  
Another fallen angel  
How far I just can't tell  
Living without love is a living hell  
Why is love such a blessing or a curse  
Baby either way  
Truth hurts  
  
Babe I've got my pride  
Somehow I will survive  
My heart keeps learning  
Don't know which is worse  
But one thing that I know  
  
Truth hurts
