Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Tell me I'm great and I'll be greater  
Build me up and I'll fly  
Love me now and I'll be glad later  
And tell your trouble goodbye  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Spill that cup of trouble and sorrow  
Sooner better for you  
Fill it up with a happy tomorrow  
We got some living to do  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Cover me up and I'll squeeze tighter  
Honey let's kiss me do  
That good good loving makes a bad bad fighter  
And I'm not picking on you  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me  
Lay some happiness on me  
So the brighter side you'll see  
No more loneliness to me  
Lay some happiness on me
