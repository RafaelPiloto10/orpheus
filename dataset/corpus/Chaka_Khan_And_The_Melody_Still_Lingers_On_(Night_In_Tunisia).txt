A long time ago in the 40's  
Dizzy and Bird gave us this song  
They called it "A Night In Tunisia"  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
It was new and very strange  
Blew the squares right off the stage  
Few could play along  
But the melody still lingers on  
  
Max and Miles to name just two  
Together they grew  
The music was young and strong  
And the melody still lingers on  
  
They paved the way for generations  
From Coltrane to Stevie  
No one could stop the winds of change  
Without them where'd we be?  
  
The Duke and the Prez were there before  
The past you can't ignore  
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame  
And the melody remains the same  
  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia  
In the 40's  
A night in Tunisia
