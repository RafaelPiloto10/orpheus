[Verse 1]  
I think I'll let fate just take me home  
Because over pain, love is outgrown  
I've never won a fight to understand  
I just move as my heart commands  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I've always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...  
  
[Chorus]  
Scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
So scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
  
[Verse 2]  
Have you found peace with your mistakes?  
Breathing on the glass as it breaks  
Have you found the words to save her  
And keep your heart out of danger?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I've always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby, it's perfect timing now to....  
  
[Chorus]  
Scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
So scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I've always had a thing for silence  
But lately I just need a voice I recognise  
Baby, it's perfect timing now to...  
  
[Chorus]  
Scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down  
So scream it out, out  
I won't let you down, down
