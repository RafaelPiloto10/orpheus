When the curtains of the night are pinned back by the stars  
And the beautiful moon sweeps the sky  
Dewdrops from heaven are kissing the rose  
It's then that your memory flies  
  
Well, upon the wings of a beautiful dove  
I'll hasten this message of cheer  
And I'll bring you a kiss of affection and say  
I'll remember you love in my prayers  
  
Now the angels of heaven are guarding the good  
As God has ordained them to do  
In answer to prayers that I offer to him  
I know there's one waiting for you  
  
Now go where you will upon land or on sea  
And I'll share all your sorrows and cares  
At night as I kneel by my bedside to pray  
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers  
  
Well at night as I kneel by my bedside to pray  
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers
