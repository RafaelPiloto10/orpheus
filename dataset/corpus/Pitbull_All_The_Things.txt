International sensation, you know  
And Mister Worldwide, dale!  
  
I'm like a quarterback, I got options  
But I played the point in school  
Broke ankles, more than a few  
Broke hearts, yeah, that too  
20 Years later, same movie, same script,  
Same player, more chips, more women, more haters  
Different toilet, same shh  
Why get caught up in the motions?  
Why go through the same emotions?  
In a sick way she love to see me mad  
It gets her wetter than the ocean  
She's a good girl gone bad  
But bad girls don't like good guys  
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy  
That's what I thought huh let's ride  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did,  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
They act hard but they got soft hearts  
And I know they're soft spots  
I meet them, I greet them, I train them  
And show them all about hard knocks  
Listen, next thing you know next thing you know)  
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox (Fort Knox)  
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not  
Damn, these are called rules of engagement  
Welcome to the world of entertainment  
They don't want a man like Reeman  
They want a man that's stuck in the remains  
I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys  
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?  
That's what I thought, now let's ride  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed
