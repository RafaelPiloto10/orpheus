I don't want to look  
Like some kind of fool  
I don't want to break  
My heart over you  
I'm building a wall  
Everyday it's getting higher  
This time I won't end up  
Another victim of love  
  
You say that I could  
Show some emotion  
That I've been  
Keeping secrets from you  
But I can see through  
All your sweet talk  
And all of your affection untrue  
I'm gonna find you out  
If I scream and I shout  
You won't break down my protection  
  
I don't want to look  
Like some kind of fool  
I don't want to break  
My heart over you  
I'm building a wall  
Everyday it's getting higher  
This time I won't end up  
Another victim of love  
  
I'm gonna lock up  
What I'm feeling inside  
Ain't no way you can  
Break down the door  
'Cause this time I've learned my lesson  
You can take this declaration of war  
Step right back  
Put on your coat and your hat  
Gonna avoid all complications  
  
I don't want to look  
Like some kind of fool  
I don't want to break  
My heart over you  
I'm building a wall  
Everyday it's getting higher  
This time I won't end up  
Another victim of love
