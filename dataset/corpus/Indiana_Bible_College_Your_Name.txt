[Verse:]  
Savior to all of the earth  
Greatest of Heaven's worth  
Your Name is all that is true  
Jesus it's You  
You are forever on high  
Merciful Savior divine  
Your Name is all that is true  
Jesus it's You  
Jesus it's You  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your name  
Hope for the hopeless  
Your name  
Healing the broken  
Your grace  
Making me whole again  
  
[Verse]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Your name carries the weary  
Your name rescues the hurting  
Your grace making me whole again  
  
[Tag]  
Your name is holy  
Your name is worthy  
Your name is Jesus  
  
You are forever on high  
Merciful Savior divine
