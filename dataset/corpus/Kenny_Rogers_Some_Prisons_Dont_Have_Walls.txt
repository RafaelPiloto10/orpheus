As I walk down this busy street  
I think about your leaving  
How my life may never be the same  
I know I should be planning ways  
To enjoy this endless freedom  
Losing you has put my heart in chains.  
  
Darling, some prisons don't have walls  
Your memory won't let me go at all  
I found no way out since you've been gone  
Some prisons don't have walls.  
  
Every night I turn the T.V on  
To break the sound of silence  
For a while it takes you off my mind  
Just when I feel over you reality surrounds me.  
  
There I am right back doing time.  
Darling, some prisons ...
