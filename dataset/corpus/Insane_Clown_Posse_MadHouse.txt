Welcome... to the Madhouse...  
Here ghost wail and moan  
Skeletons rattle trying to escape there prisoning coffins (Wicked Shit)  
Grimlins and skulls gasp a death (ICP Tech N9ne)  
You have enterd the Mad House  
Sombody open the fuckin door and let me in!  
The worlds are about to get me again  
Shit ain't pretend I'm safer in the madhouse  
Clinging to the selene like a spider  
I'm out of your mind like frozen fire  
Razorblade fingers scratchin my neck  
Lost in the maze I found a dragon barbeque in the back  
A arm came out of the toilet and squaws my balls  
That shirt hurt got me head but holes in the walls  
I wanna see you!  
I hear you!  
I catch spirits and ghosts by there invisible throats and then tear through
(tear through)  
Never scary boo bitch I'm a kamikaze  
Swimmin through the living room watching joni and chachi  
And then I realize I'm potsy trapped in the tv  
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me  
Your ain't never gettin in and we ain't never gettin out  
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
