Is there anyone out there?  
Or am I walking alone?  
When I turned around and found that you'd gone before  
The first rain could fall  
  
It seems every single time I was bleeding  
Broken promises that never came true  
Well it ain't so long before the dawn  
When the sun is gone so are  
Well, so are you  
  
So what's it gonna take  
To get you back in bed?  
Gossip, drugs, and snakes  
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)  
Fair weather friends (fair weather friends)  
  
One day when we're far away  
From everything that hurts  
Drink and screw is all we'll do  
Every day  
  
So what's it gonna take  
To get you back in bed?  
Gossip, drugs, and snakes  
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)  
  
And though the hour's late  
Don't let 'em in your head (fair weather friends)  
Gonna pray for rain again and again  
Fair weather friends  
Fair weather friends  
  
Fair I don't give a shit about 'em anyhow
