I ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune  
Ah, babe, I'm a-commin' soon  
I cannot believe I stayed so long away  
But a man must look around  
And you're the sweetest thing I've found  
Your lost high roller's rollin' home today  
  
My daddy said to me  
"Son, it's hard as you will see  
To find someone upon whom to rely"  
In the kitchen mama sneezed  
And he grinned big as you please  
Said "bless you" and a tear come to his eye  
  
I did decide that very day  
That I would like to live that way  
And now I know I just been wastin' time  
It's with you that I should be  
If you feel the same 'bout me  
I'm headed home along the straightest line
