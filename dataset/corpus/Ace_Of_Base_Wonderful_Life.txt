Here I go  
Out to the sea again  
The sunshine fills my hair  
And dreams hang in the air  
Gulls in the sky  
And in my blue eyes  
I know it feels unfair  
There is magic everywhere  
  
Look at me standing here  
Here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
Sun's in your eyes  
The heat is in your hair  
They seem to hate you  
Because you are there  
And I need a friend  
Oh, oh, I need a friend  
To make me happy  
I stand here on my own  
  
Oh oh oh ooh,  
Look at me standing here  
I'm here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
I need a friend  
Oh, I need a friend  
To make me happy  
Not so alone  
  
Look at me standing here  
I'm here on my own again  
Up straight in the sunshine  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
No need to run and hide  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
No need to laugh and cry  
It's a wonderful, wonderful life  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
