Wash your back so you won't stab mine  
Get in bed with your own kind  
Live your life so you don't see mine  
Drape your back so you won't shine  
  
Oooh then she hold my hand  
And I lie to get a smile (x2)  
  
Using what I want  
To get what you want (x4)  
  
Ooh, sweet amber  
  
How sweet are you?  
How sweet does it get? (x2)  
  
Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick  
She rolls me over, 'till I'm sick  
She deals in habits, deals in pain  
I run away, but I'm back again  
  
Oooh, then she holds my hand  
And I lie to get a smile  
And she squeezes tighter  
I still lie to get a smile  
  
Using what I want  
To get what you want (x4)  
  
Ooh, sweet amber  
  
How sweet are you?  
How sweet does it get? (x2)  
  
She holds the pen that spells the end  
She traces me and draws me in (x2)  
  
Ooh, sweet amber...  
Ooh, sweet amber  
  
How sweet are you?  
Oooh, how sweet does it get? (x2)  
  
It's never as sweet as it seems!
