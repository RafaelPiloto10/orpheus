Open the door, baby turn on the light  
We're gonna have a party tonight  
For a rock, for a rocker  
I know it's late and you're already down  
You ain't ready for people around  
I'm gonna tell you something I found out  
Whatever you think your life is about  
Whatever life may hold in store  
Things will happen that you won't be ready for  
I've got a shirt so unbelievably bright  
I'm gonna dig it out and wear it tonight  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
Don't have to change, don't have to be sweet  
Gonna be too many people to possibly meet  
Don't have to feed 'em, they don't eat  
They've got their power supplies in the soles of their feet  
They exist for one thing, and one thing only  
To escape living the lives of the lonely  
For a friend of mine, from the neighborhood  
Moving down the line, after tonight he'll be gone for good  
Here comes Ricky, Danny, and Doerge  
They got Pete's number and they're looking at me  
Russell and Bobby setting up the drums  
Gonna pound on 'till the landlord comes  
Don't want to argue, I don't want to fight  
But there will definitely be a party tonight  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
'Till the morning comes, 'till the car arrives  
'Till we kill the drums, 'till we lose our lives  
Hey Jenny, tell Peggy Sue  
We're gonna do the only thing you can do  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
For a rocker, for a rocker  
There's a party tonight!  
There's a party tonight!  
There's a party tonight!  
There's a party tonight!
