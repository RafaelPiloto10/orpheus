Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,  
I never lnew that I was born.  
Well. I like you for your body, but I love 'cause you're wise,  
I am your prisoner, Oh my Lady of the Dawn.  
You are the dealer,  
In this strange, uncertain game,  
Take my cards and deal again,  
I can feel my life is changing.  
Woman,  
Now you taught me how to learn,  
Teach me to earn  
The love you give to me,  
The love you give to me.  
Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,  
I never lnew that I was born.  
Well. I like you for your body, but I love 'cause you're wise,  
I am your prisoner, Oh my Lady of the Dawn.  
I was waiting  
In the darkness of the night,  
Only now I see the light  
Softly shining in the silence.  
Woman,  
If you really hold the key,  
Turn it for me,  
And help me understand,  
And help me understand.  
Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,  
I never lnew that I was born.  
Well. I like you for your body, but I love 'cause you're wise,  
I am your prisoner, Oh my Lady of the Dawn
