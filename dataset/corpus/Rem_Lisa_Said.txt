There you come again, I see you're having your everlasting smile on your  
Face, like now n' then.  
I cannot hide, I cannot fight, I cannot go, you know, you know, you  
Know,  
Hey, do you know  
That you do not have to entertain anybody, that you do not have to  
Entertain my cat,  
If you don't want that, yeah.  
It seems that you don't know that you're twisted by your nature n'  
That's the reason  
I hate ya.  
I'm gone, I can't stay another day.  
Roll my mind, hold my hands up in the air.  
So here it comes now - a coupple of hard words, yah, yah, I know this  
Hurts but I'm so, so happy.  
Cause you, oh yes, yes, you do really deserve this. Shed a tear when you  
Want me to stop.  
So many times you have made people cry. So many lies, why I'm asking.  
I'm the one who will say, hey get out of my way, because you're twisted.  
Oh yes you are
