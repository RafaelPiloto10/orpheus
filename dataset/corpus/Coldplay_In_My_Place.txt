In my place, in my place  
Were lines that I couldn't change  
I was lost, oh yeah  
  
I was lost, I was lost  
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed  
I was lost, oh yeah  
  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Yeah how long must you pay for it?  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Oh for it  
  
I was scared, I was scared  
Tired and under prepared  
But I wait for it  
  
If you go, if you go  
Leave me down here on my own  
Then I'll wait for you (yeah)  
  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Yeah how long must you pay for it?  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Oh for it  
  
Sing it, please, please, please  
Come back and sing to me, to me, me  
Come on and sing it out, now, now  
Come on and sing it out, to me, me  
Come back and sing it  
  
In my place, in my place  
Were lines that I couldn't change  
And I was lost, oh yeah, oh yeah
