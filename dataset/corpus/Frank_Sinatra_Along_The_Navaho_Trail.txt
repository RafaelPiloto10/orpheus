Every day, along about evening  
When the sunlight's beginning to pale  
I ride through the slumbering shadows  
Along the Navajo trail  
  
When it's night and crickets are callin'  
And coyotes are makin' a wail  
I dream by a smoldering fire  
Along the Navajo trail  
  
I love to lie and listen to the music  
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar  
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'  
It always finds me wishin' on a star  
  
Well whatta, ya know, it's mornin' already  
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale  
It's time to climb into my saddle  
And ride the Navajo trail  
  
I love to lie and listen to the music  
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar  
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'  
It always finds me wishin' on a star  
  
Well whatta, ya know, it's mornin' already  
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale  
(Like a silvery veil)  
It's time to climb into my saddle  
And ride the Navajo trail  
  
Ride the Navajo trail  
Ride the Navajo trail
