Ohhh ohhhh ohhhh  
Mmmm mmmm  
Yeah yeah yeah!  
Oh baby your so fine  
I really want you to be mine  
Under the moonlit sky  
I wish it was just you and I  
  
Chorus  
Do you believe in love, at first sight?  
Cos I do, I really really love you!  
Do you believe in love, at first sight?  
Cos I do... Ohhh... Mmm  
  
The very first time that we met,  
You sliped, into my heart,  
The very first time that we touched,  
I knew I loved you so much.  
  
Repeat chorus (twice)  
  
Ohhhhh.......(faded)
