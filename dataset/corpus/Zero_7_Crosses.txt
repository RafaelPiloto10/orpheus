Don't you know that I'll be around to guide you  
Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you  
Returning nightmares only shadows  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now  
  
Crosses all over, heavy on your shoulders  
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward  
Disturbing silence darkens you sight  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now  
  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
  
The streets outside your window over flooded  
People staring, they know you've been broken  
Repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces  
Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
