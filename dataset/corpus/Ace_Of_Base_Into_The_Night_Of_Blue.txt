Into the night of blue, into the night of blue...  
  
Haven't heard your voice for a long long time  
Still you have me hanging on the line  
Still thinking 'bout you  
Haven't seen a smile upon my face  
And I haven't slept a night for days  
I go, I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You don't know what I'm going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
  
In my mind are pictures of the past  
Telling me a story meant to last  
Still holding onto  
Days out on the beach out in the sun  
Nights when I was still your only one  
Now I go, I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You don't know what I'm going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
  
Funny how these memories  
Only lead me back to you  
They lead me back to you  
I go, I go...  
  
Into the night of blue...  
  
Haven't heard your voice for a long long time  
Still you have me hanging on the line  
Now I go, I go...  
  
Into the night of blue  
You don't know what I'm going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
I'm living lonely, where's my baby  
Into the night of blue, into the night of blue  
  
Into the night of blue, into the night of blue
