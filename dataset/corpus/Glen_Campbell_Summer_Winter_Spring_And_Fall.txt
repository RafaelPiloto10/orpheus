Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall  
Your love for me is over but sweet me'ries I still recall  
Each season brings its changes but in me there's been no change at all  
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
I thought some day I'll forget you but the chances now seem very small  
There's too much of you still here with me to ever forget you at all  
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall
