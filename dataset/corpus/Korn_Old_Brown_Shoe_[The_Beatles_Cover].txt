I want a love that's right,  
But right is only half of what's wrong.  
I want a short-haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.  
Now I'm steppin' outta this old brown shoe,  
Baby, I'm in love with you.  
So glad you came here, won't be the same now,  
I'm telling you.  
  
You know you pick me up  
From where some try to drag me down  
And when I see your smile  
Replacin' every thoughtless frown  
You got me excapin from the zoo  
Baby, I'm in love with you  
So glad you came here  
Won't be the same now, I'm tellin you  
  
If I grow up I'll be a singer,  
And wear rings on every finger.  
Not worryin' what they or you say,  
I'll live an' love and maybe someday,  
Who knows baby,  
You may comfort me  
  
I may appear to be imperfect,  
My love is sumthin' you can't reject  
I'm changin' faster than the weather  
If you and me should get together  
Who knows baby, you may comfort me.....  
  
I want a love that's yours,  
To miss is really sumthin' I'd hate.  
I'll get an early start,  
Makin' sure that I'm not late (Hey!)  
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue,  
Baby I'm in love with you  
So glad you came here,  
Won't be the same now, I'm tellin' you  
(Hey yeah yeahhhh)
