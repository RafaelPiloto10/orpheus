You better listen my brother  
'cause if you do you can hear  
There are voices still callin' from across the years  
And they're cryin' across the ocean  
And they're cryin' across the land  
And they will until we all come to understand  
  
That none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well there are people in the darkness  
And they just can't see the light  
And if we don't say it's wrong then that says it's right  
We got to feel for each other  
Let our brothers know we're here  
Got to get the message and send it out loud and clear  
  
That none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
Well it's the single truth  
We all need to see  
That none of are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well I swear to you salvation isn't very hard to find  
None of us can find it on our own  
We got to join together. Spirit, heart and mind  
All the are suffering, knows they're not alone  
  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
  
If you just look around you  
You're see what I say  
'cause the world's gettin' smaller each passin' day  
Now it's time to make some changes  
Now it's time all realized  
That the truth is shinin' right before our eyes  
  
'cause none of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
Well it's the very heart of humanity  
'cause none of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us are free  
  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us  
None of us, none of us are free  
  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free  
'cause it's the very truth  
We all need to see  
That none of us are free if one of us is chained  
None of us are free
