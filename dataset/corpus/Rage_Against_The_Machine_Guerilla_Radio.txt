Transmission third world war third round  
Decade of the weapon of sound above ground  
No shelter if you're looking for shade  
I lick shots at the brutal charade  
As the polls close like a casket on truth devoured  
Silent play in the shadow of power a spectacle monopolized  
The camera's eyes on choice disguised  
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?  
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?  
Yes a spectacle monopolized  
They hold the reins, stole your eyes  
All the fistagons the bullets and bombs  
Who stuff the banks and staff the party ranks?  
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord  
None of the above fuck it cut the cord  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Contact I hijacked the frequencies blockin' the beltway  
Move on DC way past the days of bombin' MCs  
Sound off Mumia guan be free  
Who gott 'em yo check the federal file  
All you pendejos know the trial was vile  
Army of pigs try to silence my style  
Off 'em all out that box it's my radio dial  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
Turn that shit up  
Lights out guerilla radio  
It has to start somewhere, it had to start sometime  
What better place than here, what better time than now  
All hell can't stop us now, all hell can't stop us now  
All hell can't stop us now, all hell can't stop us now  
All hell can't stop us now, all hell can't stop us now
