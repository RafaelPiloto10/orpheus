Decisions, but I want it all so I get it all  
I wanna eat the whole cache  
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing  
You should have to learn how to bake  
  
Yes I want it all so I get it all  
I wanna eat the hole cake  
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing  
You should learned bitches love cake!

Decision, between a family or a porn star  
I'm alive for sports cars, live it or die, whole bar  
Headache for my management, gossip columns resident  
Your mom and dad might hate me but in 5 years I'm the president  
  
I wanna a girl, I get her  
And I get her friend  
Five girls singhing in my bedroom, start my own band  
They love me in my peak,  
But this love is fake.  
Everyday's my birthday, cause bitches love cake  
  
Decisions, but I want it all so I get it all

I wanna eat the hole cake  
I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing  
You should learned bitches love cake!
