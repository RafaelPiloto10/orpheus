Lately I've been noticing  
I say the same things he used to say  
And I even find myself acting the very same way  
I tap my fingers on the table  
To the rhythm in my soul  
And I jingle the car keys  
When I'm ready to go  
When I look in the mirror  
He's right there in my eyes  
Starin' back at me and I realize  
  
[Chorus]  
The older I get  
The more I can see  
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
There were times I thought he was bein'  
Just a little bit hard on me  
But now I understand he was makin' me  
Become the man he knew that I could be  
In everything he ever did  
He always did with love  
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son  
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad  
I just smile and say you already have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's in my eyes  
My heart, my soul  
My hands, my pride  
And when I feel alone  
  
And I think I can't go on  
I hear him sayin' "Son you'll be alright"  
Everything's gonna be alright"  
Yes it is  
  
The older I get  
The more I can see  
That he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
Oh I hope I see  
I hope everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
A little more of my father in me  
I hope everyday I see in me  
In me  
In me  
I hope everyday I see  
  
A little more of my father in me
