Now at the station, the train to another land  
Lands of never seen light  
Light hidden in infinite night  
Night in it's biggest might, might of the strongest power  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
The waiting room of kingdom come,  
I look back upon my life  
Life of loss but now the end  
End of rat race overdrive  
Overdrive to foreign lands  
Lands of contemptuous hours  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
Now on the train  
This is the end of my day  
I feel my spirits escape like a musical clock  
That's dying away  
I turn once again and wave my hand  
And say goodbye  
I never thought it's so easy  
I never thought it's so easy  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
i take the first train to the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower
