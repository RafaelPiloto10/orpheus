I wake up every evening  
With a big smile on my face  
And it never feels out of place.  
And you're still probably working  
At a 9 to 5 pace  
I wonder how bad that tastes  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
  
Now where's your picket fence love?  
And where's that shiny car?  
Did it ever get you far?  
You never seem so tense, love  
I never seen you fall so hard  
Do you know where you are?  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told I'm lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
Hope it gives you hell  
  
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself  
Yeah. Where did it all go wrong?  
But the list goes on and on  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told I'm lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
Now you'll never see  
What you've done to me  
You can take back your memories  
They're no good to me  
And here's all your lies  
You can look me in the eyes  
With the sad, sad look  
That you wear so well  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
(hope it gives you hell)  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
(hope it gives you hell)  
When you hear this song and you sing along well you'll never tell  
(you'll never tell)  
Then you're the fool I've just as well I hope it gives you hell  
(gives you hell)  
When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell  
(give you hell)  
You can sing along I hope that he will treat you well
