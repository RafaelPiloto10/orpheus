I'll miss your naked body  
I'll miss your mind  
Human beings learn to miss  
The things they leave behind  
Another romance broken  
It's time to go  
Too late to contradict  
What we already know  
Closed my eyes  
To the truth  
And the lies  
Never again  
Won't ask why  
Don't reply  
I'll just say  
Never again  
Time tells  
Your heart compels  
Never again  
Never take a chance  
Again  
Time tells  
Your heart compels  
Never again  
Never break a heart again  
Never again never again  
But until then  
Never again never again  
Never again  
Never again never again  
Never again never again  
I know I couldn't keep you  
I know the score  
I know I'm surplus  
To the life you're looking for  
'Though nothing lasts forever  
Still hope remains  
We never go back to  
The way we were before  
From now on  
To the end  
Won't pretend  
Say it again  
Won't commit  
Won't submit  
'Til I know  
Never again  
Chorus  
Woman  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Woman  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Never again  
Never break a heart again  
Time tells  
Woman  
Your heart compels  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Never take a chance  
Again  
Time tells  
Woman  
Your heart compels  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Never break a heart again  
Never again never again  
But until then  
Never again never again  
Never again  
Never again  
Never again never again  
Never again never again
