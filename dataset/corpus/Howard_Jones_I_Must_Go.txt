You let me paint  
The colours of your mind  
The love that remains wont fade over time  
You'll be alright  
So baby don't cry  
I'll be the sunset in your sky  
I'll be the soft winds you feel passing by  
So chin up my darlin'  
Ill be there on that distant horizon  
That hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
You let me be the person that I am  
Through my confusion you helped me stand  
I'll be alright  
So baby don't cry  
I'll be the sunset in your sky  
I'll be the soft winds you feel passing by  
So chin up my darling  
I'll be there on that distant horizon  
That hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
So chin up my darlin'  
I'll be there on that distant horizon  
It hurts be so  
But I must go  
I must go  
  
I will search every star 'till I find where you are  
And take you home  
So chin up my darlin'  
I'll be there on that distant horizon  
It hurts me so  
But I must go  
  
I must go
