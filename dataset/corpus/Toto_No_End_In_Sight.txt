The curse of blood  
Falls upon this nation  
I was my hands  
And hang my head in shame  
I pray for peace  
And forge the crooked valley  
This dreader fear  
Held prisoner inside me  
  
Chorus  
I search the stars, still I find  
No rhyme or reason  
I can't see a thing  
That's gonna make it right, oh make it right  
You're still walking at midnight  
Alone with voices in your mind  
You see the world in black and white  
You know until you see the light  
There ain't no end, no end in sight  
  
I can't justify  
The cleansing of society  
The human race  
It ain't no race at all  
I breach the flood  
Of political insanity  
Where hope once stood  
Is filled with lies and shame  
  
Chorus
