A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
And all of this happened  
Because the world is waiting  
Waiting for one child  
Black, white, yellow, no one knows  
But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter  
Hate to love, war to peace  
And everyone to everyone's neighbour  
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever  
  
It's all a dream and illusion now  
It must come true, sometimes soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born
