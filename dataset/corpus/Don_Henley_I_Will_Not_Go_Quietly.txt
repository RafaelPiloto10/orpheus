Woke up with a heavy head  
And I thought about leavin' town  
I could have died if I wanted to  
Slipped over the edge and drowned  
But, oh no baby, I won't give up that easy, no  
  
Too many tire tracks in the sands of time  
Too many love affairs that stop on a dime  
Oh well, oh baby  
I think it's time to make some changes 'round here  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up  
Gonna trash it up  
I'm gonna round it up  
Gonna shake it up  
Oh, no, baby, I will not lie down  
  
I'm brave enough to be crazy  
I'm strong enough to be weak  
I see all these heroes with feet of clay  
Whose mighty ships have sprung a leak  
And I want you to tell me darlin'  
Just what do you believe in now?  
  
Well, c'mon over here baby  
You 'bout to gimme a heart attack  
I want to wrap my lovin' arms  
Around the small of your back  
Yeah, and I'm gonna pull you, pull you, pull you  
Pull you right up close to me, yeah  
  
Yeah we're gonna tear it up  
We gonna trash it up  
Gonna round it up  
Gonna shake it up  
Oh, no no no, I will not lie down  
  
Turn this thing around  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not lie down, no  
  
Well, don't you ever get lonely?  
Don't you ever get down?  
Don't you ever get tired of all the wicked tongues in this town?  
Of, baby, I just want to take you away from here  
  
I ain't no tiger  
I ain't no little lamb  
Suppose you tell me mama  
Who do you think I think I am?  
And ooh baby, don't you give a damn?  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up  
Gonna trash it up  
Gonna round it up  
Gonna rip it up  
I will not lie down  
  
Yeah I'm gonna tear it up  
Gonna trash it up  
Gonna round it up  
Gonna shake it up  
Oh baby, I will not lie down  
  
Turn this thing around  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will no go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not lie down
