It's gonna break you, son, it's gonna rot you through  
Forget the past and all you ever knew  
You've never known such fear, you've never shed such tears  
It'll have you wishin' you were never here  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
Straight through the depths of hell, ain't got no soul to sell  
Death on death, the eternal funeral bell  
You've never known such fear, you've never shed such tears  
It'll have you wishin' you were never here  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down, forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone, blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be  
No tomorrow, the demise of sanity  
All that has been, all that's to be
