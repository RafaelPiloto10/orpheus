I've been to all the ol' familiar places  
At least a hundred of times since you've been gone  
I've seen a lot of ol' familiar faces  
But again tonight I'm goin' home alone  
  
My heart won't let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do  
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new  
But my heart won't let me love no one but you  
  
I've told myself a million times it's over  
You've gotta face the truth and let her go  
Just when I think I've got it all together  
Your memory walks around in side my soul  
  
My heart won't let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do  
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new  
But my heart won't let me love no one but you
