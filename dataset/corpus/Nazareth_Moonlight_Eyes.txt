Moonlight eyes I see you smile  
It lightens up my night  
Your smile takes all the fight out of me  
Moonlight eyes I hear you cryin'  
It robs me of my pride  
There's nothing I can hide from moonlight eyes  
I got no control  
You just roll me like the sea  
Oh moonlight eyes  
  
Mooonlight eyes you're grown now  
I'll soon be out of touch  
You'll lose that innocence  
That cost so much  
Moonlight eyes you'll find your pain  
You'll say that I'm all wrong  
There'll always be a place where you belong  
I got no control  
You just roll me like the sea  
Oh moonlight eyes  
Tell your sweet lies only to me, only to me  
  
Moonlight eyes you soothe me  
Moonlight eyes you're easy on my soul  
Moonlight eyes you are the reason  
The meaning in the words  
The words to every song I've ever heard  
Paralyzed in sweet surprise  
Your every wrong is right  
One look into your night  
Oh moonlight eyes  
I got no control  
You just roll me like the sea  
Oh moonlight eyes  
Tell your sweet lies only to me, only to me  
Moonlight eyes.
