Lets leave town on a permanent vacation  
Lock up the house pack up the station wagon  
Make paradise our final destination  
As long as we're outta here  
  
There ain't no time like the present they say  
Lets cruise all the way down A1A  
Put the top down and catch a few rays  
Baby we'll be outta here  
  
[Chorus]  
Anywhere you want to go  
As long as its sunny weather  
Let the time fly by I don't mind  
As long as we're together  
  
South of the border there's a place I know  
Where James Taylor sang about Mexico  
And the suns so hot we'll forget to go home  
Baby we'll be outta here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe drive to the country  
Down to the lake see if the catfish are jumpin set our bait  
And if we come up dry we'll just sleep in late  
At least we'll be outta here  
As long as we're outta here  
Baby lets get outta here  
Outta here  
  
Come on baby lets get outta here  
Cruise down A1A  
Go hang out in Key West for awhile
