Looking for a cure within the human race  
Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take  
Burning up the tents of the rank and file  
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile  
Crushing down, caving in our will to live  
Getting rid of man's mistakes  
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down  
How much more can we take  
Fight for freedom, fight authority  
Fight for anything, my country tis' of me  
Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me  
A last minute pardon, one final reprieve  
Resist the war machine, don't get in its path  
Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath  
Crushing down, caving in our will to live  
Getting rid of man's mistakes  
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down  
I don't know how much more I can take  
Fight!... It's my country
