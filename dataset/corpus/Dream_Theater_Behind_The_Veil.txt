What would possess you to justify  
Such dark and twisted ways?  
What kind of monster would come to feast  
When the devil shows his face?  
What does it take for life to change  
And a mind to lose control?  
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame  
After all the lies you told  
  
I am finding courage in my darkest hour  
I am bent, not broken  
Calling out  
  
Someone save me, look behind the veil  
Please don't walk away  
Someone save me, bring me home tonight  
I can't face another day  
  
Can you see the stranger  
Hiding in plain sight?  
Feeding on the chaos  
When the lightning strikes  
There's no redemption  
There's no being saved  
There's no salvation  
For a soul depraved  
  
You are finding promise in your finest hour  
You are bent, not broken  
Calling out
