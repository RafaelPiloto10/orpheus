Standing on your own two feet  
Inches away from infernal heat  
Sweating like a piece of meat  
The story yours, the plan complete  
Calling out to no one there  
The semblance of a holy prayer  
That turns about to curse and swear  
As you find that no one cares  
I got the ultra thrill  
You got the weaker will  
You say that no one's there  
I say, I've always cared  
I'm singing, your plight  
Grace dancing, all night  
  
Give a little dominance  
Take a little soul  
Try a new experience  
Doing what you're told  
Go get everything you need until you're dead and cold  
Give a little dominance  
Take a little soul  
  
Wishing never gets it done  
Give two minus one  
Take away, no there's none  
All this bullshit weighs a ton  
Field the question never why  
Because is why we live and die  
So while I'm here, going high  
Fuck the limit, fuck the sky  
I got the ultra thrill  
You got the weaker will  
You say that no one's there  
I say, I've always cared  
I'm singing, your plight  
Grave robbing, all night
