You know I'm just crazy about you baby,  
Wonder do you ever think of me.  
You know I'm crazy about you baby,  
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.  
  
Well I can't sleep at night  
I just catch naps through the day  
I can't hold on much longer  
Lord, living this a-way.  
  
You know I'm crazy about you baby,  
Wonder, do you ever think of me.  
You know I'm in love with you darling,  
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.  
  
Now ain't but the one thing baby,  
Really makes your daddy drink.  
You say that you don't love me,  
Lord and I begin to think.  
  
You know I'm crazy about you baby,  
Wonder, do you ever think of me.  
You know I'm just wild about you baby,  
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.
