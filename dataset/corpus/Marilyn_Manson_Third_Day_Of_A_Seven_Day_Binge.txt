We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips  
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips  
  
I can't decide if you're wearing me out or wearing me well  
I just still feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell  
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can always see your name and disintegrated from my lips  
  
I got bullets in the booth  
Rather be your victim, than be with you  
I got bullets in the booth  
Rather be your victim, than be with you  
  
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge  
I can already see your name disintegrated from my lips!  
Rather be your victim, than be with you!  
Rather be your victim, than be with you!
