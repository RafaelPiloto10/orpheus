This is hopeless  
Yes, it's so hopeless  
Cause you're not  
Coming back anymore  
  
Oh, I tried  
Yes, I tried to forget you  
I've tried running around  
But I find  
  
That it's hopeless  
Yes, it's hopeless  
I just can't get you  
Out of my mind  
  
I keep telling my heart  
That I'm lucky  
That I'm much better off  
All alone  
  
But it's hopeless  
It's just hopeless  
Cause my heart has  
A mind of it's own  
  
I walk away the nights  
Until the city lights  
Fade into another lonely day  
  
I still can't go to bed  
I walk some more instead  
But I just can't  
Walk those blues away  
  
I keep praying that you'll  
Change your mind, dear  
And I'll see your  
Sweet face at the door  
  
But it's hopeless  
Yes, it's so hopeless  
Cause you're not  
Coming back anymore  
  
Yes, it's so hopeless
