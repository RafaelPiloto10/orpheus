Luxury and heartache  
Oh yeah  
Oh luxury and heartache  
Oh yeah  
  
I won't be coming home tomorrow  
Nobody there to catch my tears  
I won't be leaving tears of sorrow anymore  
I played that game for so many years  
  
If I cry, will you catch my fall  
Do you want me to be the same  
If I cry, will you catch my fall  
Am I playing the loser's game?  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me little warning  
  
She will be there to give you children, yes she will  
She will be there to make you sing, sing, sing  
I won't be standing in the shadows anymore  
I learned to cover up my pain  
  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Do you want me to be the same  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Am I playing the loser's game?  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me little warning  
  
Gave me love  
You gave your love to me  
You gave me love  
But it's not enough for me  
  
Oh luxury  
But all you give me is pain  
Again and again  
Luxury is sweet and so cool  
  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Do you want me to be the same  
If I cry will you catch my fall  
Am I playing the loser's game?  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me little warning  
  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way to find that you were mourning  
From luxury to heartache  
Such a long way you gave me, gave me no warning
