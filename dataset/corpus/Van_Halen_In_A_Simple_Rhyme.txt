Well, back in the past when I was treated so coldly,  
My love life was a darn disgrace.  
Needed someone to love and hold me.  
That's one of the reasons that I was out of place.  
So this is love! Well, she finally kissed me.  
Had me all worked up inside.  
I was in love, but Cupid missed me.  
She up and left, and I almost died.  
But I was young and I was far from lonely.  
I been that way for a long, long year.  
Needed a girl to call my one and only.  
Is that you?  
You think you got the int'rest.  
C'mon and take the time.  
'Cause you know I want to be  
Yours in a simple rhyme.  
Well, ain't life grand when you finally hit it?  
I'm always a sucker for a real good time.  
Woke up in life to find I almost missed it.  
Ain't I glad that love is blind?  
But I was young and I was far too crazy.  
Been that way for a long, long time.  
Needed a girl, but I was just too lazy.  
Now that I've found you:  
You think you got the int'rest.  
C'mon and take the time.  
I'm gonna be  
Yours in a simple  
Rhyme,  
Rhyme.  
She made her mountains sing.  
Birds against an icy sky.  
And I heard bells ringin'  
I think I heard an angel sigh. And she said:  
There'll be times,  
There will be times  
You're gonna hear the angels singin'  
"Ah.  
Ah.  
Ah."  
You think you got the int'rest.  
C'mon and take the time.  
I'm gonna be  
Yours in a simple  
Rhyme,  
Rhyme,  
Rhyme.
