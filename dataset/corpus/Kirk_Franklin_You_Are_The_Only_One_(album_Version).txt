You are the only one who makes me feel this way  
You turn my nights to day  
Lord I just came to say  
I tell you that  
You are the only one who came and took me in  
You've been that kind of friend  
You're the only one  
You're the one  
(Say now, Say now)

Praise God  
If you feel him in your hands  
Praise God  
Cause he's coming back again  
Praise God  
If you feel him in your hands  
Praise God  
Lift your hands  
If you love Jesus  
Lift up your hands  
If you really love Jesus  
Your the one who makes me feel brand new  
No other friend can give me joy so true  
In my darkest hour I can call on you  
You are the one

If you could lift your hands up high 1 times  
If you know the Devil's a liar 2 times  
If you know Jesus is Messiah 3 times
