Now if you feel that you can't go on  
Because all your hope is gone  
And your life is filled with confusion  
And happiness is just an illusion  
And your world around is tumblin' down  
Darling, reach out  
Reach out, for me.  
  
I'll be there to love and confort you...(tell me baby)  
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through  
  
Now when you're lost and about to give up  
'cause your best just ain't good enough  
And you feel the world has grown cold  
And you're driftin' on your own  
When you need a hand to hold  
Darling, reach out  
Reach out, for me.  
  
I'll be there to love and confort you  
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through  
  
I'll be there to love and confort you  
I'll be there to with the love I'll see you through  
  
I can tell you the way I hang your head  
Now with out of love , now you're afraid  
And through your tears you look around  
But there's no peace of mind to be found  
  
I know what you're thinking  
Witout love, now you're alone  
Baby, reach out  
Reach out for me  
  
I'll be there to love and confort you  
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through  
  
I'll be there to love and confort you  
Tell me baby  
I'll be there to always see you through  
I'll be there  
  
I'll be there to love and confort you  
I'll be there with the love I'll see you through.
