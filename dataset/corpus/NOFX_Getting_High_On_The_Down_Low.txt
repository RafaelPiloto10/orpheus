I'm on the wagon now but she doesn't know  
I'm getting high on the down low  
Cause when I got the music I got no place to go  
Unless I got a bottle in me  
  
I'm in the Cadillac, they're starting to stare  
Who's the guy with the blood in his hair  
The last thing I remember I was going somewhere  
And then the stop sign got in the way  
  
I'm laying low in a hospital bed  
I gotta a dent and a crack in the head  
That's okay cause I got no idea what I just said  
Gotta love the hospital meds  
  
I'm getting high on the D.L.
