Now I've been happy lately  
Thinking about the good things to come  
And I believe it could be  
Something good has begun  
I've been smiling lately  
Dreaming about the world as one  
And I believe it could be  
Something good's bound to come  
  
For out on the edge of darkness  
There runs the peace train  
Peace train take this country  
Come take me home again  
  
Peace train sounding louder  
Ride on the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
Come on the peace train  
Peace train's a holy roller  
Everyone jump upon the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
This is the peace train  
  
Get your bags together  
Come bring your good friends too  
Because it's getting nearer  
Soon it will be with you  
Come and join the living  
It's not so far from you  
And it's getting nearer  
Soon it will all be true  
  
Peace train sounding louder  
Ride on the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
Come on the peace train  
  
I've been crying lately  
Thinking about the world as it is  
Why must we go on hating?  
Why can't we live in bliss?  
  
For out on the edge of darkness  
There rides the peace train  
Peace train take this country  
Come take me home again  
  
Peace train sounding louder  
Ride on the peace train  
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah  
Come on the peace train  
  
Come on, come on, come on the peace train
