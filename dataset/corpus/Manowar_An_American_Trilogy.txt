Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton  
  
Old times there are not forgotten  
  
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland  
  
  
(background singers)  
  
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away  
  
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie  
  
  
For in Dixieland, I was born  
  
Early Lord one frosty morning  
  
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland  
  
  
Glory, glory hallelujah  
  
Glory, glory hallelujah  
  
Glory, glory hallelujah  
  
His truth is marching on  
  
  
So hush little baby  
  
Don't you cry  
  
You know your daddy's bound to die  
  
But all my trials Lord, will soon be over  
  
  
Glory, glory, hallelujah  
  
His truth is marching on  
  
His truth is marching on
