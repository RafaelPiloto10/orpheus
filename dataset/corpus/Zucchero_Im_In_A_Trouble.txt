I've got something to tell you  
About my heart,  
That you hold  
If you're down well there's someone there  
Don't you know  
  
Well you know there's a place  
Way down deep  
Where I hide  
I'm in trouble  
  
It's a garden I keep  
You don't know  
You can't find  
I'm in trouble  
  
I hold you close  
You turn away  
  
You know what I want to say  
  
After this love  
After the rain  
After our river's run  
  
You'll fill my eyes  
With silver rays  
And with a golden sun  
  
I'm still here  
Unafraid  
If you don't come  
Oh, I'm in trouble.  
  
What do you think about me?  
What do you think about me?  
  
Well you know part of me is  
Deep in you  
You don't want  
All my trouble  
  
Won't walk out  
I want to stay  
  
I'd light up your heart  
If I found the way  
  
After this love  
After the rain  
After our river's meet  
  
You'll fill my eyes  
With silver curves  
And golden memories  
  
I'm still here  
Unafraid  
Won't you please come  
  
After this love  
After this crying  
After the stars all fall  
  
You'll fill my eyes  
With tears of joy  
We'll laugh about it all  
  
I'm still here  
Unafraid  
If you don't come  
  
Oh no no, I'm in trouble
