[Puffy background]  
What about ten years from now?  
  
[Biggie]  
Ten years from now, where do I want to be? I want to be...just livin' man,
just  
Living comfortably with my niggas man, in a pool and shit, smoking plenty indo  
You know I'm saying? I got my wife, just lounging with my wife you know I'm  
Saying?  
With my daughter, her daughter, you know just laid back, just chillin,  
You know I'm saying? Living all my niggas is living where I think I be? Ten  
Years  
I don't think I will see it for real dogg for real man, that shit ain't  
Promised man  
I don't think my luck is that good, I hope it is but if it ain't, so be it,
I'm  
Ready

The weaker the strong,  
You got it going on,  
Your dead wrong....
