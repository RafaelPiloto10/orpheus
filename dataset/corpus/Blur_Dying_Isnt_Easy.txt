This isn't the first time  
I've left it too late  
To get on top  
I made that mistake  
To be with someone  
Never find what you need  
We don't bail out  
And I can't sleep.  
  
You left me  
Just when I needed you  
You set me back  
Just when I thought I got back  
(Whistle, Do do do's, La la la's)  
Just when I thought I got back.  
  
This is the last time  
I make this mistake  
Can't see the stars  
Yeah it's too late  
To be with someone  
Never find what you need  
We don't bail out  
Yeah I can't sleep
