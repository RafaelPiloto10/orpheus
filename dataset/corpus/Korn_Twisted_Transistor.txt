Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister  
Listening to your twisted transistor  
Hold it between your legs  
Turn it up, turn it up  
The wind is coming through  
Can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
A lonely life where no one understands you  
But don't give up because the music do  
Music do!  
Music do!  
Music do!  
Music do!  
Music do!  
Music do!  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor  
  
Hey you, hey you, finally you get it  
The world it can eat you if you let it  
And as your tears fall on  
Your dress, your dress  
But when she's coming through  
You're in a mess  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor  
Music do!  
Music do!  
Music do!  
Music do!  
  
Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit  
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt!  
Says who? Says who?  
Anesthetize this bitch  
Anesthetize this bitch, I'm not the time!  
Just let me be  
Between you and them things!  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor
