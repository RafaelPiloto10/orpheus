[KING]  
  
A woman is a female who is human,  
Designed for pleasing man, the human male.  
A human male is pleased by many women,  
And all the rest you hear is fairy tale.  
  
[ANNA]  
  
Then tell me how this fairy tale bagan, sir.  
You cannot call it just a poet's trick  
Explain to me why many men are faithful  
And true to one wife only.  
  
[KING]  
  
[Spoken] They are sick!  
[Singing] A girl must be like a blossom  
With honey for just one man.  
A man must be like honey bee  
And gather all he can.  
To fly from blossom to blossom  
A honey bee must be free,  
But blossom must not ever fly  
From bee to bee to bee.
