You're holy, You're righteous  
Great in majesty  
Angels bow down giving glory  
To the King of kings  
And we sing blessing and honor  
And we sing holy is the Lord almighty  
  
Chorus:  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Majesty and power  
To the name above all names  
Glory to the King  
We will sing forever  
  
Holy is the Lord  
  
All glory, all honor, all power to You God forever  
All glory, all honor, all power to You God forever  
All glory, all honor, all power to You God forever  
All glory, all honor, all power to You God forever  
And we sing blessing and honor  
And we sing holy is the Lord almighty
