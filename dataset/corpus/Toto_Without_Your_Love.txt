It's late at night, nothin's feelin' right  
Since you've gone away  
I think I know why you left this time,  
But it's still hard to say  
I nearly lost it, when he came around you  
Now I'm holdin' it all inside and it's killin' me  
  
We used to meet at an old cafe in Chi-Town  
At first you could hear the wind stop,  
Then my heart would pound  
I remember everything you used to do, girl  
Now I'm learning something that you already knew  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not the same without your love  
Every night and every day, girl  
It's not the same without your love  
You don't have to be afraid  
It's not the same without your love  
Every night and every day, girl  
It's not the same without your love  
  
I see you through the door, with your motor runnin'  
I can still hear the sound  
I knew then, when you asked him in, you let your guard down  
You're talking soft, don't tell me,  
I know you're sincere  
I just called to tell you I'm the only one here  
  
[Chorus]
