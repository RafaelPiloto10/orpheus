You're like a child within  
The one who just won't give in  
Oh how you love to play  
I wanna understand  
I wanna do all I can  
I wanna make you stay  
  
Where will I find you  
Next time I lose you  
I'm just a fool for your touch  
  
Cross my heart  
I wanna love you  
How can I love you  
If you keep running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
  
Your kisses are bittersweet  
Alibis incomplete  
I know what you didn't say  
Now haven't you had your fun  
Is anything left undone  
Why can't we meet half way  
  
When will you find out  
Now that the truth's out  
This is more than a careless romance  
  
Cross my heart  
I wanna love you  
How can I love  
If you keep running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
  
True love is never quite enough  
It's so unsure  
Is it what you're dreaming of  
Darling, it's time you let me in  
Maybe tonight  
We can start again  
  
Cross my heart  
I wanna love you  
How can I love you  
If you keep running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away  
Cross my heart  
It's getting stronger  
I can't wait much longer  
You gotta stop running away
