There's a new day on the horizon  
There's a rising in the air  
Somewhere somebody's tryin' to tell me they care  
So I'm a lift my head to a new day  
Plant my feet on the ground  
Look at life in a new way and what's goin' down  
'Cause today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Try and change my ways, forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, what they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And slow my roll  
Mixin' loneliness and whiskey  
Heartache and cocaine  
Livin' life like a gypsy, lost and ashamed  
So I'm a look to the Lord as my witness  
Rest my hat on a shelf  
Trade these boots for forgiveness and find myself  
'Cause today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Try to change my ways forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, 'cause they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And I can't believe sixteen has long since past  
'Cause I'm tired of runnin', and never looking back  
And I won't survive if I live this life this fast, no, no  
And today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Change my ways, forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, what they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And slow my roll  
Slow my roll, slow my roll
