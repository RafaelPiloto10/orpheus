Why did you have to die  
When I was only at the age of five  
So suddenly you were gone  
And I was left with answers hard to find  
Now I think of you 'cause I'm  
In hunger for your warmth  
That no one can replace  
And I know that where I go  
You're always by my side  
I just want to let you know oh... Oh...  
  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
For you  
  
Your spirit never died  
And all your words I treasure in my heart  
You left me with a smile  
But my cheeks aren't always dry from  
All the tears  
So I think of you 'cause I'm  
In hunger for your warmth  
That no one can replace  
And I know that where I go  
You're always by my side  
I just want to let you know oh... Oh...  
  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
Mama, oh I miss you sometimes  
Mama, can you hear me when I cry  
For you
