The opening of a new book  
A singular wave crashing  
The opening of a new book  
Sat on your chuff knowing nothing  
The opening of a new book  
A ticket on a train from nowhere to somewhere  
The opening of a new book  
Are you Elephant Man or George Michael?  
The opening of a new book  
A sip, a swig, a gulp, a mouthful, a session, a bender, a life  
The opening of a new book  
Does this personality have any brakes?  
The opening of a new book  
Does anyone know who oils the brakes?  
Are you supposed to oil them yourself?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Are you cancelled? Are you taken?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Can anyone repair me?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Are you cancelled? Are you taken in?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Can anyone repair me?
