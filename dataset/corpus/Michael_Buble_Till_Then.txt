Till then, my darling please wait for me  
Till then, no matter when it will be  
One day I know I'll be back again  
Please wait till then  
  
Our dreams will live though we are apart  
Our love -- I know we'll keep in our heart  
Till then, when all the world will be free  
Please wait for me  
  
Although there are oceans we must cross  
And mountains that we must climb  
I know every gain must have a loss  
So pray that our loss is nothing but time  
  
Till then, let's dream of what there will be  
Till then, we'll call on each memory  
Till then, when I will hold you again  
Please wait till then
