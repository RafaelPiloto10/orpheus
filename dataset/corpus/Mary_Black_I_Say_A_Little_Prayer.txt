The moment I wake up, before I put on my make up  
I say a little prayer for you  
While combing my hair now  
And wonderin' what dress to wear now  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever, forever you'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you forever and ever  
We never will part and I will love you  
Together, together that's how it must be  
To live without you could only mean heartbreak for me  
  
I run for the bus dear, while riding I think of us, dear  
And say a little prayer for you  
At work I just take time, and all through my coffee break time  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Darlin' believe me, for me there is no one but you  
Say you love me too  
'cause I'm in love with you  
Answer my prayer now  
Say you love me too  
Just answer my prayer now  
Say you love me too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The moment I wake up, before I put on my make up  
Answer my prayer now  
Say you love me too  
Just answer my prayer now  
Say you love me too
