From a battle I've come  
To a battle I ride  
Blazing up to the sky  
Chains of fate  
Hold a firey stride  
I'll see you again when I die  
  
High and mighty alone we are kings  
Whirlwinds of fire we ride  
Providence brought us the crown and the ring  
Covered with blood and our pride  
  
Heroes await me  
My enemies ride fast  
Knowing not this ride's their last  
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale  
Bow string and steel will prevail  
  
High and mighty alone we are kings  
Whirlwinds of fire we ride  
Providence brought us the crown and the ring  
Covered with blood and our pride  
  
Odin I await thee  
Your true son am I  
I hail you now as I die  
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel  
Ours is the kingdom of steel  
  
High and mighty alone we are kings  
Whirlwinds of fire we ride  
Providence brought us the crown and the ring  
Covered with blood and our pride
