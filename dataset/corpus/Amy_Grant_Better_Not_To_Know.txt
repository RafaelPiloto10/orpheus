We sowed our seeds  
Watered with tears  
Waiting for signs of growth  
Took months of days  
And then took years.  
  
We took our steps  
We took our falls  
Somewhere along the way  
We just got lost  
And we lost it all.  
  
But nothing ventured, nothing gained  
The risk of living is the pain  
And what will be will be anyway  
  
Oh, it's better not to know  
The way it's gonna go  
What will die and what will grow.  
Goodbye more than hello  
It's better not to know  
  
Those tiny stems became these trees  
With dirt and storm  
And sun and air to breathe  
Like you and me.  
  
And some fell down  
And some grew tall  
And those surviving twenty winter thaws  
Have the sweetest fruit of all.  
  
But innocence and planting day  
Are both long gone  
So much has changed  
And if we had to do it all again  
  
Oh, it's better not to know  
The way it's gonna go  
What will die and what will grow.  
Oh, nothing stays the same  
Life flickers like a flame,  
As the seasons come and go  
Goodbye more than hello  
It's better not to know  
  
Is it better, better not to know?  
Is it better, (is it better), is it better?  
  
We sowed our seeds  
Watered with tears  
  
Oh, it's better not to know  
The way it's gonna go  
What will die and what will grow.  
Oh, nothing stays the same  
Life flickers like a flame,  
As the seasons come and go  
Goodbye more than hello  
What comes of what we sow  
It's better not to know  
It's better not to know  
  
We sowed our seeds  
Watered with tears
