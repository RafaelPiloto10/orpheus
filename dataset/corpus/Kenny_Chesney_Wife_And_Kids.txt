Everybody thinks I've got it all  
Nobody really does, do they?  
I've got more than I desire, more than I ever dreamed but  
There's always a price you pay  
It's been an amazing road  
I've been blessed I know  
At the end of the day, I go home alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
I still hope some day I'll have a wife and kids  
Smiling faces running to the door when I walk in  
Saying daddy's home, you were gone too long  
What'd ya bring me, swing me, let me show you what I did  
I still dream about that look on a woman's face  
That says I love you through the good, the bad, the sunshine or the rain  
Sometimes I wish, I had someone to share my life with  
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids  
Maybe someday  
  
Maybe I could have a son  
Play football in the back yard  
Or take my daughter fishing  
And when she turned fifteen  
Teach her how to drive a car  
When I grow old and they've all left home  
I wanna lay beside my wife  
Talk about the old times, remember all the good times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I wish, I had someone to share my life with  
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids  
Someday  
  
I'll have a wife and kids  
Maybe someday
