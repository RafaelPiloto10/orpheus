American woman, stay away from me  
American woman, mama let me be  
Don't come hanging around my door  
I don't want to see your face no more  
  
I got more important things to do  
Than spend my time growin' old with you  
Now woman, stay away  
American woman, listen what I say  
  
American woman, get away from me  
American woman, mama let me be  
Don't come knocking around my door  
I don't want to see your shadow no more  
  
Colored lights can hypnotize  
Sparkle someone else's eyes  
Now woman, get away  
American woman, listen what I say  
  
American woman, I said get way  
American woman, listen what I say  
Don't come hanging around my door  
Don't want to see your face no more  
  
I don't need your war machines  
I don't need your ghetto scenes  
Colored lights can hypnotize  
Sparkle someone else's eyes  
  
Now woman, get away  
American woman, listen what I say  
American woman, stay away from me  
American woman, mama let me be  
  
I gotta go  
I gotta getta away  
Think I gotta go  
I want to fly away  
  
I'm gonna leave you woman  
I'm gonna leave you woman  
I'm gonna leave you woman  
I'm gonna leave you woman  
  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
American woman  
You're no good for me  
  
I'm no good for you  
Looking at you right in the eye  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna leave you woman  
  
You know I gotta go  
I'm gonna leave you woman  
I gotta go  
I gotta go  
  
I gotta go  
American woman  
Yeah
