I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that I'd ever
lose  
Your love dear why'd you do me this way  
I never felt more like crying all night cause everything's wrong and nothing
ain't right  
Without you you got me singing the blues  
  
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine  
There's nothing left for me to do but cry over you  
I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldn't stay  
Without you you got me singing the blues  
  
I never felt more like singing the blues...
