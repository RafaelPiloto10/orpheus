(Usher Usher Usher)  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers  
  
I can't, get to work on time,  
Can't believe the words to her I just said  
But who the hell argue 'n fight like dogs at 6 in the morning? (in the
mornin')  
I know its gonna' be some more shh tonight mm ooh  
Our pastor's callin', tellin' me I done went too far in  
I'm seen around town and my friends can't recognize me,  
'Cause I took a chance on love (love), it's like (like), I'm dyin' (ooh dyin')  
  
[Chorus]  
For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world  
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl  
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama  
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be.  
  
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers  
I done took all I can take but you leave me no options girl  
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to  
As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say  
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers  
I done took all I can take but you leave me no options girl  
  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers  
  
I'm losin' my mind, cant figure out who's wrong or right  
I know it's you I love,  
But then I also know it's you I don't like  
You claim you hate who I was,  
But that's the reason you here now  
You think I don't know what's up,  
But sweetheart that's what ruined us  
I ain't afraid to say I got needs  
But the only time you here for me  
Is when the bottles poppin' and everything is sweet  
But I, I'm tired of sleeping in the other room spending them long nights  
Trying to figure out what in the hell in my heart I ain't do right.  
(Ooh for you)  
  
For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world  
(back against the world)  
'Cause you were my girl, girl (girl), girl,  
I done damn near lost my mama (mama),  
I done been through so much drama(drama)  
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be.  
(never thought I would be)  
  
I'm ready to sign them papers (papers),  
Papers (pa'), papers (pa' ooh oh oh oh)  
(I done took) all I can take but you leave me no options girl  
I can't deny how much I love you (know that I love you),  
I done gave up everything I had to (anything I had to)  
As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say (I'm afraid I gotta say)  
I'm ready to sign them papers(papers),  
Papers(paii), papers(girl I took all I could take)  
(I done took) all I can take but you leave me no options girl  
  
Oh oh! Ooh! Ooh yea! Papers  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers  
  
Ready ready ready ready  
All my fellas up in here, if you had enough and you're ready to sign say  
Ready ready ready ready (I'm ready, yes I am)  
All my ladies if you sick and tired, and you're, ready to sign, say  
Ready ready ready ready (ooh)  
I can't keep livin' this life, I'm finna' leave it for the last time I'm  
Ready ready ready ready  
  
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama  
I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be.  
  
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers  
I done took all I can take but you leave me no options girl  
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to  
As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say  
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers  
I done took all I can take but you leave me no options girl
