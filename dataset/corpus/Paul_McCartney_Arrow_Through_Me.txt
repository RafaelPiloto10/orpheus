Ooh, baby,  
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me,  
If you'd had taken an arrow and runned right through me.  
Uh, uh, uh, uh.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
A bird in the hand is worth two flying,  
But when it came to love I knew you'd be lying.  
  
It could have been a finer fling,  
Would have been a major attraction.  
With no other thing  
Offering a note of distraction.  
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
You wouldn't have found a more down hero,  
If you'd had started at nothing and counted to zero.  
  
Oo-oo-oo.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me,  
If you'd had taken an arrow and runned right through me.  
  
It could have been a finer fling,  
Flying in a righter direction.  
With no other thing  
Featuring but love and affection.  
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
You wouldn't have found a more down hero,  
If you'd had started at nothing and counted to zero.  
  
Ah... Ooh...
