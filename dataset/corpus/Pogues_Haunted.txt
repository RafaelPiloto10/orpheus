Do you remember that sunny day?  
Somewhere in London  
In the middle of nowhere  
Didn't have nothing to do that day  
Didn't wanna do nothing anyway  
  
You got a way of walking  
You got a way of talking  
And there's something about you  
And now I know I never ever  
Want to be without you  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
I want to be haunted by the ghost  
Of your precious love  
Of your precious love  
  
The first time I saw you,  
Standing in the street  
You were so cool,  
You could have put out Vietnam  
My girlfriends ask me, "What's he like?"  
I say, "He's kind of shy,  
But that's the kind of girl I am,  
He's my kind of guy"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll build my world around you  
I'll bless the day that I found you  
I'll stand beside you, I'll never leave  
Or tell you all those lies  
That you'd never believe
