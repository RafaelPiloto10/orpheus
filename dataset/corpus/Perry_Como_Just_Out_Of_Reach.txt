Love that runs away from me,  
Dreams that just won't let me be,  
Blues that keep on botherin' me,  
Chains that just won't set me free!  
  
Too far away from you  
And all your charms,  
Just out of reach  
Of my two empty arms!  
  
Each night in dreams I see your face,  
Memories time can not erase,  
And I awake an' find you gone,  
I'm so blue and all alone!  
  
So far away from lips  
So sweet an' warm,  
Just out of reach  
Of my two empty arms!  
  
That lonesome feelin' all the time,  
Knowin' you cannot be mine,  
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep,  
Vows that we could never keep!  
  
Too far away from lips  
So sweet an' warm,  
Just out of reach  
Of my two empty arms!
