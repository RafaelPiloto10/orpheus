The throwing of your mental clothes wasn't ever your intention  
The malady within your heart has no cure and prevention  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
I wish that I could offer you a chance to change direction  
But you know that pathways must be followed to near destruction  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
There are those who will patronise and compromise your position  
They can't feel the forceful hand of  
Predetermined destination  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
I can feel the forceful hand  
And it won't let me change direction no  
And there's this hunger inside of me  
And it won't and it won't no it won't stop it's aching  
And I can feel it inside of my head the forceful hand  
And it won't let me change direction  
And there's this hunger and it won't let me  
And it won't let me stop and it won't let me stop this aching no
