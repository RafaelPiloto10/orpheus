Why don't you stop  
And look me over?  
Am I the same girl  
You used to know?  
Why don't you stop  
And think it over?  
Am I the same girl  
Whom you hurt so?  
  
I'm the one you want  
And I'm the one you need  
I'm the one you love  
The one you used to meet  
Around the corner everyday  
We would meet and slip away  
But we were much too young  
To love each other this way  
  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
  
Why don't you stop  
And look me over?  
Am I the same girl  
You used to know?  
Why don't you stop  
And think it over?  
Am I the same girl  
Whom you hurt so?  
  
I'm the one you hurt  
And I'm the one you need  
I'm the one who cried  
The one you used to need  
But you are pretending you don't care  
But the fire, ahh, is still there  
But we are no longer too young  
To love each other this way  
  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
Am I the same girl?  
Yes I am, yes I am  
Oh, yes I am  
  
Am I the same girl?  
(Yes I am, yes I am)  
Am I the same girl?, yeah  
(Yes I am, yes I am)  
Oh, yes I am  
Am I the same girl?  
(Yes I am, yes I am)  
Oh, baby, yes I am
