I can't begin to tell you  
How much you mean to me.  
My world would end if ever we were through.  
I can't begin to tell you  
  
How happy I would be  
If I could speak my mind like others do.  
I make such pretty speeches  
Whenever we're apart,  
  
But when your near  
The words I choose  
Refuse to leave my heart.  
So take the sweetest phrases  
  
The world has ever known  
And make believe  
I've said them all to you.
