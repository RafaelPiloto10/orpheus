The sun comes up and brings the dawn to a new day  
The kids run out to play the games like kids all play  
To a child the world is milk and honey  
A dime is a lot of candy money  
Oh, ain't it funny, now, ain't it funny?  
Running barefoot through the fields in the rain  
Chasin' pretty butterflies in the lane  
The world's a mess and they wonder why  
Oh, what a pretty blue, blue sky  
Gee, ain't it funny, now, ain't it funny?  
The kids all say grown ups are strange and aren't they?  
They teach their kids not to do as I do but as I say  
They cry for peace and then make war  
And wonder what they're fighting for  
Oh, ain't it funny, now, ain't it funny?  
Oh, gee ain't it funny, now, ain't it funny?
