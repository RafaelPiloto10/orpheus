The simple minded  
And the ill informed  
Can be easily led astray  
And those that cannot connect the dots  
Hey look the other way  
People believe what they want to believe  
When it makes no sense at all  
And I wish you all along the sideline  
The strength to  
  
Walk tall  
Yeah walk on  
Through this world  
Walk tall  
  
Somewhere out in the distance  
Is the death of you and me  
Even though we don't think of it much  
It's still out there for us to see  
If you treat life like a bar room fight  
You'll die stinking of gin  
No drunkards are allowed in heaven  
No sinners will get in  
  
Walk tall  
Yeah, walk on  
Walk tall  
Through this world  
Walk tall  
  
So be careful in what you believe in  
There's plenty to get you confused  
And in this land called paradise  
You must walk in many men's shoes  
Bigotry and hatred are enemies to us all  
Grace, mercy and forgiveness  
Will help a man walk tall  
  
So walk tall  
Yeah, walk on  
Walk tall  
Through this world  
Through this world  
  
Yeah, walk tall  
Then walk on  
Walk tall  
Then walk on  
Through this world  
Through this world  
Through this world  
Through this world  
  
Walk tall  
Walk tall  
Then walk on  
Walk tall
