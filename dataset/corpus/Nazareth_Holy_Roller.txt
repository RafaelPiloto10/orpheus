Holy roller, lookin' down  
Where you think you know  
All the answers  
Arrogance and pride....are sin  
Better look to your, own chances  
  
[Chorus]  
Holy roller can you save your own soul  
Can you save your own soul  
Holy roller  
  
Standin', up for jesus  
That's your thing  
But you're standin' on peoples hearts  
Charity is a virtue  
To be praised  
Better get back on...Jesus' track  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy roller, practice what you preach  
Heaven, it's still within your reach  
  
Holy roller, don't you judge  
What you think is goin' wrong  
  
[Chorus: x2]
