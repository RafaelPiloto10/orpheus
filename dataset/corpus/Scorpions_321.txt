Time is a wicked master  
Put your life into its hand  
Close your eyes and it will crush you  
Rage only spins you faster  
It's a curse born unto man  
Turns your dreams into disaster  
  
Save me  
Cause the world's gonna stop  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Come on and wake me  
The final curtain will drop  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Tonight  
  
Lies it's the truth I'm after  
Let me find it in your eyes  
Quick before the moment dies  
Cries in a sea of laughter  
Weepin' gently in my soul  
Love's the only thing that matters  
  
Save me  
Cause the world's gonna stop  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Come on and wake me  
The final curtain will drop  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Tonight  
  
321  
Come on and save me  
Cause the world's gonna stop  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Come on and wake me  
The final curtain will drop  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Come on and shake me  
Cause we're in for a shock  
Baby 321  
We're fallin' down from the top  
Come on and take me  
We're goin straight to the top  
Baby 321  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Are you ready to rock  
Tonight
