Flashin' lots of cash and spendin' lots-o-loot  
He's sitting at the bar - then he's sittin' at the booth  
Across the dance floor he does scoot  
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
  
The caboose that could he goes toot toot  
Been known to gag and sometimes puke  
A very good friend of granny goose  
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
  
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
He's half man and half cartoon  
But good buddy don't be confused  
He's full blooded looney tune  
  
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
Face to face with the man in the moon  
His family doctor is doctor seuss  
If you catch him in your soup please don't shoot  
  
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
He was new in town  
A free wheelin' clown  
  
A funny young duke  
Hangin' under the roof  
Of a place in time  
United sound  
  
He'll play a little guitar sing a few blues  
He's the kind-a-guy that you can't refuse  
Despite the fact that he's no brute  
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
  
Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move  
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots  
Coming soon to a theater near you  
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
