When I was a little boy  
Daddy used to say to me son  
We got a lotta land  
And a lotta hard work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your pappy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well, I reached twenty one  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
Left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said hold up the bank boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way you'll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well, it's four in the morning  
And the warden is calling my name  
He said he's teaching me a lesson now  
He's making me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch boy, fill it up  
I'm wantin' you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands  
Get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey David gotta get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big big man  
You better remember what old whispering bill told you in this song  
Get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you wanna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
I gotta little dirt on my hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands
