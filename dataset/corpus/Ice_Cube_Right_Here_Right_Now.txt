This right here is payback  
From way back  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
  
Recognize a real don when you see one  
And don't try to be one, you fuckin' peon  
I been like Deon for eons  
You ain't nothing but a biatch  
  
Messed around and let me read up  
I come back through and tear the street up  
Ice cube, nigga, you better D up  
And when I come by, bitch, you better be up  
  
Ass up, face in the pillow  
I don't give a fizzle  
Got to do my bizzle  
The only nizzle that'll never ever fizzle  
Original, you niggas know  
  
[Chorus]  
(Right here, right now)  
You gotta get 'em up  
Who wants some?  
You better get 'em up  
Come get some  
Come get some  
Come get some  
You gotta get 'em up  
Who wants some?  
You better get 'em up  
  
Got to get with ya  
Hit you wit' these things that I'm holding  
Who wanna squab with the frozen?  
Now, who wanna battle with the chosen?  
You nigga's lotion  
I'm no emotion  
I'm shrapnel from the explosion  
Hit you in the face while you posing  
  
High as Jimmy Hendricks  
I lined up ten dicks and took out appendix  
So go get forensics  
Let 'em know I'm Geronimo  
Till it's my time to go  
You better find your ho  
Get your babies and your mama  
And move to Guantanamo  
Doubt my skills  
I'm payin' my bills  
I'm up in the hills  
You niggas are kills  
Even though I'm on a fucked up label  
You bitches know what I can bring to the table  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This right here - it's payback  
From way back  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
I don't play that  
  
I like bitches like you  
5'2", wearing light blue  
The freak get high too  
With a fly dude  
Not a Erika Badu  
That's looking for an "I do"  
Now, what can I buy you  
Just to try you?  
Need another bitch to lie to  
Need another bitch in my coupe  
Oh, please can I trouble you  
For a double scoop  
  
A nigga need some T and A  
Now you can get dick, but you can't get no DNA  
I heard you was a big freak  
(Can I hang?)  
Bitch, look down - I got some big feet  
I like Mike and Ike's  
I like watchin' dikes  
I like goin' to fights  
I like earnin' my stripes  
In the book of life  
There's only two women  
Big ol' good ones  
And good ol' big ones  
  
[Chorus]
