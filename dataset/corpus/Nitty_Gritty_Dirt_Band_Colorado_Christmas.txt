Looking out the window of this hollywood hotel,  
You'd never know that it was christmas eve.  
The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,  
And the temperature is 84 degrees.  
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below  
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene  
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,  
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.  
  
But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air  
From telluride to boulder down below  
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere  
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow  
  
I remember christmases when I was just a boy  
In the morning I would run to see the tree.  
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy  
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.  
Now the sun is setting in the california sky  
And I can't find the spirit anywhere  
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye  
I'm going back home toook for christmas there  
  
But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air  
From telluride to boulder down below  
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere  
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow
