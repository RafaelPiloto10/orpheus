I love the East. I love the West.  
North and South, their both the best.  
But I only want go there as a guest,  
'Cause I love being here with you.  
  
I love the sea. I love the shore.  
I love the rocks, and what is more,  
You and they never be a bore,  
'Cause I love being here with you.  
  
Singing in the shower,  
Laughing by the hour.  
Life is such a breezy game.  
I love all kinds of weather  
As log as we're together.  
Oh, I love to hear you say my name.  
  
I love good wine, fine cuisine,  
Candle light. I love the scene.  
'Cause, baby, if you know just what I mean,  
I love being here with you.  
  
I like a Dance by Fred Astaire,  
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair.  
But I think to tell you's only fair,  
That I love being here with you.  
  
And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day,  
His utter charm takes me away.  
But don't get me wrong, how do you say,  
I love being here with you.  
  
Basie's band a-swingin',  
I like Ella's singing.  
'Cause there's something else, you know,  
They know how to say it,  
They know how to play it,  
They wind it up and let it go.  
  
I love the thrill of New York shows.  
I'd love to kiss Durante's nose.  
But I'll like to say before I close,  
I love being here with you!
