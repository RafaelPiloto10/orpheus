Well, I stand up next to a mountain  
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand  
Well, I stand up next to a mountain  
Chop it down with the edge of my hand  
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island  
Might even raise just a little sand  
Cause I'm a voodoo child  
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child  
  
I didn't mean to take you up all your sweet time  
I'll give it right back to you one of these days  
I said, I didn't mean to take you up all your sweet time  
I'll give it right back to you one of these days  
And if I don't meet you no more in this world  
Then I'll, I'll meet you in the next one  
And don't be late, don't be late  
Cause I'm a voodoo child  
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child  
I'm a voodoo child
