I hate to see de ev'nin' sun go down,  
Hate to see de ev'nin' sun go down  
Cause ma baby, he done lef' this town.  
Feelin' tomorrow lak ah feel today,  
Feel tomorrow lak ah feel today,  
I'll pack my trunk, make ma git away.  
  
Saint Louis woman wid her diamon' rings  
Pulls dat man 'roun' by her apron strings.  
'Twant for powder an' for store-bought hair,  
De man ah love would not gone nowhere, nowhere.  
Got de Saint Louis Blues jes as blue as ah can be.  
Dat man got a heart lak a rock cast in the sea.  
  
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. Doggone it!  
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie,  
Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye.  
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die.  
  
Been to de gypsy to get ma fortune tole,  
To de gypsy, done got ma fortune tole,  
Cause I'm most wile 'bout ma Jelly Roll.  
Gypsy done tole me,
