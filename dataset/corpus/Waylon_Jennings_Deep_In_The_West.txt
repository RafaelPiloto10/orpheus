Deep in the west where the tall mountains grow I've gone home  
Where the heavens above turn red from the fire down below  
Are you listening to me when I'm talking to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
Divided we're through  
  
Silver friend at night yellow friend you come with the dawn  
Back in my heart I've been drying my eyes see me run  
So you hang on to me and I'll hang on to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
Divided we're through  
  
Refusing to talk I suppose that it's all for love's sake  
And learning to give that's important before you can take from me  
Are you listening to me when I'm talking to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
  
So you hang on to me and I'll hang on to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
Divided we're through
