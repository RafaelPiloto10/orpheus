Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand  
And the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."  
And the walls collide, Mona cries,  
And the rain man leaves in the wolf man's disguise.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit  
Says to the masked man, "ain't you cute!"  
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf  
And he says, "you ain't so bad yourself."  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, jumpin' Judy can't go no higher.  
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire.  
Rasputin he's so dignified,  
He touched the back of her head an' he died.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,  
Stretchin' out upon the grass.  
She gets all messed up and she faints  
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.
