I have been given  
One moment from heaven  
As I am walking  
Surrounded by night,  
Stars high above me  
Make a wish under moonlight.  
  
On my way home  
I remember  
Only good days.  
On my way home  
I remember all the best days.  
I'm on my way home  
I can remember  
Every new day.  
  
I move in silence  
With each step taken,  
Snow falling round me  
Like angels in flight,  
Far in the distance  
Is my wish under moonlight  
  
On my way home  
I remember  
Only good days.  
On my way home  
I remember all the best days.  
I'm on my way home  
I can remember  
Every new day.
