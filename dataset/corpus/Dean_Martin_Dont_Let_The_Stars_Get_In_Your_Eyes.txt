Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
The love blooms at night in the daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Oh keep your heart for me for someday  
I'll return and you know you're the only one I'll ever love  
  
Too many nights  
Too many stars  
Too many moons to change your mind  
  
If I'm gone too long don't forget where you belong  
When the stars come out remember you are mine  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
The love blooms at night in the daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Oh keep your heart for me for someday  
I'll return and you know you're the only one I'll ever love  
  
Too many miles  
Too many days  
Too many nights to be alone  
  
Ah please keep your heart while we are apart  
Don't you linger in the moonlight when I'm gone  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
The love blooms at night in the daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Oh keep your heart for me for someday  
I'll return and you know you're the only one I'll ever love  
You're the only one I'll ever love
