Yeah, you're such a gentleman  
You always open doors for me  
But you see us kind of different  
It's like, you always have to be  
The first one to open his mouth  
The last one to throw in the towel  
It's time to show your self-out  
Boy you're trying  
  
Just a little bit too hard  
I thought I told you when we met  
That all I get for who you are  
But I treat you like an argument  
I don't need to speak in my mind  
I'm too grown, I'm taking my time  
I'm sick of hearing you rhyme  
Listen, baby  
  
You don't have to come first  
Second is okay 'cause you ain't never beated me  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think I'm wrong when I know I'm right  
You lose this ain't no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know it's time to let go  
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind  
  
Tell me does this scare you  
That I'm living my dream?  
Now I don't mean to hurt you  
But you make me wanna scream  
You smile while grinding your teeth  
You clap and stomping your feet  
You act about 17  
I'm so tired  
  
You don't have to come first  
Second is okay 'cause you ain't never beated me  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think I'm wrong when I know I'm right  
You lose this ain't no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know it's time to let go  
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind  
  
I can do it better  
You know I can do it better  
  
What are you trying to prove?  
What is it with you?  
Always thinking  
  
I can do it better  
You know I can do it better  
  
Baby, I can't stand  
Always argument  
Why you wanna fight?  
Why you always fight?  
  
You ain't always right  
I can do it better every day and every night  
I can do it better every day and every night  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think I'm wrong when I know I'm right  
You lose this ain't no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know it's time to let go  
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind
