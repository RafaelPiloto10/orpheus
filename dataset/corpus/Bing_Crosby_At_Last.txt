At last  
My love has come along  
My lonely days are over  
And life is like a song  
  
At last  
The skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
And I found a dream that I can speak to  
A dream that I can call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
Oh, you smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last
