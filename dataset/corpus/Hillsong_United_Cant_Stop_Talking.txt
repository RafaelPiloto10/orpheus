Chorus:  
Can't stop talking 'bout everything He's done  
It's the best thing, happened since the world began  
It didn't come cheap but I got it for free  
It's the hope of glory, Christ in me  
  
He helped me to see when my spirit was blind  
It's amazing if you look just what you'll find  
Every step I took, He took two  
If He did it for me, He can do it for you  
  
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)  
Do you know what I say is true?  
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)  
If He did it for me, He can do it for you  
[Verse:]
