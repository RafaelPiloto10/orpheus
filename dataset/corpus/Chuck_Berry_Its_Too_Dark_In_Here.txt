I went to pick this little girl up I met last night  
She's ready, waitin' for me under the front porch light  
She said, "Ain't it dark out there, ooh, it's so dark out there  
I hope your car got bright lights, ooh, it's so dark out there"  
  
We went to a house party, it was really outta sight  
It was about forty people dancin' under one dim light  
"Ain't it dark in there, ooh, it's too dark in there  
Will you take me somewhere else, darlin', 'cause it's too dark in there"  
  
So I drove her out the freeway into the country air  
She said, "I hope you ain't gonna park around here nowhere  
It's too dark out there, so dark out there  
Let's go back into town and do something 'cause it's too dark out there"  
  
So I asked her just where she had in mind to go  
She said, "Maybe to a scary movie picture show"  
I said, "It's too dark in there"  
I said, "It's too dark in there  
I've seen that movie before, baby, it's too dark in there"  
  
So it was nothing left for me to do but take her back home  
'Twas no one there, the lights was out and the fuse was blown  
And it was dark in there, yes, it was dark in there  
And we finally got the fuse in  
Ooh, it was dark in there
