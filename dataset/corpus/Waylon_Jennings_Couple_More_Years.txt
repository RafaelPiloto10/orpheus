I've got a couple more years on you, baby,that's all.  
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.  
And it ain't that I'm wiser,  
It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall.  
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby.. that's all.  
  
I've walked a couple more roads than you, baby,that's all.  
And I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl.  
And you're headin somewhere,  
But I've been to somewhere, and found it was nowhere at all.  
And I've picked up a couple of years on you baby, that's all.  
  
Now sayin' goodbye, girl don't never come easy at all.  
But you've got to fly 'cause you're hearin' those young eagles call.  
And someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall.  
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you, baby, that's all.  
  
I've got a couple more years on you baby, that's all.  
You'll say I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.  
It ain't that I'm wiser,  
It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall.  
And I've picked up a couple more years on you baby, that's all.
