You and I long to live like wind upon the water  
If we close our eyes we'll maybe realize  
There's more to life than what we have known  
And I can't believe I've spent so long  
Living lies I knew were wrong inside  
I've just begun to see the light  
  
Long ago there was a dream, had to make a choice or two  
Leaving all I loved behind for what nobody knew  
Stepped out on the stage  
A life under lights and judging eyes  
Now the applause has died and I can dream again...  
  
Is there anybody listening?  
Is there anyone that sees what's going on?  
Read between the lines, criticize the words they're selling  
Think for yourself and feel the walls  
Become sand beneath your feet  
  
Fell the breeze?  
Time's so near you can almost taste the freedom  
There's a warm wind from the south  
Hoist the sail and we'll be gone  
By morning, this will all seem like a dream  
And if I don't return to sing the song, maybe just as well  
I've seen the news and there's not much I can do...alone  
  
Is there anybody listening?  
Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?  
What's behind the words-images  
They know will please us?  
I'll take what's real  
Bring up the lights  
  
Is therew anybody listeing?  
Is there anyone that sees what's going one?  
Read between the lines  
Criticize the words they're selling  
Think for yourself and feel the walls  
Become sand beneath your feet.
