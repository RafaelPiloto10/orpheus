You tell me that you've got everything you want  
And your bird can sing  
But you don't get me  
You don't get me  
  
You say you've seen the seven wonders  
And you bird is green  
But you can't see me  
You can't see me  
  
When your prized possessions  
Start to weigh you down  
Look in my direction  
I'll be round, I'll be round  
  
When your bird is broken  
Will it bring you down  
You may be awoken  
I'll be round, I'll be round  
  
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is  
And your bird can swing  
But you can't hear me  
You can't hear me
