Take your fingers from my hair  
They have gotten us nowhere  
We can't last another second  
For we are two, too lost for open doors  
Take your memories and your ways  
Let me see a brighter day  
Greener fields aren't hard to hope for  
It's just hard to go on living here without you  
Chorus:  
Somewhere I have dreamed  
That you haven't got the time to be with me  
Somewhere though it seems  
That you have been making lovin' without me  
Starshine, moonshine  
You're the light that shines upon me baby  
I know, you'll go  
Find yourself another lover lady  
Let me tell you how I feel  
Loving others isn't real  
You are blind  
Too blind to notice  
That their love is not the love we share together  
Chorus:  
Somewhere I have dreamed  
That you haven't got the time to be with me  
Somewhere though it seems  
That you have been making lovin' without me  
Starshine, moonshine  
Your the light that shines upon me baby  
I know, you'll go  
Find yourself another lover lady  
Starshine, moonshine  
You're the light that shine upon me baby  
I know, you'll go  
Find yourself another lover lady
