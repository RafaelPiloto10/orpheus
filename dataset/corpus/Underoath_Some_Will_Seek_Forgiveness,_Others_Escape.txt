I heard a voice through the discord  
Of a deluge of passersby  
I saw one gaze frozen in time  
Watching me passing by  
  
I swear I'll know your face in the crowd  
And I'll hear your voice so loud  
When your whispering  
  
Hey unfaithful I will teach you to be stronger.  
Hey ungraceful I will teach you to forgive one another.  
  
Here's my kiss to betray  
Desperate to brush the lips of grace  
Do you feel hollow when you think of how Iv lied?  
  
Oh sweet angel of mercy  
With your grace like the morning  
Wrap your loving arms around me  
  
Hey unfaithful I will teach you to be stronger  
Hey ungraceful I will teach you to forgive one another  
Hey unloving I will love you  
  
Jesus I'm ready to come home
