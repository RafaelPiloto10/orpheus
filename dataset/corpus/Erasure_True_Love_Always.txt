Just you know why  
Why you and I  
Will by and by know true love ways  
Sometimes we'll sigh  
Sometimes we'll cry  
And we'll know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
Throughout the days  
Our true love ways  
Will bring us joys to share  
With those who really care  
Sometimes we'll sigh  
Sometimes we'll cry  
And we'll know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
Throughout the days  
Our true love ways  
Will bring us joys to share  
With those who really care  
Sometimes we'll sigh  
Sometimes we'll cry  
And we'll know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways
