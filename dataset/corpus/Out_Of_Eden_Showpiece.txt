Yo, I don't appreciate you telling me  
The way that I should live  
No, I think the choices you've laid out for me  
The end is negative  
So, take all your imagery and ideology  
Yes I'll be fine  
When you go I'd rather not display my physical  
I'd rather use my mind, oh  
You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  
Hey, it seems a shame to me I've been reduced  
To an object of lust and hate  
No way, please understand that I refuse to be  
Simply a height and weight  
This day, somewhere we've lost the value  
Of what a woman is supposed to be  
A queen, respected and defined by her creator  
Size 24, size 10 or size 3  
You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  
It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride  
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl  
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me  
It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride  
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl  
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby
