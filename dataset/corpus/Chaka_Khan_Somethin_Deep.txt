Why'd you have to take me there?  
You start the fire, then you put it out  
I have to depend on my imagination  
I didn't want to fade what you've been puttin' down  
  
But then you say the word  
Then I go under  
  
Every time you go  
Missing you so  
Somethin' deep  
Baby come around  
Missing you now  
Somethin' deep  
(Deeper, going deeper down without you honey)  
  
It's more confusing by the hour  
You set me free, but you don't go away  
I try to think about somebody else  
That's when I know I just can't help myself  
So baby say the word and take me over  
  
Every time you go  
Missing you so  
Somethin' deep  
Baby come around  
Missing you now  
Somethin' deeply
