Do you remember anyone here?  
No you don't remember anything at all  
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back  
Never woke up, had no regrets  
  
There's a party in my mind...  
And it never stops  
There's a party up there all the time...  
They'll party till they drop  
Other people can go home...  
Other people they can split  
I'll be here all the time...  
I can never quit  
  
Take a walk through the land of shadows  
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows  
Try not to look so disappointed  
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?  
There's a party in my mind...  
And I hope it never stops  
I'm stuck here in this seat...  
I might not stand up  
  
Other people can go home...  
Everyone else will split  
I'll be here all the time...  
I can never quit  
  
Everything is very quiet  
Everyone has gone to sleep  
I'm wide awake on memories  
There memories can't wait.
