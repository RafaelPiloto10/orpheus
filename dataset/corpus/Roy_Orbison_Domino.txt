There's a cat in town that you might know  
He goes by the name of Domino  
A long tweed jacket and a diamond ring  
A blue sport car, he's a crazy king  
They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino  
  
Well the girls all think that he's a real gone guy  
They all flip when he walks by  
Shanty clothes and cool white shoes  
He's rearm' to go and never sings the blues  
They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino  
  
He's got cool black hair and a solid style  
Long side-bums and a crazy smile  
A thousand girls, they'll tell you so  
They dig that cat called Domino  
They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino  
Well Domino, cool man go, Domino, they love him so  
Get out of the way, here comes Domino, Domino, Domino
