Everybody's dancing  
To the farfisa beat  
All the girls are crazy  
Acting out the heat  
Tie and shirts and cuff links  
Well that's pretty neat  
  
[Chorus]  
Flash flash mirror ball  
Stereo and disco  
Wow wow ain't she tall  
Moved off my feet  
To the farfisa beat  
  
Pulling my side glances  
To the one across the way  
She wears a lot of makeup  
But they all do these days  
Pretty horny tee shirt  
Well might you explain  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Beat for beat for beat for all  
Cut there in the yea  
Everybody's got their girl  
So is there any spare  
For five foot seven  
Of heavy duty wear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
  
[Chorus]
