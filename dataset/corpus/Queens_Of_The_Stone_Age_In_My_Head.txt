It's the cruelest joke to play  
I'm so high I run in place  
Only a line we separate  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep on playing our favorite song  
I turn it up while you're gone  
It's all I've got when you're in my head  
And you're in my head, so I need it  
  
You're the only thing I've got  
I can't seem to get enough  
We collide for one embrace  
So  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Ooh, ohh  
  
Hurry up and wait forever  
Hurry up and wait forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need it  
I need it  
I need it now
