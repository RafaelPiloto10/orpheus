In Your Name  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
In Your name, we come into your presence  
In Your name, we breathe and live  
In Your name, we find salvation  
That you so freely give  
Chorus:  
If we love a little more in Your name  
And we care a little more in Your name  
And we share a little more in Your name  
Then this world is gonna be changed  
In Your name, we've heard the message  
In Your name, we've heard the call  
In Your name, as those before us  
We rise up to give you all  
Chorus (repeat 2x)  
In Your name, in Your name, in Your name  
I know this world is gonna be changed
