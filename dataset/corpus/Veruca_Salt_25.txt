I'm afraid I will never change  
It's okay I am not ashamed  
I can say that my bed is made  
You can bend me, shape me any way You can bend me, shape me any way you want
me  
I maintain, I am not in pain  
How I try, not to place the blame  
I came late to an early game  
You can bend me, shape me any way  
You can bend me, shape me any way  
You can bend me, shape me any way  
You can bend me, shape me any way you want me  
When I was five, I took a dive  
When I was ten, I walked again  
When I was fifteen, I kept my motor clean  
When I was twenty, I got plenty  
When I was twenty-five...  
When I was twenty-five...
