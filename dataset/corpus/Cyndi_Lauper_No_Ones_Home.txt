Leave me alone  
I'm not home  
Don't hear your knock at the door  
I'm running away so don't call  
There'll be no answer today  
  
There's no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be no one at home  
There's no one at home oh oh  
Oh there'll be  
  
Don't ask me why  
Time goes by, I haven't heard from the witness  
No things are play  
So don't call me  
There'll be no answer today  
  
There's no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be  
  
Be better if I fall... After all  
I'm always crying crying  
So would you catch me if I fell  
When there no one listening  
To hear what happened  
When I'm all on my own  
  
Leave me alone  
I'm not home  
Don't hear your knock at the door  
I'm running away so don't call  
There'll be no answer today  
  
There's no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be  
  
Be better if I fall... After all  
I'm always crying crying  
Know if you catch me if I fell  
And there's no one listening  
To hear what happened  
When I'm all on my own  
No one at home  
No one at home  
  
No nah nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah na no no hah hah  
No nah nah nah no no no no uh oh
