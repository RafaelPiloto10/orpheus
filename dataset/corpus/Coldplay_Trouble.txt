Oh no I see  
A spider web it's tangled up with me  
And I lost my head  
The thought of all the stupid things I said  
Oh no what's this  
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle  
So I turned to run  
The thought of all the stupid things I've done  
  
And oh I never meant to cause you trouble  
And oh and I never meant to do you wrong  
And oh well if I ever caused you trouble  
Oh no I never meant to do you harm  
  
Oh no I see  
A spider web and it's me in the middle  
So I twist and turn  
Here am I in my little bubble  
  
Singing out  
Oh I never meant to cause you trouble  
Oh I never meant to do you wrong  
Oh well if I ever caused you trouble  
Oh no I never meant to do you harm  
  
They spun a web for me  
They spun a web for me  
They spun a web for me
