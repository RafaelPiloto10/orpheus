Some people don't seem real at all  
Unafraid of any mountain  
Sure that the gods won't let him fall  
Should he fall, he will always get up again  
And if he's hurt he never shows it  
If he's wrong nobody knows it  
Seems like he never has to try  
He just must be a lucky guy  
And when there's pain he never minds it  
When it's lost he always finds it  
Nobody really knows just why  
He just must be a lucky guy  
He just must be a lucky guy  
I wish I was that lucky guy
