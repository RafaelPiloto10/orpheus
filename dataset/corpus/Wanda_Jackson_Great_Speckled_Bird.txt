What a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning the great speckled bird  
Remember her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word  
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes  
But they long to find fault with her teaching but really they find no mistakes  
  
I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am proud that my name is on her
book  
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Savior's true look  
When he comes descending from heaven on the cloud as he write in his word  
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of the great speckled bird
