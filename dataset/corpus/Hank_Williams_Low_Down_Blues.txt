Lord, I went to the doctor, he took one look  
He said, the trouble with you ain't in my book  
I'll tell you what it is but it ain't good news  
You've got an awful bad case of them low down blues  
  
I've got the mean old miseries in my soul  
I went to the river but the water's too cold  
I've walked the floor till I've wore out my shoes  
Lord, they're killin' me, I mean them low down blues  
  
Lord, I never knew a man could feel so bad  
I never knew livin' could be so sad  
All I do is set and cry  
Lord, I'd have to get better, before I could die  
  
I've got the mean old miseries in my soul  
I went to the river but the water's too cold  
I've walked the floor till I've wore out my shoes  
Lord, they're killin' me, I mean them low down blues
