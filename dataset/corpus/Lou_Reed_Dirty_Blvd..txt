Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel  
he looks out a window without glass  
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet  
his father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg  
  
He's got 9 brothers and sisters  
they're brought up on their knees  
it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs  
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man  
but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard  
  
He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard  
he's going out, to the dirty boulevard  
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard  
  
This room cost 2,000 dollars a month  
you can believe it man it's true  
somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants  
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything  
they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard  
  
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em  
that's what the Statue of Bigotry says  
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death  
and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard  
  
Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard  
going out, to the dirty boulevard  
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard  
going out  
  
Outside it's a bright night  
there's an opera at Lincoln Center  
movie stars arrive by limousine  
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan  
but the lights are out on the Mean Streets  
  
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel  
he's selling plastic roses for a buck  
The traffic's backed up to 39th street  
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck  
  
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming  
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can  
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling  
"At the count of 3" he says, "I hope I can disappear"  
  
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard  
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard  
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard  
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly  
Fly, fly away  
I want to fly  
Fly-fly away (Fly a-)  
fly-fly-fly (-way, ooohhh...)  
Fly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)  
fly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)
