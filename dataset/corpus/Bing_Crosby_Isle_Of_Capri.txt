't Was on the Isle of Capri that I found her  
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree  
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her  
Where we met on the Isle of Capri  
  
She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning  
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me  
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning  
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri  
  
Summertime was nearly over  
Blue Italian sky above  
I said "Lady, I'm a rover,  
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"  
  
She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"  
And then as I kissed her hand I could see  
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger  
't Was goodbye at the Villa Capri  
  
Summertime was nearly over  
Blue Italian sky above  
I said "Lady, I'm a rover,  
Can you spare a fine word of love?"  
  
She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"  
And then as I kissed her hand I could see  
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger  
't Was goodbye on the Isle of Capri (3x)
