Now I've heard you singing  
Dreaming that you know me well  
Let me tell you far away  
Looking down on you  
  
If you know my spirit  
Always shall you know me now  
Singing is your pleasure  
Looking down on you  
  
Now I hear you singing  
Saying that you know me well  
Take me to your promise  
New state of mind  
  
Now I feel you sighing  
Saying that you understand  
Feeling all the power  
Looking down on you  
  
You know that I would be  
The one who waits forever  
You know that someday we will find  
A way to share our love  
  
Now I hear you singing  
Dreaming that you know me well  
Let me tell you far away  
New state of mind
