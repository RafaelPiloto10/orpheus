Oo-ooo if I had you, yeah the things that I could do  
Honey, if I had you  
  
Now I could sing like an angel, fly just like a bird  
Sing you the best love song you ever heard.  
I could be a poet like Mohammed Ali,  
Float like a butterfly, sting just like a, just like a bee.  
  
Mmm, ooo, if I had you, ahhh the things that I could do  
If I had you.

Well it'd just say 'my baby, my baby, she's the best.'  
I could be your Superman, you could be my Lois Lane  
I could be a Tarzan, you could be my sweet Jane - if you wanted to.  
  
Mmm if I had you, ah the things that I could do  
If I had you.

Oh boy  
Only if I had you.  
  
So come on dance with me baby, don't let me go.  
Yeah dance with me baby, don't let me go.  
Baby don't let me, don't let me  
Don't let me go, oh no...
