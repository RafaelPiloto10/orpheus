Have you seen that vigilante man  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
I've been hearin' his name all over this land  
  
Lonely nights down in the engine house  
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse  
Man comes home, chase the crowds in the rain  
That's a vigilante man  
  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man  
Well I ramble around from town to town  
Ramble 'round from town to town  
  
And they hunted us a while like a wild herd of cattle  
That's a vigilante man  
Tell me why does that vigilante man  
Tell me why does that vigilante man  
  
Carry that sawed off shotgun in his hand  
Would he shoot his brother and sister down  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
I've been hearin' his name all over this land  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man  
  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man
