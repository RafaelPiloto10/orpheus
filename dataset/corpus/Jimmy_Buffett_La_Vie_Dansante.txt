They can can come take it all away  
Break your heart in the light of day  
Drown your love in a distant bay  
So lonely  
See the ship heading for the rocks  
  
See the time melting off the clocks  
There's a light shattering all the locks  
And saves me  
It saves me  
  
That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante  
On the night wind that takes me just where I want  
That's all I want La Vie Dansante  
Why don't you wander and follow La Vie Dansante  
On the night wind that takes you just where you want  
That's all you'll want La Vie Dansante  
  
Miss the beat if you close your eyes  
Every night wears a new disguise  
And I live when a new surprise surrenders  
  
Feel it all with a willing heart  
Every stop is a place to start  
If you know how to play the part with feeling  
I play with feeling
