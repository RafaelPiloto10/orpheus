When the moon lays his head on a pillow,  
And the stars settle down for a rest,  
Just do me one small favour, I beg you,  
Please, play me my baby's request.  
  
It's the song that we heard when we started,  
Now the birds have all flown from our nest.  
But you could bring back mem'ries, departed,  
By playing my baby's request.  
  
My baby said,  
That she knows how it goes,  
But you're the one who really knows.  
So go ahead,  
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.

Mm-mm, play me baby's request,  
Please, play me my baby's request.  
  
One more time.
