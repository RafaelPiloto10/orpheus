One after the other,  
The banished ones fled as they watched from  
The distance the destruction of the digital garden.  
  
With no more fruit to bear from its trees,  
The haze was finally broken.  
  
With the rains came the awareness that never again  
Would anyone ever lay claim to the treasures of the Rainbow Children.  
  
As though awakened from a dream,  
The muse opened her eyes. This time as queen.
