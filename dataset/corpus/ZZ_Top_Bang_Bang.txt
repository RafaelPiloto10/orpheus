Everybody knows what it's all about  
Pretty thing jumpin' all around  
Shakin' your money-maker now  
Take it off and take me down  
  
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang  
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang  
Take it off  
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang  
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang  
Hey yeah  
  
Tear me up, baby, tear me down  
You got me movin' upside down  
Feelin' good, I'm feelin' alright  
Do it again, do it all night  
  
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang  
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang  
Take it off, take it off  
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang  
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang  
(Popgun!)  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Do me once, baby do me twice  
Do it 'cause it feels so nice  
I don't care 'bout nothin' else  
Do me 'til my money melts  
  
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang, take it off  
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang, hey yeah  
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang  
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang  
Hey  
(Popgun!)  
  
Hey, hey, hey
