The color of my hair is changing, my skin is soft  
Too soft for a man my age, and I am never alone  
Where is time taking me  
Nothin' is real, this is how I feel  
And nothing is wrong but everything takes too long  
How did this end up me against you  
With everything that I say, and everything you do  
Your smile is changing yea, where is time taking you  
'Cause nothing is real, this is how I feel  
And nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind  
If you don't mind doing time  
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long  
Hey by the way, when I fell to your  
Waste side, did I crash or just slide  
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up  
To your waste side did I hurt you or just slide in  
So this is how it feels to get a little older  
And some would say wiser  
But we know what that means, maybe not  
When maybe that's what that means, maybe not  
'Cause nothing is real, this is how I feel  
And nothing is good, but I don't mind being blind  
If you don't mind doing time  
Nothing is wrong but everything takes too long  
Hey by the way, when I fell to your  
Waste side, did I crash or just slide  
Hey by the way, when I pulled myself up  
To your waste side did I hurt you or just slide in
