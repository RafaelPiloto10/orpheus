Let me loose I just got back  
I was pushed and I got dragged  
I tasted mud, I tasted wine  
I've kissed the life I've left behind  
So say I choose to stick around  
I got news for this here town  
I kick the ball, I catch the bus  
And raise the roof for all of us  
  
Destination anywhere  
So far gone, I'm almost there  
Can't you see I can't deny  
I'm out of here like I'm on fire  
  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man  
  
Steal your car and leave a wreck  
Kiss your bride, I cash your check  
And Tyson plus, I'm ripped and torn  
Been on the edge since I was born  
I kick the jukebox, change the tune  
I break the bank and jump the moon  
I sink the fleet to catch a buzz  
And raise a glass for all of us  
  
Destination anywhere  
So far gone, I'm almost there  
Can't you see I can't deny  
I'm out of here like I'm on fire  
  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man  
  
I'm a beast in space  
I'm an acid taste  
I'm a primitive gong stuffed in your face  
It's enough to bring you to your knees  
  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything, everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man
