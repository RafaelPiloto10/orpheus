Halloween story they'de like to share with the class?  
I have another one. Well you have just told your story J  
So what bitch, you sit here every day and tell stories  
I'll tell a story in this mutha fucka  
See he doesn't want me to tell my story  
'cause he knows my story, it's about Mr. Rotten Treats  
All your parentes know my story too  
They don't tell you about him though  
Long ago they all killed Mr. Rotten Treats  
They're scared that you'll talk about 'em, they're scared that  
He'll come back from the dead, they're all scared  
he'll cut your fuckin' ass  
Welcome too, the other side  
that's what they told me when I died  
I was stabbed in the head  
Look what ya done dead  
All the blood bleed, one juggalo dead  
It was a cold, dark, scary Halloween  
So my neighbors and my people,  
they didn't really like me right?  
So they came and burn down my world  
Just because I like to murder their boys and girls  
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one  
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun  
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to  
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?  
I come back from the other side  
I come for the people that took away my life  
Trick or treat bitch, my dead body speaks  
You tricked me now it's only right  
that you try my rotten treats  
Trick or treat, trick or treat  
Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)  
Mr. Rotten Treats got all the good shit  
over hereboys and girls, I got balls freshly  
picked form Detroits biggest nutsacks, I got  
Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling  
I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds rarest fudge packer  
Must return to the other side  
But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride  
Murder go round the dead body clown  
Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around  
Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?  
Thank you sonny here's a little treat now run along  
Hey buddy, you thought I was dead, man  
You probably stuffed the fuckin' shank in my head  
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one  
I thought you were supposed to murder it was all in fun  
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to  
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?  
I send you to the other side  
Your buddies and your neighbors can come along for the ride  
Weak bitches, you thought that you had me beat  
But this aolloween I'm commin back with my Rotten Treats  
Trick or treat, trick or treat  
Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)

Fried titty nipples, sweet acid drops, sweet  
chocolate coverd nipple nuggets with the fresh creamy  
shit filling, ask about my bitch she loves my  
cookie dough nut dribbles  
Trick or treat? (Trick)  
Trick or treat? (Trick)  
It was the halloween I never ment to harm no one  
I thought that you were supposed to murder it was all in fun  
I seen the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer too  
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?
