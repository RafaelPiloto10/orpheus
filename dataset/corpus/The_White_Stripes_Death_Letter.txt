I got a letter this morning  
What do you reckon it read?  
It said the gal you love is dead  
I got a letter this morning  
What do you reckon it read?  
  
Said "Hurry, Hurry because the gal you love is dead"  
Well I packed up my suitcase  
I took off down the road  
When I got there she was layin' on the cooling board  
I packed up my suitcase  
And I took off down the road  
When I got there she was layin' on the cooling board  
  
It looked like ten thousand people standing around the burial ground  
I didn't know I loved her 'till they began to let her down  
Looked like ten thousand people standing on the burial ground  
I didn't know that I loved her 'till they began to let her down  
  
You know it's so hard to love  
Someone that don't love you  
Won't get satisfaction  
Don't care what you do  
So hard to love  
Someone that don't love you  
  
Don't look like satisfaction  
Don't care what you do  
  
Well I got up this morning  
The break of day  
Just hugging the pillows  
She used to lay  
  
Got up this morning  
The break of day  
Just hugging the pillows  
Where my baby used to lay
