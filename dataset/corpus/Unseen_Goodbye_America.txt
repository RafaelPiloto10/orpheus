Yeah, everything bothers me  
Just about everything that I see  
No need for a flag or a country  
Raise your finger if you agree  
  
The problems won't go away  
If we keep our rage at bay  
The filth and slime will always stay  
If we choose to ignore and play  
  
The stars and strips are prison bars  
They won't let you get too far  
The rule over many, by the few  
You can't police my mind 'cause I won't let you  
  
Goodbye America! fuck you America!  
  
Pledge allegiance to yourself  
Not greed, power, war, and wealth  
Remember you were born a human being  
Not a part of their machine  
  
Goodbye America! fuck you America!  
  
No more social order.
