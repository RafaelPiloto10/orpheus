Well the morning's come  
And Lord my mind is aching  
The sunshine's quietly standing at my door  
Just like the dawn  
My heart is silently breaking  
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor.  
  
Once again the whole town will be talking  
It's more I've seen the pity in their eyes  
They could never understand  
It's her sorrow not a man  
  
No matter what they say I know she tried  
Baby's packed her soft things  
And oh she's left me  
I know she never meant to make me cry  
  
It's not her heart Lord  
It's her mind she didn't mean to be unkind  
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye.
