Are you back in Greenwich dropping acid?  
Are you at the archive, watching television?  
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?  
And your leather lookin' like Greg Kinnear?  
Are you still the king of Rock 'n' Roll, babe?  
  
Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana  
And did you take your run today  
Along that west side highway?  
Do you miss your baby mama? Blue hydrangea  
Will my forever love never come back to me?  
Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?  
  
How quickly you forget how I made you smile  
I remember everything  
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tire light  
Blue hydrangea  
Will my forever love never return to me?
