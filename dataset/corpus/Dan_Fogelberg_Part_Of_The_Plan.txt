I have these moments  
All steady and strong  
I'm feeling so holy and humble  
The next thing I know  
I'm all worried and weak  
And I feel myself starting to crumble  
  
The meanings get lost  
And the teachings get tossed  
And you don't know what  
You're going to do next  
You wait for the sun  
But it never quite comes  
Some kind of message  
Comes through to you  
Some kind of message comes through  
  
And it says to you. . .  
  
Love when you can  
Cry when you have to  
Be who you must  
That's a part of the plan  
Await your arrival  
With simple survival  
And one day we'll all understand  
  
I had a woman  
Who gave me her soul  
But I wasn't ready to take it  
Her heart was so fragile  
And heavy to hold  
And I was afraid I might break it  
  
Your conscience awakes  
And you see your mistakes  
And you wish someone  
Would buy your confessions  
The days miss their mark  
And the night gets so dark  
And some kind of message  
Comes through to you  
Some kind of message shoots through --  
  
Love when you can  
Cry when you have to  
Be who you must  
That's a part of the plan  
Await your arrival  
With simple survival  
And one day we'll all understand  
  
There is no Eden or  
Heavenly gates  
That you're gonna make it to one day  
But all of the answers you seek  
Can be found  
In the dreams that you dream on the way
