Wake up  
The dawn of another dull day  
Take up  
Your dreams and on your way  
Oh oh ooh  
  
Daylight  
Mother stands in the hall  
Last night  
Head against the wall  
Oh oh ooh  
  
When night turns to day  
And the children come out to play  
Another day  
  
Stop, shake out  
They came my way  
Oh oh ooh...  
  
Boy, salute in a street uniform  
Toy, soldier ripped and torn  
Oh oh ooh  
  
When night turns to day  
And the children come out to play  
Another day  
  
Stop, shout  
They came my way  
Oh oh ooh
