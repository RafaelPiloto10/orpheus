Out on the town kicking around feeling bluesy  
It's getting late I can't afford to be choosy  
Should be home and dry by now  
Tried every trick in the book but  
  
Another night Saturday night and I'm losing  
Another night Saturday night and I'm losing  
  
The DJ plays a song from the past I remember  
I hold her tight in my arms she surrenders  
It's the same old record playing  
But it's a different girl that's swaying  
  
[Chorus:]  
As we move around the room  
Whispering things with my eyes closed  
I feels that you're here  
Then the music stops I open my eyes  
My fantasy ends we're not even friends  
  
So leave me to catch my ride pay my fare on my way home  
The same thing every week on my own  
Next time around you might be there  
My luck might change but until then  
  
[Chorus:]
