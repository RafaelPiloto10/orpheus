Inside out again  
I had to spread it a little thin  
I work and work and try  
And try  
And try and try to shine  
That's fine but  
  
It's high time  
Break and take the freedom  
My time  
To live like I feel  
To let down and let myself be  
It's high time for me  
High time for me  
High time for me  
  
Darling look at you  
I can see what you been through  
You been bought and sold  
And pushed and rolled  
And rolled  
And rolled gets old  
  
But it's high time  
Break and take the freedom  
Your time to leave like you feel  
So get up, you know what to do  
It's high time for you  
High time for you  
High time for you too  
  
I know you know  
All about a fool  
Who is where and where is  
What is cool to you  
  
I'll go underground  
With the ones I've found  
Put your ear down  
You can feel us shake  
Way down way down  
We're making a break  
Making a break  
Our ship is in  
You know it is  
It is high time  
It's high time  
  
Don't we feel fine tonight  
We got the fire hot alright  
The feeling is clear  
You better be aware  
It's here  
It's all here  
  
And it's high time  
Break and take the freedom  
Our time  
To live as we feel  
So come on feel the buzz  
It's high time for us  
High time for us  
High time for us
