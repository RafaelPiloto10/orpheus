I'm in love I can't lie  
Got a feeling that I just can't hide  
More than the world, more than good  
You said you love me  
And I knew you would  
Somehow I knew you would  
Somehow I knew it, oh yeah, yeah  
Look what you're doing for me  
  
Chorus:  
Well I found your love  
I wanna stay around your love  
I can't pretend to love  
Everything I say  
I'm gonna use your love  
I don't wanna ever lose your love  
I can't refuse your love  
You're everything I need to me  
And the night has me calling for you  
  
It's no dream, I know it's real  
No one tells me what it is I feel  
Let me know, it's understood  
You said you love me  
And I knew you would  
Somehow I knew it, oh yeah, yeah  
Look what you're doing to me  
  
Chorus:  
  
I'm gonna use your love  
I don't wanna lose your love  
I can't refuse your love  
You're everything to me  
Don't wanna lose your love  
I never wanna lose your love  
'Cause the night has me calling for you
