When the night has come  
And I'm all alone  
And I have some time to breath  
So much damage done  
I guess nobody won  
Is it to late to make you see  
  
I love you  
Oh darling  
Yes I really do  
I love you  
Oh darling  
Yes I really do  
  
I know very well  
How it got this way  
I was drifting on my cloud  
There isn't much to tell  
Except you've gone away  
And darling now I'm reaching out  
  
I love you  
Let me show you  
How I really do  
I love you  
Oh darling  
You gotta know it's true  
  
I wish that I had you now  
The way that I had you then  
Darling, I'd take you and hold you and kiss you  
Over and over again  
Oooh  
  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Umm umm umm umm umm  
Oooh oooh oooh  
  
Maybe we can try  
To get back to that place  
When passion made us wild  
No more alibis  
Standing face to face  
You will see it in my eyes  
  
I love you - oh my darling  
You should know it's true  
I love you  
Oh let me tell you  
How much I really do  
Oh darling  
You know I really do  
Oh darling  
Yes I really do
