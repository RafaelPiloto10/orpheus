Gangsters bangin, nuts straight hanging  
Chillen in the allyway, signs straight beemin  
Up in the air I hear they don't care  
Get your mutha fuckin' melon busted for a stare  
Luv pumpin through the heart, flowin through the veins  
Pop a mutha fucka like it ain't no thang  
Blood shoot eyes from pufin on the bud  
Let me see that rag, let me see that luv  
Roamin through the hood top cut down  
Car packed so full it's fuckin' on the ground  
Max with the homies spitten on the hoes  
Stop in the store for a cold 4-0  
Grabbin on your balls, straight slanging stalls  
Fuck the gang squad tryin to take me out my home  
Check my neck and I got yours  
'cause roll with yourself and keep that clown luv  
Throw your signs in the air  
what's that? I don't check, I don't care  
'cause I'm down with the clown everywere  
'cause much clown luv is in here (2x)  
Hey homes what set your clame?  
I'm in the rhymin game, wicked Clown Banging  
I'm just a mutha fucka that's down for the cause  
You can suck on my balls, unless you got clown luv  
Put 'em up, throw 'em up  
Let me see them mutha fuckas  
Flip 'em up, flip 'em down, flip 'em around  
Mutha fuckas mind all warped  
From breathin all the smog  
I'm all up in the shit, like if my name was frog  
Damn I heard a shot, but I got luck  
The mutha fuckas missed it's time to shoot 'em up  
Here come the sirens I hear 'em gettin close  
Here come the squad, it's time to get ghost  
If you want to stay you get beat by a pig  
Fuck that shit 'cause were I live  
My boys got my neck and I got theirs  
'cause I'm true to myself, bitch  
Clown Luv  
Throw your signs in the air  
what's that? I don't check, I don't care  
'cause I'm down with the clown everywere  
'cause much clown luv is in here (2x)  
Hey what the fuck you lookin at man  
My rag, my flannel, or the club in my hand?  
Well here go ahead, take a closer look  
Thanx for the wallet bitch  
Give me them duckets, mutha fuckin' child  
To buys doing other things like hangin with my mob  
Crew got my neck, well push come to shove  
Never sell out yourself, and keep that Clown Luv  
Throw your signs in the air  
what's that? I don't check, I don't care  
'cause I'm down with the clown everywere  
'cause much clown luv is in here (repeating)
