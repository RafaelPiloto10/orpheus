I sit alone in the golden daylight,  
But all I see is a silver sky,  
For in my fancy I sweep away light,  
And keep my image of the sky,  
Just the way we like it, you and I.  
  
All through the day I dream about the night,  
I dream about the night, Here with you.  
All through the day I wish away the time,  
Until the time when I'm here with you.  
  
Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,  
The evening mist melts away,  
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall  
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.
