Sometimes, I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear  
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear  
Take the wheel and steer  
  
It's driven me before  
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal  
But lately I am beginning to find  
That I should be the one behind the wheel  
  
Whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes  
  
Whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes  
  
So if I decide to waiver my chance  
To be one of the hive  
Will I choose water over wine  
And hold my own and drive?  
  
It's driven me before  
And it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around  
But lately I am beginning to find  
That when I drive myself my light is found  
  
So whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes, yeh  
  
Whatever tomorrow brings  
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes  
  
Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?  
Would you choose water over wine  
Hold the wheel and drive?
