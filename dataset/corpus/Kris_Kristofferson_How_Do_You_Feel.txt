So many people got so many lines  
They've all been tried and it's true  
They've all got so many reasons for changin' your mind  
And there ain't none of 'em knew  
But there's just so little distance between me and you  
I think we're two of a kind  
We won't do nothin' you don't wanna do  
And I won't tell you no lies  
  
Chorus:  
So tell me, how do you feel about foolin' around  
Down from your head to your toes  
Ain't nothin' realer than right here and now  
If that's as far as it goes  
  
And it goes-and it goes-and it goes  
  
Hey, you'll never miss nothin' you've never known  
You'll never know 'til you try  
Hey, we can take it or leave it alone  
But we got so little time  
  
Chorus:  
So tell me, how do you feel about foolin' around  
Down from your head to your toes  
Ain't nothin' realer than right here and now  
If that's as far as it goes.
