Better To Have Loved  
Ooh  
Better To Have Loved...  
Ooh  
If the sun went down tomorrow and it never came back  
And the city went quiet and we fade to black  
Well I won't have a single regret  
And I wouldn't trade a thing  
Cause I never knew I could feel what I feel inside of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Better to have loved than never loved at all  
Better to have dreamed than never taken the fall  
Better to have loved you and let you in than never to have touched your skin  
Better to have hurt and screamed and cried  
Fall into the earth for a trip to the sky  
Better to have loved  
You  
  
Better to have Loved:  
I knew all the time I was taking a chance  
When I stand there on the edge of the cliff and no one was holding my hand  
Well the wind blew strong and the clouds rolled in and I, I felt us lift off
the ground  
Yes I bared my soul and I dared to go knowing one day you might let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gave you everything but to have said goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
Better to have loved than never loved at all  
Better to have dreamed than never taken the fall  
Better to have loved you and let you in than never to have touched your skin  
Better to have hurt and screamed and cried  
Fall into the earth for a trip to the sky  
Better to have loved, better to have loved  
You
