You need a feature Daddy?  
Give me my Peter Pan  
When I hit the club, it'll be me and my conceited friend  
Been signin' autographs  
Since like a quarter past  
I'm in the hallway  
Don't need no hall pass  
If I eat it, then everybody gonna order that  
Everything I do these bitches wishin' they'da thought of that  
I'm an indian giver  
I want the quarter back  
If hip-hop was dead  
Bitch I just brought it back  
Take it to the off, I'm a take it, take it off  
I'm a take it in the club, then we take it to the loft  
I'm a take it to my niggas, I'm a take it to the boss  
I'm a jiggle it, jiggle it, bakin' soda soft  
I'm a put it in your face, I'm a put it in your braids  
Way I make it pop a peak put me in his favs  
Make it rain, it's a 10, 000 dollar day  
Pop it like champagne on the holiday  
  
It's like shh be quiet  
'Cause your body talks louder when you're silent (silent)  
Got your eyes sayin' yes, your body sayin' more  
Girl you like what I do, come here let me guide you  
(Oh) So take it off  
Now take it off oh whoa (Someone take it off)  
You take it off (I'ma take it off)  
Girl I'm about to break you off (baby take it off)
