When the jungle shadows fall  
Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock  
As it's standing against the wall  
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops  
When the summer shower's through  
So a voice within me  
Keeps revealing you, you  
  
Night and day  
You are the one  
Only you beneath the moon  
And under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter, baby, where you are  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Day and night  
Why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic gloom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Though such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Oh, such a hungry yearning  
Burning, burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Night and day  
Night and day  
Night, night, night and day  
Night and day  
Night, night and day  
Night and day
