The hour's late and the lights are low  
I'm walking home just kicking stones  
I waited at the deopt you never showed  
You missed the last bus hours ago  
  
I remember the first time  
I saw you on the street  
You looked so pretty my heart skipped a beat  
I can't wait any longer but I still feel the heat  
  
I'm down but I'm still on my feet  
I walked on down the old fairground  
Up from the docks blew a lonely sound  
I sat for a while on the cold hard ground  
  
Watched the stars slowly turn as the earth spun around  
As the past falls behind up ahead there's a crack  
Of light shining bright through the night so black  
Like a runaway train rolling down the track  
  
From here there's no turning back  
Listen to me baby  
Once upon a time  
My heart was an ocean  
  
You swam against the tide  
The time is past for grieving  
My tears have all run dry  
I'll leave you with my love  
  
And now I say goodbye  
The bottles broke the glasses are cracked  
The cards are all dealt and the chips have been stacked  
The lamp shades busted and the curtains are torn  
  
The door keeps knocking but there's nobody home  
I stood by the road brushed a tear from my eye  
Cursed the cars and the rain and the rolling grey sky  
I turned around turned my back on that town  
  
And I never looked back again
