[CHORUS:]  
Lying on the side of the road  
Feeling like he heard a sound  
Shivered with the feelin' that he knowed  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
She gave John a present that was fine  
So fine that he had to go  
Went to see what it was that he knowed  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
And I know it's hard  
But what did you expect of her?  
John looked down  
  
If you see the lady in your mind  
Even in her nothingness  
Standing through the darkest night  
And the people want to fight  
But first ask if it's all right  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
[CHORUS]  
And I know it's hard  
But what did you expect of her?  
John looked down
