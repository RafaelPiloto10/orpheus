Every day is a new day  
Since you went away  
(Since you went away)  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
(Made a change)  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
(Every day's a new day)  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
You were my comfort zone  
I depended on you for everything  
I wanted in my life, yes I did  
But now that you're gone  
I'm doing just fine without you  
How I bless the day you went away  
Now I have a song inside  
(Inside)  
The birds sing to me  
I finally can be  
Free to spread my wings in harmony  
Now the sun shines on me  
(On me)  
I have been set free  
To collect my thoughts and jot them down  
All this happiness I've found  
Since you've been away  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
(Made a change)  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me  
(It was best for you and me)  
Since you went away from me  
(Yeah)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
It may sound crazy, but I forgive you  
And want the best for you  
The circumstances came my way  
Now I've learned to do for myself  
And all the things I thought  
That you would do for me  
Like leaving me alone to go for my own  
When you're not at home, I'm glad you're gone  
Now I have a song inside  
(Inside)  
The birds sing to me  
I finally can be  
Free to spread my wings in harmony  
Now the sun shines on me  
(On me)  
I have been set free  
To collect my thoughts and jot them down  
All this happiness I've found  
(Since you went away)  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day and I see  
(Everyday)  
It was best for you and me  
(Since you went away)  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
Since you went away from me  
(From me)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me  
(How I bless that day)  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
Every day  
Since you went away from me  
(From me)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day and I see  
(Every day)  
It was best for you and me  
(Every day)

Since you went away from me

My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me  
Since you went away from me  
(From me)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me  
(It was best for you and me)  
Since you went away from me  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
Since you went away from me  
(Since you went away)  
My whole life has made a change  
Every day's a new day and I see  
It was best for you and me
