The cops are hanging around the house  
The cars outside look like they've got the blues  
The moon don't know if it's day or night  
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes  
You're making coffee for everyone concerned  
Someone points to this and someone points to that  
Everyone is saying that you should lie down  
But you ain't having none of that  
And I say to the sleepy summer rain  
With a complete absence of pain  
You might think I'm crazy  
But I'm still in love with you  
  
Hide your eyes, hide your tears,  
Hide your face, my love  
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows  
Hide your coloured cotton gloves  
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures  
Hide your neatly scissored locks  
Hide your memories, hide them all  
Stuff them in a cardboard box  
Or throw them into the street below  
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow  
For you might think I'm crazy  
But I'm still in love with you  
  
Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call  
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all  
  
Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs  
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair  
The other one resting on your hip  
Without a solitary care  
I fall to sleep in the summer rain  
With no single memory of pain  
And you might think I'm crazy  
But I'm still in love with you
