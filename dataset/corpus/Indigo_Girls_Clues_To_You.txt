There on those days when the sun barely touches the sky  
Your eyes are so heavy with the morning  
And there you lie on the horizon of my mind  
Streams flow through the consciousness of time  
And I follow your every movement for a clue to you  
  
You cover my eyes with your deepness  
You wrap my soul in the beauty of it all  
You take me away from my incompleteness  
Lead me all the way or not at all  
And times too precious here  
I can't wait for clues to you  
I can't wait for clues to you  
  
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming, no, no, no, this is my reality  
If I touch you tell me will you blow away  
Please don't move now until you set me free - set me free  
  
I can't wait for clues to you  
  
Name the time and Ill be your place  
Remove my eyes from this deathly haze  
Now I've been living shades of blue and grey  
Don't you know I'm ready for a brighter phase  
And times too precious here  
I can't wait for clues to you  
I can't wait for clues to you  
  
Wont you catch me if I fall too fast  
Don't let me fly too high  
Youve released me from my earthly grasp  
And now youve got me in your skies - in your skies  
  
I can't wait for clues to you  
Now I don't want to wait anymore for clues  
  
Let it rain  
Let it wash on down  
  
Can't wait for clues to you  
I don't want to wait anymore for clues
