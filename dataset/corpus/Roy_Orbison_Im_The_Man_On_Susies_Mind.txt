Morning comes into my room through pretty purple curtains  
And looks upon a man so satisfied  
I hold a woman in my arms and watch her while she's sleeping  
And I know that I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I'm the pretty dress she buys  
I'm the little bug she drives  
I'm the picture that she shows  
To everybody that she knows  
I'm the wiggle in her walk  
I'm the giggle in her talk  
I'm the happy little song she sings  
She wears my love for all to see  
Sail on by silver moon  
I won't follow you this time  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I'm the stops on her way home  
I'm the dime in the telephone  
I'm the honey that she talks about  
I'm old meanie when she pouts  
I'm the carpet beneath her feet  
Every night before she sleeps  
I'm the pillow where she lays her head  
I'm the last word that she said  
Sail on by silver moon  
I won't follow you this time  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind  
I've got heaven in my arms tonight  
I'm the man on Susie's mind
