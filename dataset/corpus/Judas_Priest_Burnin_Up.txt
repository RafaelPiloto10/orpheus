You stitch me up good, and you cut me down  
So I string you up to keep you hanging around  
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting  
So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking  
  
We've got to make love, the time is right  
We've got to make love tonight  
'Cause we're burnin' up  
  
You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food  
But I'll make out easy, 'cause I see straight through you  
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right  
'Cause you'll get hungry in the heat of the night  
  
And then we'll make love, just when it's right  
And when we make love tonight  
We'll be burnin' up  
  
I know you feel the same  
I know you feel the flame  
Staring deep inside of you  
Burnin' you up, breaking you down  
Breakin' you out in a cold sweat  
And as you lose control, of your very soul  
Your desire takes over  
You'll feel the heat sway  
You're round to my way  
And suddenly you'll know that you're burnin' up  
  
You stitch me up good, and you cut me down  
So I string you up to keep you hanging around  
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting  
So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking  
  
We've got to make love, the time is right  
We've got to make love tonight  
'Cause we're burnin' up  
We're burnin' up
