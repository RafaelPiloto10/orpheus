Well I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the lord  
But you don't really care for music, do ya?  
  
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you to a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Maybe there's a god above  
All I ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
And it's not a cry you can hear at night  
Not somebody who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah
