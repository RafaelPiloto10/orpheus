What else should I be  
All apologies  
What else could I say  
Everyone is gay  
What else could I write  
I don't have the right  
What else should I be  
All apologies  
  
In the sun  
In the sun I feel as one  
In the sun  
In the sun  
Married  
Buried  
  
I wish I was like you  
Easily amused  
Find my nest of salt  
Everything's my fault  
I take all the blame  
Aqua seafoam shame  
Sunburn, freezer burn  
Choking on the ashes of her enemy  
  
In the sun  
In the sun I feel as one  
In the sun  
In the sun  
Married  
Buried  
Married  
Buried  
  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we all are  
All in all is all we are
