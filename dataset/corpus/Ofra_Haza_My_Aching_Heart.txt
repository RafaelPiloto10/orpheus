I thought by now I'd forget  
Give me a sign  
I wanted more than the pain you left  
It's here all the time  
You're so out of reach,  
A disappearing star  
And still, when you look at me  
You tear me apart  
  
When you flow through me  
Surround me and light the dark  
Brand me and leave your mark  
My aching heart  
Is breaking again  
  
We've turned the page,  
And the summer's gone  
Turning to fall  
Memories paint the pictures like dreams  
I hear you call  
Was it only a dream  
When you made love to me  
And you filled my soul  
Made me whole  
And watched me cry  
My aching heart  
  
And floating somewhere  
You're there between pain and tears  
Between my love and fear  
Where no-one hears  
And I've got nothing  
No strength left to watch you fall  
Nothing left at all
