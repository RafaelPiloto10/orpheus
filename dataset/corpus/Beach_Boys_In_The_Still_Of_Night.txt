In the still of the night  
I held you, held you tight  
Cause I love, love you so  
Promise I'll never let you go  
In the still of the night  
  
I remember that night in May  
The stars were bright above  
I'll hope and I'll pray  
To keep your precious love  
Well before the light  
Hold me again with all of your might  
In the still of the night  
  
So before the light  
Hold me again with all of your might  
In the still of the night  
(In the still of the night)  
In the still of the night
