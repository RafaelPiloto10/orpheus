Hey Mister, walkin' with the blues  
Hey Mister, payin' heavy dues  
Havin' troubles, and it ain't so hard to find  
When you're ridin' double, and you're running out of time  
  
No need to feel, that you lack the spirit  
Within the body, but it's in the soul  
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it  
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back  
Need a little taste of love  
  
Hey Mister, tell me how long has it been  
Hey sister, so how could you pretend  
Why keep the sorrow, where it don't belong  
Well come tomorrow, oh help me sing the song  
  
No need to feel, that you lack the spirit  
Within the body, but it's in the soul  
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it  
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back  
Need a little taste of love  
  
Need a little taste of love
