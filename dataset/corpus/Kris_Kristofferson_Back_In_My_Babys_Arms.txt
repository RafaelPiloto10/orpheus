I'm back in my baby's arms again I'm thankful too  
I'm back in my baby's arms again that love is true  
I'm back in my baby's arms again where I should be  
Cause I know where I've been I was lost in sin  
But I'm back in my baby's arms again  
  
Well I hurt her so that I had to hide I would stay away not to face my pride  
But she saw me through to the truth inside  
And I'm back in my baby's arms again with the love that I stole  
I'm back in my baby's arms again God bless her soul  
I'm back in my baby's arms again and I know it's real  
  
I pray the Lord I remember when cause it's better now than it's ever been  
He came back to me like a long lost friend and I'm back in my baby's arms
again  
I'm back in my baby's arms again I'm thankful too...  
I'm back in my baby's arms again
