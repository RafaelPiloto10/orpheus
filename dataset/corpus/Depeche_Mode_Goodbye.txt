It was you that stripped my soul  
And threw it in the fire  
And tamed it in the rapture  
And filled me with desire  
  
Now I'm pure  
Now I'm clean  
I feel good and serene  
In you  
  
There is no denying  
How I have been changed  
You won't hear me crying  
Now misery is strange  
  
I can dream  
I can fly  
Now it seems I get by  
With you  
  
Goodbye, yeah  
Goodbye, again  
  
I was always looking  
Looking for someone  
Someone to stick my hook in  
And pull it out and run  
  
Now I'm caught on your line  
All my thoughts are entwined  
In you  
  
Goodbye, yeah  
Goodbye, again  
  
If you see me walking  
Through the golden gates  
Then turn around stop talking  
Stop and hesitate  
I'll be waiting up there  
With my fate in the air  
For you
