Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink  
Choking with a link, killing with a stink  
Just your mother's, ho  
  
Bleeding in a sink, poisoning a drink  
Burning up, my sweet Clementine  
  
Trampling a shrink, bleeding in a sink  
Hallelujah wink, getting on the brink  
Just your mother's, ho  
  
Hallelujah wink, murdering a shrink  
Burning up, On my sweet revenge  
Will be yours for the taking  
It's in the making baby, ahhhhh  
Ahhhhh, ahhhhhh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh  
  
My sweet revenge  
Will be yours for the taking  
It's in the making baby, ahhhhh  
Ahhhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
