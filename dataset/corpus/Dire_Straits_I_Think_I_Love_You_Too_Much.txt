I'm not alone sitting right there  
How come I get the feeling you'd vanish into the air  
I love you more than anybody else, babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch.  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much  
If I picked you up, oh you'd slip right away  
If I locked you up, you'd find a way to make me pay.  
You're gonna hurt me more than anybody else babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much.  
  
Guess I'm gonna get you what you want  
'Cause I'm so into you  
You don't even give an inch to me baby  
Though I've been giving you a mile or two  
  
I'm not alone sitting right there  
How come I get the feeling you'd vanish into the air  
I love you more than anybody else, babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch.  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much  
If I picked you up, oh you'd slip right away  
If I locked you up, you'd find a way to make me pay.  
You're gonna hurt me more than anybody else babe  
Can't you tell I'm an easy touch  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much.  
  
Baby, baby, I think I love you too much (repeat)
