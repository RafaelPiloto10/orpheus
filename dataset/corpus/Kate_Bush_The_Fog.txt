You see, I'm all grown-up now  
He said  
"Just put your feet down child  
'Cause you're all grown-up now."  
Just like a photograph I pick you up  
Just like a station on the radio  
I pick you up  
Just like a face in the crowd  
I pick you up  
Just like a feeling that you're sending out  
I pick it up  
But I can't let you go  
If I let you go  
You slip into the fog  
  
This love was big enough for the both of us.  
This love of yours,  
Was big enough to be frightened of  
It's deep and dark like the water was  
The day I learned to swim.  
He said "Just put your feet down child  
Just put your feet down child  
The water is only waist high  
I'll let go of you gently  
Then you can swim to me."  
  
Is this love big enough to watch over me  
Big enough to let go of me?  
Without hurting me  
Like the day I learned to swim.  
"'Cause you're all grown-up now  
Just put your feet down child  
The water is only waist high.  
I'll let go of you gently  
Then you can swim to me."
