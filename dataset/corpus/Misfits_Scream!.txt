A chill runs up your spine  
It crawls into your brain  
The freezing touch of fear  
  
It's driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
'Til you... Scream  
  
Scream  
I can't wait to hear you  
I can't wait to hear you  
Scream  
  
It's driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
'Til you... Scream  
  
Scream  
I can't wait to hear you  
I can't wait to hear you  
Scream
