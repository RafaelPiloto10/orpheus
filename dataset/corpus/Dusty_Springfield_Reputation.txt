They're going to want you  
They're going to love you  
They're going to make your dreams come true  
They don't know the real you, but  
They're going to steal you, oh  
They're going to take my dreams away  
Well you tried, you looked for a way  
Of keeping your face, of keeping your face, oh, oh

You leave me to cry again  
(Who cares what they're thinking?) oh, oh  
(Who cares what they're whispering? Whispering, whispering)  
  
You know I won't blame you  
And I won't defame you, oh  
I won't name you in any court of law  
Well you tried, you looked for a way  
Of keeping your face, of keeping your face, oh, oh
