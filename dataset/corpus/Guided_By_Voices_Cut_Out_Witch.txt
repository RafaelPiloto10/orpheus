Do you suppose she could change your life?  
If she could then I wish she would  
Do you suppose she could save my life?  
If she could then I think she should  
  
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch  
Silver threads for our heads need another stitch  
Golden needles in our eyes then we realize  
It's another busy day for the cut out witch  
  
And could she change this wrong into a right?  
Say pretty please and I think she might  
Cause if she won't then you'll fall and bust  
And turn to dust and so I think she must  
  
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch  
Silver threads for our heads need another stitch  
Golden needles in our eyes then we realize  
It's another busy day for the cut-out witch  
  
Do you think she can change your life?  
Do you think she can change your life?  
Do you think she can change your life?
