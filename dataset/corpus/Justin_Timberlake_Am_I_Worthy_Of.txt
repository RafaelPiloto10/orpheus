Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Girl I find you so amazing  
With everyday I learn more about you  
The way you work day out and day in  
And still find time for us too  
  
I love the fact that you're there for me when I feel down  
No matter what I'm going through  
Lately I've been questioning myself  
Am I good enough for you  
  
Am I worthy of  
Am I man enough  
Am I strong enough  
To maintain this love  
You got me questioning  
Got me wondering  
Could I be that man  
That can keep you happy  
  
I know that there'll be times when I'll be miles away  
And you'll be all alone  
I constantly fight my insecurities  
When I can't reach you by phone  
And oh lord knows that I'm only human  
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions  
I know that you truly love me,  
But, fear has me second guessing  
  
Am I worthy of  
Am I man enough  
Am I strong enough  
To maintain this love  
You got me questioning  
Got me wondering  
Could I be that man  
That can keep you happy  
  
Girl, excuse my ways (excuse my ways)  
I'm not trying to push your love away (ooo... Love... Love away)  
It's just that sometimes  
My imagination gets the best of me, yeah  
I still love you baby  
Everyday  
  
Am I worthy of  
Am I man enough  
Am I strong enough  
To maintain this love (to maintain this love)  
You got me questioning  
Got me wondering (you got me thinkin' bout myself)  
Could I be that man (Am I good enough for you)  
That can keep you happy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)  
  
Am I worthy of  
Am I man enough  
Am I strong enough  
To maintain this love  
You got me questioning  
Got me wondering  
Could I be that man  
That can keep you happy  
  
Yeah...  
Yeah, yeah, yeah wanna keep you happy...
