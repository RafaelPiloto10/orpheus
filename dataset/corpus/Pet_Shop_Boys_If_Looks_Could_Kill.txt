What d'you want?  
You've got nothing to say  
And you can't  
Hide that look of dismay  
Why pretend?  
You only want revenge  
It's been said  
I'd be dead  
If looks could kill  
  
Where'd you go  
With that threadbare crowd  
Still in tow?  
Do they appreciate your  
Tales of woe?  
Droning on and on  
Lost your thread?  
I'd be dead  
If looks could kill  
  
You think you're acting  
In self-defense  
But you're fooling no one  
And you never will  
The only crime is irrelevance  
No wonder you're worried  
I'd be dead and buried still  
If looks could kill  
  
Welcome to a unique event  
Where we see what you represent  
Flaunt that look  
Of 'Let battle commence!'  
It changes nothing  
And it never will  
And on that matter of self-defense  
I'm not worried  
I'd be dead and buried still  
If looks could kill  
If looks could kill
