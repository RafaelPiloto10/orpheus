She used to drive a beat up pickup  
Down around San Antone  
Stealin' the heart of every guy in town  
Includin' the one I own  
But this sweet young thing of seventeen  
Would sting you with the lovesick blues  
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin  
Lookin' for someone to use  
She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider  
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago  
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker  
But she can break a heart and take all the love she needs  
Ooh well I heard she got down in beaumont  
And she wound up in El Paso  
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail  
And she could step to the cotton eyed joe  
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy  
I slip in and I get her while you can  
'Cause far too long she'll be good as gone  
And runnin' with another man  
She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider  
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago  
And she's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker  
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs  
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker  
Well she can break a heart and take all the love she needs
