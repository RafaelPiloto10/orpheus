Betcha say that  
Betcha say that  
Betcha say that  
To all the girls  
  
You say you'll be my knight in shining armor  
We'll run away and live a life of glamor  
You say for me you'll be true blue  
  
You say you want me everywhere beside you  
And that you just cannot live without me no  
You say I love you  
  
I betcha say that to all the girls  
Betcha say that  
  
You say you wish I wasn't so defensive  
You try to kiss me but I'm apprehensive  
No, no, I just don't believe you  
  
You say you feel as though you're going crazy  
Your head is spinning and your eyes are hazy  
You say I want you

Betcha say that, betcha say that

I don't believe you  
But I want you anyway  
  
You say you want to fall in love forever  
You'll get place where we can be together  
No more secret rendezvous  
  
You say you're tired of always feelin' lonely  
And that you want me for your one and only  
  
You say I want to marry you
