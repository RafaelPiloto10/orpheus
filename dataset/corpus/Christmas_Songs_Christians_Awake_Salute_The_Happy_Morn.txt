Christians, awake, salute the happy morn  
Whereon the Saviour of the world was born  
Rise to adore the mystery of love  
Which hosts of angels chanted from above  
With them the joyful tidings first begun  
Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son  
  
Then to the watchful shepherds it was told  
Who heard the angelic herald's voice: "Behold,  
I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth  
To you and all the nations upon earth  
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word
