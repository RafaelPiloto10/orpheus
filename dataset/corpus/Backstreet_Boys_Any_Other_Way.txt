[Nick:]  
There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again  
Just when I'm trying to get over you  
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend  
A day without you  
  
[AJ:]  
Now you've carved out a life  
But I wear the scars  
Reminding me by the hour  
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are  
I wish I could but  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't imagine it any other way  
A world without you is only wasted space  
You're gone and I'll always wonder  
Why it can't be any other way  
Any other way  
  
[Brian:]  
Since you drained all the color out of the sky  
How am I supposed to feel?  
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life  
Tell me it's not real  
  
[Repeat Chorus 2x]  
  
[Howie:]  
Like we never had a falling out  
Like the tears had never hit the ground  
Like you're still here  
You're still here  
  
[Brian:]  
Since you drained all the color out of the sky  
  
[Repeat Chorus 2x]
