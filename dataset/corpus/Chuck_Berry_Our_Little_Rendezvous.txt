Hello little Suzie, hello little Suzie  
Can I walk home with, can I walk home with you ?  
To see will your mother and your father  
Let us have a rendezvous  
  
'Cause I want you to be my, be my little loved one  
I will be true to you, to you my love, in every way  
And in our little rendezvous we'll have  
A beautiful wedding day  
  
Then I'll build a spaceship with a heavy payload  
We'll go 'bip-bip-bip' way out in the wide open blue  
Where we can love one another  
In our little rendezvous  
  
We'll take a basket, a short wave radio  
A-tunin' on the record shows all over the whole wide world  
And in our little rendezvous there'll be  
A happy boy and girl  
  
We'll kiss the moon, my love, go around the world  
We'll send a signal back to mom and dad from me and you  
Tell them they'll soon have a grandson  
In our little rendezvous  
  
Bip-bip-bip, bip-bip-bip  
Bip-bip, bip-bip...
