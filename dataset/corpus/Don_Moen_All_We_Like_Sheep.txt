All we like sheep  
Have gone astray  
Each of us turning  
Our own separate way  
We have all sinned and  
Fallen short of Your glory  
But Your glory is  
What we desire to see  
And in Your presence is  
Where we long to be  
  
Taking our sickness  
Taking our pain  
Jesus the sacrifice Lamb  
Has been slain  
He was despised  
Rejected by men  
He took our sin  
Draw us near to you, Father  
Through Jesus Your Son  
Let us worship before You  
Cleansed by Your blood  
  
Chorus  
O Lord show us  
Your mercy and grace  
Take us to Your holy place  
Forgive our sin  
And heal our land  
We long to live  
In Your presence  
Once again
