Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster  
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone  
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story  
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along  
  
No reason to stay  
Oh, when I'm slipping away  
  
Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle  
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end  
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies  
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow  
  
Slipping away  
Slipping away  
Nobody to pay  
Look out, 'cause I'm slipping away  
  
Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection  
A future without a past, no more road to take me back  
Come if you will, just don't question my direction  
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun  
  
Slipping away  
Slipping away  
Got nobody to pay  
And you're slippin' away  
  
No more running in a circle  
It's time to move along  
Round, round, round we go  
A start without an end  
So I'm slipping away  
Slipping away
