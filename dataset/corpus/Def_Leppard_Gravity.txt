Can't sleep at night  
The darkness enslaves me  
I turn out the light  
And no one can save me  
  
So try not to stare 'cause I'm stripped to the bone  
It's a trick of the light and I'm lost  
  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
Insanity inside of me  
It's like I'm wide awake  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Can't recognize, I'm hypnotized  
These feelings can't be fake  
(Can't take it all)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down  
  
I lie to myself  
It don't make it easy  
If somebody else  
Would only believe me  
  
My sweat soaks the sheets and I'm hung out to dry  
It's a trick of the light and I'm lost  
  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
  
Wake up  
Don't try to catch me  
Just let me fall  
Eyes wide shut  
Don't make a sound  
Keep fallin' till I hit the ground  
  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
Insanity inside of me  
It's like I'm wide awake  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Can't recognize, I'm hypnotized  
These feelings can't be fake  
(Can't take it all)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
Insanity inside of me  
It's like I'm wide awake  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Can't recognize, I'm hypnotized  
These feelings can't be fake  
(Can't take it all)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down
