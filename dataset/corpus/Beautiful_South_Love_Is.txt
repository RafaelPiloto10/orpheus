Ooh you care, you really, really care  
From the first 12" I made to the colour of my underwear  
Ooh you know, you really, really know  
Inside, outside in, from head to toe  
  
But where were you in the colder days?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
And where will you be in years to come?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
  
So don't beg and don't plead  
You can't have the heart you made bleed  
You're in love with fame  
So whilst we love, please don't scream my name  
  
You're my friends, my only real friends  
But I'd like to know where you'll be when the party ends  
I remember your face the dance was slow  
"Easy" by The Commodores and you said 'no'  
  
But where were you in colder days?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
And where will you be in years to come?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
  
So here's an invitation to this caring nation  
25 years from now will you come my cremation  
Sherry or beer, family and friends  
Will you be there? Will you be there?  
No fame, no fortune, no name in lights  
Will you be there? Will you be there?
