I'm a fool to want you  
I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true  
A love that's there for others too  
  
I'm a fool to hold you  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone  
To share a kiss the devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
Then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I'd have to say  
  
I'm a fool to want you  
Pity me, I need you  
I know it's wrong  
It must be wrong  
  
But right or wrong  
I can't get along  
Without you  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
Then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I'd have to say  
  
I'm a fool to want you  
Pity me, I need you  
I know it's wrong  
It must be wrong  
  
But right or wrong  
I can't get along  
Without you
