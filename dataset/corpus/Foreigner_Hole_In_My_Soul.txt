I can feel these four walls around me  
I can feel them closing in on me  
But I know there's someone out there  
Ready and waiting  
For the chance to set me free  
  
I don't want nothing  
Ain't looking for no one  
You walk into my life  
Well I ain't no hopeless romantic  
I've gotta listen to my cautious heart  
I've been dealing with my illusions of love  
I built it up and then I tear it apart  
  
And I feel this rising suspicion  
That my heart will ever rule my mind  
Well I'm guilty of love  
By my own admission  
Come on girl let me do my time  
  
Hey, when I call you  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, when I fall through  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
  
Don't need no sisters of mercy  
They set me off like a loaded gun  
Ain't nothing in this world possessing me  
Honey you're the only one  
  
Can't live in this empty sadness  
It's more than we can endure  
Well wise men say  
That love is madness  
Come on girl I say that love is the cure  
  
Hey, when I call you  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, when I fall through  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, without you  
I will fall through the hole in my soul  
  
Hey, when I call you  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, when I fall through  
I need to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, without you  
I will fall through the hole in my soul  
  
Hey, I need you  
I need you to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, I want you to fill the hole in my soul  
Hey, hey, hey, I need you to fill the hole in my soul
