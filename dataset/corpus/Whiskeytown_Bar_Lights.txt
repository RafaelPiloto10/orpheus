The bar lights and the liquor  
And the way all the bottles they shine  
  
Well I got five more dollars, drink another  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
  
The bar lights and the women  
The empty pool hall and you and I  
  
Well I got five more dollars, drink another  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
You'll feel fine  
  
Write your name down on a matchbook sleeve  
Call me up on Sunday for a drink  
Call me up on Sunday tell me anything  
  
The bar lights and the liquor  
The way all the bottles they shine  
  
Well I've got five more dollars that wont make you mine  
That won't make you mine  
That won't make you mine
