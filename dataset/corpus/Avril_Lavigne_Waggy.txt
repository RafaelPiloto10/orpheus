Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror  
As I drive away  
Wishing that I could take back all those words  
That meant nothing that I didn't say  
  
I'm trying  
To be what you want me to be  
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part  
Of the fool, week after week  
  
I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)  
You say you want someone to call your own  
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride  
You can live your life all on your own  
  
Is this all going to be just another time  
That we play this game?  
I've tried to convince you that things could be different  
But somehow they end up the same  
  
But what  
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?  
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost  
Well, I do, too  
  
I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)  
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when  
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side  
I'll just jack off in my room until then  
  
It's never over 'til it's done  
And I don't think that you're the one  
It's never over 'til it's done  
And I don't think that you're the one
