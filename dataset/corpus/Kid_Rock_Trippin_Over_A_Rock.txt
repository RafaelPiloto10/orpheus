People like the way my style is rollin'  
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin'  
I'm not bullshittin'  
Here's how I'm hittin'  
  
Funkin' it up more than George Clinton  
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format  
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that  
I live press the best I won't rest the pest(?)  
  
'Cause I'm blessed and I jus won't settle for less  
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up  
The one with the hair that stands straight up  
People look and stare in shock  
  
Trippin' over a Rock  
Trippin' over a Rock  
  
Chased,and chased and chased but never close to caught  
And the skills I filled were all self taught  
With so many styles on each panfulls(?)  
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels  
  
As the girls admire the way I aspire  
To move piles of dough in my own empire  
Not a liar, I tell no lies  
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes  
  
But don't get me wrong I get wicked  
Shake that ass in my face and ill stick it  
Hit it get wit it  
Knock it out the box  
  
Trippin' over a rock  
Trippin' over a rock  
  
A genuine badman  
Like Yosemite Sam man  
I see-see-see-can rock the land  
And bring a new swing and sensation  
  
To represent the next generation  
So slack up You better back up  
Here comes the score and the weed in a jigsaw  
Fuck with me  
  
With no doubt  
Ill put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out  
Ill go deep in I won't weaken  
Guaranteed to keep the house beepin'  
  
Girls rockin' guys  
Try to to cockblock(?)  
  
Trippin over a rock
