[Verse 1]  
Come back baby, come back to me  
I'll be in my sundress watching TV  
I've been missing you, have you been missing me?  
Thinking 'bout your loving, 'bout your loving, sweet, sweet  
  
[Verse 2]  
Come back sugey, come back to me  
Fix me up a mixed drink, Bacardi  
I'll put on your favourite dress and we'll party  
Take a drive, kiss, kiss by the sea  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You don't have to say  
That I'm the girl that got away  
  
[Chorus]  
I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot  
Sucking on my lollipops  
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music  
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot  
Smoking all my cigarettes  
Missing what we used to got  
You-you-you kid  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Won't you come home to me now babe?  
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground  
Won't you come home to me now babe?  
I'm strong, babydoll, but I want you around  
  
[Verse 3]  
Come back honey, don't be so mean  
Come back to your trailer, come see your queen  
You been missing out, pea-peaches and cream  
Dreaming 'bout your dolly, sweet dolly, dream, dream  
  
[Verse 4]  
You bad baby, dumb as can be  
Who could you find be-be-better than me?  
I've been missing you, you been missing me  
Thinking 'bout your sugar sweet ca-candy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You don't have to say  
That I'm the girl that got away  
  
[Chorus]  
I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot  
Sucking on my lollipops  
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music  
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot  
Smoking all my cigarettes  
Missing what we used to got  
You-you-you kid  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Won't you come home to me now babe?  
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground  
Won't you come home to me now babe?  
I'm strong, babydoll, but I want you around  
  
[Breakdown]  
Come on over pretty baby  
What you make your mommy crazy  
Come on over pretty baby  
What you make your mommy crazy  
  
[Bridge]  
I want my cake and I wanna eat it too  
I wanna be friends, be in love with you  
Go out on weekends, party it up, boo  
Back the way it was, a summer of love  
  
[Chorus]  
I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot  
Sucking on my lollipops  
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music  
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot  
Smoking all my cigarettes  
Missing what we used to got  
You-you-you kid  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Won't you come home to me now babe?  
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground  
Won't you come home to me now babe?  
I'm strong, babydoll, but I want you around
