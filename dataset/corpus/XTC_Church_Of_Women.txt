A lie for a lie, but a truth for the truth  
  
Church of women is made out of milk  
which their love turns to butter -er -er  
Church of women will have you give praise  
with a laugh, bark and stutter -er -er  
Like us men like us men they are nothing like us men  
Men have gargoyles 'round their hearts  
I'm on my knees but dancing  
  
Want to worship at the church of women  
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
  
Church of women is making donations of loving and giving -ing -ing  
Church of women performing that miracle raising the living -ing -ing  
Like us men like us men will they ever like us men?  
Men have thorns around their minds  
I'm on my mountain preaching  
  
Want to worship at the church of women  
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
  
Lie for a lie, but a truth for the truth  
Give 'em back their house: the walls, the doors, the floors and roof  
And stop tryin' to diet on the wafers and wine and submit we're in control  
Now let's put things right  
Let's multiply the loves and kisses  
'Til we have enough to love and eat forever  
  
Want to worship at the church of women  
I want to worship at the church of women now  
Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around  
I'll breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning 'round  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
Want to worship at the church of women  
(Repeat X3 and fade)
