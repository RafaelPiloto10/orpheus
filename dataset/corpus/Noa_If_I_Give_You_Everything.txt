If I give you everything  
Will you open your heart and let me in  
If I give you everything  
Throwing my soul against the wind  
Would you let me sing  
My inside out  
All the love within,  
If I give you everything  
If I give you everything  
  
If I give you everything  
All of my dreams and hidden fear  
If I give you everything  
My craziest laugh and saddest tear  
Would your feelings grow  
The more you know  
Would they disappear  
If I give you everything  
If I give you everything  
  
She stares at the mirror  
She's seen that face so many times before,  
She knows every line, every pore,  
Poor souls been tattered,  
She's been round and round but still some how,  
You hear her say...  
  
If I give you everything  
Will you open your heart and let me in  
If I give you everything  
Throwing my soul against the wind  
Would you let me sing  
My inside out  
All the love within,  
If I give you everything  
If I give you everything...
