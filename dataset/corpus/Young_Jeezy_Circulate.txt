See I'm a' start off so slow yeah I said so slow  
They love me out in D.C. just like gogo  
I said gogo yeah I said gogo  
See them right with Don Cannon it's a gogo  
See I want my song like Cocoa  
I like to heat mine up like Cocoa  
See dem eight seven Jeans see the logo  
Every time a day, count em' baby gogo  
  
You know how the drop be everything slow  
You know how the drop be anything goes  
Remember back then when I got the snow low  
And I was in and out of state just like Romo  
  
Lookin' out for them boys no homo  
Can't tell em what your drivin' that a no no  
I'm gonna tell you this but keep it on the low low  
If it's number two then we might be the popo  
  
Things are gettin' higher  
Makes it hard on the buyers  
Sun is all around  
Sun rise  
Sun rise  
  
Push up till we grind  
  
Rent bein' paid late
