They got nothing on me anymore,  
They got nothing on you  
I don't care what they say anymore,  
All I want is the truth  
  
I don't feel  
To unveil,  
Here's a song,  
Sing along  
  
They got nothing from me anymore,  
I got nothing from you  
I don't care what they say anymore,  
All I want is the truth  
  
I don't feel  
To unveil,  
Here's a song,  
Sing along  
Watch my style,  
Pick a place,  
Wipe the smile  
From your face  
  
I don't feel  
To unveil,  
Here's a song,  
Sing along  
Watch my style,  
Pick a place,  
Wipe the smile  
From your face  
  
They got nothing on me anymore,  
They got nothing on you  
I don't care what they say anymore,  
All I want is the truth
