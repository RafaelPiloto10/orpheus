I went to bed too late  
and got up too soon  
My poor head still spinnin'  
from too much booze  
  
I got a foot in the gutter  
A foot in the grave  
I ain't seen home  
In the last three days  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh my god look what the cat dragged in  
Livin' my life sin after sin  
Night rolls up and I do it again  
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in  
  
No tell, motel, hotel bed  
If it wasn't for the sunlight I'd swear I was dead  
  
I got a girl on the left of me  
a girl on the right  
I know damn well I slept with both last night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm late for work on Monday  
and my boss is bitchin'  
Can't get out of be  
'Cause my head's still spinnin'  
  
My hair's in a rat's nest  
I look like hell  
Half alive or half dead,  
I just can't tell  
  
[Chorus]
