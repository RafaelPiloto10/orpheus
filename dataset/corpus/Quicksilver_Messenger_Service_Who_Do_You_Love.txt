I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire,  
I got a cobra snake for a necktie,  
I got a brand new house by the road side,  
Made out of rattlesnake hide.  
I got me a chimney made on top,  
Made from a human skull,  
Now come on, take a little walk with me,  
Now who do you love?  
Come on Arlene, take me by the hand,  
Let me know you understand,  
Who do you love? ...  
Ride nine times on the midnight train  
Through the fire and cold rain,  
Who do you love? ...  
I've got a tombstone hand in a graveyard mine,  
Just twenty-two and I don't mind dying,  
Who do you love? ...
