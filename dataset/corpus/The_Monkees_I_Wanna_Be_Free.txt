I wanna be free,  
Like the bluebirds flying by me,  
Like the waves out on the blue sea,  
If your love has to tie me,  
Don't try me, say good-bye.  
I wanna be free,  
Don't say you love me, say you like me  
But when I need you beside me,  
Stay close enough to guide me,  
Confide in me, whoa-oh-oh.  
I wanna hold your hand,  
Walk along the sand,  
Laughing in the sun,  
Always having fun.  
Doing all those things  
Without any strings to tie me down.  
I wanna be free,  
Like the warm September wind, babe,  
Say you'll always be my friend, babe,  
We can make it to the end, babe,  
Again, babe, I've gotta say...  
I wanna be free,  
I wanna be free,  
I wanna be free.
