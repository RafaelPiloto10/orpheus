Heartbeat  
I can't see you  
Heartbeat  
I can hear you  
I feel you pumping just beyond my door  
I know exactly  
What you've crawled here for  
Cringe down lower  
You're all dressed in grey  
Me, I'm still breathing  
It's just not your day  
  
I hear you whisper like an open grave  
O.D. Receiver, I am all you crave  
You're dying, crying, I can hear you fall  
Your bony fingers scratching on my wall  
  
O.D. Receiver  
  
I hear you screaming, well at least you try  
Me, I'm still smiling but I don't know why  
I'd call a doctor if I had the time  
But I'm so busy with this fix of mine  
  
O.D. Receiver...
