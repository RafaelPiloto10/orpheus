Skull rings  
Fast cars  
Hot chicks  
Fancy things  
  
The touch of a hand in the wasteland  
You're walking asleep and dreaming cheap  
A bird's wing don't beat for free  
You're freezing cold and your family

Fingers on fire to do what's bad  
Ring on the finger is a skull man  
Strong as a bar of steel  
Weakness is that you can't feel

My life is dirtied, my mind is loaded  
I'm feeling and breathing and fighting  
To see  
People get ready now  
Baby come on give your heart to me
