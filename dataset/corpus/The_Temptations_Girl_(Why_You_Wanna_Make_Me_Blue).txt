I love you girl, with all my heart and soul  
I can't understand why you treat me cold  
Your every wish, girl, is my command  
And that's why I can't seem to understand why  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue  
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue  
  
One day you say you love me too  
The next day you tell me that we are through  
My love for you is just a game  
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Oh)  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (So blue)  
  
Woo girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Make me blue)  
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl tell me why can't you be true (Can't be true)  
The way you treat me it just isn't fair  
You make it so plain you just don't care  
You have a ball around my time.  
Sleepless nights are getting me tired  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue  
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Baby)  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue
