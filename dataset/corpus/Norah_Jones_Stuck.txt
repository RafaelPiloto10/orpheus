You shove your way  
Through the room from the street  
And finally to me  
You ask me what I'm drinking  
  
My friend Johnny  
Tugging on my sleeve  
Asks if I wanna leave  
But what I'm really thinking is  
  
Why can't it be easy  
Easy  
Why don't you leave  
Leave me  
Leave me be  
I can see you swaying  
I can't hear what you're saying  
  
I'm sitting here stuck  
And plastered to my seat  
I think up a reason to leave  
When you finally stop speaking  
I'll take a long slow  
Walk down Washington Street  
Half asleep on my feet  
Half aware if I'm dreaming  
  
I'll go home alone  
A sinking stone  
A switched off telephone  
I'll go on and be free  
A frozen breeze  
A fallen down factory  
But I still see you swaying  
And I can't hear what you're saying  
  
I just lost the plot  
Got a little caught  
In a little knot  
I just hit a wall  
Had a little fall  
Felt the swinging wrecking ball  
  
And why should that be  
Why don't you tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
I'm sure you'll tell me  
Why don't you tell me  
I guess you'll tell me  
Tell me
