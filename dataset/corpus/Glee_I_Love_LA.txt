Will:  
Hate New York City  
It's cold and it's damp  
And all the people dressed like monkeys  
Let's leave Chicago to the Eskimos  
That town's a little bit too rugged  
For you and me, bad girl  
  
Blaine:  
Rollin' down Imperial Highway  
With a big nasty redhead at my side  
  
Artie:  
Santa Ana winds blowin' hot from the north  
And we was born to ride  
  
Will:  
Roll down the window, put down the top  
Crank up the Beach Boys, baby  
Don't let the music stop  
We're gonna ride it 'til we just can't ride it no more  
  
Blaine:  
From the South Bay to the Valley  
From the West Side to the East Side  
  
Blaine with Artie:  
Everybody's very happy  
'Cause the sun is shining all the time

Look at those trees

He's down on his knees

There ain't nothin' like em nowhere
