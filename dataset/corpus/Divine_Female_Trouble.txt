[Chorus]:  
I got lots of problems  
Female Trouble  
Maybe I'm twisted  
Female Trouble  
  
They say I'm insane  
But I don't care  
Go ahead, put me  
In your electric chair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, spare me your morals  
Look, everyone dies  
What please me  
Is hom-homicide!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oink! Oink! Oink! Oink!  
  
I'm berserk  
I like it fine  
As long as I'm  
Grabbing headlines  
  
Ah ha ha Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]
