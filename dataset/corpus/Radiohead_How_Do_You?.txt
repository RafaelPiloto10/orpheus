He's bitter and twisted, he knows what he wants.  
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong.  
He wants you to listen, he wants us to weep.  
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak.  
  
But how do you?  
How do you?  
How do you?  
  
He lives with his mother, but we show him respect.  
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget.  
And he's just like his daddy, 'cause he cheats on his friends.  
And he steals and he bullies, any way that he can.  
  
But how do you?  
How do you?  
How do you
