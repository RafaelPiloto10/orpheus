I hear voices inside my head  
All of them just want to talk to you  
I can feel your imagination  
Runnin' wild deep inside you know it's true  
This won't be a test of your religion  
You won't have to bang the bedroom walls  
Can you really hold and keep a secret  
I'll be right here anytime at all  
  
Anytime you want to call, call  
Anytime you want to come, come over  
Anytime you want to come, call  
Anytime you want to call, come over  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Well no one thinks that love lasts forever  
More than just a lonely day and night  
Never thought about the perfect answer  
But I've got a place where you can hide  
I can feel your lips all around me  
A wet kiss waitin' to explode  
  
Anytime you want to call, call  
Anytime you want to come, come over  
Anytime you want to come, call  
Anytime you want to call, come over  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
Everyone inside my head wants to talk to you  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
'Cause I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
Everyone inside my head wants to talk to you  
I can't eat I can't sleep  
Gotta leave nowhere to go  
Hidin' out oh no it's what I want  
Whatcha gonna do now  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love
