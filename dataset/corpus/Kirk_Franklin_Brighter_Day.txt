When I close my eyes and think of you  
And reminisce on all the things you do  
I can't imagine my life without you  
It's like paradise now I know that it's real (um)  
It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me  
What you did on calvary  
Makes me wann love you more  
  
[Chorus]  
I never knew I could be so happy  
And I never knew I'd be so secure because of your love  
Life has brand new meaning  
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day  
  
Never thought that I would smile again  
I never thought the dark clouds would end  
Never thought the dark clouds would end  
Never thought that I could have a friend  
That would keep me never leave me alone (um)  
Jesus you're my everything  
The only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)  
Now I know what real love means  
It's everlasting, lasting.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing can compare to the joy ya bring an ever lasting love affair  
Jesus my life will never will be same I found someone who truly cares  
  
[Chorus]
