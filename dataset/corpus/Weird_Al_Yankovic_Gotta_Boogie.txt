Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off  
  
Well, I went out to a party just the other night  
I was jammin' to the music, I was feelin' alright  
I was burning up the floor like a disco maniac  
When my woman said, "Baby, why's your hand behind you back?"  
  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
I said boogie (gotta boogie)  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off  
  
I can't pick it off (uh uh)  
I can't flick it off (uh uh)  
I sure ain't gonna lick it off (oh no)  
So I guess I'm gonna have to learn to live with it  
  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off  
  
(boogie)  
Gotta boogie  
(boogie)  
  
Hey, you want to boogie? (No man, I don't want to boogie)  
Want to boogie? (Get that boogie out of my face)  
Do any of you want to boogie? (No!)  
  
Gotta boogie on my finger  
Gotta boogie on my finger  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off
