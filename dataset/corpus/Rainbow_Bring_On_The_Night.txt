I was taking a chance on a tight-rope  
Walking the line to the end  
I was ready to fall had my back to the wall  
But I'm flying again...  
I been shifting my gears. I been moving  
Cause they wanted me dead or alive  
But I'm making a break and I want you to take a ride  
Take a ride -  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away  
  
When the sun hits another horizon...  
And the joker has started to deal...  
You can quit if you choose but there's nothing to lose  
By a spin of the wheel  
Gotta burn all your bridges behind you, they'll keep dragging  
You down if you stay...  
And I know I ain't wrong cause I'm free and I'm on my way  
On my way...  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away  
  
I live on the edge of tomorrow  
I'm racing along on the wind  
I can see what I need, you better believe  
I'm playin' to win  
I got nothin' to fear when I'm flyin...  
Cause yesterday's over and gone  
And there's nothin' I can do... So I gotta keep movin' on..  
Movin' on -  
Movin' on -  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away... Take you away  
Bring on the night  
"dream chaser"  
  
Repeat till fade
