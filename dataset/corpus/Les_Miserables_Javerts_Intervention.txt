[Javert and constables break up the fight.  
Valjean picks himself up and looks for Cosette, who is with Marius.]  
  
Javert  
Another brawl in the square  
Another stink in the air!  
Was there a witness to this?  
Well, let him speak to Javert!  
M'sieur, the streets are not safe,  
But let these vermin beware  
We'll see that justice is done!  
  
Look upon this fine collection  
Crawled from underneath a stone  
This swarm of worms and maggots  
Could have picked you to the bone!  
I know this man over here  
I know his name and his trade  
And on your witness, M'sieur,  
We'll see him suitably paid.  
  
[Valjean and Cosette have disappeared.]  
  
But where's the gentleman gone?  
And why on earth did he run?  
  
Thenardier  
You will have a job to catch him  
He's the one you should arrest  
No more bourgeois when you scratch him  
Than that brand upon his chest!  
  
[The constables search for Valjean.]  
  
Javert  
Could it be he's some old jailbird  
That the tide now washes in  
Heard my name and started running  
Had the brand upon his skin  
And the girl who stood beside him  
When I turned they both had gone  
Could he be the man I've hunted?  
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?  
  
Thenardier  
In the absence of a victim,  
Dear Inspector, may I go?  
And remember when you've nicked him,  
It was me who told you so!  
  
Javert  
Let the old man keep on running  
I will run him off his feet!  
  
Everyone about your business  
Clear this garbage off the street!
