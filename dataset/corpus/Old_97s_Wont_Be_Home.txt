You're a bottle cap away  
From pushing me too far  
Well the problem's gettin' big  
An empty compact car  
So I won't feel so bad  
I did all I could do  
Now I'm on wounded knee  
And we're at Waterloo  
So please get out of my car  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was "I won't be home no more"  
  
You're a rattle trap tonight  
My ears are gettin' tired  
So listen for awhile  
Before this thing expired  
Oh it was bound to fail  
All because of where I'm from  
Now the moon's at four o'clock  
And it's high time kingdom come  
So please get out, of my car  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was "I won't be home no more"  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was "I won't be home no more"
