Ever felt away with me  
Just once that all I need  
Entwined in finding you one day  
Ever felt away without me  
My love, it lies so deep  
Ever dream of me  
  
Would you do it with me  
Heal the scars and change the stars  
Would you do it for me  
Turn loose the heaven within  
  
I'd take you away  
Castaway on a lonely day  
Bosom for a teary cheek  
My song can but borrow your grace  
  
Ever felt away  
  
Come out, come out wherever you are  
So lost in your sea  
Give in, give in for my touch  
For my taste for my lust  
  
Ever felt away  
  
Your beauty cascaded on me  
In this white night fantasy  
  
Ever felt away
