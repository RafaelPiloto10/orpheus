Summer,  
Not a bit of breeze,  
Neon signs are shining,  
Through the tired trees,  
Lovers,  
Walking to and fro,  
Everyone has someone,  
And a place to go  
Now listen,  
Hear the cars go past,  
They don't even see me,  
Flying by so fast,  
Moving,  
Going who knows where,  
Only thing I know is,  
I'm not going there  
Where do you go,  
When you feel that your brain is on fire,  
Where do you go when you don't even know  
What it is you desire,  
Listen  
Laughter everywhere,  
Hear it  
Life is in the air,  
As the night comes  
And the town awaits,  
Sound o' children calling  
And the squeal of brakes,  
Music  
But a lonely sound  
When you can't help wond'ring  
Where do I belong
