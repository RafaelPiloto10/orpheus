Your love means more to me than  
All the apples hanging on a tree and  
Like those apples, our love will grow because I,  
I love you.  
  
Your love means more to me than  
All the fishes swimming in the sea and  
Like those fishes, my heart begins to swim because I,  
I love you.  
  
I love you, I want you for my own.  
I need you near to me  
More than anyone could ever know.  
  
Your love means more to me than  
All the loves I've ever had before, so,  
Please believe what I say because I -  
I love you  
  
I love you  
  
I love you, I want you for my own.  
I need you so much more,  
More than anyone could ever know.  
  
Everyone knows one and one makes two,  
I'm the one and the other one's you, so,  
Let's get together and you will see how much I,  
I love you  
Let's get together and you will see how much I,  
I love you
