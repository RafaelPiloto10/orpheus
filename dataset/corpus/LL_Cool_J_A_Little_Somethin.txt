Here we go, another funky style  
Peace to my brothers on "Rikers' Isle"  
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile  
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild  
This here part is like section one  
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns  
Early mornin' light is yet to come  
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun  
Females, let your hair down  
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown  
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz  
You give me to the "sploshers", you can get your-a blast  
Enter at your own risk, some brothers got weapons  
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied  
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone  
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop  
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop  
Dosey-do your partner all night long  
And all you mothers, bring your kids along  
  
[Chorus]  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) Huh, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) (just kick a little somethin')  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough to overcome this  
Funky-like type of stuff  
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff  
Oh, my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs  
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover  
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver  
Don't stop till you get it on  
With ya head B-boppin' like a bouncy ball  
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall  
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all  
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static  
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic  
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it  
Here we go, hand over the cash yo  
What chime? Hey yo, blast the Tabasco  
Work your body like a dime, oh no  
Do the freaky-deaky, the whole girls' cargo  
Females on the side, we gotta win 'em, yeah  
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah  
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber  
Makes me sick like an earthquake  
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make  
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house  
Must be eatin' hardy  
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya  
And clinically proven, damn!  
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz  
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound  
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound  
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down  
Put ya body in the lost and found  
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down  
What you see is what you get  
And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?  
Down-home monkey, corn fed, original  
And what you do is up to you, the individual  
This is the place to be for why'all underage brothers  
With the rebel mentality  
Sweet young freaks sayin' "Rock me ?Arma-day-us?  
Skin so smooth lookin' all ?  
Video to video, tape to tape  
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate  
Party is packed like a rich mans' fridge  
Too many people in the crib  
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy  
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady  
Ain't nothin' here petty  
Trip down to your laund-a-ray, I'm ready!  
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force  
And get jaws off, no matter what the cost  
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove  
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes  
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove  
I know the Marley remix to make you move  
  
[Chorus]
