(What they want?)they want that young shit  
That dumb shit that where you from shit  
That ride around your hood all day with your gun shit  
All I got to my name is two bricks and one felony  
Your going back to jail that's what my conscious keep on telling me  
I really ain't buying all this bullshit they selling me  
When the government throwing more curves than the letter C  
I said the letter C I guess that's for correctional  
They try to box me in, sit me still like a vegetable  
  
[Chorus]  
God damn another trap I think bush trying to punish us  
Sending little messages out to each and every one of us  
Real g shit well that's really unheard of  
When you get more time for selling dope than murder  
In this crazy world  
This world keeps spinning my rims still spinning  
Even though the money slow we still spinning  
In this crazy world  
Let this world keep turning yeah my blunts still burning  
Same thing different day still burning  
In this crazy world and this dopes still selling  
And these niggas still telling  
When you make it through the day its no talent  
In this crazy world (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
In this crazy world  
  
When I was fourteen I turned nothing to a quarter meal  
Probably why I never give a fuck about a record deal  
And I ain't never tried the shit imagine how that white feel  
But that don't even matter though trying to pay the light bill,  
Light bill, phone bill plus my granted nerve bills  
Feel like I should be taking off imagine how my nerves feel  
I want a new Bentley my aunty need a kidney  
And if I let her pass her children never will forgive me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't a x box so why you niggas trying to play with me  
I really be the streets so what you niggas got to say to me  
Cant be much cant be much (why?) cause I ain't listening  
I just left the hood and ill be damned if they ain't filling them want to see
me fall off guess that just the way it be  
Old school triple beam them usually that the way it be  
And plus I got a driver that get them things from a to b  
Soon as you get your money right they hit you with conspiracy  
  
[Chorus]
