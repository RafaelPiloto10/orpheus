You don't look but you kick me  
You can't feel but you hit me  
You can't deal with the way I pray  
Why do we all have to look this way  
I gotta heart I got blood feel pain  
  
Time, time is not on my side -'Cause the way I am  
Gotta gotta find gotta find the reason why A woman ain't a man  
  
You don't look but you kick me  
You can't feel but you hit me  
You can't deal with the way I pray  
Why do you all have to think this way  
I gotta heart I got blood feel pain  
  
Fall in those single file lines like Army Ants  
Yeah fall into those single file lines and complete the plan  
  
You don't look but you kick me  
You can't feel but you hit me  
You can't deal with the way I pray  
Why do we all have to think this way  
I gotta heart I got blood feel pain  
  
You don't look but you kick me  
You can't deal with the way I pray
