Here from the kings mountain view  
Here from the wild dream come true  
Feast like a sultan I do  
On treasures and flesh never few  
  
But I, I would wish it all away  
If I thought I'd lose you just one day  
  
The devil and his had me down  
In love with the dark side I've found  
Dabbling all the way down  
Up to my neck soon to drown  
  
But you changed all that for me  
Lifted me up turned me round  
  
So I, I, I, I,  
I would, I would, I would  
Wish this all away  
  
Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn  
Begged like a hooker all night long  
Tempted the devil with my song  
And got what I wanted all along  
  
But I, I would, if I could, I would  
Wish it away  
Wish it away  
Wish it all away  
Wanna wish it all away  
  
No pressure could hold sway  
Or justify my kneeling away my center  
  
So if I could I'd wish it all away  
If I thought tomorrow they'd take you away  
You're my piece of mind, my all  
I said, I'm just trying to hold on one more day  
  
Damn my eyes, damn my eyes  
Damn my eyes if they should compromise our fulcrum  
What you need divides me then  
I might as well be gone  
  
Shine on forever  
Shine on benevolent sun  
Shine down upon the broken  
Shine until the two become one  
Shine on forever  
Shine on benevolent sun  
Shine on upon the severed  
Shine until the two become one  
Divided, I'm withering away  
Divided, I'm withering away  
Shine on upon the many, light our way  
Benevolent sun  
  
Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
Breathe in union  
So as one survive  
Another the day and season  
Silence, leech, and save your poison  
Silence, leech, and stay out of my way
