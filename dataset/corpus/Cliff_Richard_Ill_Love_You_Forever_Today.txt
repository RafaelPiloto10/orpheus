Love is being friends, she says  
Going on and on she says  
True love never ends, she says  
I don't believe a word  
She says, I don't believe a word  
  
Love is now for me, I say  
True love needn't come to stay  
It can come and slip away  
Believe me when I say  
That love is strictly for today  
  
Love is many things to many people  
I just know what it means to me  
Love is tie me down to many people  
For me, if its right, then its got to be free  
  
I can't look ahead to say  
Tomorrow Ill still feel this way  
Who knows what games we both might play?  
But this I'm gonna say Ill love you forever Today  
  
On and on today, Never ending today  
I'll love you forever today
