I like your wooden door, baby  
I never want to leave, baby  
If I could rule the night, baby  
I'd turn it into white  
There wouldn't ?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm getting high on you  
I'm getting high on you  
I'm getting high on you  
High on you  
  
I like your rugged cross, baby  
I don't pray in churches, baby  
I got nowhere to worship, baby  
Because it isn't him  
I don't need a ? man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Terrorist in my heart  
Tearin' it all apart  
Terrorist in my heart  
Tearin' it all apart  
  
I love the way you feel, baby  
The mornin' startin' drunk, baby  
Drinking of your soul, baby  
And everything I know  
Digs the way your body glows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm getting high on you  
I'm getting high on you  
I'm getting high on you  
I'm getting high  
  
Corrupting in the air  
I really need you  
You got two play rides  
I really love them  
My we're getting high  
Are we getting high
