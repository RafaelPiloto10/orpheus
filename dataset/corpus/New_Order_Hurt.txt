(One, two, three, four)  
I am for you can enjoy I can give you  
(Give me, give me, give me)  
It's a time we love to hate, I can give you  
  
I am for you will enjoy I can give you  
(Give me, give me, give me)  
This is the time you'd love to hate, I will take you  
  
I'm quite determined and there will be  
No more mistakes, no more talking  
I'll bet you hate this  
  
Oh, I am for you will enjoy, I can take you  
(Give me, give me, give me)  
This is the law and you...  
  
I'm quite determined and there will be  
No more mistakes like the last one
