Wanna be there just in time  
Wanna be your shining knight  
Protect you like a soldier  
  
I wanna be the first in line  
Be the one to save your life  
All I wanna do is hold you  
  
But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside  
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies  
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe...oh oh oh  
  
I will be your soldier  
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over  
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
  
You don't have to hide your scars  
I'll be there when you fall apart  
And fix you like a soldier  
  
You don't have to go to far  
Baby just lay down your arms  
Now that the battle's over  
  
But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside  
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies  
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe, oh oh oh  
  
I will be your soldier  
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over  
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
  
Somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside  
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies  
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe!  
  
I will be your soldier (I will ooh)  
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over (ooh yeah)  
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know!)  
You know I will always be your soldier (soldier)  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder (heart is getting colder)  
You know I will always be your soldier (soldier, soldier)  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh (I will be your soldier, oh yeah)  
And if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know)  
You know I will always be your soldier
