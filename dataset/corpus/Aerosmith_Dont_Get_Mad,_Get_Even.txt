Mmm.....  
I'll tell ya little secret  
Make you wanna jump and shout  
When you talk to me in circles  
Take your foot out of your mouth  
It's hard enough to make it  
When you're livin' on the street  
And you want to tell somebody  
But you got to be discreet  
Then you catch your girlfriend  
With her skirt hiked up to here  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
Say the times they be a-changing  
Though the blind lead the blind  
And you know your head is empty  
Though there's something on your mind  
Shackin' up with Lucy and when the morning comes  
You're with sally in the ally  
And the junkies and the bums  
You wonder why your girlfriend  
Has her skirt hiked up to here  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
(till I can see the white o'  
Your eyes, baby...just wait till i...  
I'm gonna fuck up, mm hmm, I'm gonna kick ass  
You just wait to see what I've got in store...)  
Roll the dice get lucky  
'Cause they roll ya for a dime  
You got nothing else to lose  
If ya only loose your mind  
When pleasure that is shallow  
Causes trouble to be deep  
You've been dusted with the devil  
While he sweeps you off your feet  
Huh,  
Tell you little secret  
Make you want to jump and shout  
When you talk to me in circles  
Take your foot out of your mouth  
It's hard enough to make it  
When you're livin' on the street  
And you hate to be a wise guy  
When your feet are in concrete  
Sleeping with the dogs  
And you wake up with the fleas  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
Uh, uh, uh...
