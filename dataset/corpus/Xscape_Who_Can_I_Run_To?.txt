Verse One:  
(LaTocha):  
As I stand here contemplating,  
On the right thing to decide.  
Will I take the wrong direction,  
All my life, where will I go,  
What lies ahead of me?  
(Tamika):  
I have strong determination,  
And I'm not afraid of change.  
I have yet to find that someone,  
Who would care to satisfy me,  
To stay right by me.  
  
Chorus:  
Who can I run to,  
To share this empty space?  
Who can I run to,  
When I need love?  
Who can I run to,  
To fill this empty space with laughter?  
Who can I run to,  
When I need love?  
  
Verse Two:  
(Tiny):  
And my mind is so confusing,  
Who would be that special one?  
Everyday I'm trying to find you,  
All along, I've got to know,  
Is there a place for me?  
(LaTocha):  
I know love has many names,  
And a message very clear.  
All it takes is time and patience,  
To bring you near,  
But look at me, tell me  
  
Repeat Chorus
