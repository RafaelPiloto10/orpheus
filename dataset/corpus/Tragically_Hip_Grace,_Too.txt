He said I'm fabulously rich  
C'mon just let's go  
She kinda bit her lip  
Geez, I don't know  
But I can guarantee  
There'll be no knock on the door  
I'm total pro that's what I'm here for  
I come from downtown  
Born ready for you  
Armed with will and determination  
And grace, too  
  
The secret rules of engagement  
Are hard to endorse  
When the appearance of conflict  
Meets the appearance of force  
But I can guarantee  
There'll be no knock on the door  
I'm total pro  
That's what I'm here for  
I come from downtown  
Born ready for you  
Armed with skill and it's frustration  
And grace, too
