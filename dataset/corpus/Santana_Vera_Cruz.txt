Come on, baby, don't you wanna go  
Way down south, talkin' ?bout Mexico  
Straight through the jungle, out to the sea  
We'll have some fun if you fly away with me  
Like some old movie in black and white  
We'll fall in love in the middle of the night  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
Come on, baby, don't you wanna come  
In the town, people movin' to the drums  
Let me tell ya that  
Rosa's Cantina, it never stops  
Drinkin' cerveza, people party ?til they drop  
Forget the laundry, forget the rain  
We'll get to heaven on the seven thirty plane  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
In [Incomprehensible], it never stops  
You wanna party? We can party 'til we drop  
Forget the laundry, forget the rain  
Got to get to heaven on the seven thirty plane  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
Me and you, down in Veracruz  
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz  
Me and you  
Down in Veracruz  
Down in Veracruz
