Verse  
You stand eternal  
The uncreated One  
Who knows no end  
  
The starry wonders  
The vast expanses  
Bound to Your command  
  
Chorus  
You formed the earth  
The sky the sea  
Father of every living thing  
  
Verse  
You spoke creation  
Into existence  
Life and all we are  
  
Beyond all measure  
The universe  
An echo of Your power  
  
Chorus  
You shine like a million suns ablaze  
Wrapped in eternal light and praise  
Jesus the First the Last  
The Bright and Morning Star  
  
Bridge  
Everlasting  
Never ending  
You will reign forevermore  
You are holy  
You are worthy  
Lord of all
