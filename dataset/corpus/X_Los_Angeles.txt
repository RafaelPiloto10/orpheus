She had to leave...  
  
Los Angeles  
  
All her toys wore out in black and her boys had too  
She started to hate every nigger and Jew  
Every Mexican that gave her lotta shit  
Every homosexual and the idle rich  
She had to get out  
She gets confused  
Flying over the dateline her hands turn red  
Cause the days change at night change in an instant the days  
Change at night change in an instant  
She had to leave  
Los Angeles  
She found it hard to say goodbye to her own best friend  
She bought a clock on Hollywood blvd the day she left  
It felt sad she had to get out
