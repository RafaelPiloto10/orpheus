You should have seen  
Tuesday's dream  
Dancing in my head  
For you'd have heard  
A thousand words  
That nobody had said  
And you'd have  
Watched me try to run  
Where dreams have  
Never strayed  
Heard my cries because  
I know I really was afraid  
  
Dreams, dreams  
I'll never keep  
My body rests  
But my eyes refuse to sleep  
Sights and sounds  
My mind created  
Far beyond the thoughts  
Of which we speak  
  
And then we danced  
On silver wings  
Upon a gilded thread  
I heard the song the angel sings  
To bless my lowered head  
And at the door of paradise  
My best laid plan begun  
But as I turned to reach for you  
My colored night, it was gone
