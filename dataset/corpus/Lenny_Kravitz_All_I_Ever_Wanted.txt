Baby can't keep on running  
All I want you to do is to feel with me yeah  
We both are hurting  
And it's gonna take a little time  
To heal all the wounds and save our family  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
All I ever wanted was love  
  
Remember kissing in the moonlight?  
How we held each other all night  
All I ever wanted was love  
  
Darling darling darling  
Don't you want to feel good inside?  
It seems I've forgotten how it feels to be  
Look up to the stars  
And ask the heavens  
To show you the truth  
So that you can be free  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
All I ever wanted was love  
  
Remember kissing in the moonlight?  
How we held each other all night  
All I ever wanted was love  
  
Tell me what's the answer?  
It's gotten so cloudy I just can't see  
But you got your life and I got mine  
Are we even?  
When I know I want you  
And baby you want me  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
All I ever wanted was love  
  
Remember kissing in the moonlight?  
How we held each other all night  
All I ever wanted was love
