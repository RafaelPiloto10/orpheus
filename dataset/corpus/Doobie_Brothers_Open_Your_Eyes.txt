Girl, as we take a long last look at this love  
Before you go, I've got to know  
I've got to know, was it ever true  
I've got to hear it from you  
Girl, I can take one more hurt in this heart  
Before you go, I've got to know  
I've got to know, was it ever true  
I've got to hear it from you  
  
Not like before  
We were lost in a whirling dance  
Never slowing down  
Long enough to give truth a chance  
To come out  
So that the light could shine in  
  
And open your eyes  
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown  
Open your eyes  
Let's not let what never was bring us down

Open your eyes  
Let's not let what never was bring us down...
