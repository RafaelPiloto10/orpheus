Remember how lonely I told you it would be  
Without you here with me  
But you just turned and walked away  
And now that I've found somebody new  
You've changed your tune  
You want me back but all I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
It's too late now  
Just tell me how long did you think  
I'd be your fool  
And I would sit right here an' wait  
For you to make up  
Your mind to show up  
Well, just turn around  
I'm sorry it's too late now  
  
Well didn't I tell you that one of these days  
It would be too late  
To say you'd made a big mistake  
And now you've come back like you've never been gone  
Well baby you're wrong  
Somebody else has taken your place  
  
[Chorus]
