As clear as wine, the wind is flying  
Among the dreamy pines  
As evening light is slowly dying  
And a lonely bell still chimes.  
  
So many songs, so many stories  
The stony hills recall...  
Around her heart my city carries  
A lonely ancient wall.  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
Alas, the dry wells and fountains,  
Forgotten market-day  
The sound of horn from Temple's mountain  
No longer calls to pray.  
  
The rocky caves at night are haunted  
By sounds of long ago  
When we were going to the Jordan  
By way of Jericho.  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
But when I come to count your praises  
And sing Hallel to you  
With pretty rhymes I dare not crown you  
As other poets do.  
  
Upon my lips is always burning  
Your name, so dear, so old:  
If I forget Yerushalaim  
Of bronze and light and gold...  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
Back to the wells and to the fountains  
Within the ancient walls  
The sound of horn from Temple's mountain  
Again so loudly calls,  
  
From rocky caves, this very morning  
A thousand suns will glow  
And we shall go down to the Jordan  
By way of Jericho.  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
In Hebrew:  
  
Avir harim zalul kayayin  
Ve-rei'ah oranim  
Nissa be-ru'ah ha'arbayim  
I'm kol pa'amonim  
  
You-ve-tardemat ilan va-even  
Shvuyah ba-halomah  
Ha-ir asher badad yoshevet  
You-ve-libbah homah

Ve-shel nehoshet ve-shel or  
Ha-lo le-khol shirayikh  
Ani kinnor.  
  
Eikhah yavshu borot ha-mayim  
Kikkar ha-shuk reikah  
Ve-ein poked et Har ha-Bayit  
Ba-ir ha-attikah  
  
You-va-me'arot asher ba-selah
