I'm Pachacuti, the Incan lord  
All other tribes dreaded  
My name means 'he who shakes the earth'  
Not that I'm big-headed  
  
When it comes to claiming nearby lands  
I was the type to risk it  
But it's how I treat dead enemies  
That really took the biscuit  
  
I drink from their skull  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Pull out their teeth whole  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Turn teeth into charms  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Make flutes out of their arms  
(Pachacuti!)  
  
Once on a hillside, my troops hid  
To cause a rival strife  
And when they jumped out, it looked like  
The ground had come to life  
  
The rocks they are my warriors  
I then used to boast  
And that little lie helped us win wars  
But violence helped the most  
  
I drink from their skull  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Pull out their teeth whole  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Turn teeth into charms  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Make flutes out of their arms  
(Pachacuti!)  
  
If you were a rival chief  
We'd kill you fast and then  
We'd stuff you like a scarecrow  
But one for scaring men  
  
Then we'd rest your bony fingers on  
The stretched skin of your belly  
And in the breeze, they'd tap that tum  
Like a drummer, but more smelly!  
  
Drink from their skull  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Pull out their teeth whole  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Use their skin as a drum  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
I've never had so much fun!  
(Pachacuti!)
