Black Sun came and changed our name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
Drove the children from their chores  
Handcrafted housewives into whores  
  
Society snake it ate our brains  
Injected poison in our veins  
T. V. Minds hip swing grinds  
Faces cracked and filled with lines  
Black sun came and changed our name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
  
Introveneous T. V. Feeds  
Bedroom violence all he sees  
Ride the lightning to the sky  
Stab the clouds and watch them cry  
Black sun came and changed our name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
  
All we do is smite  
For what we think is right  
Sound of mind bereft of sight  
Denial taking human life  
  
Clouds go by children run  
Gulls do nosedives in the sun  
Water falling from a spout  
Into wanting thirsty mouths  
  
Black sun came and changed out name  
Made our lives this simple stain  
Made our lives this simple stain  
Made our lives this simple stain  
  
All we do is smite  
For what we think is right  
Sound of mind bereft of sight  
Denial taking human life  
  
All we do is smite  
For what we think is right  
Sound of mind bereft of sight  
Endless blinding cathode light
