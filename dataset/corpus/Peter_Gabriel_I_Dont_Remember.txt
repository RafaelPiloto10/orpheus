I got no means to show identification  
I got no papers show you what I am  
You'll have to take me just the way that you find me  
What's gone is gone and I do not give a damn  
  
Empty stomach, empty head  
I got empty heart and empty bed  
I don't remember  
I don't remember  
  
I don't remember, I don't recall  
I got no memory of anything at all  
I don't remember, I don't recall  
I got no memory of anything  
Anything at all  
  
Strange is your language and I have no decoder  
Why don't you make your intentions clear  
With eyes to the sun and your mouth to the soda  
Saying, "Tell me the truth, you got nothing to fear  
  
Stop staring at me like a bird of prey  
I'm all mixed up, I got nothing to say  
I don't remember  
I don't remember  
  
I don't remember, I don't recall  
I got no memory of anything at all  
I don't remember, I don't recall  
I got no memory of anything  
Anything at all  
  
I don't remember, I don't recall  
I got no memory of anything at all  
I don't remember, I don't recall  
I got no memory of anything  
Absolutely anything at all  
I don't remember
