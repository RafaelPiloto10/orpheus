So much to say  
But where do I start  
Would you listen if I spoke from the heart  
It's simple things  
That keep us apart  
You know it doesn't have to be this way  
  
Can't you hear it in my voice  
You gotta listen when I say  
  
Don't let me go when I'm this low  
Why can't we talk about it  
Why can't we figure it out  
I want to know as people grow  
How do they sort it all out  
Work out what love is about  
So tell me now yeah I've gotta know  
When this feeling I've got won't let go  
  
Some people stop  
And some people stare  
I'm hearing whispers that you no longer care  
Should I stay  
Should I turn away  
Stop playing games now you know it's not fair  
  
Can't you hear it in my voice  
You gotta listen when I say  
  
Don't let me go when I'm this low  
Why can't we talk about it  
Why can't we figure it out  
I want to know as people grow  
How do they sort it all out  
Work out what love is about  
So tell me now yeah I've gotta know  
When this feeling I've got won't let go  
  
You make me think I've got this feeling for you  
I've tried so hard, won't you listen to me?  
Cause we can make it we can see this through  
Let me start by telling you  
  
Don't let me go when I'm this low  
Why can't we talk about it  
Why can't we figure it out  
I want to know as people grow  
How do they sort it all out  
Work out what love is about  
So tell me now yeah I've gotta know  
When this feeling I've got won't let go
