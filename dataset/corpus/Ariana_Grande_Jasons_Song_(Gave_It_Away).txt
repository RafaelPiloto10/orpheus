[Verse 1]  
Yeah, you really tried  
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy  
All the shit you've done  
You can't outrun the way you understand me  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale  
You don't even care  
You focused your frustration on a small detail  
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why, then why should I listen?  
If you don't want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away  
And I'm taking it right back  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all  
No slave to your decision, ooh  
Gotta find a way to break the spell  
To get the hell away from those who block my vision  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey  
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line  
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why, then why would I listen?  
If you don't want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away  
I'm taking it right back, baby  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be  
Then why, then why should I listen?  
If you don't want to do the things I need from you  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away  
And I'm taking it right back, hey  
Taking it right back, baby  
I'm taking it right back, hey
