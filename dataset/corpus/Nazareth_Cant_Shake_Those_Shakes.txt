Blind in my one good eye  
My mind just won't reply  
Somethin' from way down south  
Kinda formin' a dust in my mouth  
Lookin' for a place to hide  
Lookin' for a space to die  
Rattlin' like an old tin can  
I'm cruisin' like a laundry van  
Hot 'n' cold fever down to my knees  
Wearin' out all of my rosary beads  
  
Can't shake those shakes  
Can' t shake those shakes no more  
Can't shake those shakes  
Feels like I'm dyin' when I'm already dead  
  
Date with my medicine man  
He got the remedies I understand  
Gotta find the price to pay  
Gonna send me on my way  
Gotta desperate need, gotta feed the fire  
I got a chemical love and a burned out desire  
  
Can't shake those shakes  
Can't shake those shakes no more  
Can't shake those shakes, eels like I'm dyin'  
When I'm already dead, I'm dead.  
  
Don't care for sentiment, don't even pay my rent  
Got enough bad habits to blame  
Got enough of them to keep me sane  
Losin' altitude in this neighborhood  
Can't break the fall, though I know that I should  
  
Can't shake those shakes
