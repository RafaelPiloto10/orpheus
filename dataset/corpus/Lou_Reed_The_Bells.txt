And the actresses relate  
To the actor who comes home late  
After the plays have gone down  
And the crowds have scattered around  
Though the city lights and the streets  
No ticket could be beat  
For the beautiful show of shows  
Ah, broadway only knows  
The great white milky way  
It had something to say  
When he fell down on his knees  
After soaring through the air  
With nothing to hold him there  
It was really not so cute  
To play without a parachute  
As he stood upon the ledge  
Looking out, he thought he saw a brook  
And he hollered, look, there are the bells  
And he sang out, here come the bells  
Here come the bells, here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells
