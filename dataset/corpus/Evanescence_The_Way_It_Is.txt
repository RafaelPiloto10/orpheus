Its just the way it is  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
No body can change  
  
You come around, every day  
Trying to get in my way  
I want you go get away  
Its just not the same old game  
Its not just the same old thing  
The same old relationship  
That had the same old thing  
  
  
Its just the way it is,  
That's just the way it was  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
Anyone can change  
  
  
Its been years, it's been hours  
Many days I can't seem to remember  
I thought this was forever  
But it just can't be,  
The only things that don't last forever  
Are just you and me.  
  
It's just the way it is,  
That's just the way it was  
And nothing can ever stop that  
Its nothing in no way  
Anyone can change  
  
  
  
  
Guess it wasn't forever  
It's just the way it is  
The way it is,  
Way it is,  
Way it is.
