I need you to hear me  
I want you to feel this  
It should be clear as fear and plain as day  
I'm not going to bend now  
You're not gonna break me  
You'll never be hard enough to scratch my face  
  
I wanted to feel you  
I tried to belong here  
Well all of the ghosts and faded headlines  
But I couldn't read you  
No you wouldn't let me  
You always pull away  
From the ones you can't defy  
  
Are you tired  
Of holding up the sky?  
Of teaching birds to fly?  
You've done it all your life  
Oh baby are you sad  
When you see the sun?  
'Cause then you're not the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
And honey all is said and done  
  
I need to move through this  
The waiting just kills me  
Whatever you do is on you,  
I'm washed clean  
No don't be alarmed now  
The story's ending  
These aren't open arms,  
They're just waving you away  
  
Are you tired  
Of holding up the sky?  
Of teaching birds to fly?  
You've done it all your life  
Oh baby are you sad  
When you see the sun?  
You've never been the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
And honey all is said and done  
All is said and done  
  
I need you to hear me  
I want you to feel this  
It should be clear as fear and plain as day  
  
Are you tired  
Of holding up the sky?  
Of teaching birds to fly?  
You've done it all your life  
Oh baby are you sad  
When you see the sun?  
'Cause then you're not the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
  
Oh are you tired  
Of running for your life?  
When there's no one left behind,  
Just the chaos in your mind  
Oh baby are you sad  
Each day you greet the sun?  
You know you're not the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
All is said and done
