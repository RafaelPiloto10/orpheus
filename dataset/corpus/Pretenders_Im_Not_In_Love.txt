I'm not in love, so don't forget it  
It's just a silly phase I'm going through  
And just because I call you up  
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made  
I'm not in love, no no  
It's because  
  
I'd like to see you, but then again  
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me  
So if I call you, don't make a fuss  
Don't tell your friends about the two of us  
I'm not in love, no no  
It's because  
  
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me  
Ooh, you'll wait a long time  
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me  
Ooh, you'll wait a long time  
  
I keep your picture upon the wall  
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there  
So don't you ask me to give it back  
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me  
I'm not in love, I'm not in love  
  
Be quiet, big boys don't cry  
Big boys don't cry
