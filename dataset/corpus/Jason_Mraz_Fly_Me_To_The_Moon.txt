Fly me to the moon  
And let me play amoung the stars  
And let me know what love is like  
On Jupiter and Mars  
  
In other words hold my hand  
In other words, Darling kiss me  
  
And fill my heart with joy  
And let me sing forever more  
'Cause you are all I've wanted,  
All I've worshipped and all I've adored  
  
In other words please be true  
In other words, In other words  
  
In other words, I love you  
  
And fill my heart with joy  
And let me sing forever more  
'Cause you are all I've wanted,  
All I've worshipped and all I've adored  
  
In other words please be true  
In other words, In other words  
In other words, I love you  
  
... Something like that
