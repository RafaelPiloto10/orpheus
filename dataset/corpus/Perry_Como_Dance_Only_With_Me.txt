Dance, dance, only with me,  
Only with me near your heart  
Dance, dance, cling close to me,  
Never to part!  
Love, love, love only me,  
All of our days from now on  
Dance only with me  
'till all our sweet music is gone!  
  
Love, love, love only me,  
All of our days from now on  
Dance only with me  
'till all our sweet music is gone!  
. . . 'till all our sweet music is gone!  
( Dance with me, only with me! )  
from the Broadway Production "Say Darling"  
Music by Julie Styne  
With lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green
