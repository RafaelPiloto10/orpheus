I am on that 24 hour  
Champagne diet spillin while I'm sippin  
I encourage you to try it  
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it  
The club owner supply it  
Boy I'm on that fly shit  
I am, what everybody in my past don't want me to be  
Guess what, I made it  
I'm the mother fucking man  
I just want you to see  
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga  
Quit fronting on me  
Don't come around and try to gas me up I like runnin on E  
I I I I'm on my disneyg shit  
Goofy flow on records I'm Captin Hook  
And my new car is Rupio  
Damn where my roof just go  
I'm somebody that you should know  
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drama produced it fo'  
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for  
Leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes  
I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my roof just go  
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl  
  
I got 'em  
He can't, they can't, and I can't blame 'em  
Since I got famous bitch, I got money to blow  
Gettin it in, letting these bills fall  
All over your skin  
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh oh oh
