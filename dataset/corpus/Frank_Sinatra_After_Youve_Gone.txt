After you've gone, and left me crying  
After you've gone, there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you're gonna be sad  
You've missed the dearest pal that  
(slickest partner) you ever had  
  
There'll come a time,  
Don't you forget it  
(yeah) there'll come a time,  
When you're gonna regret it  
Some day when you get lonely  
Your heart will break like mine,  
(and) you'll want me only  
  
After you've gone (split),  
After you've gone away (flown the coop)  
After we paid, our dues together  
You should have stayed,  
Through all that nasty weather  
Someday while you're feeling badly  
You'll need the only one that loves you so madly  
  
But I'll be gone, yes I'll be gone, to stay  
Yeah after I've gone, after I've gone away
