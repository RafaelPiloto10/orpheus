In the name of god  
We didn't know for sure  
That evil is right outside our door  
And now all the bad and ugly  
Showing their faces more  
So now we have got to work it out  
And think with precision  
Make sure we make the right decision  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
Together we're standing tall  
Together we will never fall  
Together we're living free  
And the truth is all for all to see  
But since we've all been blinded  
Blinded by evil  
Now is the time to stand and fight  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
In the name of god  
In the name of god
