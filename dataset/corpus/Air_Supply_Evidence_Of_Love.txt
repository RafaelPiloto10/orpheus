When I look for the love in your eyes  
You turn away  
And there's nothing as loud as the words  
That we never say  
Look at us now  
Standing on the edge again  
It's not too late to try again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Evidence of love  
To keep on going  
Show me some evidence of love  
And I'll be here  
I still believe we can see this through  
There's only so much I can do  
And it doesn't make sense  
Without some evidence of love  
  
There's a frozen look on your face  
Is it saying goodbye  
'Cause there's nothing as cold as the ashes  
When the fire has died  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stand and fight  
Gotta say what's on your mind, baby  
So much is on the line  
Here's a chance to make it right  
  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus]
