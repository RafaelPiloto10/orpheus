I know you rider  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
I know you rider  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin',  
I said runnin' in your arms.  
  
Don't the moon look lonesome  
When it's shinin' down through the trees.  
Don't the moon look lonesome  
When it's shinin' down through the trees.  
Don't my, don't my man looks fine  
When he comes runnin', runnin' after me.  
  
I know you rider  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone, honey when I'm gone.  
Say now, I know you rider  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin',  
I said runnin' in your arms!  
  
I know you rider  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
I know you rider  
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.  
Yeah, you're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin',  
Oh, I said runnin' in your arms!  
  
And I know my baby  
Says he's bound to love me so, love me so.  
Said I, I know my baby  
And he's bound to love me so.  
You know he'll close his arms around me  
Like a circle, he thinks I'll understand.  
  
I know you rider  
Said you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
