Until you've been beside a man  
You don't know what he wants  
You don't know if he cries at night  
You don't know if he don't  
Where nothing comes easy, old nightmares are real  
Until you've been beside a man  
You don't know how he feels  
  
But once inside a woman's heart  
A man must keep his head  
Heaven opens up the door  
Where angels fear to tread  
Some men go crazy, some men go slow  
Some men go just where they want  
Some men never go  
  
But, oh, blame it on midnight  
Ooh, shame on the moon  
  
Everywhere is all around  
Comfort in the crowd  
Stanger's faces all round  
Laughing right out loud  
Hey, watch where you're goin', step light on old toes  
Until you've been beside a man  
You don't know who he knows  
  
But, oh, blame it on midnight  
Ooh, shame on the moon  
Oh, blame it on midnight  
Ooh, shame on the moon
