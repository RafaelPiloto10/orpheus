I may not mystify you  
In your search for higher love  
I may just slip right by you  
With your eyes turned up above.  
We may not compromise  
I may not suit your taste tonight  
My love  
But as the time goes by  
You might think that I'm all right  
My love, my heavy love.  
A noise, your phone is ringing  
Or is that someone at your door  
Inside your head I'm singing  
Inside your heart I cry for more.  
You may not hear me calling  
You may not feel me bawling out  
My love  
But heavy rocks are falling  
Heavy love is coming down  
My love, my heavy love.  
A noise, your phone is ringing  
Or is that someone at your door  
Inside your head I'm singing  
Inside your heart I dig for more.  
We may not compromise  
I may not suit your taste tonight  
My sweet love  
But as the time goes by  
You might think that I'm all right  
My love, my heavy love.  
My heavy love.
