River, there are no stars in the city  
Here there is no telephone in the trees  
Beautiful days all on the water  
And all I can do is write you a letter  
River, it's cold here in the morning  
Later I can see it in your eyes  
Mild and white, we follow the canyons  
Quiet at night, we stare at the sky  
Leaving you now will never change things  
Running away will just change the view  
All I can see is the highway  
All I can see is you  
River, you'll carry me through the fire  
Maybe you'll drown me in your arms  
But if I die like that, it won't be like dying  
When I rise again, the ashes are gone  
Leaving you now will never change me  
Running away will just change the view  
All I can see is the highway  
All I can see is you
