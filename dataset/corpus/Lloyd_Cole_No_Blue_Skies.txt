You want to leave me baby be my guest  
All I'm gonna do is cry  
And then I'm gonna find there's someone else  
And tear the stars out of the sky  
Looking for something when there's nothing there to be found  
Make it easy on yourself  
Go out and find your body someone else  
And tear the stars out of the sky  
Baby you're too well-read  
Baby you're too well-spoken  
Baby you're too pristine  
When I cry, do you feel anything?  
Baby you're too well-read  
You want to leave me baby be my guest  
All I'm gonna do is cry  
And then I'm gonna find there's someone else  
And tear the stars out of the sky  
Baby you're too well-read  
Baby you're too well-spoken  
Baby you're far too clean  
When I cry, do you feel anything?  
Baby you're too well-read  
Baby you're too well-read  
You don't need me anymore  
You don't need me anymore  
They say storms are right for summertime  
Well baby I'm long gone  
Whatcha gonna do when you open your eyes  
It's a brand new day and baby  
No blue skies  
Baby you're too well-read  
Baby you're too well-spoken  
Baby you're too pristine  
When I cry, do you feel anything?  
Baby you're too well-read  
Baby you're too well-spoken  
Baby you're far too clean  
When I cry, do you feel anything?  
Baby you're too well-read
