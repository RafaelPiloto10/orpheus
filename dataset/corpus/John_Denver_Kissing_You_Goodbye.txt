Oh, at first it was just like heaven in your heart and in your arms  
And paradise discovered in the sweetness of your charms  
Yes, and every day a miracle to awake and be with you  
And every night in your embrace another dream come true  
Oh, but castles sometimes crumble, some rivers still run dry  
And fairy tales are witches tales when the truth becomes a lie  
And a pocket full of promises won't buy a diamond ring  
And every word you said to me just didn't mean a thing  
It's over now, you've gone too far I can't take anymore  
Be careful now, don't hurt yourself when you walk through the door  
I can hardly stand to look at you it makes me want to cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Oh, I suppose I'll never know why things turned out this way  
And why the one you love the most is the one you drove away?  
Yes, and I suppose I'll never, ever really understand  
How I could think that you'd make me a happy married man  
So now I sit and contemplate the reason for it all  
The climb to heights of ecstasy, the failure and the fall  
If a broken heart is purposeful it's in the lesson learned  
But no matter what the reason is it hurts when you get burned  
Now I don't care, I don't think I'll ever love again  
Kemosabe used to mean "a good and trusted friend"  
But now it stands for therapy and all the tears I cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Bye, bye goodbye  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye
