Come rejoicing, praises voicing  
Christmas Day is breaking  
Now th'Eternal, Lord supernal  
Human form is taking  
On the hay - lo, behold  
Virgin's Son, as foretold  
Lies the precious Infant in the wintry cold  
Lies the precious Infant in the wintry cold.  
  
Unabated for Him waited  
Many generations  
Him now proudly angels loudly  
Praise the Hope of nations  
Let us, then, gladly sing  
Let our songs gaily ring  
As we to this holy Child our praises bring  
As we to this holy Child our praises bring.  
  
Tender Flower, Mighty Tower  
Jesus Christ, our Savior  
Heav'nly Treasure, without measure  
Thee we love forever  
Lord and King without end  
Our poor hearts now befriend  
All Thy gifts of grace and goodness to us send  
All Thy gifts of grace and goodness to us send...
