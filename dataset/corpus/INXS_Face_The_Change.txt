Turns back to front, turns hate to love  
The simple things that mean a lot  
Turns rock to sand, turns ice to snow  
That's you and me about to grow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Change the face of a magazine  
Face the change of a million years  
Stare in shock at what you saw  
Take a breath and lock the door  
Tell your children what to do  
Mistakes and all they still love you  
Change the pace of a magazine  
Face the change of a million years  
  
Turns rough to smooth, turns don't to do  
To reminisce turns me to you  
Turns war to peace, turns greed to need  
The consequence of visionaries  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turns back to front, turns hate to love  
The simple things that mean a lot  
Turns rock to sand, turns ice to snow  
That's you and me about to grow  
  
[Chorus]
