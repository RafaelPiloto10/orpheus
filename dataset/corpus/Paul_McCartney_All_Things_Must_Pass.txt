Sunrise doesn't last all morning  
A cloudburst doesn't last all day  
Seems my love is up and has  
Left you with no warning  
It's not always been this gray  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
Sunset doesn't last all evening  
A mind can blow those clouds away  
After all this, my love is up  
And must be leaving  
It's not always been this gray  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
All things must pass  
None of life's dreams can last  
So, I must be on my way  
To face another day  
And darkness only stays at nighttime  
In the morning it will fade away  
Daylight is good, at arriving at the right time  
It's not always gonna be this gray  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away
