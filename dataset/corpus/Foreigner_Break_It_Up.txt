Made myself a prisoner  
I locked myself away  
Can't remember the last time  
I saw the light of day  
Don't want to face life  
Feel I've been betrayed  
I want you to tell me  
Where our love went astray  
  
So can't you wait one more minute  
Why can't you wait one more day  
Let's get it straight  
Cause it's a big mistake  
You better think about it  
  
I don't want to break it up  
Why do we have to break it up  
Never ever want to break it up oh no  
I only want to make it up tonight  
  
You say you've thought about it  
But you sound so cold  
You make it look like our love  
Can be bought or sold  
But you won't listen  
You say it's way too late  
That something is missing  
And now you just can't wait  
  
Why can't you wait one more minute  
Why can't you wait one more day  
Let's get it straight  
This is a big mistake  
We better think about it  
  
I don't want to break it up  
Why do we have to break it up  
Never ever want to break it up oh no  
I only want to make it up tonight  
  
So don't say break it up  
I want to hear you say we'll make it up  
I don't want to break it up  
Ooh baby why can't we make it up tonight  
Make it up tonight  
  
And I ask myself  
What's wrong with me  
How could I be so blind  
Although she tried to give me everything  
I still couldn't see  
Now as I watch our love slip away  
I'm beggin' you beggin' you please  
Don't break it up  
Take a little time and make it up  
I don't want to break it up oh no  
I only want to make it up tonight  
  
I don't want to break it up  
Baby let me make it up
