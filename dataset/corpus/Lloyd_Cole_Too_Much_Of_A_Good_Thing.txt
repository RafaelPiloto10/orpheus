If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you stay with me  
And I will stay with you, baby  
  
Do you ever wonder  
'Bout the way you move  
You know what it does to me  
You've got nothing to prove  
Do you ever think about  
Your natural grace  
And how it is that it came to you  
And landed on your sweet face  
  
Ooh, ahh  
Now every day that I go without you baby  
Is a rainy day  
I'm gonna get up in the morning  
I'm gonna work all day  
If that's what it takes  
To be with you  
  
If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you stay with me  
And I will stay with you  
If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you say to me  
I want to stay with you, baby  
  
Do you ever think about  
The way that you move me  
You know what it does to me  
You've got nothing to prove to me  
Do you ever think about  
Your natural grace  
And how it is that it came to you  
And landed on your sweet face  
  
Ooh, ahh  
Now every day that I go without you baby  
Is a rainy day  
I'm gonna get up in the morning  
I'm gonna work all day  
If that's what it takes  
To be with you  
  
If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you stay with me  
And I will stay with you  
If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you say to me  
I want to stay with you, darling  
  
Waking up is hard to do  
Except when I'm lying next to you baby  
  
If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you stay with me  
And I will stay with you  
If it's good for me  
And it's good for you  
Won't you say to me  
I want
