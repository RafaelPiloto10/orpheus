I can see you when the moon is shining bright  
I can feel you when the moon is out of sight  
Whisper softly, well it sounds so nice  
All alone in the dark, all alone in the dark  
  
I can hear the words you whisper when you're near  
I can feel them tickle softly in my ear  
Kiss me softly while there's no one here  
All alone in the dark, all alone in the dark  
  
You know this darkness makes me see  
That you're the only one for me  
You know this darkness makes me see  
And this time's the only time  
We can make our feelings rhyme  
With all the things we could not say  
  
I can see you when the moon is shining bright  
I can feel you when the moon is out of sight  
Whisper softly, well it sounds so nice  
All alone in the dark, all alone in the dark  
All alone in the dark
