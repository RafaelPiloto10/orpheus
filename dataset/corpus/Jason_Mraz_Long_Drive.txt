Long drive, long night  
The best night of my life  
With you ridin'  
Your hand on my hand  
  
The thought of arriving  
Kinda feels like dying  
I don't want to go home  
And be alone  
  
Could we stay out  
Could you drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going  
As long as I'm with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Chevy Nova  
Front seat sofa  
Getting closer  
To you  
  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going  
As long as I'm with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I rather stay with you  
We can take the long way out  
  
To the country, out of town  
Let's get lost, I don't want to be found  
Let's get away now  
  
And be careful not to crash  
It's known there's frost and we're steaming the glass  
You hit the road, have a generous shoulder  
We could pull over  
And say we took the long way  
  
Headlights  
Strobe lights  
I can see you  
But not quite  
I can feel you  
Inside  
The timing  
Is just right  
For the moment  
I don't want  
To go home  
  
Take the long way out  
Oh, oh, oh  
Take the long way now  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going now  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going now  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I'd rather stay with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Long drive, long night  
The best night of my life
