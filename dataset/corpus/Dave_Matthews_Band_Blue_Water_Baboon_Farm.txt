Walking by the river's edge  
Reach my hands to cup the sky  
Run down my arms a bitter blue  
Turn to red and the gashes grew  
  
The river taste me  
I'm so much more than I have ever been  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Take this my arms  
Take this my eyes  
Take this my mouth  
And God it seems to be  
Completely true  
Oh, oh, oh, oh... Yeah  
  
Walking by the river's edge  
Reach my hands to cup the sky  
While on my arms a bitter blue  
Turn to red and the grew  
  
The river taste me  
I'm so much more than I have ever been  
Oh, oh, oh
