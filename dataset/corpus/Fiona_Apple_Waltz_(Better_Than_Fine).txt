If you don't have a song  
To sing you're okay  
You know how to get along  
Humming  
Hmmm  
  
If you don't have a date  
Celebrate  
Go out and sit on the lawn  
And do nothing  
'Cause it's just what you must do  
Nobody does it anymore  
  
No I don't believe in the wasting of time,  
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine  
  
If you don't have a point to make  
Don't sweat it  
You'll make a sharp one being so kind  
And I'd sure appreciate it  
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed  
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm  
Better than fine
