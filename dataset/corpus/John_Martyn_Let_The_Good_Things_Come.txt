Oh, she'd walk down every road I ever set my eyes upon  
Wish she could take care of every dream I ever set my heart upon  
I wish she could step free of every weight I ever leaned my weight upon  
Laying low, let the good things come  
Laying low, let the good things come  
Wish she could walk out of every scene of every game I ever played  
I wish she could move on from every place in every town I ever stayed  
I wish she could let go and hold on on anything I wanted to  
Letting go, let the good things come  
Letting go, let the good things come  
Laying low, let the good things come  
Letting go, let the good things come  
I wish she could see you in better times and longer days to waste away  
I wish she could be you and see the world another way, another way  
I wish she could get through to every face and every friend I ever knew
