I can't read and I can't write down  
I don't know a book from countdown  
I don't care which shadow gets me  
All I've got is someone's face  
Money goes to money heaven  
Bodies go to body hell  
I just cough and catch the chase  
Switch the channel, watch the police car  
I can't read shit anymore  
I just sit back and ignore  
'Cause I just can't get it right, can't get it right  
I can't read shit, I can't read shit  
When you see a famous smile  
No matter where you run your mile  
To be right in that photograph  
Andy where's my fifteen minutes, fifteen, yeah  
I can't read shit anymore  
I just can't read shit anymore  
No matter I just can't get it right  
I can't read shit, I can't read shit, no, no
