[Chorus:] (Nelly Furtado)  
I'm alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an that's all I need  
Know 'cause I'm not looking for a change. 'cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just don't bother me, 'cause as long as I believe I can breath.  
(Prevail)  
Metamorphis, battle-axe Fortress. Four hundred horsepower, full  
Moon the Sorceress, Swollen Members an my girl nf, the predators  
And the terminators the tribe cold breath why we hurt em later we  
Do so much damage now. They'll truck em, when I hit them, so much  
Garbage around yells, bells and whistles like carnival sounds  
Phenominal adrenaline from words of my mouth.  
(Mad Child)  
How did shayne manage to rap? With brain damage I'm phat remained  
Famished and stacked your playin with the praying mantis infact you  
Gigantic you sink like titanic panic attack act up and I'm a? Crash into  
Disaster, smash like master-plaster, punker rangle-monster wants  
To stomp ya, crushin 'cause I'm? Crushin? Will tomorrow be the same blood  
Rushin thru my veins  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an that's all I need  
Know 'cause I'm not looking for a change. 'cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just don't bother me, 'cause as long as I believe I can breath.  
(Nelly Furtado)  
A noices people I knew has to, that's we are of this point to do what I  
Did of so spoint to, to wether it be easy enough to do  
(Moka)  
I'm sharin a mouth I'm like a crispy creme prevayer belt.  
With the sync notes swollen like your lymphnods,  
We went from instro to intro to insto, coincidentally  
Messin up your mental state, we makin ends glow  
Pacific center? Me an my kinfolk atttention  
Nobody can do it like your man mok' my bands dope!  
The tracks all flow I'm beautiful that's for sure!  
(Mad Child)  
I'm a neanderthal, your bound ta fall,  
I'm wonderful we warned ya all it's foreign to y'all it's  
Wonderful the underworld beautiful minds, tryin to  
Keep it independant in recruitable times  
[Chorus:] (2x)  
I'm alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an that's all I need  
Know 'cause I'm not looking for a change. 'cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just don't bother me, 'cause as long as I believe I can breath.  
(Moka)  
We crashin thru you, now feel the magnitude were flashin  
Thru inside of you it has to do with how you do your thing  
Be true to only you well moka only tellin you is take your soul an  
Talent to the next plateau an balance who you try to think of times two  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an that's all I need  
Know 'cause I'm not looking for a change. 'cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just don't bother me, 'cause as long as I believe I can breath.
