Changing my life, with your love,  
Has been so easy for you,  
And I'm amazed, every day, and I'll need you.  
'Till all the mountains are valleys,  
And every ocean is dry, my love.  
  
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine,  
'Till time stands still  
Until the winds don't blow,  
When today is just a memory to me, I know.  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin' you.  
I'll still be lovin' you.  
  
Never before did I know,  
How lovin' someone could be,  
Now I can see, you and me, for a lifetime.  
Until the last moon's rising,  
You'll see the love in my eyes, my love.  
  
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine,  
'Till time stands still,  
Until the winds don't blow.  
When today is just a memory to me, I know.  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin' you.  
  
I'll be yours until the sun doesn't shine,  
'Till time stands still.  
Until the winds don't blow.  
When today is just a memory to me, I know.  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin' you.  
I'll still be lovin' you.  
  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin'  
I'll still be lovin' you  
I'll still be lovin', I'll still be lovin'  
I'll still be lovin' you
