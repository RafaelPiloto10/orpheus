[Hebrew lyrics]  
  
El meod naala akabel panav  
Beshira utehila avo limonav [x2]  
  
Kimimoshe veaharon  
Yovileni lemishkenotav [x2]  
  
Hoshaa mimaal veishma koli  
Veishlach mimaal veyaazor li [x2]  
  
Kimimoshe veaharon  
Yovileni lemishkenotav [x2]  
  
A most honorable god i shell great him  
With singing and glory i will great his coming  
And like mozes and Aaron he will lead me  
To his land above  
[X2]  
He will lend his ear and hear my voice  
And will send from above and help me  
Couse like mozes and Aaron he will lead me  
To his land above [X2]
