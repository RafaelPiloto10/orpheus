Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that it's right  
Like a thief in the night  
Ah, oh yeah  
I'll tell you it's true  
You come around with your stories to tell  
I don't hold no interest  
But I let you go  
I know you've fallen under his spell  
Don't let him kill you  
He'll only fill you with lies  
You're a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But it's all over  
You're through  
Jet Boy Blue  
He'll only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop, stop while you're still ahead  
You've got a lot to learn  
You're still so young  
Listen to what your mama said  
  
Try to tell you go to hell  
You're just a kid  
Don't take no advice, you never think twice  
Close the door  
Jump in, don't mention what you did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But it's all over  
You're through  
Jet Boy Blue  
He'll only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that it's right  
Like a thief in the night  
  
Woah, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet Boy Blue  
Jet Boy Blue [Repeat: x7]
