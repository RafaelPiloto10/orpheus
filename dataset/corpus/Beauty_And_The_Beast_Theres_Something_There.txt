Belle:  
There's something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean  
And he was course  
And unrefined  
And now he's dear  
And so I'm sure  
I wonder why I didn't see it there before  
  
Beast:  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched  
She didn't shudder at my paw  
No it can't be  
I'll just ignore  
But then she's never looked at me that way before  
  
Belle:  
New and a bit alarming  
Who'd have ever thought that this could be  
True that he's no prince charming  
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see  
  
Lumiere:  
Well who'd have thought  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well who'd have known  
  
Ms. Potts:  
Well who indeed  
  
Lumiere:  
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own  
  
Ms. Potts:  
It's so peculiar  
  
Ms. Potts, cogsworth, lumiere  
We'll wait and see a few days more  
There may be something there that wasn't there before  
  
Cogsworth:  
Well perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before  
  
Ms. Potts:  
There may be something there that wasn't there before
