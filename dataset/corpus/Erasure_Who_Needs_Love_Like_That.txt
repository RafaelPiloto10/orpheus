Who needs love like that  
  
There's something going on  
Something not quite right  
There's something strange  
Happening to me  
There's someone at the door  
Hear voices in my head  
It seems things aren't the way  
They ought to be  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
  
It seemed so clear before  
I held my point of view  
I kept my conversation  
Never changed  
Now it's all gone wrong  
Words are kind of hard  
Nothing else around me  
Looks the same  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
Love can turn you upside-down  
And leave you cold  
It's plain to see  
You're losing all control  
(Losing all control)  
  
I'd like to understand  
Like to find out why  
I can't remember all  
The lines that you said  
But then I see your face  
And nothing really counts  
Don't tell me now  
This feeling will stay  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
Love can turn you upside-down  
And leave you cold  
It's plain to see  
You're losing all control  
(Losing all control)  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
Love can turn you upside-down  
And leave you cold  
It's plain to see  
You're losing all control  
(Losing all control)
