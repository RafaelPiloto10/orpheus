Strangers in the night, exchanging glances  
Wondering in the night what were the chances  
We'd be sharing love before the night was through  
  
Something in your eyes was so inviting  
Something in your smile was so exciting  
Something in my heart told me I must have you  
  
Strangers in the night, two lonely people  
We were strangers in the night  
Up to the moment when we said our first hello  
Little did we know, love was just a glance away  
A warm embracing dance away and  
  
Ever since that night, we've been together  
Lovers at first sight in love forever  
It turned out so right for strangers in the night  
  
Love was just a glance away  
A warm embracing dance away and  
  
Ever since that night, we've been together  
Lovers at first sight in love forever  
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
