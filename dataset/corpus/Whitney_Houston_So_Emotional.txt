I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me  
I keep your photo right beside my bed  
Livin' in a world of fantasies  
I can't get you out of my head  
  
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night  
Why you want to make me feel so good  
I got a love of my own  
Shouldn't get so hung up on you  
  
I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much  
I get so emotional, baby  
Every time I think of you  
I get so emotional, baby  
  
Ain't it shocking what love can do  
Ain't it shocking what love can do  
  
I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby  
I gotta watch you walk out  
I like the animal way you move  
And when you talk I just watch your mouth  
  
I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much  
I get so emotional, baby  
Every time I think of you  
I get so emotional, baby
