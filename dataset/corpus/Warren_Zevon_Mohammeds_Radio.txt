Everybody's restless and they've got no place to go  
Someone's always trying to tell them  
Something they already know  
So their anger and resentment flow  
But don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammed's Radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio, Mohammed's Radio  
You know, the Sheriff's got his problems too  
He will surely take them out on you  
In walked the village idiot and his face was all aglow  
He's been up all night listening to Mohammed's Radio  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long  
Mohammed's Radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio, Mohammed's Radio  
Everybody's desperate trying to make ends meet  
Work all day, still can't pay the price of gasoline and meat  
Alas, their lives are incomplete  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long Mohammed's Radio  
I heard somebody singing sweet and soulful  
On the radio, Mohammed's Radio  
You've been up all night listening for his drum  
Hoping that the righteous might just might just might just come  
I heard the General whisper to his aide-de-camp  
"Be watchful for Mohammed's lamp"  
Don't it make you want to rock and roll  
All night long Mohammed's Radio
