We're off on the road to Morocco  
This camel is tough on the spine (hit me with a band-aid, Dad)  
Where they're going, why we're going, how can we be sure  
I'll lay you eight to five that we'll meet Dorothy Lamour  
(Yeah, get in line)  
  
Off on the road to Morocco  
Hang on till the end of the line (I like your jockey. Quiet)  
I hear this country's where they do the dance of the seven veils  
We'd tell you more (uh-ah) but we would have the censor on our tails  
(Good boy)  
  
We certainly do get around  
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound  
  
We're off on the road to Morocco  
Well look out, well clear the way, 'cause here we come  
Stand by for a concussion  
The men eat fire, sleep on nails and saw their wives in half  
It seems to me there should be easier ways to get a laugh  
(Shall I slip on my big shoes?)  
  
Off on the road to Morocco  
Hooray! Well blow a horn, everybody duck  
Yeah. It's a green light, come on boys  
  
We may run into villains but we're not afraid to roam  
Because we read the story and we end up safe at home (yeah)  
Certainly do get around  
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound  
  
We certainly do get around  
Like a complete set of Shakespeare that you get  
In the corner drugstore for a dollar ninety-eight  
We're Morocco bound  
  
Or, like a volume of Omar Khayyam that you buy in the  
Department store at Christmas time for your cousin Julia  
We're Morocco bound  
(We could be arrested)
