Way down in the delta  
Where the days move slow  
There's a squeeze box player  
Name a Little Johnny O  
He's got a four piece band  
And they're playin' real tight  
Make the people go crazy  
Every Saturday night  
  
Singing, Hey Johnny O  
Let's Fied-I-Ay  
On the ol' bayou  
Hey Johnny O  
Well play the Tennessee Waltz  
And the Zydeco  
  
They like their Chuck Berry records  
And some Fats Domino  
But the thing they like the most  
Is hearin' Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
That's right Johnny  
  
Well the Natches girls  
They like to stroll around town  
When Johnny starts a playin'  
You see 'em come unwound  
Well the boys in the corner  
All loosin' their minds  
Gonna make their move  
When Johnny gives the sigh  
  
Singing, Hey Johnny O  
Let's Fied-I-Ay  
On the ol' bayou  
Hey Johnny O  
Play the Tennessee Waltz  
And the Zydeco  
  
They like their old country records  
They're the mill for the soul  
But the thing they like the most  
Is hearin' Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
Play it, Hey Johnny  
That's the ticket  
(Let's get down girl)  
  
Way down in the delta  
Where the big blue flows  
There's a one little secret  
That everybody knows  
If you just can't sleep  
And you're feelin' down  
There's an all-night cure  
Outside of town  
  
And it's Hey Johnny O  
Let's Fied-I-Ay  
On the ol' bayou  
Hey Johhny O  
Play the Tennessee Waltz  
And the Zydeco  
  
They like all those songs  
On the radio  
But the thing they like the most  
Is hearin' Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh  
Little Johnny O  
Playin' Fiedle-I-Oh hey  
Hey Johnny  
What is Fiedle-I-Oh?
