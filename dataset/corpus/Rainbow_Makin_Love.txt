I was always on the wilder side  
Chasing love away  
Love was something for romantic fools  
Just a game how to play  
  
How can I deny my heart  
When my love is blind  
I got no choice  
I've gone too far  
I lose my mind  
When we're makin' love  
When we're makin' love  
  
When I look into your magic eyes  
The mirror of my love  
I like to see you  
Smiling back at me  
It makes me feel so good  
  
Need to keep you satisfied  
The only way I know  
And all the cares I cannot hide  
Will never show  
When we're makin' love  
Woh makin' love  
  
Don't believe that I'm a liar  
But I can't get enough  
Never knew I could be higher  
Just by makin' love  
  
How can I deny my heart  
When my love is blind  
I got no choice  
I've gone too far  
I lose my mind  
When we're makin' love  
When we're makin' love  
  
Don't believe that I'm a liar  
But I can't get enough  
Never knew I could be higher  
Just by makin' love  
  
Oh oh oh yeah oh makin' love  
Oh makin' love  
Makin' love  
Coming to you  
Makin' love  
With nothing to do  
Makin' love  
Makin' love  
Makin' love  
Makin' love
