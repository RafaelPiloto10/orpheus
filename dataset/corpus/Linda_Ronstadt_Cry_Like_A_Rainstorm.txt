Life isn't easy  
Love never lasts  
You just carry on  
And keep moving fast  
  
I pulled off the highway  
And rolled into town  
I'm just fancy free babe  
And I travel 'round  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes down  
Where can I run to  
How have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  
And my thoughts are filled with memories  
They won't let me be  
But if all the stars are shining bright  
Well they would not let me see  
  
It's so cold and the rain keeps blowing  
It's tearing through the town  
But I'm still fancy free darling  
And I travel 'round  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes down  
Oh where can I run to  
How have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Most times down  
Oh where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  
Who can I turn to  
Tell me where to begin  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind
