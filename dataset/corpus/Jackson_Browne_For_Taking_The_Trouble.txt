For taking the trouble, for hanging on and tryin'  
You've been working through the rubble of a shattered mind  
Yeah Baby, tell me why the tears are falling from your eye  
Tears of laughter, tears of grief, are they the tears of a captured thief?  
You thought that you were home free, you thought you had her well in hand  
But there were things about her you didn't understand  
Yeah Baby, tell me how you're gonna keep that promise now?  
To live your life without regret and make it work with what you get  
You didn't then, but now you know  
When she began to lie, you really should have let her go  
You're learnin' how to talk about it, you're learnin' how to bend  
It's like you're learning how to walk all over again  
Yeah Baby, tell me who you're gonna give your lovin' to?  
That girl who catches every eye or the one you can set your compass by  
You set it by her soulful smile, the fire in her eye  
And the way she goes that extra mile  
The love you wanted this to be is somewhere down the line  
You'll find her eventually  
Your grandma and her grandma are sittin' 'round heaven discussin' the law  
Lovin' that girl was not your crime, livin' without her gonna take some time  
Lovin' that girl next thing you knew, you'd turned away from the thing you do  
Lovin' that girl, you couldn't see, living without her gonna make you free
