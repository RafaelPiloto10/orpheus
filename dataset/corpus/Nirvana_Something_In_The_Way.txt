Underneath the bridge  
The tarp has sprung a leak  
And the animals I've trapped  
Have all become my pets  
And I'm living off of grass  
And the drippings from the ceiling  
But it's okay to eat fish  
'Cause they don't have any feelings  
  
Something in the way  
Ummmmm  
Something in the way, yeah  
Ummmmm
