Another day in the city  
Another dancer to the music  
But lately, all the music sounds so strange  
Well some songs have no meaning  
And some songs try to hard  
Tryin' to say it all  
And end up saying nothin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Well maybe the words ring true  
What's right for them  
Maybe wrong for you  
So come out of the jungle  
Of another man's dreams  
And if you come to a clearing  
As lonely as it seems  
It's never too late to breakaway  
To breakaway  
  
Another day lost in livin'  
And another same old beginning  
And knowing where and why we went wrong  
Someone says I've changed  
And someone says that I've remained  
In the same place  
For maybe just a little too long  
  
[Chorus: x2]
