Oh I can't keep it in can't keep it in  
I've gotta let it out.  
  
I've got to show the world, world's got to see.  
See all the love, love that's in me, I said  
Why walk alone. Why worry when it's warm over here.  
You got so much to say, say what you mean.  
Mean what you're thinkin', and think anything.  
Oh why, why must you waste you're life away.  
  
You've got to live for today, then let it go, oh  
Lover, I want to spend this time with you.  
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know.  
And I can't keep it in, I can't hide it and  
I can't lock it away.  
  
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood  
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love.  
No I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in  
I've gotta let it out  
  
I've got to show the world, world's got to know,  
Know of the love, love that lies low,  
So why can't you say, if you know then why can't you say  
You've got too much deceit, and deceit kills the light.  
Light, needs has to shine,  
I said shine light, shine light.  
Love, that no way to live you life.  
  
You allow too much to go by, and that won't do, no  
Lover, I want to have you here by my side  
Now don't you run don't you hide  
while I'm with you now I can't keep it in,  
I can't keep it in I gotta let it out  
  
I've gotta show the world, worlds's got to see see all the love,  
love that's in me I said why walk alone  
Why worry when it's warm over here  
You got so much to say, say what you mean  
Mean what you're thinkin' and thing anything, why not?  
Now why why why not?
