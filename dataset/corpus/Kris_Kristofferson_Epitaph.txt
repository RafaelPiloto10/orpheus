Her close friends have gathered.  
Lord, ain't it a shame  
Grieving together  
Sharing the blame.  
But when she was dying  
Lord, we let her down.  
There's no use cryin'  
It can't help her now.  
  
The party's all over  
Drink up and go home.  
It's too late to love her  
And leave her alone.  
  
Just say she was someone  
Lord, so far from home  
Whose life was so lonesome  
She died all alone  
Who dreamed pretty dreams  
That never came true  
Lord, why was she born  
So black and blue?  
Oh, why was she born  
So black and blue?
