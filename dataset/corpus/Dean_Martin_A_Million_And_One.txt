(How many teardrops)  
Have I cried over you  
A million and one tears  
A million and two  
(How many lonely nights)  
Have my arms ached for you  
A million and one nights  
A million and two  
Loving you darlin'  
While I thought you loved me, only me  
But you were just fooling  
And the fool you were fooling was me  
How many sweet dreams  
Will never come true  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
(Loving you darlin'  
While I thought you loved me, only me)  
But you were just fooling  
And the fool you were fooling was me  
(How many sweet dreams)  
Will never come true  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two
