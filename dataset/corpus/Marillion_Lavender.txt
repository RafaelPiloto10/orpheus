I was walking in the park  
Dreaming of a spark  
When I heard the sprinklers whisper  
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns.  
Then I heard the children singing  
They were running through the rainbows.  
They were singing a song for you  
Well it seemed to be a song for you  
The one I wanted to write for you  
  
Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green  
When I am King, dilly dilly  
You will be Queen  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I. O. You. For your love  
I. O. You. For your love  
  
Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue  
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I. O. You. For your love  
I. O. You. For your love  
  
Lavender dreams dilly, dilly lavender true  
When you miss me dilly dilly, I did miss you  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I. O. You for your love  
I. O. You. For your love  
For your love
