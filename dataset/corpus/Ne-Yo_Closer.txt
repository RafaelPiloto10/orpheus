Closer  
Closer  
Closer  
Closer  
  
Turn the lights off in this place  
And she shines just like a star  
And I swear I know her face  
I just don't know who you are  
Turn the music up in here  
I still hear her loud and clear  
Like she's right there in my ear  
Telling me  
That she wants to own me  
To control me  
Come closer  
Come closer  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I just can't pull myself away  
Under her spell I can't break  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
And I just can't break myself no way  
But I don't want to escape  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
  
I can feel her on my skin  
I can taste her on my tongue  
She's the sweetest taste of sin  
The more I get the more I want  
She wants to own me  
Come closer  
She says "come closer"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x7]  
(Come closer)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I just can't stop no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I just can't pull myself away  
Under her spell I can't break  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
Come closer
