Hey darling  
Have to tell 'bout the world  
Have to tell you today  
Believe me now  
Believe me now  
You'd better believe in angels  
There's no other substitute  
We all do that before we're going up in the sky  
If your loving is in your money  
Know they cannot hug you back  
This is the sound of the world  
I know, I say, I do, I say  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl  
Take a look around  
Take a look around  
You're going to be burned out  
You must blame it on yourself  
You're burning your candlse both ways  
That I've learned from my past  
Quench your thirst with memories  
There's no point in being stressed  
That is the thing I have learned  
I've done, I've been, I've seen all that  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl  
Take a look around  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Take a look around  
Hey darling (ouuh, ooooooh)  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world (Got to tell you ...)  
I'm never gonna change my mind  
No, I'm never gonna change my mind  
Believe me now  
Believe me now  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl (Got to tell you ...)  
Hey darling  
Hey darling (have to tell you today)  
Hey darling (ah uh)  
Hey darling (have to tell you ...)  
Hey darling (believe me now)
