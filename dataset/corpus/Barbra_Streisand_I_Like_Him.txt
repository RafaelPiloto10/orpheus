I like him, I like him,  
How strange the feeling, I like him.  
I never dreamed it could be.  
He's foolish, unworldly and yet appealing, I like him.  
I feel alive and free.  
How did the birds and the bees outsmart me?  
Who's little arrows are these that dart, dart, dart me?  
I like him, I like him,  
Up to the ceiling, I like him.  
He's for me, A to Zee.  
I like him, I like him and he likes me.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I never dreamed it could be.  
He's foolish, unworldly and yet appealing I like him.  
He's for me, A to Zee.  
I like him, I like him and he likes me.
