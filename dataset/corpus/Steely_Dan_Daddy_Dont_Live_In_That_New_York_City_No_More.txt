Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more  
He don't celebrate Sunday on a Saturday night  
No more  
Daddy don't need no lock and key  
For the piece he stowed  
Out on Avenue D  
Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more  
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado  
No more  
He don't travel on down to the neighborhood  
Liquor store  
Lucy still loves her coke and rum  
But she sits alone  
Cause her daddy can't come  
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado  
No more  
  
Driving like a fool out to Hackensack  
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack  
He says I gotta see a joker  
And I'll be right back  
  
Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more  
He can't get tight every night  
Pass out on the barroom floor  
Daddy can't get no fine cigar  
But we know you're smoking  
Wherever you are  
Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more
