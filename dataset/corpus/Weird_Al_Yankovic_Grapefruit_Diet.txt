Who's that waddlin' down the street?  
It's just me, 'cause I love to eat  
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham  
Who's real flabby? Yes, I am!  
Every picture of me's  
Gotta be an aerial view  
Now my doctor tells me  
There's just one thing left to do--  
  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Throw out the pizza and beer  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Oh, get those jelly donuts out of here  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Might seem a little severe  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
I'm gettin' tired of my big fat rear  
Blow, flatty!  
  
Well, I used to live on chocolate sauce  
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss  
Walked down an alley and I got stuck  
I got more rolls than a pastry truck  
When I'm all done eating  
I eat a little more  
When I leave a room  
First I gotta grease the door  
  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Can't have another eclair  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
I gotta decrease my derriere  
  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
  
No more pie now  
No more creme brulee  
Lay off the gravy  
And souffle  
No french fri-yi-yies now  
No ice cream parfait  
Mr. Cheese Nacho  
Stay away  
  
Oh, I think I'd sell my soul  
For a triple patty melt  
But I need a boomerang  
When I put on my belt  
  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Lay off the 3 Musketeers  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Until my big booty disappears  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Eat'em till they're comin' out of my ears  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
'Cause I haven't seen my feet in years  
  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet
