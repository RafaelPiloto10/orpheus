Two lovers in a desperate game  
She holds him close but their love's in vain  
And the married man that you laid  
Goes back home to his own charade  
  
She puts her faith in every word he said  
Tender moments in a motel bed  
When you press the point he says we'll see  
But then walks to his mystery  
  
So darling you tell me it's a wild world  
You gotta take a little pain and  
How long will love last that you can  
Never, never explain  
  
Do you just  
Let it rain, let it rain  
Don't stop those tears falling again just  
Let it rain, let it rain  
Now you see that love's just a game  
  
In his arms time goes so fast  
But stolen love will never last  
You try to keep him though you know it's wrong  
This kind of love can only last so long
