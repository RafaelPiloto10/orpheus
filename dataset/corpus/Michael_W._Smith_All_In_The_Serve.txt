Never gave you nothin'  
People couldn't explain away  
Never gave you nothin'  
Without something to gain  
Never could slow down enough  
To study a face, but now  
I wanna know your name  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold my feet to the fire  
'Til I'm breaking a sweat  
'Til I never forget  
Your calling  
Keep me on the line  
Give me the nerve  
Here it's all in the serve  
  
Locked in the diamond lane  
I kept driving past it  
Better to be safe than learn  
What you're about  
Give me another chance  
To go where you're going now  
I'm here to walk it out  
I'm here to walk it out  
I'm here to walk it out  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's all in the serve  
It's all in the serve  
Here it's all in the serve
