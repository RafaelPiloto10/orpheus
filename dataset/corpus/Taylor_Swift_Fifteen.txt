You take a deep breath  
And you walk through the doors  
It's the morning of your very first day  
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile  
Try and stay out of everybody's way  
  
It's your freshman year  
And you're gonna be here for the next four years  
In this town  
Hoping one of those senior boys  
Will wink at you and say, "you know I haven't seen you around, before"  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out  
  
Count to ten  
Take it in  
This is life before you know who you're gonna be  
At fifteen  
  
You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail  
And soon enough you're best friends  
Laughing at the other girls  
Who they think they're so cool  
We'll be out of here as soon as we can  
  
And then you're on your very first date  
And he's got a car  
And you're feeling like flying  
And you're mama's waiting up  
And you're thinking he's the one  
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends  
When the night ends  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
And your first kiss makes your head spin around  
  
But in your life you'll do things  
Greater than dating the boy on the football team  
But I didn't know it at fifteen  
  
When all you wanted  
Was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back  
And tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had  
To a boy who changed his mind  
And we both cried  
  
'Cause when you're fifteen,  
Somebody tells you they love you  
You're gonna believe them  
And when you're fifteen  
  
Don't forget to look before you fall  
  
I've found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who you're supposed to be  
I didn't know who I was supposed to be  
At fifteen  
  
La la la la la  
Your very first day  
Take a deep breath girl  
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
