Well I grew up lean and hungry  
I worked hard for my money  
Said I'm gonna live my life the way I please  
Spent some time on the road of life  
Saw an angel once and the devil twice  
I came across some things that I don't need  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Like a cold-hearted woman  
Whiskey in my water  
And only one way out of a motel room  
Payments on the Cadillac  
And too many questions  
And old guitars that won't stay in tune  
  
You know there's good and bad breaks  
You learn from your mistakes  
It's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts  
A hillbilly boy is hard to convince  
Wild and stubborn and not much sense  
But I've got enough to know what I don't want  
  
[Chorus: ]
