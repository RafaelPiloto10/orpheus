Will I be alone this morning?  
Will I need my friends?  
Something just to ease away the pain  
And now I never see the loneliness  
Behind my face  
I am just a prisoner to my faith  
  
If I could only stand and stare in the mirror would I see  
One fallen hero with a face like me  
And if I scream, could anybody hear me  
If I smash the silence, you'll see what fame has done to me  
  
Kiss away the pain and leave me lonely  
I'll never know if love's a lie  
Ooh - being crazy in paradise is easy  
Can you see the prisoners in my eyes  
Where is the love to shelter me  
Give me love, love set me free  
Where is the love, to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
Set me free
