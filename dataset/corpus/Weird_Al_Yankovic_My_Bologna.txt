Ooh, my little hungry one, hungry one  
Open up a package of my bologna  
Ooh, I think the toast is done, the toast is done  
Top it with a little of my bologna  
  
Never gonna stop, eat it up  
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up  
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo  
M-m-m-my bologna  
  
Spreadin' on the mustard now, show me how  
Spread it on a litle of this bologna  
Hopin' that we don't run out, don't run out  
If we do I'm sure that I'll miss bologna  
  
Never gonna stop, eat it up  
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up  
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo  
M-m-m-my bologna  
M-m-m-my bologna  
  
(belch)  
  
Goin' to the market now, market now  
I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer  
Walkin' down the shopping isles, shopping isles  
Filling up my basket with Oscar Meyer  
  
Never gonna stop, eat it up  
Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up  
But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo  
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my, my, my, yi, yi, woo  
M-m-m-my bologna  
M-m-m-my bologna  
M-m-m-my bologna  
M-m-m-my bologna
