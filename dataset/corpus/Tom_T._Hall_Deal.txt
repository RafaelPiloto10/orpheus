Well life is a gamble and the days they're just so many decks  
Oh the hours are cards they deal and you play what you get  
Oh you think of the the time that you knew you could call so you raised  
Oh you think of the the time that you got out when you should have stayed  
  
Deal hey may be the next card's an Ace  
Deal you ought to go home but you know that a Flush beats a Straight  
Oh you can't have a Full House the Queen has been dealt to a friend  
Oh the good thing about life is they shuffle and they deal life again  
  
Well the cards are all stacked when you're hot and the women are too  
Oh it's a hard cut to take when you raised every hand but you do  
Well I'm not complainin' it ain't like a Joker to cry  
Oh it won't do to cheat cause you have to cash in when you die  
So deal hey may be the next card's an Ace...
