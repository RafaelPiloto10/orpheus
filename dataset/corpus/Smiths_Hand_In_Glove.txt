Hand in glove  
The sun shines out of our behinds  
No, it's not like any other love  
This one is different - because it's us  
  
Hand in glove  
We can go wherever we please  
And everything depends upon  
How near you stand to me  
  
And if the people stare  
Then the people stare  
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care  
  
Kiss my shades  
  
Hand in glove  
The good people laugh  
Yes, we may be hidden by rags  
But we've something they'll never have  
  
Hand in glove

But we've something they'll never have  
  
And if the people stare  
Then the people stare  
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care  
  
Kiss my shades...oh...  
  
So, hand in glove I stake my claim  
I'll fight to the last breath  
  
If they dare touch a hair on your head  
I'll fight to the last breath  
  
For the good life is out there somewhere  
So stay on my arm, you little charmer  
  
But I know my luck too well  
Yes, I know my luck too well  
And I'll probably never see you again  
I'll probably never see you again  
I'll probably never see you again  
Oh
