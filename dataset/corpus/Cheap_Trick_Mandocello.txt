I, I can hear you laughing  
You're a million miles away or you're here  
I, I will never leave you  
I'm a million miles away or I'm near  
I, I, the thoughts you're thinking  
But you're a lifetime away from your home or you're here  
I, I can see you crying  
You're a million miles away or you're here  
Look at me like I look at you  
Think of me like I think of you  
Speak to me like I speak to you  
Dream of me like I dream of you  
I, I can hear you thinking  
You're a million thoughts away  
I, I'm the dreams you're dreaming  
I'm a million dreams away or I'm here  
We can go down slowly like the rain  
I could leave and be with you again, oh  
I could be your lover, let's pretend
