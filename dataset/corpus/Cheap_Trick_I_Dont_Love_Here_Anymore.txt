We had a special way of talkin'  
Oh, a language all our own  
We always knew the latest dances  
But we liked old-fashioned love  
Now something seems the matter  
  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
I don't want to love here anymore  
(I don't want to love here anymore)  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
  
I don't have a lot of patience  
When someone's lit my fuse  
So don't you try to reason  
Me, I don't want no excuse, no!  
  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
I don't want to love here anymore  
(I don't want to love here anymore)  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
  
You (you)  
Don't (don't)  
Play (play)  
By the rules  
I (I)  
Won't (don't)  
Love here anymore  
  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
'cause I don't want to love here anymore  
(I don't want to love here anymore)
