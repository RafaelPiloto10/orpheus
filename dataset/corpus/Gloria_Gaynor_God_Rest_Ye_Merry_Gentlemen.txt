God rest you merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of god by name  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
"Fear not", then said the angel  
"Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a Savior  
Of virtue, power, and might  
So frequently to vanquish all  
The friends of Satan quite"  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
The shepherds at those tidings  
Rejoiced much in mind  
And left their flocks a-feeding  
In tempest, storm, and wind  
And went to Bethlehem straightway  
This blessed babe to find  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
But when to Bethlehem they came  
Whereat this infant lay  
They found him in a manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeling  
Unto the Lord did pray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises  
All you within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All others doth deface  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy
