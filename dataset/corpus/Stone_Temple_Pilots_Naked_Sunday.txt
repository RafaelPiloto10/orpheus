You're the fuel to the fire You're the weapons of war  
You're the irony of justice And the father of law  
  
I've been waiting for a while to meet you  
For the chance to shake your hand  
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command  
And when all is over and we return to dust  
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?  
Angst...  
  
You're the champion of sorrow You're the love and the pain  
You're the fighter of evil Yet you're one and the same  
  
I've been waiting for a while to meet you  
For the chance to shake your hand  
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command  
And when all is over and we return to dust  
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust?  
Angst..
