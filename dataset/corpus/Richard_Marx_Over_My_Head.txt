Baby, I'm tryin' to make some sense  
Of all we should've learned from experience  
We win, we lose, we conquer and we fail  
One part serious, do or die  
Another part crush in junior high  
I'm chasing my emotions like a tail  
I can still move my fingers  
But I can't seem to let go  
  
The cold winds are blowing, I should be goin'  
I'm in over my head  
Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'  
I would be better off dead  
Yeah' I'm in over my head  
  
You made me weak, I made you laugh  
Driving through the rain in a yellow cab  
The taste of your kiss is with me even now  
But this thing we've got goes by different names  
Never two days in a row the same  
I wanna stop feelin' this, but don't know how  
  
I see my legs and they're moving  
But I just can't walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
I'll say goodbye, but talk is cheap  
I count the memories in my sleep  
I've had enough, but I want more  
  
Makin' me weak, makin' you laugh  
Driving through the rain in that yellow cab  
Baby, your kiss is with me even now  
  
Chorus
