Woke up early this morning  
As I looked around my world be crumblin' down  
What I saw, I couldn't believe, Who are you?  
What might I be? Oh, the things you do  
  
Stare at the sun, one means three  
At the helm insanity, if you'd look Mama  
Ya just might find but you're too far gone  
Now you're just losin' your mind  
  
Wanting to get away, one more fix you'll be okay  
The things ya do, try and try to talk you down  
You're so damn high, can't hear a sound  
Oh, what's going on?  
  
Once you start, you can't stop, start to shake  
Fall apart, engine's burnin'  
Burnin' out of time, you're too far gone  
Now you're just losin' your mind  
  
Pass through time without a move  
You're the one that's being used  
If you'd look you must might find  
But you're too far gone, now you're just losin' your mind
