Downtown we'll drown We're in our never splendour.  
Flowers, showers. Who's got the new boy gender?  
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score.  
I'll run the gun for you and so much more.  
  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble.  
  
Uptown. Their sound is like the native you send her.  
Junktion, funktion. The boy with pop is slender.  
Did he say maybe? Or I'm not sure?  
He'll be a boy for you but you need more.  
  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble.  
  
I get a crazy feeling that chases in my head.  
It's nothing that you do to me,  
It's nothing that you said.  
It's love in stereo  
And when I can't let got I say:  
  
I'll be your baby  
I'll be your score,  
I'll run the gun for you and so much more.  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
  
Downtown we'll drown We're in our never splendour.  
Flowers, showers. Who's got the new boy gender?  
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score.  
I'll run the gun for you and so much more.  
  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,  
I'll tumble 4 ya, I'll tumble 4 ya,
