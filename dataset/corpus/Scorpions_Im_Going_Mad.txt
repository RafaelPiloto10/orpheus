Walking through the desert  
You know what it's about  
It's really from the church  
Too foreign  
That was never there  
Yet you know I'm in heaven  
But it is a hell  
Sun is drying up my brain  
The smile and installations  
Are my pain  
I'm going mad  
I'm going mad  
I'm going mad  
Aaaayowwww!!!
