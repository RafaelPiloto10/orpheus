The tears have all been shed now  
We've said our last good-bye  
His soul's been blessed and he's laid to rest  
And it's now I feel alone  
  
He was more than just a father  
A teacher my best friend  
He can still be heard in the tunes we shared  
When we play them on our own  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never will forget him for he made me what I am  
Though he may be gone memory lingers on  
And I miss him... The old man  
  
As a boy he'd take me walking  
By mountain field and stream  
And he showed me things not known to kings  
And secret between him and me.  
  
Like the colors of the pheasant  
As he rises in the dawn  
And how to fish and make a wish  
Beside the holly tree  
  
I never will forget him for he made me what I am  
Though he may be gone memory lingers on  
And I miss him... The Old Man  
  
I thought he'd live forever  
He seemed so big and strong  
But the minutes fly and the years roll by  
For a father and his son  
  
And suddenly when it happened  
There was so much left unsaid  
No second chance to tell him thanks  
For everything he's done  
  
I never will forget him for he made me what I am  
Though he may be gone memory lingers on  
And I miss him... The Old Man
