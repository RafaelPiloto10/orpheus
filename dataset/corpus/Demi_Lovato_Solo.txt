You speak to me  
And in your words I hear a melody  
But in the twilight it's so hard to see  
What's wrong for me  
  
I can't resist  
Until you give the truth a little twist  
As if you're gonna get away with this  
You're not sorry  
  
I can't believe I fell for this  
  
[Chorus]  
I fell through the hole  
Down at the bottom of your soul  
Didn't think you could go so low  
Look at what you done  
You're losing me  
Is what you've won  
Got me planning to go solo  
  
You sing to me  
Too bad you couldn't even stay on key  
If your life is such a mystery  
Why don't you just stick to acting  
Oh  
  
Here we go again  
You couldn't find my number until when  
You thought that you could get to my best friend  
Without a script your game is lacking  
  
I can't believe I fell for this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd rather go to a party alone  
Than have to walk around with you on my arm  
Now that I'm better to admit that we're done  
Good luck trying to find me  
  
Down at the bottom of your soul  
Didn't think you could go solo  
Oh oh oh  
Look at what you've done  
You're losing me  
Here's what you've won  
Got me planning to go solo  
  
Now we're done oh oh  
Cause you got me planning to go solo
