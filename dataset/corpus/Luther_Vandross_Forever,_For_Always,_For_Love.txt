I sing this song  
To remind myself that  
There was a time when I  
Didn't have no one  
Didn't have no love  
Do you remember  
The love that we once had  
Well, if I had the chance to love you again  
I would make your heart forget I was ever bad  
If we forgive the past  
I know this time love would last  
Forever, for always, for love  
  
I'm not coming home anymore  
Does it matter?  
Well, if I had the chance to hold you again  
I would fill your heart with joy  
And make you know that I'm the only one for you  
Let's throw the bad memories out  
And make this the first day of our  
Forever, for always, for love  
  
I'd be a fool to ever change  
If she said she loves the way I am  
I'd be a fool to ever change  
If she said she loves the way I am  
It's gonna be starting here, starting now  
Forever, for always, for love
