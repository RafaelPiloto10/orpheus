I was talking to a homeless drunk about religion  
He said "It's all I got, but it ain't much  
'Cause the way I feel these days,  
I'd rather have a gun than a crutch"  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
Listen to a little girl, she was a runaway.  
She said "My daddy treated me like a slave.  
Soiled me in my momma bed when I was just 15.  
That's why I had to lay him in his grave!"  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
Talking to a black man from Atlanta.  
He said "The time has come to take what's mine.  
And if I must bust a few heads to achieve justice,  
My righteous cause will well explain the crime!"  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess
