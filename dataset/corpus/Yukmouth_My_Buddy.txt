Me and You  
[Daz] And you know that  
Me and You  
  
[Daz]  
Who can fade it, two assassins up on the mic  
Blastin', askin' no questions, when they catch you in a gunfight  
Kaboom! We still mash as a team  
As we mash for our dreams, (?) hood niggaz for green  
It's Dillinger, fulfillin, makin a low outta killin  
Pullin' scandalous (?) fulfillin fantasy dreams  
Catch me on a Costa Rica, with an island full of weed  
Money and bitches, on a boat for Sweden  
  
[Numskull]  
See when I'm yellin'  
International help me  
No colorlines on my  
Ugly and fine  
You can sell me  
I'm glad folks think the same way as I do  
Cause I stab bitches way down in the Bayou  
Would you make way for two mo'  
Fo' blows, like you have hoes  
Stamp a nation wide through the ghetto  
Fore youngsters, Hennesy sponsors  
With fore youngsters on a  
Quarter of the map now I do  
  
[Daz]  
I spin mayor loot and khaki suits  
Nike's and cripsacks,  
Wetsuits and leather boots  
I block niggaz twice with thighs  
Buck with a .45  
Make you open while you blast at the parking lot  
  
[Numskull]  
What you speakin' on  
Want to go through it  
Drink a lot, made from fluid  
Scrump bitch, don't you hear the music  
My buddy, Daz Dilly and Numskull  
You will be thanked  
With you're petty pang petty  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
To all my niggaz.. and all my bitches  
Throw your motherfuckin hands in the air  
And if you don't give a fuck  
Like we don't give a fuck then  
Throw your motherfuckin hood up in the air  
  
[Kurupt]  
Check it out  
No bitch ass niggaz, no funny ass hoes  
Dogg Pound Gangstas drippin' in low-lows  
You ain't all about th
