Forever's a lonely time and the dogs aren't always  
Aren't always on my mind  
'Cause I didn't free them  
The scenery is burning me 'cause I'm still in it  
So why don't you free me  
'Cause its not my business  
What he's done to me  
Control is all you really need  
And I can't believe it  
I can't believe that  
You didn't see me  
  
Passing glances fall on me  
Like screams on deaf ears  
They're all laughing at me  
With encouraging cheers  
What he's done to me  
Control is all you really need  
And I can't believe it  
I can't believe that  
You wouldn't free me  
  
Why don't you see me?  
Why don't you free me?  
I can't believe that  
You don't believe me  
  
I guess I had it comin'  
My fault for not runnin'  
I just dressed too tempting  
'Cause your heads fuckin empty  
And I can't believe it  
I can't believe that you didn't see me
