He wakes up early today,  
Throws on a mask that will alter his face.  
No one knows his real name,  
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave.  
  
He pretends he's okay, but you should see.  
In his bed, late at night he's petrified.  
  
Take me out, finish this waste of a life.  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone gather around for a show.  
Watch as this man disappears as we know.  
Do me a favor and try to ignore,  
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor.  
[End Chorus]  
  
He thinks that faith might be dead,  
Nothing kills man faster than his own hand.  
He used to dream things at night,  
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes.  
  
He pretends he's okay, but you should see.  
In his bed, late at night he's petrified.  
  
Take me out, finish this waste of a life.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me out, finish this waste of a life.  
  
Everyone gather around for a show,  
Watch as this man disappears as we know.  
Do me a favor and try to ignore,  
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor...  
  
'Cause nobody knows his life.
