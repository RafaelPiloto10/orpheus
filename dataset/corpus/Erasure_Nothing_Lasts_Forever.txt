  
When you touch I love it so much  
Only then do I know that you're mine  
Strangely I long to be  
Just standing here right by your side  
For all the saintly things you've done  
It's not enough to hold you  
When all the changes surely come  
I'm pulling you back to my heart  
Nothing lasts forever  
Just a brief glimpse in time  
I see it in your eyes  
I wanna know you're mine  
Don't know why I break down and cry  
When I know that you won't be around  
Come to me I surely be  
Just ready to lay on the ground  
For all the saintly things you've done  
It's not enough to hold you  
When all the changes surely come  
I'm tugging you back to my heart  
Nothing lasts forever  
Just a brief glimpse in time  
I see it in your eyes  
I wanna know your mind  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
Our love will eclipse the night  
No more pain no sorrow  
Our love has taken flight  
Nothing lasts forever  
Just a brief glimpse in time  
I see it in your eyes
