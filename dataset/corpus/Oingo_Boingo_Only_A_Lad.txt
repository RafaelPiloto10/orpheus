Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell,  
Everyone said, "If you don't get straight  
You'll surely go to hell."  
  
But Johnny didn't care,  
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old,  
He didn't want to do what he was told  
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster.  
  
His teachers didn't understand,  
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age,  
Just because he didn't want to learn things  
He had other interests  
He liked to burn things!  
  
The lady down the block,  
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad,  
So he took it the first chance he had.  
Then he shot her in the leg,  
And this is what she said  
"Only a lad. You really can't blame him."  
"Only a lad. Society made him."  
"Only a lad. He's our responsibility."  
Oh, oh, oohh oh oh oh  
"Only a lad. He really couldn't help it."  
"Only a lad. He didn't want to do it."  
"Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused."  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh oh ohhh, oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
  
His parents gave up, they couldn't influence his attitude,  
Nobody could help.  
The little man had no gratitude.  
  
And when he stole the car,  
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far.  
He didn't mean to hit the poor man,  
Who had to go and die.  
It made the judge cry.  
  
"Only a lad. He really couldn't help it."  
"Only a lad. He didn't want to do it."  
"Only a lad. He's underprivileged and abused."  
Perhaps a little bit confused?  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh  
  
It's not his fault that he can't believe,  
It's not his fault that he can't behave,  
Society made him go astray.  
  
Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away,  
Perhaps he'll go away,  
He'll go away  
  
"Only a lad. You really can't blame him."  
"Only a lad. Society made him."  
"Only a lad. He's our responsibility."  
  
Hey there Johnny you really don't fool me,  
You get away with murder,  
And you think it's funny!  
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh,  
Hey there Johnny boy,  
I hope you fry!  
  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh, ohh ohh ohh oh oh.
