Summer death, slow step  
Walk behind the mother of the thirteen year old brown-eyed boy  
Attitudes, attitudes  
Sloganized by middle boots  
The men who slogged the brown-eyed boy  
  
And it's the end of everything that you've been told about  
Decency, honesty  
And it's the end of holding back and breaking bones and building bombs  
And hanging witch-hunts conducted by men of such opinion  
  
Repeat first verse  
  
And it's the end of building roads to load the dead to someone else's field  
And it's the end of falling back on breaking backs and aching handshakes  
And playing fields conducted by men of such opinion  
  
But the fathers crossed you boys  
I fire so heaven knows it only righteous folk  
But righteous taste hold the keys to sitting grace  
To conduct and to proclaim decisions made of such opinions  
  
And it's the time of summer days  
When children sing about the killing fields  
Winter melts the snow and knees will crack on rock  
And the iron on earth beneath the dearth bequeathed  
??? By men of such opinion
