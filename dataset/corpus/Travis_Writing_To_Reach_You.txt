Every day I wake up and it's Sunday  
What evers in my eye won't go away  
The radio is playing all the usual  
And what's a wonder wall anyway?  
  
Because my inside is outside  
My right side's on the left side  
Cause I'm writing to reach you now but,  
I might never reach you  
I only want to teach you, about you,  
But that's not you  
  
It's good to know that you are home for Christmas  
It's good to know that you are doing well  
It's good to know that you're no longer hurting  
It's good to know I'm feeling not so well  
  
Because my inside in outside  
My right side's on the left side  
Cause I'm writing to reach you now but  
I might never reach you  
I only want to teach you,  
About you, but that's not you  
To know it's true, but that won't do  
  
Maybe then tomorrow will be Monday  
And whatever's in my eye should go away  
Still the radio keeps playing all the usual  
And what's a wonder wall anyway?  
  
Because my inside in outside  
My right side's on the left side  
Cause I'm writing to reach you  
I might never reach you  
I only want to teach you,  
About you, but that's not you  
And you know it's true, but that won't do  
And you know it's you, I'm talking to
