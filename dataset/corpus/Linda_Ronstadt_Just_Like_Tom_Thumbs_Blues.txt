When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too  
And your gravity fails and negativity won't pull you through  
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue  
They got some hungry women there  
And they'll really make a mess out of you  
Well, if you see Saint Annie please tell her thanks a lot  
I cannot move and my fingers they are all in a knot  
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot  
And my best friend the doctor won't even say what it is I got  
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom  
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room  
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon  
And she takes your voice and she leaves you howling at the moon  
Well, up on housing project hill  
It's either fortune or fame  
You must pick one or the other  
Though neither of them are to be what they claim  
And if you're looking to get silly  
You better go back to from where you came  
Because the cops don't need you  
And man they expect the same  
Now all the authorities they just stand around and boast  
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post  
And picking up Angel who just arrived here from the coast  
Who looked so fine at first and she left looking just like a ghost  
Well, I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff  
Everybody said they'd stand beside me when the game got rough  
But the joke was on me there was nobody even there to bluff  
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough
