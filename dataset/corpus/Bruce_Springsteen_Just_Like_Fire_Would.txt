One night in a motel room  
Eyes cast like steel  
I drank the wine that they left on my table  
I knew the morning was too far  
I smoked my last cigarette  
I stay only to get by  
The night was dark and the land was cold  
I was frozen right to the bone  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up, oh  
  
Five hundred miles I have gone today  
Tomorrow it's five hundred more  
Outside my window the world passes by  
Its stranger than a dream  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
  
I go to work and I earn my pay, lord  
My sweat falls to the ground  
I see you now but we may never meet again child  
The ice is hanging on the door  
  
One night in a motel room  
Eyes cast like steel  
I drank the wine that they left on my table  
Knew the morning was too far  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up
