Bright morning lights  
Wipe the sleep from another day's eye  
Turn away from the wall  
And there's Nothing at all  
Being naked and afraid  
In the open space of my bed  
  
I'll be with you now  
I'll be with you now  
I'll be with you now  
We lie on a cloud  
We lie...  
  
Just as I am  
I awoke with a tear on my tongue  
I awoke with a feeling of never before  
In my sleep I discover the one  
But she ran with the morning sun  
  
I'll be with you now  
I'll be with you now  
I'll be with you now  
We lie on a cloud  
We lie...  
Another time, another place  
We lie...  
Another child has lost the race  
We lie...  
Another time, another place  
We lie...  
Your time, your price  
  
We lie...  
Another time, another place  
We lie...  
Another child has lost...
