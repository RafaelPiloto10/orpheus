Atom bombs  
Something's wrong  
D. E. A sent to Guam  
Acid trips  
Big fat chicks  
Purple Flintstone vitamins  
All the needy, rich are greedy  
I find out  
You don't need me  
Berlin Wall starts to fall  
I trip out to the wall  
  
Hooray Hoorah (x8)  
  
You think I'm stupid  
Stay out of my way  
You think I'm stupid  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Ku Klux Klan makes a plan  
To destroy the black man  
Air pollution, no soloution  
What is causing this confusion  
Anarchism satanism  
Anti-Christ socialism  
A man's brain is deranged  
So we think he's insane  
  
Hoo-ray Hoo-rah (x8)  
  
You think I'm stupid  
Stay out of my way  
You think I'm stupid  
Yeah yeah yeah
