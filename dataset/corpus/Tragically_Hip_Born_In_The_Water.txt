Rolling hill all covered in suede  
I'm heat-nervous and out of road  
Downtown there's a parade  
But I don't think I wanna go  
Smart as trees in Sault Ste Marie  
I can speak my mother tongue  
Passing laws just because  
And singing songs of the English unsung  
  
How could you do it?  
How could you even try?  
When you were born in the water  
And you were raised up in the sky?  
  
Front seats stamped by the window  
No erasees in this game  
Arbitrary as the wind blows  
It's another way to lay claim  
Ain't no cause for bloodthirst  
In a little town so dry  
Where the angels dance on a pinhead  
Just to make room for you and I  
How could you do it?  
How could you even try?  
When you were born in the water  
And you were raised up in the sky  
  
Thoroughbreds with their great big heads  
Think a mile might be too far  
Highway horses laugh, but of course  
When they don't know where the hell they are  
Smart as trees an Sault Ste Marie  
Victorious mother tongue  
Passing laws just because  
Singing songs of the English unsung  
  
Well how could you do it?  
How could you even try?  
When you were born in the water  
And you were raised up in the sky?
