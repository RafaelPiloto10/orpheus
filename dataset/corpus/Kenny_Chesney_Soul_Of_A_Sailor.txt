He walked in with a salty sway  
Lookin' like Blackbeard in his day  
A brother in arms just like me  
I was born a son of the sea  
I can't be still, I can't be tied  
The only time I feel alive is  
  
When the wind fills my sail  
Riding on a lifelong swell  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor  
  
He slid a stool and a beer to me  
Said, you know, we're both a dying breed  
Here's to love lost and new found friends  
And living out life in the boat we're in  
I can't be still, I can't be tied  
The only time I feel alive is  
  
When the wind fills my sail  
Riding on a lifelong swell  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor  
  
Let my heart take me where it wants to go  
That's the soul of a sailor, the soul of a sailor
