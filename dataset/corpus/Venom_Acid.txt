My brain fed with ecstacy  
Fills my need  
As I feel my body burst with great speed  
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist  
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list  
A)Feel that rush,with that gold  
Satanic dust  
Feel that pain,the drug induce through  
My veins  
I will in life as I will in death  
Sow the seeds with every breath  
Never will I run,never will I hide  
Only to express myself and feel it deep  
Inside  
Acid  
Now I dream in comatose neuotic state  
As my paranoia grows I must wait  
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die  
Then I'll hit the drug again,take me high  
B) Feel that buzz,for all the goddam  
Good it does  
Feel the flight,that flies me in through  
Day and night  
Now inside my arteries there's no blood
