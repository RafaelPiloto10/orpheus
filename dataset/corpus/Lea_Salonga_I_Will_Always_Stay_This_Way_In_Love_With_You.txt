(boy katindig)  
  
I never lost the love that I had given you  
With all the things that we have both been through  
I never stayed in love before  
As much as I have stayed in love with you  
You never thought the feelings meant for you were true  
'cause every time we're all alone you'd wonder  
If I really never changed  
And if I really stayed in love with you  
Love  
It means just you and me to stay together  
Even if there's nothing more  
The best is there forever  
Love  
We have to stay this way in love forever  
Even if you change your ways  
I'll always stay this way 'cause I  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay in love this way  
Love  
It means just you and me to stay together  
Even if there's nothing more  
The best is there forever  
Love  
We have to stay this way in love forever  
Even if you change your ways  
I'll always stay this way 'cause you  
You never thought the feelings meant for you were true  
'cause every time we're all alone you'd wonder  
If I really never changed  
And if I really stayed in love with you  
Love  
It means just you and me to stay together  
Even if there's nothing more  
The best is there forever  
Love  
We have to stay this way in love forever  
Even if you change your ways  
I'll always stay this way 'cause I  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay this way in love with you  
I will always stay in love this way
