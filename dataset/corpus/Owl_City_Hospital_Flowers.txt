I survived a dreadful accident,  
In the car crash of the century,  
My shattered hopes collapsed on cold cement,  
But in the back of the ambulance, I'd never felt so content.  
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,  
And now my vision can render the scene,  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,  
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.  
  
Da da da, da da da,  
Da da da, da da da.  
  
I tossed and turned, in sterile apathy,  
Until the violets arrived for me,  
The bouquet burst and blossoms filled the room,  
And the police got smaller as they grew taller,  
And taught me to bloom.  
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,  
And now my vision can render the scene,  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,  
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.  
The curtains decayed, the daylight poured in,  
I was never afraid, of the darkness again,  
My burns were third degree,  
  
But I'd been set free,  
'Cause grace had finally found its way to me.  
A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,  
And now my vision can render the scene,  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,  
Happiness returned to me,  
  
Da da da, da da da,  
Happiness returned to me,  
Da da da, da da da,  
Happiness returned to me,  
Through a grave emergency.  
Da da da, da da da,  
Da da da, da da da,  
Through a grave emergency.  
Da da da, da da da,  
Da da da, da da da,  
Happiness returned to me,  
Through a grave emergency
