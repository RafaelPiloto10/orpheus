I get out, I'll get out of all your boxes  
I get out, you can't hold me in these chains  
I'll get out  
Father free me from this bondage  
Knowin' my condition  
Is the reason I must change  
Your stinkin' resolution  
Is no type of solution  
Preventin' me from freedom  
Maintainin' your pollution  
I won't support your lie no more  
I won't even try no more  
If I have to die, oh Lord  
That's how I choose to live  
I won't be compromised no more  
I can't be victimised no more  
I just don't sympathize no more  
'cause now I understand  
You just want to use me  
You say "love" then abuse me  
You never thought you'd loose me  
But how quickly we forget  
That nothin' is for certain  
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'  
Your guilt trip's just not workin'  
Repressin' me to death  
'cause now I'm choosin' life, yo  
I'll take the sacrifice, yo  
If everything must go, then go  
That's how I choose to live  
Heh... hehehehehe...  
Ok, we gettin' there  
At least I had a chunk  
Aight ok, it's how I choose to live  
Hehehe, awww  
No more compromises  
I see past your diguises  
Blindin' through mind control  
Stealin' my eternal soul  
Appealin' through material  
To keep me as your slave  
But I get out  
Oh, I get out of all your boxes  
I'll get out  
Oh, you can't hold me in these chains  
I get out  
Oh, I want out of social bondage  
Knowin' my condition  
Oh, is the reason I must change  
See what you see is what you get  
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet  
Oh, I don't care if you're upset  
I could care less if you're upset  
See it don't change the truth  
And your hurt feeling's no excuse  
To keep me in this box  
Psychological locks  
Repressin' true expression  
Cementin' this repression  
Promotin' mass deception  
So that no one can be healed  
I don't respect your system  
I won't protect your system  
When you talk I don't listen  
Oh, let my Father's will be done  
And just get out  
Oh, just get out of all these bondage  
Just get out  
Oh, you can't hold me in chains  
Just get out  
All these traditions killin' freedom  
Knowin' my condition  
Is the reason I must change  
I've just accepted what you said  
Keepin' me among the dead  
The only way to know  
Is to walk then learn and grow  
But faith is not your speed  
Oh, you've had everyone believed  
That you're the sole authority  
Just follow the majority  
Afraid to face reality  
The system is a joke  
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul  
Oh, when escape is mind control  
You spent your life in sacrifice  
To a system for the dead  
Oh, are you sure...  
Where is the passion in this living  
Are you sure it's God you servin'  
Obligated to a system  
Getting less then you're deserving  
Who made up these schools, I say  
Who made up these rules, I say  
Animal conditioning  
Oh, just to keep us as a slave  
Oh, just get out  
Of this social purgatory  
Just get out  
All these traditions are alive  
Just get out  
Superstition killing freedom  
Knowin' my condition  
Is the reason I must die, ahh  
Just get out  
Just get out  
Just get out  
Let's get out  
Let's get out  
Knowin' my condition  
Is the reason I must die  
Just get out
