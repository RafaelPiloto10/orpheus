Now MIssy she too much for me (Im freaky)  
Took her to her crib and she told me (eat me)  
Now Ima big momma told her ass not to beat me  
Broke ass wanna fight me  
Missy know how to treat me  
Sittin on cash  
got money out the ass  
gave me the back shots  
got money out the ass  
Now you can see me in the coop like what  
next time I hit it in the G5 truck  
I got the magic stick  
I can go for hours  
from the bed to the floor to the sink to the shower  
wit her back to the bed and her legs to the sky  
I can go hard  
know why  
big girls dont cry  
I got visions of missywit her money by the tub  
Ching ching

Im looking for missy now so i can get my back rub  
Dis the shit she holla'd in my ear before we hit the club
