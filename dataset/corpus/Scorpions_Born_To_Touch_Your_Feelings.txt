I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling  
  
Close your eyes and I'll try to get in  
To waken your heart like the sping  
'Cause I was born to touch your feelings  
  
Steal the time, take a song and be glad  
Be free as the birds, don't be sad  
Your time will come, I'll make you feel it  
You're still young like the sun after rain  
Follow the light it's not in vain  
And you will see I'll touch your feelings  
  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
  
You were born just to lose or to win  
To be someone's chime in the wind  
To live between your mind and feelings  
Find your way, check it out  
Learn each day  
Follow the light, it's not in vain  
And you will see I'll touch your feelings  
  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
  
I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling  
I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling
