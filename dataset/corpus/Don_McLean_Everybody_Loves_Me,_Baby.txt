One, two, three, four!  
  
Fortune has me well in hand, armies wait at my command  
My gold lies in a foreign land buried deep beneath the sand  
The angels guide my ev'ry tread, my enemies are sick or dead  
But all the victories I've led haven't brought you to my bed  
  
You see, everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?  
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?  
  
Now the purest race I've bred for thee to live in my democracy  
And the highest human pedigree awaits your first-born boy, baby  
And my face on ev'ry coin engraved, the anarchists are all enslaved  
My own flag is forever waved by the grateful people I have saved  
  
You see, everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?  
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?  
  
Now, no land is beyond my claim when the land is seized in the people's name  
By evil men who rob and maim, if war is hell, I'm not to blame!  
Why, you can't blame me, I'm Heaven's child, I'm the second son of Mary mild  
And I'm twice removed from Oscar Wilde, but he didn't mind, why, he just
smiled  
  
Yes, and the ocean parts when I walk through, and the clouds dissolve and the
sky turns blue  
I'm held in very great value by everyone I meet but you  
'cause I've used my talents as I could, I've done some bad, I've done some
good  
I did a whole lot better than they thought I would so, c'mon and treat me like
you should!  
  
Because everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?  
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?  
  
Everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?  
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?  
  
Yeah, everybody loves me, baby, what's the matter with you?  
Won'tcha tell me what did I do to offend you?
