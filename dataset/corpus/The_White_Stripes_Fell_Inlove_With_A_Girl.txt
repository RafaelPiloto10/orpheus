I fell in love with a girl  
Fell in love once and almost completely  
She's in love with the world,  
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading  
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"  
I said I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating  
Come and kiss me by the riverside  
Yeah Bobby said its fine, he don't consider it cheating now  
  
Red hair with a curl  
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping  
Can't keep away from the girl  
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting  
Can't think of anything to do yeah my left brain knows that all love is
fleeting  
She's just looking for something new  
And I said it once before but it bears repeating, now  
  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
  
Can't think of anything to do  
Yeah my left brain knows that all love is fleeting  
She's just looking for something new, well  
I said it once before but it bears repeating
