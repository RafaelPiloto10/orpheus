Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo  
Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo  
  
Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,  
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,  
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'  
Grown-ups said "Get that thing out of here!"  
  
Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'  
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a  
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make  
Things disappear. But the father played too  
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the  
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass  
Disappears, He'd come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'  
No chair.  
  
People said to the father, "You get out  
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and  
Your son!" The boy and his father were  
Ostracized. That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town.  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories.  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat, people, up.  
Of course, nobody believed it, but they  
Told the story anyway.  
  
One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red  
Over the hill. And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window, they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And  
They could feel the whole ground shake.  
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'  
Strong men fainted "Ohh!" - "Run for  
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!"  
  
He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a  
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow  
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'  
Daniel, "Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run! Run!" Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up "Hey, Paw,  
What's coming over the field?" - Oh, Son,  
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him  
To lie down, I could make him disappear."  
  
The boy said "Come with me, Father." He  
Grabs his father by one hand. The father  
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the  
Ukelele. They run across the field. People  
Yelled, "Don't go near him! He'll eat you  
Alive!" There was Abiyoyo. He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.  
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush  
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash  
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.  
  
Well, you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to  
Dance "Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo," the boy  
Went faster, "Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo," The giant  
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat  
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out  
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.  
  
They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,  
"Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,  
We don t care anymore!" And they all sang:  
  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo  
(Oh, you sing it with me,)
