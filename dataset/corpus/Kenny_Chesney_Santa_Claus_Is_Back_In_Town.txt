Well it's Christmas-time pretty baby  
Snow is fallin' on the ground  
Well it's Christmas-time pretty baby  
Snow is fallin' on the ground  
You'll be a real good little baby  
Cause Santa Clause is back in town!  
  
Got no sleigh with reindeer  
No sack on my back  
Gonna see me comin' in a big black Cadillac  
  
Oooh Christmas-time pretty baby  
Snow is fallin' on the ground  
You'll be a real good little baby  
Cause Santa Clause is back in town, (yeah he's back in town)  
  
(ho, ho, ho, baby)  
  
Hang up your stockin'  
Turn out the light  
Santa Clause is coming  
Down your chimney tonight!  
  
Oooh Christmas-time pretty baby  
Snow is fallin' on the ground  
You'll be a real good little baby  
Cause Santa Clause is back in town  
  
You'll be a real good little baby  
Cause Santa Clause is back in town

Santa Clause is back in town
