Take one look at these small hands  
Bend down with power that can move mountains  
There's much more in store than we could understand  
I know we have to do anything  
  
Close your eyes and visualize  
Nothing is impossible for those who try  
Just the dream to fly as eagles fly across the sky  
I know we can  
  
See the rainbow 'round us all  
Hear the Angels when they call  
Find a way to reach inside  
Just dare to dream and walk with pride, yeah  
  
Hold on when a hope is gone  
Race may not begin to the swift or strong  
It's given to the ones who can enjoy for long  
I know we care  
  
See the rainbow 'round us all  
Hear the Angels when they call  
Find a way to reach inside  
Just dare to dream, oh, we will rise  
  
Rise up together and we'll go higher  
Find a step to make it through the fire  
Just dare to dream, I know we care  
  
See the rainbow 'round us all  
Hear the Angels when they call  
Find a way to reach inside  
Dare to dream and walk with pride  
  
We're together side by side  
Let's find a way to reach inside  
Walk with pride, oh  
  
See the rainbow 'round us all  
Hear the Angels when they call  
Find a way to reach inside  
Dare to dream and walk with pride  
  
We're still together side by side  
Let's find a way to reach inside
