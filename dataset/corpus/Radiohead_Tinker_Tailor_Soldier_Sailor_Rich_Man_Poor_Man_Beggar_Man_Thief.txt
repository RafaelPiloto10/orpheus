[Verse 1]  
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free  
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely  
And their prey  
  
[Chorus]  
The ones you light your fires to keep away  
Crawling out upon, expending  
And all you have to do is say yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
All the birds stay up in the trees  
All the fish swim down too deep and lonely  
And they pray  
Honey, come to me before it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
The ones you light your fires to keep away  
Is crawling out upon, expelling  
And all you have to do is say yeah
