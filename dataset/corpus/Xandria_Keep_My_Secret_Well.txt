Keep my secret well  
Like my eyes keep these tears  
It's raindrops on my face  
A thunderstorm has led me here  
Keep my secret well  
Like my lungs keep on breathing  
Until I close my eyes  
The last time it's beneath me  
Fot the case all is past and gone  
I'll keep my smile and carry on  
Don't ask for more  
Keep my secret well  
See how deep I fell  
Keep my secret well  
And I won't ask you for more  
Keep my secret well  
Like my veins keep my blood  
No wounds can be as deep  
As the love that I had
