Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
Next time I'll listen to my heart  
Next time, well I'll be smart  
That girl could still be mine  
But I'm tired of the hurt  
Tired of tryin'  
I'm tired of the pain  
Tired of tryin'  
I'm tired of cryin'
