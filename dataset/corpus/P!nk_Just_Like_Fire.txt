[Verse 1]  
I know that I'm running out of time,  
I want it all mmm mmm  
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off,  
I want it all mmm mmm  
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher,  
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars.  
Even when I give it all away,  
I want it all  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
Just like fire, burning up' the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day.  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'ma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire.  
  
[Verse 2]  
And people like to laugh at you cause they  
Are all the same.  
See I would rather we just go our different way,  
Than play the game.  
And no matter the weather, we can do it better,  
You and me together forever and ever.  
We don't have to worry about a thing,  
About a thing  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
Oh...  
  
  
[Chorus]  
Just like fire, burning out the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day.  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'mma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire, fire, fire.  
Running, running, running,  
We can here them runing, runing, runing.  
  
[Hook]  
So I came here to run it,  
Just cause nobody's done it,  
Y'all don't think I can run it,  
But look, I've been here, I've done it.  
Impossible? Please,  
Watch, I do it with ease,  
You just gotta believe,  
Come on, come on with me.  
  
Oh, what you gonna do? (What, what?!)  
Hay, what you gonna do? (What, what?!)  
Oh, what you gonna do? (What, what?!)  
Mmm, what you gonna do?  
  
[Bridge]  
Just like fire, burning out the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day.  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
  
[Outro]  
Just like fire, burning out the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day (one day! ).  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'mma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire, fire!  
Running, running, running,  
Just like fire!  
(Running, running, running...)
