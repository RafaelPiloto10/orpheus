Candy kisses wrapped in paper  
Mean more to you than any of mine  
Candy kisses wrapped in paper  
You'd rather have them any old time.  
  
You don't mean it when you whisper  
Those sweet love words in my ear  
Candy kisses wrapped in paper  
Mean more to you than mine do dear.  
  
I built a castle out of dreams, dear  
I thought that you were building, too  
Now my castles all have fallen  
And I am left alone and blue.  
  
Once my heart was filled with gladness  
Now there's sadness, only tears  
Candy kisses, wrapped in paper  
Mean more to you than mine do dear.
