They're days that make you fly  
They're days you want to cry  
Sometimes the walls come tumbling down  
They're moments in the dark  
When pain just floods your heart  
And you surrender one more time  
  
Just take a walk out in the rain  
With every drop that falls  
You know the sun will shine again  
  
They're days you're naturally high  
They're days you want to die  
Sometimes your world goes down in flames  
They're moments deep in love  
But when it breaks your heart  
You just surrender one more time  
  
Just take a walk out in the rain  
With every step you make  
You learn that life means constant change  
  
Tomorrow's all that counts  
As life goes round 'n round  
You gotta draw the line  
Goodbye yesterday  
Tomorrow's all that counts  
As life goes round 'n round  
And if you keep the faith  
Time will call your name  
  
Take a walk out in the rain  
With every breath you take  
You feel your soul is free again  
  
Tomorrow's all that counts  
As life goes round 'n round  
You gotta draw the line  
Goodbye yesterday  
Tomorrow's all that counts  
As life goes round 'n round  
And if you keep the faith  
Time will call your name  
Tomorrow's all that counts  
As life goes round 'n round  
You gotta draw the line  
Goodbye yesterday  
Tomorrow's all that counts  
As life goes round 'n round  
And if you keep the faith  
Time will call your name
