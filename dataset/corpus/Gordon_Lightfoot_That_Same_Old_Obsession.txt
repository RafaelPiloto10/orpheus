I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Early each day upon rising  
I think of my lost love from over the sea  
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air  
Peace in the sound of the river  
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold  
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul  
I long to return to the place I remember  
The taste of her lips close to mine  
I could do much better if I could be strong  
Come into my garden but leave me alone  
I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Just as the night comes stealing  
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name  
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart
