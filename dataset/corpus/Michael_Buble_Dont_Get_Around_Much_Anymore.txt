Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless, why stir up memories  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore
