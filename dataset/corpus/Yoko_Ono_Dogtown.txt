Okay  
  
The town's dawning, I'm the only one awake  
The streets are whistling, I light my fourth cigarette  
I think of my friends, they were once not so dead  
What are they thinking now?  
  
One day I'll be just a little stone  
Nobody'll know that the stone had such emotions  
Anyway I'm always on the run  
Someday I'll be remembered for the phone calls I never made  
  
Letters I never mailed  
And stories I never finished telling anyone  
  
The town's yawning, I let my dog walk me around  
He took a shoot and people smiled  
I tried the same and people frowned  
Yes, it's a dog, dogtown  
  
One day let's be a pair of trees  
Nobody'll know that the trees had such a history  
Anyway, wed never be this lonely  
Someday I'll be remembered for the fine words I meant to keep  
  
A warm smile I meant to leave  
And a true song I meant to finish writing all my life  
  
Yes, it's a dogtown, it's a dogtown  
Yes, it's a dogtown, it's a dogtown  
Dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dogtown  
  
Peas porridge luck, peas porridge stuck  
Peas porridge in the pot nine years old  
Some gets paid, some gets grades  
Some stays in the pot nine years old  
  
Yes, it's a dogtown, it's a dogtown  
Yes, it's a dogtown, it's a dogtown  
Dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dogtown  
  
Peas porridge loved, peas porridge spoiled  
Peas porridge in the pot nine years old  
Some gets laid, some gets slayed  
Some stays in the pot nine years old  
  
Yes, it's a dogtown, it's a dogtown  
Yes, it's a dogtown, it's a dogtown  
Dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dogtown  
  
Dogtown, dogtown, dogtown, dogtown  
Dogtown, dogtown, dogtown
