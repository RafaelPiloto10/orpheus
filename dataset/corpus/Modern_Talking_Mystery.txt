Oh - love is a mystery  
Oh - love is a mystery  
  
She was the sister of Margarita, it was long long ago  
And I told her that I need her, so much she would'nt know  
And her brother was Juanito, he was a friend of mine  
And I told him that I missing her, but she has no time  
And I said Marie amore, you're the girl I adore  
  
Love is a mystery, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
It's like history, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
  
It's ending on the floor, in the heat of the night  
With the hands in the air and I hold her tight  
And the "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
I know this girl is a mystery  
  
I drank a lot of cool tequilas, should I go or should I stay  
My heart told me I need her, but I'm too shy to say  
I drank a lot of Caipirinhas, I was walking like on air  
And I told her that I love her, baby on I swear  
I said Marie amore, you're the girl I adore  
  
Love is a mystery, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
It's like history, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
  
It's ending on the floor, in the heat of the night  
With the hands in the air and I hold her tight  
And the "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
I know this girl is a mystery  
  
Oh - love is a mystery  
Oh - love is a mystery  
  
Love is a mystery, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
It's like history, with a "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
  
It's ending on the floor, in the heat of the night  
With the hands in the air and I hold her tight  
And the "L" and an "O" and a "V" and an "E"  
I know this girl is a mystery  
  
Oh - love is a mystery  
Oh - love is a mystery
