Brainwashed in our childhood  
Brainwashed by the school  
Brainwashed by our teachers  
And Brainwashed by all their rules  
  
Brainwashed by our leaders  
By our Kings and Queens  
Brainwashed in the open and brainwashed behind the scenes  
  
God God God  
A voice cries in the wilderness  
God God God  
It was on the longest night  
God God God  
An eternity of darkness  
God God God  
Someone turned out the spiritual light  
  
Brainwashed by the Nikkei  
Brainwashed by Dow Jones  
Brainwashed by the FTSE  
Nasdaq and secure loans  
Brainwashed us from Brussels  
Brainwashing us in Bonn  
Brainwashing us in Washington  
Westminster in London  
  
God God God  
You are the wisdom that we seek  
God God God  
The lover that we miss  
God God God  
Your nature is eternity  
God God God  
You are Existence, Knowledge, Bliss  
  
The soul does not love. It is love itself  
It does not exist. It is existence itself  
It does not know. It is knowledge itself  
How to know God, page 130  
  
They brainwashed my great uncle  
Brainwashed my cousin Bob  
They even got my grandma when she was working for the mob  
Brainwash you while you're sleeping  
While in your traffic jam  
Brainwash you while you're weeping  
While still a baby in your pram  
Brainwashed by the military  
Brainwashed under duress  
Brainwashed by the media  
You're brainwashed by the press  
Brainwashed by computers  
Brainwashed by mobile phones  
Brainwashed by the satellites  
Brainwashed to the bone  
  
God God God  
Won't you lead us through this mess  
God God God  
From the places of concrete  
God God God  
Nothing's worse than ignorance  
God God God  
I just won't accept defeat  
  
God God God  
Must be something I forgot  
God God God  
Down on Bullshit Avenue  
God God God  
If we can only stop the rot  
God God God  
Wish that you'd brainwash us too
