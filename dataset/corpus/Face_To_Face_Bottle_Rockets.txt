Thought that I'd be strong enough for both of us  
And you had given up  
Is there anybody strong enough for you  
She said she's scared of waking up  
She's realized it's all been a mistake  
She didn't have to be afraid  
But you walked out on me  
It doesn't really matter what you said  
'cause I've tried  
To turn this water into wine  
It doesn't have to be so hard to understand  
The things that we should do  
I know I made it difficult for you  
She said I couldn't give enough  
To make her feel the way she wanted to  
This doesn't have to be so hard  
But you walked out on me  
It doesn't really matter what you said  
And I tried  
To turn this water into wine  
It takes time  
Its not that way  
T here are several different answers here  
But you just walked away
