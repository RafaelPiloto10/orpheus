When you love someone so deeply  
They become your life  
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside  
Blindly I imagined I could  
Keep you under glass  
Now I understand to hold you  
I must open up my hands  
And watch you rise  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were meant to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
I have learned that beauty  
Has to flourish in the light  
Wild horses run unbridled  
Or their spirit dies  
You have given me the courage  
To be all that I can  
And truly feel your heart will  
Lead you back to me when you're  
Ready to land  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were ment to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
I can't pretend these tears  
Aren't over flowing steadily  
I can't prevent this hurt from  
Almost overtaking me  
ButI will stand and say goodbye  
For you'll never be mine  
Until you know the way it feels to fly  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were ment to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were ment to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
So flutter through the sky  
Butterfly  
Spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly
