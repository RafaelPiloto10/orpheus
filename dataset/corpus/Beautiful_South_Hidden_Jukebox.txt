Hey church I was thinking  
The Third World seems to be sinking  
Can't you all get over there  
And we'll have them all over here  
  
And you can learn to catch your own food  
And you can learn to build your own hut  
And we'll make up the usual excuse  
To keep them in the pubs till they're shut  
  
Hey skin, I just thought  
The doctrine Hitler has taught  
Is still kicking off in the States  
Can't you go and join with your mates  
  
Join up with the clueless clan  
Dress up in a bag and a skirt  
End up looking like a jerk  
Meanwhile we'll have gone mad  
  
And the hidden jukebox plays us a song  
For each and everyone  
For black, white, straight and the gay  
Celebrate you being away  
  
Hey Turk I was thinking  
OK so l may have been drinking  
You can come drink over here  
And we'll fuck them off over there  
  
Whisky for the Greek and the Turk  
Gin for the Arab and the Jew  
A double arsenic for Mister Le Pen  
Cause it's him who soils Europe and not you  
  
And the hidden jukebox plays us a song  
Everyone should sing along  
With a message that'll ring and ring  
These are the words that we sing
