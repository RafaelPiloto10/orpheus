In the greenhouse  
Among the flowers  
You would linger, linger there for hours  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
What were you thinking  
Was this the jungle?  
I felt the good earth, I felt the good earth rumble  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
You were smiling  
The heat was rising  
The blood-red roses hypnotizing  
In the greenhouse  
You were waiting  
And the perfume was suffocating  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse
