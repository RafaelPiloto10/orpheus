Lonely am I  
Only my thoughts crowd the room  
Why can't I cry?  
  
Time passes me by  
The cold touch of dawn tells me so  
Still, I can' t cry  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
You'd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday you'd go  
  
Flames in the fire  
Can't warm the chill of my room  
Why can't I cry?  
  
Feel I want to die  
Just how much more can I take  
If I can't cry?  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
You'd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday you'd go  
  
I multiply all of the hours you've been gone  
Still, I can't cry  
Lonely am I  
Why can't I cry?
