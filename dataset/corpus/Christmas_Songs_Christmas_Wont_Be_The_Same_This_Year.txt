"Merry Christmas everybody!  
Yeah, Merry Christmas everybody, big deal...  
Hey man, what's wrong with you Jermaine?  
Yeah, that's not kind of attitude...  
This only happens once a year!  
Hey, fellas, don't bug him!  
He and his girl just broke up, so get off his back!  
Can't you see there's tears in his eyes?  
Yeah, he's cryin'... "  
  
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry  
  
Christmas won't be the same this year  
Without her loving arms holding you so near  
Christmas won't be the same this year  
(No, it won't, now, darlin', no, no)  
Without her loving arms holding you so near  
  
I see the lights  
But they don't shine for me  
I see the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
Our house is decorated  
My friends are celebrating  
  
No, no, it won't be the same this year  
The things we used to do  
Now Darling, it's all over  
  
The neighborhood kids  
Are having so much fun  
Counting off the days  
'Til Santa Claus comes  
And I see the mistletoe  
Hanging from my door  
I wish I could kiss you again  
Like I did before  
  
So go on, girl  
And have your fun  
Don't spoil your time  
Thinking about me  
This time next year, my darling dear  
Hopefully, you'll be having dinner with me  
  
No, no, it won't be the same without you, my darling
