I don't need no money, honey  
Fortune and fame  
'Cause I got all the riches, baby  
That one man can claim  
So take off your coat and close the door  
Forget about your pride  
I'm not afraid of falling down  
Or staying up all night  
You're gonna see it my way now  
Don't try to bring me down  
My life's a circus, an insane chain of circumstances  
  
I never had a lot to lose  
I never let it slow me down  
I never had a lot of love now, honey  
Never had a lot to lose  
  
I can't explain the time it takes  
To make you understand  
I know you'll get to like it  
If you only get the chance  
I hope I get some time tonight  
To see you comin' 'round  
What can I give you in return  
For one night on the town  
My life's a circus, an insane chain of circumstances  
  
But not till daylight, not till daylight, not to daylight  
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight,  
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight  
  
I tried to tell you  
It's a pain you can't hide  
My life's a circus  
An insane chain of circumstances  
  
I never had a lot of love  
I never had too much money  
I never let it slow me down now, honey  
I never had a lot to lose
