My troublin' mind tonight is drifting  
To a cottage far away  
And as restless cattle wander  
I can hear a sweet voice say.  
  
"You are leaving, Jack, your darling  
With a lonesome broken heart  
But I'll wait in Lonesome Valley  
Tho' we may be far apart. "  
  
Yes, so well do I remember  
Of the night we say goodbye  
There were teardrops on your cheeks, dear  
As I left your loving side.  
  
But when round up time is over  
Wheter skies are dark or fair  
I'll ride back to Lonesome Valley  
For I know I'll find you there.  
  
You are my queen of Lonesome Valley  
By your side I know no care  
Nights out on the lonesome prairie  
You have been my guiding star.  
  
Soon my faithful paint I'll saddle  
And beneath the western sky  
I'll ride back to Lonesome Valley  
And you'll be my blushing bride...
