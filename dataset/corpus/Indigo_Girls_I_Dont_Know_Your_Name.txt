Emily:  
I walked into my favorite place one night  
Id just gotten back from a lecture  
And I was feeling kind of uptight  
And at the edge of the bar there was this guy  
And you know I wasnt really looking  
But I caught him out of the corner of my eye  
The next thing I know he was moving my way  
I thought he wanted to talk  
But this is what he had to say  
  
Amy:  
I don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Yall sing it with me  
I don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Your lover your lover your lover  
One time or another baby  
I want to be your lover  
  
Emily:  
I have to admit I was a little bit surprised  
But I wasnt really scared cause I was twice his size  
So I said to myself, okay, Ill play his game  
And when he turned to me  
I gave him my name  
  
Amy:  
I know your name babe  
But I got to know your number  
I know your name babe  
But I got to know your number your number  
I said one time or another baby  
I'm gonna be your lover  
Yeah I wanna be your lover  
  
Emily:  
Well I said to myself this guy is persistent  
Hes a little bit dumb but at least hes consistent  
I tried to talk cool but when we touched I went under  
I made a quick decision and I gave him my number  
  
Amy:  
I know your number  
But I don't know what to say babe  
  
Emily:  
That's ok  
  
Amy:  
I know your number  
Your number babe  
But I don't know what to say to you  
Say to you say to you say to you darling  
Oh it don't matter anyway no  
I don't talk when I'm make love to you babe  
I don't talk when I make love  
I wanna be you lover  
I wanna be you lover  
Lover lover  
Lover lover  
Lover lover  
  
Emily:  
Well you probably wont believe this  
But we got married one day  
And I still don't know if he speaks english  
Cause he doesn't have much to say  
Its a damn good thing I like lying around  
We don't make much conversation  
But love makes sounds  
You know what I'm talking about  
Yall know what I'm talking about  
Well one thing I've learned from being in this state  
  
Emily and amy:  
There are other ways to communicate  
  
Amy:  
I don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Your lover your lover your lover  
One time or another baby  
I'm gonna be your lover
