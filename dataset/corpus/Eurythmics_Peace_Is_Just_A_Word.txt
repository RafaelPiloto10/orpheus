Stop the world, turn out the sun  
I'm so tired of it turning round  
Stop the world, call it a day  
Leave it all behind, leave it that way  
Peace, is just a word, is just a word  
Peace, is just a word, yeah  
Stop the world, just let it bleed  
Well, we've taken more than everything we need  
Stop the world, just shut it down  
(Just shut it down, shut it down)  
(Just shut it down, shut it down)  
There's no point in it spinning around  
I tell you little peace, is just a word, is just a word  
Everyday that peace, is just a word, yeah  
Stop the world, take it any where  
It's just that, living here is more than I can bear  
(More than I can bear, ooh)  
Stop the world, just pack it in  
Well, we've reached the point, where no one ever wins  
No one ever wins  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word, it?s just a word  
Peace, is just a word  
Peace, is just a word  
Peace, is just a word  
...
