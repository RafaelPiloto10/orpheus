  
  
  
  
Gotta get back  
  
Gotta figure out a way  
  
I'm losing my senses to you  
  
Where'd it go the bluebird I should follow  
  
Back home? But where is home?  
  
Guess it won't amount to much  
  
Won't be long before I crush  
  
I'll stand in line  
  
Don't believe a thing they say today  
  
Seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs  
  
All alone  
  
But I'm in a crowded room  
  
I'm sinking in quicksand tonight  
  
You pick me up , and I shine across the sky till morning , then you  
  
colour me in  
  
Guess it won't amount  
  
to much  
  
Seems to me I've lost my touch  
  
I'm back in line  
  
Don't believe a thing they say today  
  
Turn around and walk away  
  
Everything will go your way , I pray  
  
Seems we all get lost amongst the pigeons and the crumbs
