Slow and easy is a dimension  
Gonna laugh it up  
Laugh it up  
They say you make no fool of you  
And it's new for you to gaze  
Up and down inside your yourself  
Inside yourself  
It's good in here  
It's pretty far out  
Yes we're all just learning how to smile  
We're looking out to you  
We're looking out to you and you and you and you and you  
  
Show your love  
Bite me now  
Put a hand in and take it out  
You can try to make me mad  
Or change my mind  
Be careful  
So you want me there now  
So you want me there now  
  
Barely moving I stagger  
Some interpretation  
There's a buzzing in the station  
Spinning station unravel me  
Cross platforms with rehearsed travel  
Rehearse travel  
Rehearse travel  
Rehearse travel
