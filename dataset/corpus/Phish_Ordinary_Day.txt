I just went about my business  
I really don't have much to say  
The city cars just keep on rolling along  
It's just an ordinary day  
  
Pat Sajak spun his big wheel  
Vanna White clapped her hands  
The sun came up and down  
The Earth still spun around  
It's just an ordinary day  
  
Did you read the morning paper?  
Did you brush your teeth?  
We have only scratched the surface  
Much more is lying underneath  
  
Eggs and bacon for my breakfast  
With some orange juice on the side  
It don't take a brilliant genius  
To see that life's a bit cockeyed  
To see that life's a bit cockeyed  
Well, I just went about my business  
I really don't have much to say  
The city cars just keep on rolling along  
It's just an ordinary day
