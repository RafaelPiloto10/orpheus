I gotta stay in the race  
The die has been cast  
That's the way I'm going  
I tried to jump the river  
That flows so fast  
But it just keeps flowing  
  
It's a hell of a journey  
And I just can't wait  
There's no way I can hide it  
But it's a killer of a storm  
And it looks like rain  
I guess I've got to ride it  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Ain't no question if you win or lose  
Whether it's cold or rainy  
Gotta find my place whatever I choose  
Never Say if or maybe  
And there's so many turns that I can see  
In a world that I'm no stranger  
I'm in the race and now I can't turn back  
Survive in the face of danger  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know
