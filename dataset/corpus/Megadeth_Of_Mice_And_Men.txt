The fire burns on and on  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
  
Back when I was just seventeen  
I thought that I knew everything  
I could make it in this scene  
To be a rising star that only gleamed  
But all the answers disagreed  
With the questions held for me  
I was legal now at twenty-one  
  
I knew the way the world should run  
My God just look what I had done  
Simply drunk and having fun  
Looked for friends, but I found none  
All alone at twenty-one  
  
The fire burns on and on  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
  
The fire burns on and on  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
  
At twenty-five I was surprised  
That I was still even half alive  
Somehow I managed to survive  
I felt my body's doing time  
And In my back a hundred knives  
From friends at twenty-five  
  
And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell  
I'd buy your life, if you would sell  
A year or two, if less compelled  
So live your life and live it well  
There's not much left of me to tell  
I just got back up each time I fell  
The fire burns on and on  
  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
The fire burns on and on  
  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
The fire burns on and on  
  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
The fire burns on and on  
  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
The fire burns on and on  
  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men  
The fire burns on and on  
  
That drives me on till all is gone  
Except the simple plans  
Of mice and men
