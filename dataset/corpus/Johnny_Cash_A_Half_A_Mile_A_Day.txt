I'm comin' Lord, for my heavenly reward  
I'm comin' home to you, can you see me comin' thru  
Thru clouds of persecution, and stumblin' on my way  
I 'spect I'm only makin', 'bout a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,  
It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day  
  
Lord, when I let you lead, I never make much speed  
"Cause I have to stop and touch, the ones who need so much  
Then sometimes others pull me, off of Your narrow way  
And by my mistakes, I barely make, a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,  
It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day
