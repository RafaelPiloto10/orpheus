I heard you sing a rebel song  
Sung it loud and all alone  
We can't afford the things you save  
We can't afford the warranty  
  
Well I see you walking in the glare  
Down the county road we share  
Our southern blood my heresy  
Damn that ol' confederacy  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you won't  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
I'm sorry for what you've learned  
(learned)  
When you feel the tables turn  
To run so hard in your race  
(race)  
Now you found who set the pace  
  
The landed aristocracy  
Exploiting all your enmity  
All your daddies fought in vain  
Leave you with the mark of Cain  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you won't  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you  
  
The center holds so they say  
(it never held too well for me)  
It never held too well for me  
(the center holds so they say)  
I won't stop short for common ground  
(that vilifies the trodden down)  
That vilifies the trodden down  
(i won't stop)  
  
The center held the bonded slave  
For the sake of industry  
(ah)  
The center held the bloody hand  
Of the executioner man  
(ah)  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you won't  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you
