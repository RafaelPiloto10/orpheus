Deep in my dreams,  
I saw you close by my side.  
And the words you said to me,  
Made me reel down deep inside.  
My hand in your hand,  
So warm and so lovingly.  
Leaving all my dreams behind,  
Wonder who my prince will be?  
  
[Chorus:]  
What is this wonder,  
That love can make you feel?  
Am I deep now in slumber,  
Or is my prince real?  
Now, now my dream,  
Is standing close by my side.  
Saying words I wish to hear,  
And I'm reeling deep inside.  
  
[Chorus]  
Morning has come,  
My dreams are left far behind.  
As I walk through Paris streets,  
I know now what I shall find.  
This smile on my face,  
Will carry a love I have known.  
Like a fairytale come true,  
Oh, what joy this love has shown
