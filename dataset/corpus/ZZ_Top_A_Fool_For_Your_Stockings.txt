Is it you again outside  
Just banging on the front door?  
You say you had enough  
Now you're comin' back for more  
But that's alright  
I said that, "That's alright"  
I may not want to admit it  
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe  
Now I don't mind when you send money  
And bring your girlfriends with you  
But how could one be so thoughtless to try  
And handle less than two?  
But that's alright  
I said that, "That's alright, baby"  
I may not want to admit it  
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe, yea  
Now I'm tellin' everybody  
It seems too good to be true  
Sweet things can always get sweeter  
I know mine did, how about you?  
Yes, it's alright  
I said, "Yes it, yes it is, that's alright"  
I may not want to admit it  
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe  
Admit it
