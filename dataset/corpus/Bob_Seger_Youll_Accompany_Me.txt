Words and Music by Bob Seger  
  
A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight  
The sky is starlit and the time is right  
And still you're tellin' me you have to go  
Before you leave there's something you should know  
Yeah something you should know babe  
  
I've seen you smiling in the summer sun  
I've seen your long hair flying when you run  
I've rnade my mind up that it's meant to be  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea  
You're high above me now, you're wild and free ah but  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
Some people say that love's a losin' game  
You start with fire but you lose the flame  
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone  
You end up cold and lonely on your own  
  
I'll take my chances babe I'ii risk it all  
I'll win your love or I'ii take the fall  
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
It's written down some where, it's got to be  
You're high above me flyin' wild and free  
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea  
I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be  
Oh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Somedaylady you'll accomp'ny me
