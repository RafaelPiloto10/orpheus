Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed  
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Think I'll go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.  
  
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight  
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight, bt that's all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.
