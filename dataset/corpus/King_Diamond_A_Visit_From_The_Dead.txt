It must be summer the sky is clear  
The garden is so beautiful  
All the flowers and all the trees  
Make Me feel like they're inside of Me  
I'm holding My sister's hand  
While we're playing in the sand  
It's all but a dream  
  
My bed is moving, I cannot see a thing  
I am in total darkness, someone is calling  
I can feel the chill, it's all around Me  
I know it's not a dream, No no no  
  
Someone is in My room  
Standing at the end of My bed  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Must be a visit from the dead  
  
Now I see her figure, it's just a little child  
And there's no reflection, she's in the mirror  
Could it really be, has she returned?  
My little sister  
  
"King beware, something bad is coming Your way  
King beware"  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Missy will You tell Me  
You know we don't have no secrets  
"Just beware"  
  
Must be a visit from the dead  
Must be a visit from the dead  
You've to to tell Me Missy  
Come on now, spit out little girl  
  
"I will send You a dream,"
