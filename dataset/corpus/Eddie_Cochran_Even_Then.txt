You ask me when I knew  
I was in love with you (with you, with you)  
Well, when the world began  
I was dreaming even then of you (of you, of you)  
And then as time went on (went on)  
I knew you'd come along (along, along)  
For you couldn't stay away  
When you knew I felt the way I do (I do, I do, I do)  
For just how long has there been a moon  
And the stars in the sky up above (doo-dee-yup)  
So if I tell you when I knew (doo-dee-yup)  
That would be how long I'd love  
Oh, when the world began (began)  
And everything was new (was new, was new)  
Well, I was dreaming even then  
And I knew I was in love with you (with you, with you)  
  
For just how long has there been a moon
