YOU STAND OUTSIDE the circle lonely  
Here in darkness' eyes  
Are the lives realized all the same  
Or are they magic of mind  
Ooh if I leave  
Will I - be here again  
Ooh what remains  
Is Evermore in the wind  
Do the shadows of my memory  
From a long ago time  
Lead a path to the other lives of me  
Souls of past great divides  
Will I be here again  
Ooh, give me wings  
Ooh and its embrace  
Is in the arms of the wind  
And only those who stand within  
Can hold the keys that let us in  
But if the magic in us dies  
Ooh then the souls within us cries  
Beyond the wall of tears we wander  
Evermore in the wind  
Beyond the wall of tears we wonder  
The magic of the circle lays  
Somewhere between the dark and light  
Will I be here again  
The magic circle never dies  
Ooh, Evermore winds of change  
Will I be here again  
Ooh, will I rise on my wings  
Evermore in the wind  
Ooh, am I ever the same  
Will I come back again  
Ooh, give me wings for my change  
Evermore in the wind  
Oh will I come back again  
Ever free in the end  
Into the arms of the windOoh, will I be here again
