I know a good dance when the mood is right  
You can do it by day, you can do it by night  
It can be so fine and you'll agree  
If you just do what comes naturally now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby it's the other side of love  
Baby it's the other side of love  
Baby it's the other side of love  
Baby, baby  
  
There's plenty of ways we can do that thing  
We can fool around til we get that swing  
Come on do what you want honey we don't mind  
If you just make sure that you stay in time now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know a good dance when the mood is right  
You can take is sow cause we've got all night  
It can be so fine and you'll agree  
If you just do what come naturally now
