One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol.  
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time.  
However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends - of whom  
I have none, that in order to get a song popular by Christmas  
Time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here  
Goes.  
It has always seemed to me after all, that Christmas,  
With it's spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity  
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply  
Believe in - I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the  
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street,  
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we  
Celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial  
Spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol  
For next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.  
  
Christmas time is here, by golly  
Disapproval would be folly  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly  
Fill the cup and don't say when  
  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens  
Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens  
Even though the prospect sickens  
Brother, here we go again  
  
On Christmas Day you can't get sore  
Your fellow man you must adore  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four  
  
Relations, sparing no expense, 'll  
Send some useless old utensil  
Or a matching pen and pencil  
("Just the thing I need, how nice!")  
  
It doesn't matter how sincere it is  
Nor how heart felt the spirit  
Sentiment will not endear it  
What's important is the price  
  
Hark, the Herald Tribune sings  
Advertising wondrous things  
God rest ye merry merchants  
May ye make the Yuletide pay  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and - buy!  
  
So let the raucous sleighbells jingle  
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle  
Driving his reindeer across the sky  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by  
  
(Spoken)  
Actually I did rather well myself, this last Christmas.  
The nicest present I received was a gift certificate  
"Good at any hospital for a lobotomy"... rather thoughtful.
