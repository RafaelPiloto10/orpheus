[Refrain]  
Baby they mad cause we play how they wanna play  
And they mad cause I say what they wanna say  
Baby they mad cause we do what they wanna do  
If I was them I would be mad too  
So let them be mad, whoa  
They can be mad as they want to  
Girl let them be mad  
Go ahead let them be mad  
So we gonna keep moving how we move  
So let them be mad  
  
Blog sites, media talking  
I wonder why they telling me to be cautious  
Filling the blanks while the drama is pouring  
I don't pay attention, I don't really read it too often  
Got niggas hating on me for years I holds it down  
Talking bout the women I'm fucking and the money I spend  
Why they tripping? already knowing that I'm destined to win  
Use it to motivate the grind and they at it again  
Damn, they mad at me, sneak... and throwing a little jab at me  
See me and be mad happy  
Half filled wine glasses as the time passes  
Cooler breeze, eye cashing with the fine accent  
Still on my shit though, remember when I was piss posed  
So now I'm surrounded by powerful niggas that get dough  
Huh, I prolly got your girlfriend wanting to get low  
Infatuated by all the haters, I need to get more  
  
[Refrain]  
  
We get the jealousy and envy  
Cause she can never be you  
And he can never be me  
And she mad at him cause he can never be me  
And she mad at you because you better than she  
They hit the blogsites to see the highlights  
How lighter they life, talking bout our life  
We doing things haters can only dream  
This kinda be messing with they up esteem you know  
  
Do me a favor, keep your nose up out my situation  
Besides your angering mind, your time is what you wasting  
Been through bs in life, can show a demonstration  
But built my shit from the ground up, renovation  
The past lurking, I see they hurting I stall them out  
You where you at for a reason, nothing to talk about  
The roads to success been a lot of ups and downs  
Doing you up, they merry goes, they come around
