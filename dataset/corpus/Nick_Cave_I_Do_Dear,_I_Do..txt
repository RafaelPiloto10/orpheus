I wish you happy christmas  
I do dear, I do  
I wish for you the stars, babe  
I wish for you the moon  
  
You can sit, and you can drink your champagne  
With your gibbering goon  
I hope he's being good to you  
I do dear, I do  
  
Ain't no whirlwind below your wing  
Wish that you will keep safe  
Up there in your leather babe  
With your ivory and [?]  
  
Things down here are fragmatic  
In fact they've exploded all over the room  
I think everything's a little off-center, babe  
I do dear, I do  
  
You said, that to love me you must set me free  
Now, that may all be very well  
Still I miss you baby  
More than words can ever tell  
  
Sometimes I can not sleep  
The greatness of my hate for you  
Sometimes I can not sleep  
For I miss you  
  
May your day be bright as the eyes  
Of the girl that I once knew  
May your sun be happy yellow, babe  
And your sky be baby blue  
  
I miss your manic scratches  
And your howling at the moon  
Ten steps behind me  
With your dustpan and broom  
  
I hope you wish for me  
All the things I wish for you  
Health, hope and happiness  
The sun and the moon  
  
Say hello to the one  
Who really don't have a clue  
I'll be calling you soon  
I think I love you  
  
I do dear, I do.
