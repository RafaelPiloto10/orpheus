Love is here, here to stay  
Love is here, here to stay  
It gets proven every day  
Love is here, here to stay  
  
They both love Chinese food, he hates to dress  
He loves to play pinball, she wants to play next  
She likes her novels long, he's into comic books  
They're gilt-edged polymorphous urban but somehow it works  
  
'cause love is here, here to stay  
Love is here, here to stay  
It gets proven every day  
Love is here, here to stay  
  
She likes Truman Capote, he likes gore Vidal  
He likes Edgar Allan Poe, she's into mean Joe Greene  
She thinks eating meat's disgusting, he likes hot dogs  
She's into gestalt therapy  
While est and the vest just make him ill  
But love is here to stay  
  
Love is here, here to stay  
Love is here, here to stay  
It gets proven every day  
Love is here, here to stay  
Love is here, here to stay  
Love is here, here to stay  
It gets proven every day  
Love is here, here to stay
