Colour my world all black and blue  
The hell you dish out  
Comes back three-fold to you  
Inside your riddled rotten core  
I hope you get what you deserve  
Worse and even more...  
Even more...  
Even more  
  
[Chorus:]  
[How can you do the things you do?  
You make Satan look like Christ  
I swear its true  
How could you do the things you do?  
How could you do...  
The things you do?]  
  
The Rolling Stones once sang a tune  
Singing words of sympathy  
Yet none were sung for you  
If the lord of darkness seen you comin' his way  
He'd get on his knees  
And look to Jesus...  
Start to pray...  
Start to pray  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More...  
Even more...  
Even more  
  
[Chorus]
