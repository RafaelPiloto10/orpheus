Told you before, stay away from my door  
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother  
The freaks on the phone, won't leave me alone  
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother  
No!  
  
I, I found out!  
I, I found out!  
  
Now that I showed you what I been through  
Don't take nobody's word what you can do  
  
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky  
Now that I found out I know I can cry  
  
I, I found out!  
I, I found out!  
  
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand  
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man  
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa  
They didn't want me so they made me a star  
  
I, I found out!  
I, I found out!  
  
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you  
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do  
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky  
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes  
  
I, I found out!  
I, I found out!  
  
I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all  
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul  
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine  
No one can harm you, feel your own pain  
  
I, I found out!  
I, I found this out!  
I, I found out!
