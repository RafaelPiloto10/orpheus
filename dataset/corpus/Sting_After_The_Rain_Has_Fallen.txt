The palace guards are all sleeping  
Their fires burn into the night  
There's a threat of rain on the dark horizon  
And all that's left is a quarter moon of light  
He climbs up through the darkness  
No weapon but his surprise  
The greatest thief in the high Sahara  
Enters the room where a sleeping princess lies  
All your money, your pretty necklace  
This is my work on such a night  
There's a storm coming over the mountain  
I'll be gone long before the morning  
After the rain has fallen  
After the tears have washed your eyes  
You find that I've taken nothing, that  
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye  
He was as gentle as the night wind  
As no lover had been before  
And the rings she wore for her bride groom  
Slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor  
Take me with you, take me with you  
Before my lonely life is set  
I've been promised to another  
To a man I've never even met  
After the rain has fallen  
After the tears have washed your eyes  
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that  
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye  
After the thunder's spoken, and  
After the lightning bolt's been hurled  
After the dream is broken, there'll  
Still be love in the world  
She said take me to another life  
Take me for a pirate's wife  
Take me where the wind blows  
Take me where the red wine flows  
Take me to the danger  
Take me to the life of crime  
Take me to the stars  
Take me to the moon while we still have time  
After the rain has fallen  
After the tears have washed your eyes  
You'll find that I've taken nothing, that  
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye  
After the thunder's spoken, and  
After the lightning bolt's been hurled  
After the dream is broken, there'll  
Still be love in the world
