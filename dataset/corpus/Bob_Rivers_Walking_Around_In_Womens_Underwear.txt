"Lacey things, the wife is missing.  
Didn't ask, for her permission  
I'm wearing her clothes,  
Her silk panty hose.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
  
In the store, there's a teddy.  
With little straps, like spagetti.  
It holds me so tight,  
Like handcuffs at night.  
Walking around in womens underwear  
  
In the office there's a guy named Melvin.  
He pretends that I am Murphy Brown.  
He'll say "Are you ready?"  
I'll say, "Woah man! Lets wait untill the wife is out of town."  
Later on, if you wanna,  
We can dress, like Madonna.  
Put on some eye shade, and join the parade.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
  
Lacey things, missing.  
Didn't ask, permission.  
Wearing her clothes, silk panty hose.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
Walking around in women's underwear.  
Walking around in women's underwear...... "
