Was 27 surviving my return to Saturn  
A long vacation didn't sound so bad  
Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron melting  
Running on empty, so out of gas  
  
Thought I wasn't enough and I wasn't so tough  
Laying on the bathroom floor  
We were living on a fault line  
And I felt the fault was all mine  
Couldn't take it any more  
  
By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn't gonna let love take me out  
That way  
  
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water  
When the truth was like swallowing sand  
Now every morning  
There is no more morning oh I  
Can finally see myself again  
  
I know I am enough  
Possible to be loved  
It was not about me  
Now I have to rise above  
Let the universe call the bluff  
Yeah the truth will set you free  
  
By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn't gonna let love take me out  
  
That way no  
There ain't no  
Not in the name of love  
In the name of love (in the name of love)  
That way  
There ain't no  
I'm not giving up  
  
By the grace of God  
I picked myself back up  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)  
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)  
  
By the grace of God (there was no other way)  
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)  
I put one foot in front of the other and I  
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay  
Wasn't gonna let love take me out  
That way
