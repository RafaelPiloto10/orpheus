I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio  
I'm pulling you close, you just say no  
You say you don't like it, but girl I know you're a liar  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
Late at night I'm takin' you home  
I say I want to stay, you say you want to be alone  
You say you don't love me, girl you can't hide your desire  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
You had a hold on me, right from the start  
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart  
My nerves all jumpin' actin' like a fool  
Well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool  
  
Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah  
You can bet their love they didn't deny  
Your words say split but your words they lie  
'Cause when we kiss, fire  
  
(Repeat)
