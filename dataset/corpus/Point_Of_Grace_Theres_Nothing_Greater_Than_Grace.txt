What do you say to someone who feels like they've lost it all  
Over the edge with no one there to break their fall  
And what do you say to someone who feels so unloved  
Giving themselves away a little bit every day just to be good enough  
And what do you say to a hopeless soul who can't remember their way home  
And everything is out of their control  
  
Chorus:  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.  
  
What do you say to someone whose life is on the line  
And they're unsure what happens after their last breath in time  
What do you say to someone whose built a wall you can't break through  
And it's so hard for them to hear the truth  
  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.  
  
So don't lose hope, don't let go  
Don't give up, you are not alone  
  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.
