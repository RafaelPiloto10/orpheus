Lonely days lonely nights  
Hoping thing's gonna turn out right  
You had me hanging on a string  
For you I did most anything  
You don't give me no  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Its a blind mans eye baby ain't no youth  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Don't need your lies I got my proof  
  
Put your face up to my window  
Ask me baby what did I see  
Well I know I know you ain't right  
I know you ain't right for me  
You don't give me no  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Gods little baby's got nothing to shoot  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Get your kicks on a different route  
All I want is the truth  
All I want is the truth  
  
All I want is  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Blind mans eye baby ain't no use  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Don't need your lies I got nothing to prove  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Gods little baby's got nothing to shoot  
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth  
Get your kicks on a different route  
Don't hurt ya  
Don't hurt ya  
The truth don't hurt ya  
The truth don't hurt ya  
Don't hurt ya don't hurt ya  
The truth don't hurt ya
