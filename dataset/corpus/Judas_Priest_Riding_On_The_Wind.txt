Shooting for the stars  
Cruise the speed of light  
Glowin god of Mars  
Body burning bright  
  
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
  
Tearing up through life  
Million miles an hour  
Blinding all in sight  
Surging rush of power  
  
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
  
Ri-din', on the wind  
  
Ri-din', on the wind  
  
Ri-din', on the wind  
  
Ri-din' on the wind  
  
Thunderbolt from hell  
Shattering aloud  
Screamin' demons yell  
Bursting through the clouds  
  
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind  
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
