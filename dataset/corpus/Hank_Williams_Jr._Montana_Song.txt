I'm going to Montana to spend the winter  
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are cold  
Way out there the blues will never find me  
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul  
  
I wish that special someone was goin' along  
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone  
Maybe I can find someone who cares  
'Bout the man I am stead of clothes I wear  
'Cause I ain't takin' nothin' but my boots and jeans  
And a big ole cold along  
  
But oh Lord, wouldn't her warm skin feel good at night  
Makin' love in a sleepin' bag and holdin' me [pretty] tight  
We've spent the days side by side right upon the great divide  
And look across America and feel so free inside  
  
Oh Lord, that would be quite a change for a country boy like me  
Up there in the snow drifts right up to my knees  
And as I warm my hands by the fire  
I'd have to fight off the great desire  
To call that girl and ask her  
To come out here for a while  
  
I'm going to Montana to spend the winter  
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are so cold  
Way out there the blues will never find me  
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul  
  
I wish that special someone was goin' along  
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone  
Maybe I can find someone who cares  
A sweet simple baby who'd like to share  
This love I've held inside me for so long  
And help me sing my Montana song, ooh
