Sitting in a car here  
After a party where we've seen  
Everyone we've known for years  
Well I've known you for years  
Oh but now it's all changed  
And all of my feelings  
Have been rearranged  
  
[Chorus]  
Come upstairs  
We'll be all alone  
Come upstairs  
No one will know  
Come upstairs  
We can take of the phone  
Come upstairs  
You can take of my clothes  
  
Say that it feels good  
Maybe too good to say that it feels like a dream  
You want to knock on some wood  
Well I'll give you some wood  
And I'll give you some fire  
I'll give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
Come upstairs  
We'll have a few laughs  
Come upstairs  
We'll take a bath  
Come upstairs  
It's only one flight  
Come upstairs  
You can stay overnight  
  
I'll give you some wood  
Yeah, I'll give you some fire  
I'll give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
[Chorus]
