For you  
It's all in a day  
One day in a life  
It's all in the one word  
The one word is goodbye  
  
For me  
It's all in what you say  
Though you've tried to be kind  
It's all in the words  
From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh  
Goodbye  
  
For you  
It's all in your face  
The laugh and worry lines  
It's all in the one word  
You hope will make you young again  
Goodbye  
  
It's all in the play  
Someone speaks the line  
It's all in the one word  
That stops and steals the time  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
For me  
It's all in a day  
It's the part in life  
When it's all in the words  
To fate and circumstance resigned  
Goodbye
