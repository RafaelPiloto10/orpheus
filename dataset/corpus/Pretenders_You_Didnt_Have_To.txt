That old train keeps blowing  
Through the center of this town  
Restores my faith  
When the chips are down  
  
It don't take no passenger  
Since the streets got re-arranged  
But that whistle still blows  
Because one thing never changed  
  
The boy I was loving  
Had to say so long  
Back to a world  
Where I don't belong  
  
It affected me so  
You could say I was deranged  
But that whistles gonna blow  
Because one thing never changed  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me again  
Speak to me  
Speak to me again  
  
That old train keeps blowing  
I can hear it in the night  
I hold onto myself  
Its gonna be alright  
  
People come and go  
Like cars changing lanes  
But that whistles gonna blow  
Because one thing never changed
