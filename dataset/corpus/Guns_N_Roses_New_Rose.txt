(spoken) Is she really going out with him?  
  
Hey!  
  
I got a feeling inside of me,  
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea  
I don't know why, I don't know why  
I guess these things've gotta be  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got a new rose, I got it good  
Yes, I knew that I always would  
I can't stop to mess around  
I got a brand new rose in town  
  
See the sun, see the sunny skies  
Don't get too close, it'll burn your eyes  
Don't you run away that way  
Come back another day  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never thought this could happen to me  
I'm a strange washing machine  
I never served somebody this sane  
I'll never, never, never be too late  
  
Hey!  
  
[Repeat first verse]  
  
[Chorus:]
