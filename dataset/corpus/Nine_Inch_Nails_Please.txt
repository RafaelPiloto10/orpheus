This is how  
It begins  
Push it away but it all comes back again  
All the flesh  
All the sin  
There was a time when it used to mean just about everything  
  
Just like now  
  
Breathe, echoing the sound  
Time starts slowing down  
Sink until I drown  
(please) I don't ever want to make it stop  
  
And it keeps repeating  
Will you please complete me?  
  
Never be enough  
To fill me up  
  
Watch the white  
Turn to red  
It fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead  
All my life  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead  
(well guess what?)  
The world is over and I realize it was all in my head  
  
Now everything is clear  
I erase the fear  
I can disappear  
(please) I don't ever want to make it stop  
  
You can never leave me  
Will you please complete me  
  
Never be enough  
To fill me up
