My love must be a kind of blind love,  
I can't see anyone but you  
And dear, I wonder if you find love,  
An optical illusion, too?  
Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright cause I only  
Have eyes for you.  
  
The moon may be high,  
But I can't see a thing in the sky,  
Cause I only have eyes for you.  
I don't know if we're in a garden,  
Or on a crowded avenue.  
You are here, so am I.  
Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view,  
And I only have eyes for you.
