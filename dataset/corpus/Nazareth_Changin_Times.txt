When I was younger I used to understand  
That when you're with a girl, you gotta act like a man  
Mama told me that's the way it should be  
And I know my mama never lied to me.  
  
What do you think about you're changin' times  
Cause when I'm with you I just can't make up my mind  
Since I met you don't know right from wrong  
Somebody tell me just what's goin' on  
  
Just can't get myself thinkin' straight  
I'm all shook up and in a terrible state  
Sometimes I think I got it all figured out  
Then you do something new and it just knocks me right out  
  
Someday baby I'm going to have to make a stand  
The way that you treat me baby  
Don't make me feel too much like a man  
And baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
You're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.  
  
Tellin' myself that time is on my side  
You're gettin' this feelin' that my mind's on the slide  
Dumped on the floor, I feel I'm trapped in a spin  
Don't know how to end, can't think of where to begin  
  
She don't care I know she don't even try  
But when she turns it on  
You know she gets me so high.  
  
She's a lady that's making my life a sin  
You know that I'm runnin' in a losin' race  
There ain't no way I can win  
Baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
They're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.
