You've got me wrapped up  
In you  
Somehow you led me in  
Into your web of bittersweet  
Of ecstasy and sin  
I feel like an angel falling  
Down from grace  
  
[Chorus]  
I try to run but I keep  
On falling  
And every time I turn around  
I hear your voice,  
And it keeps on calling  
I'm bound  
There's no way out  
No way out  
  
You wanted me to want  
You and  
I couldn't help myself  
You became my addiction  
And I wanted nothing else  
I feel like I'm trapped inside  
These walls  
Trying to find my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's like a dream you can't  
Wake up from  
It's a hunger that can't be  
Satisfied  
No matter how I try there's  
No escape  
  
[Chorus]
