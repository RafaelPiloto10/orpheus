(Tex Owens)  
The cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the dogies bawl  
Where spurs are a-jinglin' a cowboy is singin'  
This lonesome cattle call  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo  
He rides in the sun, till his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Singin' his cattle call.  
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide  
When the night wind blows up a squall  
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo  
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie  
And sings with an ol' western drawl  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Singin' his cattle call
