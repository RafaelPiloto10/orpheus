Somewhere out on the prairie  
Is the greatest cowboy that's ever been  
And when he lays his hands upon the ponies  
They shudder with an understanding skin  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
When the storm clouds in the west  
Are quickly gathering  
The ponies they run wild there  
Before it rains  
  
You'll see their sleek dark bodies  
Brightly gleaming  
You know the fire is flying through  
Their brains  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
And he says ponies  
Ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
I want to fly
