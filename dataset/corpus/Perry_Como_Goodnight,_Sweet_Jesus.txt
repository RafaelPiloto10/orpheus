Goodnight, Sweet Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight, Sweet Jesus,  
Guard us in sleep,  
Our souls and bodies,  
In thy love keep . . .  
Waking or sleeping,  
Keep us in sight,  
Dear gentle saviour,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight, Dear Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight Sweet Jesus,  
Pray that each day,  
Of our lives mortal,  
Thus pass away. . .  
Thy love o'er watching,  
Guiding our right,  
Dear gentle saviour,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight Dear Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .
