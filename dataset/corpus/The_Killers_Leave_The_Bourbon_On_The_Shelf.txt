Shakin' like the Devil when she lets me go  
Got a new place and how it's so much better.  
Falling over myself, the televisions on,  
I turn it off and smile.  
Oh, Jennifer, you know I always tried.  
Before you say goodbye  
  
Leave the bourbon on the shelf.  
And I'll drink it by myself.  
And I love you endlessly,  
Darling don't you see I'm not satisfied  
Until I hold you tight.  
Give me one more chance tonight  
And I swear I'll make it right.  
But you ain't got time for this  
And that wreckin' bell is ringin'  
And I'm not satisfied  
Until I hold you  
  
Jennifer, tell me where I stand  
And who's that other boy holdin' your hand?  
Oh, Jennifer, you know I've always tried.  
Before you say goodbye  
  
Leave the bourbon on the shelf.  
And I'll drink it by myself.  
And I never liked your hair or those people that you lie with  
And I'm not satisfied  
Until I hold you tight  
And I love you endlessly,  
Darling don't you see I can't be satisfied  
Until I hold you tight.  
  
Leave the bourbon on the shelf.  
And I'll drink it by myself.  
And I love you endlessly,  
Darling don't you see  
I'm not satisfied.
