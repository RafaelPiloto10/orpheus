This chapter says  
"Put it out of your mind"  
Give it time  
  
The fine purple  
The purest gold  
The red of the Sacred Heart  
The gray of a ghost  
The "L" of the lips are open  
To the "O" of the host  
The "V" of the velvet  
  
Of all of the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
There's just something 'bout you  
There's just something 'bout you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
  
Have you ever seen a picture  
Of Jesus laughing?  
Mmm, do you think  
He had a beautiful smile?  
A smile that healed  
  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
There's just something 'bout you  
There's just something 'bout you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
  
The fine purple  
The purest gold  
The red of the Sacred Heart  
The gray of a ghost  
The "L" of the lips are open  
The "O" of the host  
The "V" of the velvet  
The "E" of my eye  
The eye in wonder  
The eye that sees  
The "I" that loves you  
  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?
