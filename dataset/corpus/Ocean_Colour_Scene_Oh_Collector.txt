Oh collector, I'm so sorry  
You had the notion, I was rolling in the money  
No, I'm sorry but I?ll pay you  
No worries  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
I've been heavy with my fortune  
Like a crystal and a hammer  
I'm so sorry, oh collector  
I'm away now in a hurry  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
Get up, all you fighters  
Don't you lie here now  
Get up, all you fighters  
Don't you lie here now  
Oh collector, you had it coming  
It was that funny, we were rolling  
Oh collector, we're so sorry  
And we?ll pay you, no worries  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
let's sing softly  
Let's sing softly  
Oh, so softly  
Not so heavy  
Let's sing softly, oh
