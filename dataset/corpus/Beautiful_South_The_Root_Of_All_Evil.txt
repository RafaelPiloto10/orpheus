If euro replaces the pound  
It's still likely to be shiny and round  
Rich may switch the way they feel rich  
But not the man who's alive  
Or the man who has drowned  
Keeping pound only makes sense  
If you're worth more than 99 pence Those who have a lot and those who have not  
Remain francs marks pesetas or cents  
If money is the root of all evil  
What does that make lover of pound  
We'll be eating frogs and modeling clogs  
And you'll be hunting french  
And dutch with a hound  
Now a nation goes to the vote  
So our country has its name on the note  
Same set of people same boat  
Need their name in the back of their coat  
Heads or tails can't have been won  
On whose head graced whatever was spun  
If queen's head's not on money they've got  
It's still business and money's still fun  
If money is the root of all evil  
What does that make lover of pound  
We'll be eating frogs and modeling clogs and you'll be hunting french  
And dutch with a hound  
Now a nation goes to the vote  
So our country has its name on the note  
Same set of people same boat  
Need their name in the back of their coat
