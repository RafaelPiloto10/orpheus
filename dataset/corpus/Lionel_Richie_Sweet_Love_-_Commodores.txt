Show me a river that's so deep  
Show me a mountain so high  
I'll show you love that'll last forever  
Flying high, so high  
Ah, show me a place where dreams are for dreamers  
And all the things you wish come true, yeah  
I'd wish the world had all happy people  
Then there'd be no more wishing to do  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Sweet)  
Sweet love (Sweet love)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Well, well)  
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet love)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh  
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, ooh? Well  
Sweet love  
Sweet love that comes through the ages  
Reach out and touch my soul  
Gave my life so much meaning  
And everyone a heart of gold  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)  
(Oh, you needed love)  
(Ooh? Hoo?)  
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet love)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love (Sweet love, well)  
I know you're searchin'  
I know you're searchin' for a little love  
A little peace and understandin'  
And I know it's been hard tryin' to find your way  
But you got to keep on searchin' harder day by day  
'Cause it's love, love's the only way  
(Oh, nothin' but love)  
Oh? Oh? (Love)  
Sweet love (Sweet love, ow)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (When you're down and out and you can't see your way)  
Sweet love (And you need a friend, well-ell-ell)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Just call on love, love)  
Sweet love (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
