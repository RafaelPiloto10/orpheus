Margie said Roy you ain't listening to me  
And I got a whole lot more to say  
Roy just crossed the floor and picked up his car keys  
She ain't seen nor heard from him to this day  
  
[Chorus]  
And that's why God made Mexico  
A place where we can lay low  
Where the Cuervo goes down nice and slow  
And the warm winds blow  
That's why God made Mexico  
  
And Betty fixed Joe dinner every night half past six  
'Cause that's when he'd roll through that door  
Sixteen years and not a thank you from his lips  
She don't fix him dinner no more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is sweet in a border town  
You learn to let your hair down  
And you don't make trouble  
You learn to dance the fandango  
  
You change your name and you change your face  
Get used to beans and chile paste  
And learn to live and love life in the slow lane  
  
And that's why God made Mexico  
A place where we can lay low  
Maybe Monterey or Acapulco  
Anywhere the warm winds blow  
Don't you know  
That's why God made Mexico  
That's why God made Mexico
