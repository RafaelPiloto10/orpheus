The problem is  
For many years  
I've lived my life  
Publicly  
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust  
I really trust  
And everytime I find someone I like  
Gotta worry about  
If it's really me  
That they see  
And I thought you were the one, yeah  
  
Deep inside I wish that they could see  
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary  
Deep inside I wish that they could see  
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary  
  
I don't have a lot of friends  
And sometimes I have to wonder  
Is it cash they see when they look at me  
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free  
So I made the choice to be  
Good to those who are good to me  
Don't judge me, don't think I'm bitter  
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary  
  
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary  
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary  
I, I, oh  
  
Deep inside I wish that they could see  
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary  
Deep inside I wish that they could see  
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary  
  
The problem is  
For many years  
I've lived my life  
Publicly  
And everytime I find a man  
I, I can't trust him  
Oh
