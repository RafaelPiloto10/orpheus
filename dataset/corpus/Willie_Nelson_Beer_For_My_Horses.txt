Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news  
Said somebody's been shot, somebody's been abused  
Somebody blew up a building, somebody stole a car  
Somebody got away, somebody didn't get too far yeah  
They didn't get too far  
  
Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son  
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done  
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree,  
Round up all them bad boys hang them high in the street  
For all the people to see  
  
That justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune  
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon  
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
  
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds  
Too much corruption, and crime in the streets  
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground  
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down  
You can bet he'll set 'em down  
  
'Cause justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune  
We'll all meet back at the local saloon  
And we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
  
You know justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune  
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon  
And we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
