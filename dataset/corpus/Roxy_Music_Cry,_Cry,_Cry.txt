Are you ready for bad blood?  
I've got my share  
I'm sick of them sweet sweet nothings  
Oh! In my ear  
  
Ain't funny I'm the honey  
All your money just can't buy  
So baby you can cry cry cry  
Now the last laugh is mine  
You ready for hot stuff?  
Be prepared  
  
I'm sick of your cheap cheap hustle  
Oh! Don't cha dare  
Let us pray the lord have mercy  
On your mercenary mind  
'Cause even if you cry cry cry  
Your heart out  
I won't be kind  
Are you ready for good times?  
Hard to bear!  
  
You're steppin' on holy ground  
Hold it there!  
I'm fading out your hologram  
A phoney toothpaste smile  
Remember when you cry cry cry  
Your heart out  
I did mine
