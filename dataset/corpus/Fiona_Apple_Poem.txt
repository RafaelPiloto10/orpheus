(Recited before performing Sleep To Dream)  
  
"When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king  
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight  
And he'll win the whole thing before he enters the ring  
There's nobody to batter when your mind is your might  
So when you go solo you hold your own hand  
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights  
And if you know where you stand then you know where to land  
And if you fall it won't matter ''cause you know that you're right"
