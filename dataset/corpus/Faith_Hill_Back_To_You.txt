I'm gonna find my way back to you  
  
I lie in bed and watch the shadows  
Dancing across the wall  
Nothing to do but think of you  
And count the tears that fall  
  
Oh, how I wish it was real  
I wish I could feel you holding me close  
The only thing I know for sure  
Is I should've never let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
I would walk the world across the sea  
Journey beyond the moon  
I try anything, go anywhere  
To find my way back to you  
  
I still don't understand the reason  
I think I was just afraid (what can I say)  
All I can do is face the truth  
And deal with the mess that I made  
  
Now all I want is the chance to take it back  
And go on like this  
Because ever since we said goodbye  
I've been lost in loneliness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now baby I was wrong  
Now that you're gone  
The only thing left to do  
Is spend every day  
  
Stray every way  
To find my way back to you  
  
I know that I was a fool  
To push you away  
And if you let me back in your life  
Baby, I swear all my heart  
And in your arms I will stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, I'm gonna find my way back to you
