Been on a barbed wire highway forty days and nights  
I ain't complain'n that's my job and it suits me right  
I got a sweet soul fever rushin' around my head  
I'm gonna sleep tonight in Maria's bed  
  
Got on a dead man's suit and smilin' skull ring  
Lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing  
I keep my heart in my work, my troubles in my head  
And I keep my soul in Maria's bed  
  
I been up on sugar mountain, 'cross the sweet blue sea  
I walked the valley of love and tears and mystery  
I got run out'a luck and gave myself up for dead  
Then I drank the cool clear waters from Maria's bed  
  
She give me candy stick kisses 'neath a wolf dog moon  
One sweet breath and she'll take you, mister, to the upper room  
  
I was burned by the angels, sold wings of lead  
Then I fell in the roses and sweet salvation of Maria's bed  
  
I been out in the desert, doin' my time  
Siftin' through the dust for fools gold, lookin' for a sign  
Holy man said, "Hold on, brother, there's a light up ahead."  
Ain't nothin' like the light that shines on me in Maria's bed  
  
Well I take my blessings at the river head  
I'm living in the light of Maria's bed
