There's no better way to describe  
What you do to me, I love you  
  
Ooh, the summer came in the middle of the winter  
And all my nightmares became a dream come true  
Then suddenly my pool became an ocean  
No sooner that I laid both of my eyes on you  
  
And I have never seen wings like that  
Never seen a smile like that  
I've seen the light but never ever bright as that  
(You blind me with love)  
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream?  
  
'Cause I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
Right before my very eyes  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
And it was like a vision coming from the sky  
  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
She held my hand and whispered to me  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
Nothing compares to what you are  
  
A sad end became happily ever after  
And a sad song turned into a song of joy  
When the light is on to me was going dim  
You showed up with a candle burning bright  
  
And I have never seen wings like that  
Never seen a smile like that  
I've seen the light but never ever bright as that  
(You blind me with love)  
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream?  
  
'Cause I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
Standing right before my very eyes  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
It was like a vision coming from the sky  
  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
He held my hand and whispered these words  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
Nothing compares to what you are  
  
And it feels so good  
That I found my angel next to me  
That I just gotta tell somebody  
About my new discovery  
  
And how I'm touched by an angel  
Touched by an angel, touched by an angel  
Girl, it feels like I'm touched by an angel  
(Feels like)  
Touched by an angel, touched by an angel  
  
I can't believe it, I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
And it was standing right before my eyes  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
Like a beautiful vision coming from the sky  
  
I just saw an angel, an angel on earth  
And it took my hand and it said to me these words  
(I just saw an angel)  
Nothing, nothing, nothing  
(An angel on earth)  
Nothing can compare to what you are  
  
I'm so glad that I've got my angel  
I saw an angel right in front of me, whoa baby, yeah  
You're my angel and I know you can set me free
