I have always been a little shy  
I've always been the quiet type till now  
And I never let my feelings show  
I never let anybody know  
Just how much I was so deep in love  
But now that you're in my arms  
  
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop  
Baby, scream and shout  
I want to sing it on the radio, show it on a video  
Baby, leave no doubt  
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about  
I love to love you out loud  
  
You keep bringing out the free in me  
What you do to my heart just makes me melt  
And I don't think I can resist  
But I've never been one to kiss and tell  
A love this true can't be subdued  
So I'm gonna let out a yell  
  
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop  
Baby, scream and shout  
I want to sing it on the radio, show it on a video  
Baby, leave no doubt  
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about  
I love to love you out loud  
  
Baby, I want the whole world to see  
Just how good your love looks on me  
  
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop, climb up a mountaintop  
Baby, scream and shout  
I want to sing it on the radio, show it on a video  
Baby, leave no doubt  
I want the whole world to know just what I'm all about  
I love to love you out loud  
  
Baby, I love to love you out loud  
Yeah, I love to love you out loud
