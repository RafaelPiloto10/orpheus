You can make money, you can make good  
Friends  
You can make mistakes and you can make  
Amends  
You can make it easy when push comes to  
Shove, but  
You can't make love  
You can make advances, you can make  
Big plans  
Plant sloppy kisses all over her hands  
You can tell her everything you're dreamin'  
Of, but  
You can't make love  
Love's a little word that been kicked around  
Used too much, beaten down  
What in the world are you thinkin' of?  
You can't make love  
You can go through the motions with your  
Magic spells  
Buy all the potions that fifth avenue sells  
You can try to call down all the stars above,  
But  
You can't make love  
You can buy her diamonds, you can go out in style  
You can make a promise, you can walk  
Down the aisle  
You can make a life for her that fits like  
A glove, but  
You can' t make love  
Oh, it takes so long  
You gotta be strong  
Before it's gone  
What in the world where you thinkin' of,  
Boy  
You can't make love
