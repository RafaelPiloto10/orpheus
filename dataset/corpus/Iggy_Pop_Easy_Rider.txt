In the alley where have I grown  
Hot night sweats our clothes  
My hell is crackin' fire  
That's what you inspire  
Cruel highway entrance signs  
People driving to their lives  
Looks like a giant stream  
But it's just a dream  
  
Easy rider, easy rider  
Easy rider, easy rider  
  
Broken people all around  
Old guarantees that pull you down  
You need a way out, you need a ride  
Cause where you are is suicide  
  
Easy rider, easy rider  
Easy rider, easy rider  
  
Oh I see the sacred dreams  
And if I'm no ?  
I'll feel real ?  
Tearing out my hair  
I see fertility  
In pretty girls I meet  
I love my friend  
Give me hands ?  
  
Highway in the sun  
We listen to the engines run  
I wanna fine myself in you  
You wanna find yourself, too  
  
Easy rider, easy rider [Repeat: x4]
