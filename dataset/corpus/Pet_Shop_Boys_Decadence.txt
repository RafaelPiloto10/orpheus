You don't care about nothing  
So you don't care about love  
If you want me to come back  
You'd better change  
  
You'd better give up talking about money  
Begin thinking of love  
If you want me to come back  
You'd better change  
  
You'd better change for the better  
It cost more than dollars and cents  
Take it from me there's - got to be  
An end to this decadence  
This decadence  
  
You don't care about people  
So you don't care about pain  
If you want me to come back  
You'd better change  
  
You'd better change for the better  
Start using some common sense  
Take it from me there's - got to be  
An end to this decadence  
  
For decadence - is fatal  
It's the beginning of the end  
In self-defense  
I cannot recommend  
This decadence  
  
You don't care about real life  
You're too distant and strange  
If you want me to come back  
  
You'd better change for the better  
It may be rather intense  
Stop this caprice, you've got to cease  
This fidesiecle pretense  
  
For decadence - is fatal  
It's the beginning of the end  
In consequence  
I cannot recommend  
This decadence  
This decadence  
This decadence  
This decadence
