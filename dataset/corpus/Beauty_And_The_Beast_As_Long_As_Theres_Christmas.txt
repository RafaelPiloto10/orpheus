Don't look inside a stocking  
Don't look under the tree  
The one thing we're looking for  
Is something we can't see  
Far more precious than silver  
And more splendid than gold  
Is something to treasure  
But is something we can't hold  
  
As long as there's Christmas  
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll receive (we'll receive)  
  
As we all pray together  
It's the time to rejoice  
And though we may look different  
We are singing with one voice  
  
As Long As there's Christmas  
I truly believe  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll recieve  
  
There is more (so much more)  
To this time of year (to this time of year)  
Than sleigh bells and holly  
Mistletoes and snow  
Those things will come and go  
Come and goooo  
  
As long as there is Christmas  
I truly do believe that  
Hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We will receive (we'll receive)  
  
As Long As there's Christmas  
I truly believe (I truly believe)  
That hope is the greatest of the gifts  
We'll recieve  
  
That Hope Is the Greatest gift we'll receive!
