I'm addicted to feeling  
Stealing love isn't stealing  
Can't you see that I understand your mind?  
  
I'm a walking believer  
I'm a ghost and a healer  
I'm the shape of the home inside your heart  
  
Not looking for a brighter side  
Crooked steps will take me higher  
I don't care if you want to cry  
I'm a soldier for hire  
Killing all you admire  
And you live in the cloud but that will change  
  
Not looking for a brighter side  
Crooked steps will take me higher  
I don't care if you want to cry  
  
Blood raining down  
Cuts a deep, deep river  
And we're diving  
And we're diving  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you  
  
I'm a walking believer  
I'm a ghost and a healer  
Can't you see that I understand your mind?  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you
