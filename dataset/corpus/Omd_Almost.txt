I'd travel oh so far  
To be where you are  
I'd travel there by car  
To be where you are  
But if I get there I'd find  
That I'd change my mind  
It happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
  
Always making statements  
And moving step by step  
Always acting theories  
I will regret  
My only consolation  
In the things that I've done  
Are the people who know me  
And the objects I own  
  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time
