Are we gonna keep pushing our children to drugs?  
Are we gonna keep driving them insane?  
Are we gonna keep laying empty words and fists?  
Are we gonna be remembered as the century that failed?  
  
People of America, when will we learn?  
It's now or never, there's no time to lose.  
  
Are we gonna keep sending our youths to war?  
Are we gonna keep scaring rice fields and infants?  
Are we gonna keep watching dead bodies over dinner?  
Are we gonna be known as the century that kills?  
  
People of America, when will we stop?  
It's no or never, there's no time to waste.  
  
Are we gonna keep pretending things are alright?  
Are we gonna keep our mouths closed just in case?  
Are we gonna keep putting off until it's too late?  
Are we gonna be known as the century of fear?  
  
People of America, when will we see?  
It's now or never, we've no time to lose.  
  
People of America, when will we see?  
It's now or never, we've no time to lose.  
  
Are we gonna keep digging oil wells and gold?  
Are we gonna keep shooting the ones that tries to change?  
Are we gonna keep thinking it won't happen to us?  
Are we gonna be known as the century that kills?  
  
People of America, please, listen to your soul,  
We can change the times to century of hope.  
  
'Cause dream you dream alone is only a dream,  
But dream we dream together is reality.
