Love for sale.  
Appetizing, young love for sale.  
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled. Love that's only slighty soiled.  
Love for sale.  
  
Who will buy?  
Who will like to sample my supply?  
Who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise?  
Love for sale.  
  
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way.  
I know every type of love better far than they.  
If you want the thrill of love I've been through the mid'l of love.  
Old love. New love. Every love, but true love.  
  
Love for sale.  
Appetizing young love for sale.  
If you want to buy my wares, follow me and climb the stairs.  
Love for sale.
