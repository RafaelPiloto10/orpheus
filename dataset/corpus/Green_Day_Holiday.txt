Hear the sound of the falling rain  
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)  
A shame  
The ones who died without a name  
  
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key  
To a hymn called faith and misery (Hey!)  
And bleed, the company lost the war today  
  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
On holiday  
  
Hear the drum pounding out of time  
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)  
To find, the money's on the other side  
  
Can I get another Amen (Amen!)  
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)  
A gag, A plastic bag on a monument  
  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
On holiday  
  
"The representative from California has the floor"  
  
Sieg Heil to the president gasman  
Bombs away is your punishment  
Pulverize the Eiffel towers  
Who criticize your government  
Bang bang goes the broken glass and  
Kill all the fags that don't agree  
Trials by fire setting fire  
Is not a way that's meant for me  
Just cause  
Just cause  
Because we're outlaws yeah!  
  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
This is our lives on Holiday
