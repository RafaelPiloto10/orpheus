I will do whatever you say  
It's got to be, it's got to be that way, yes it does  
Because it's true, oh, oh yeah, it's true  
That I'm strung out, strung out on you, on you  
  
Alright, if you say one, just tell me, boy  
I'm gonna start walkin' and if you say talk  
Tell me I'm gonna open my mouth and start talkin', boy  
  
I'm strung out, well, oh yeah, I'm strung out on you  
Oh ha, on you, baby, on you, on you  
You, you, you, you, you  
  
Yeah, now listen, I was in such a romance, hey, hey  
And I stopped off in Paris, France, yes I did  
It was a whole lot of people knew me, oh yeah  
But don't you know, don't you know that wouldn't do me, no, no, no, no  
  
And I stopped off in Spain, everything, everything remains the same  
I just needed you, needed you, you, you, talkin' about you  
I just needed you, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
If you say, walk, darlin', I'll put on my best shoes and start walkin'  
Hey, and I dare you to tell me to talk, all day and all night  
I'm gonna be talkin', 'cause I'm strung out and well  
  
I'm strung out on you, I'm strung out, strung out, baby, on you  
Strung out on you, you, you, you, oh yeah, yeah  
My goodness, I got a Jones, baby  
  
Well, well, well, now listen now, now  
Oh bay, oh yeah, well, well, now listen  
  
I went to the family doctor, yes I did  
And he used everything he had, yes he did  
And he said, "Etta, your case is so sad, it's so sad"  
  
You, you, I need you, I need you, you, you, you  
Oh baby, I need you, I need you like the bees need the flowers  
And like the trees need the sunshine  
And I need only the one that I'm strung out, strung out on you  
No, it's you, you, you, oh yeah, strung out on you
