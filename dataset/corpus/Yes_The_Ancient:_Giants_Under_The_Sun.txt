PURANAS: The Ancient probes still further into the past beyound the point of  
remembering. Here Steve's guitar is pivotal in sharpening reflection on the  
beauties and treasures of lots civilisations, Indian, Chinese, Central  
American, Atlantean. These and other people left an immense treasure of  
knowledge.  
As one with the knowledge and magic of the source  
Atuned to the majesty of music  
They marched as one with earth  
Sol, Dhoop  
Sun  
Ilios  
Naytheet  
Ah Kin  
Saule  
Tonatiuh  
Qurax  
Gunes, Grian  
Surje  
Ir  
Samse  
So the flowering creativity of life wove its  
Web face to face with the shallow  
And their gods sought out and conquered, Ah Kin  
Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn  
Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white  
Does a shadow come between us in the winter  
Is the movement really light  
And I heard a million voices singing  
Acting to the story that they had heard about  
Does on child know the secret and can say it  
Or does it all come out along without you  
along without you  
along without you  
Where does reaon stop and killing just take over  
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead  
Are there many more in comfort understanding  
Is the movement in the head  
And I heard a million voices singing  
Acting to the story that they had heard about  
Does one child know the secret and can say it  
Or does it all come out along without you  
along without you  
along without you
