... me and her sister had somethin goin on  
(Aiyyo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)  
I reach my peak, I can't speak  
Call my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak  
(Aiyyo c'mon nigga, cut that)  
I'm sick of niggaz lyin, I'm sick of bitches hawkin  
(Aiyyo, yoyo Big, aiyyo chill)  
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin  
  
(Aiyyo Big, aiyyo BIG!!)  
  
Damn... we was spose to rule the world baby  
We was unstoppable!  
The shit can't be over, no  
The shit can't be over man  
I know you hear me nigga  
I know you hear me  
You got too much livin to do  
Too much unfinished business  
It ain't over  
Live your life
