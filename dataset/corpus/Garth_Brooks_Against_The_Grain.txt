Folks call me a maverick  
Guess I ain't too diplomatic  
I just never been the kind to go along  
Just avoidin' confrontation  
For the sake of conformation  
  
And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song  
But sometimes you just can't be afraid  
To wear a different hat  
If Columbus had complied  
This old world might still be flat  
  
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained  
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain  
Well, I have been accused  
Of makin' my own rules  
There must be rebel blood  
Just a-runnin' through my veins  
But I ain't no hypocrite  
What you see is what you get  
And that's the only way I know  
To play the game  
Old Noah took much ridicule  
For building his great ark  
But after forty days and forty nights  
He was lookin' pretty smart  
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain  
By havin' strength to go against the grain  
Well, there's more folks than a few  
Who share my point of view  
But they're worried  
If they're gonna sink or swim  
They'd like to buck the system  
But the deck is tacked against 'em  
And they're a little scared  
To go out on a limb  
But if you're gonna leave your mark  
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep  
You got to listen to your heart  
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne  
Sometimes you got to go against the grain  
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained  
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
