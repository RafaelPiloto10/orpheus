My friend drove off the other day,  
And now he's gone and all they say,  
Is you gotta live cause life goes on  
But now I see I'm mortal too  
I can't live my life like you  
Gotta live it up while life goes on  
  
And I think it's alright  
That I do what I like cause that's the way I wanna live  
And so I give  
And I'm still giving  
  
And now I wonder about my friend  
If he gave all he could give  
Cause he lived his life like I live mine  
If you could see inside my head  
Then you'd start to understand  
The things I value in my heart  
  
You know that,  
I know that,  
You're watching me.  
  
Gotta make a plan  
Gotta do what's right  
Can't run around in circles if you wanna build a life  
And I don't wanna make a plan for a day far away  
While I'm young and while I'm able all I wanna do is....
