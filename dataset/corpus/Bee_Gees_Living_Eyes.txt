Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday.  
But be alive, I know that we will.  
The world keeps on moving but I'm holding still.  
  
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny.  
That would arrive the moment you're born.  
For we will be here when the miracle comes.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Living eyes when under the sun don't cry.  
No war in my mind.  
The state of my heart.  
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall.  
The day I deny the face of my love.  
  
[Bridge:]  
We are of age, we are in time, we are forever.  
Right now when the power is mine.  
I leave you Heaven and the Earth, I leave you never.  
And living to love is the reason to shine.  
  
I been over I been under I don't own a dream to analyze.  
But living eyes you know that I do.  
Believe in the soul and the magic of you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
