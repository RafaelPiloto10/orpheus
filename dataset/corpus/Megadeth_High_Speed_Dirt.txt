Do it if you dare  
Leaping form the sky  
Hurling through the air  
Exhilarating high  
See the earth below  
Soon to make a crater  
Blue sky, black death  
I'm off to meet my maker  
Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge  
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure  
Up here in the air, this will never hurt  
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high speed dirt  
Paralyzed with fear  
Feel velocity gain  
Entering a near  
Catatonic state  
Pressure of the sound  
Roaring through my head  
Crash into the ground  
Damned if I'll be dead  
Jump or die!  
Dropping all my weight  
Going down full throttle  
The pale horse awaits  
Like a genie in a bottle  
Fire in my veins  
Faster as I go  
I forgot my name  
I'm a dirt torpedo  
High speed dirt...
