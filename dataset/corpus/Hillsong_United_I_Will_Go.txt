I have found myself in You, the purpose for my life  
I discover who I am, as Your spirit touches mine  
Every step I take, every move I make  
You are by my side  
And I will be strong, my strength is in you  
  
I will go where You want me to go  
I will do what You want me to do  
Yes I will go where You want me to go  
I will be who You want me to be  
  
Anything for You  
When You ask me I will go  
You show the way before me  
In Your word I find the truth  
You lead me on this journey  
  
Those who trust in you, ever praising You  
Will find their strength renewd  
I'm gonna make itm, make it happen
