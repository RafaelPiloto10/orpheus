Cover of Sons of Freedom song  
  
Last night I saw you standing in the rain  
So tired, I must have been dreaming again  
It ain't easy, easy, when you're on your own  
It ain't easy, easy, when you're all alone  
  
I'll revenge you  
I'll revenge you  
I'll find you  
Nobody sees your pain  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
  
Last night I saw you backing up all afraid  
So tired, I must have been dreaming again  
It ain't easy, easy, 2nd Avenue  
It ain't easy, easy, those things you put me through  
  
I'll revenge you  
I'll revenge you  
Revenge you  
I found you  
Nobody sees your pain  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
  
How long now, baby?
