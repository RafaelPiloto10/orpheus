Well, I just can't seem to pity  
'Cause my heart's too numb to feel  
And the smile does all the talking  
Though the pain is all that's real  
With the way that you keep screaming  
I can hardly hear to think  
And I feel the bridges burning  
Underneath my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
Where do you go, oh  
When you're gone?  
Where do you go, oh  
When you're gone?  
Oh, how the road feels so long  
But where do you go, oh  
When you're gone?  
  
I just want to stay dreaming  
No, I just don't want to wake  
Why can't we keep on sailing  
Across this emerald lake?  
My forehead is still bleeding  
From the thorns I used to wear  
And I'm left alone and beaten  
For this cross I choose to bear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I finally found what I'm looking for  
Though the road's still long and the light is still far  
But I finally found what I'm looking for  
Well, I finally found what I'm looking for  
Though the road's still long and the light is still far  
But I finally found what I'm looking for  
  
Well, the voices fall like timber  
And the fear it pours like rain  
And my heart is crushed to cinders  
Underneath this kind of pain  
Well, there is no resolution  
When the revolution's dead  
So I'm left with no solution  
For the voices in my head  
  
[Chorus]
