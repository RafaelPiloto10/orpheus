If you need a woman in bed with you  
Tell her in front what you can do  
It's easy, easy as pie  
Don't have to be a ?  
You don't have to lie  
  
If you play the guitar it won't be long  
You'd be writing and singing, them songs  
It's easy, easy you bet  
And you've been bet, if you don't quit  
  
If you feel kinda lonesome, a friend's inside  
Get yourself a dog and be alright  
Get yourself too, lucky me  
Now one thing nice, I'll be there twice to love you  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
If you wanna think she's ugly and always depressed  
She can go out and buy herself a new dress  
It's easy, easy for her  
Solves all of her problems, that's for sure  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
If she cashes your property, you might regret  
Use that old plastic, swipe deeper in debt  
It's easy, easy you see  
If tomorrow never comes, everything is free  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine
