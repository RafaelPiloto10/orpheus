I woke up this morning  
With an attitude  
Looked at the headlines  
Put me in a real bad mood  
Sitting here remember  
Tryin' to stay sane  
Between the end of the summer  
And the comin' of the blessed rains  
And I feel dirty  
All the way down  
I feel dirty, baby  
Like this dirty town  
I gave you everything  
On a silver tray  
Could have been a fool forever  
But I'm not made that way  
  
And after all these years  
I think it's time to say goodbye  
I'm doing you a favor  
I will not help you live a lie  
And believe me,  
If you think I'm gonna catch you when you fall  
You don't know me  
You don't know me at all  
  
I closed up the curtains  
Learned to confess  
Baby I knew better  
But you were such a pretty mess  
You took my breath away  
And now I want it back  
Aah, you should have killed me  
Cause you always looked so good in black  
  
And after all these twisted roads  
That we've been down together  
I think it's time to say goodbye  
And believe me,  
If you think I'm gonna get down and crawl  
You don't know me  
You don't know me at all  
  
Oooooo  
  
After all these years  
I think it's time to say goodbye  
I'm doing us a favor, baby  
You know I cannot live a lie  
And when you need me,  
And you think I'm gonna be there when you call  
You don't know me  
You don't know me at all  
You don't know me at all, la de da  
You don't know me at all  
You don't know me at all
