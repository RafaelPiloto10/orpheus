I took myself down to the Tally-Ho Tavern to buy me a bottle of beer  
I sat me down by a tender young maiden whose eyes were as dark as her hair  
And as I was searchin' from bottle to bottle for somethin' unfoolish to say  
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows and smilingly stole
her away  
I said hey little girl don't you know he's the devil he's everything that I
ain't  
Hidin' intentions of evil under the smile of a saint  
All he's good for is gettin' in trouble and shifting his share of the blame  
And some people swear he's my double and some even say we're the same  
But the silver tongued devil's got nothing to lose I'll only live till I die  
We take our own chances and pay our own dues the silver tongued devil and I  
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him  
She knew in her heart that he'd lied  
But nothing that I could have said could've saved her  
No matter how hard that she tried  
Cause she'll offer her soul to the darkness and danger  
Of something that she's never known  
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger who'll love her and leave her
alone  
And you know he's the devil...
