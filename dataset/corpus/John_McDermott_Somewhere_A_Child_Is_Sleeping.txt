The snow is softly falling  
The night is cold and grey  
The forests fields and mountains  
Await the coming day  
One star outshines the others  
So bright as if to say  
This is a special morning  
A child was born on christmas day.  
Long ago, far away  
In a stable bare  
Look and see, he sleeps so peacefully  
As if the cold of night were never there  
Bless all the little children  
Whenever they may lay  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day.  
So we might love each other  
In peace and honor's way  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day  
To save the world from sadness  
His troubled life he gave  
To offer hope and gladness  
Our weary souls to save  
To comfort us in trouble  
To guide us ev'ryday  
One hope for life eternal  
A child was born on christmas day  
Long ago, far away  
In a stable bare  
Look and see he sleeps so peacefully  
As if the cold of night were never there  
Bless all the little children  
Where ever they may lay  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day.  
So we might love each other  
In peace and honor's way  
Somewhere a child is sleeping  
A child was born on christmas day.
