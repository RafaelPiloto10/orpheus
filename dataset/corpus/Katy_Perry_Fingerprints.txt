Voted most likely to end up on the back OK a milk box drink  
Looks like I'm letting them down  
'Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth and hour of my hard work and time  
When you cant afford half the shit they advertise  
Oh I'm worth more then they ask more then the two-tag generation full of
regret  
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype  
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight  
It's my life  
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching  
  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you  
  
Representing you and me  
Don't you wanna go down in history?  
Rather then end up begging on the streets  
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep  
'Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin  
I can't focus my attention  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
Don't give up  
Don't give in  
Because your arms on the rock  
Oh I'm not innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent  
  
Effortless and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
(I want you to remember me)  
Effortless and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching  
It pass me by  
I'm leaving you my legacy  
I gotta make my mark  
I gotta run it hard  
I want you to remember me  
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints  
I'm leaving my fingerprints, in the end
