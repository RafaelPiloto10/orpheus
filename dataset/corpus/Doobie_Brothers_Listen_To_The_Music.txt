Don't you feel it growing, day by day  
People getting ready for the news  
Some are happy, some are sad  
Woah, gotta let the music play  
  
What the people need is a way to make them smile  
Ain't so hard to do if you know how  
Gotta get a message, get it on through  
Oh now momma don't you ask me why  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
  
All the time  
  
Well I Know, You know better, everything I say  
Meet me in the country for a day  
We'll be happy and we'll dance  
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away  
  
And if I'm feeling good to you and you're feeling good to me  
There ain't nothing we can't do or say  
Feeling good, feeling fine  
Oh, baby, let the music play  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
  
All the time  
  
Like a lazy flowing river  
Surrounding castles in the sky  
And the crowd is growing bigger  
Listening for the happy sounds  
And I got to let them fly  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
  
All the time
