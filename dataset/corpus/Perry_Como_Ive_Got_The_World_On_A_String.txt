I got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,  
Got a string around my finger, what a world, what a life,  
I'm in love...  
  
I got a song that I sing, I can make the rain go,  
Anytime I move my finger, lucky me, can't you see?  
I'm in love...  
  
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold a string,  
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let you go . . .  
  
I got the world on a string, sittin' on the rainbow,  
Got a string around my finger, what a life, what a world,  
I'm in love...  
  
... what a world, what a life,  
I'm in love...  
  
... lucky me, can't you see?  
That I'm in love...  
  
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold a string,  
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let you go...  
  
Oh! I got the world on a string, sittin' on the rainbow,  
Got a string around my finger, what a world, what a life,  
I'm really in love...
