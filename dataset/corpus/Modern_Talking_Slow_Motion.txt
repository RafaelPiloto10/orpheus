My tears will never dry  
Behind my painted smile  
You are the nearest thing to heaven, girl  
This world is not my home  
Love in a danger zone  
Some hearts are better left unbroken, girl  
  
Slow-motion, baby  
Hold on tight  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
Deep inside  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
I got hooked on you  
I know it isn't true  
Slow-motion, baby  
Full of pride  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
I have cried  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
'Cause only love knows why  
I know I want to die  
  
Good love can never die  
Inside my love's alive  
Take it of him, my babe  
They just don't need  
Just when I needed you most  
Oh babe, God only knows  
I'm lost without your love in me, baby
