(Original by Lynyrd Skynard)  
  
Big wheels keep on turning carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the southland  
I miss my family once again and I think it's a sin  
Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her  
Well I heard Ol' Neil put her down  
Well I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  
Chorus:  
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you  
In Birmingham they love the governor boo-hoo-hoo  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate pisses me off so much  
Does your conscience bother you tell me true  
Chorus:  
Here I come Alabama  
Solo  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers, they've been known to pick a song or
two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue  
Now how about you  
Chorus:  
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue oh sweet home  
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you And the gov'nor's true  
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue oh yeah  
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you yeah yeah
