Go ahead and cry and weep and moan -  
You know the blame is all your own.  
You paid your money and you made a choice.  
A world out there's waiting to be shown.  
Stuck in conformity, something wrong with that.  
Searching for sanity, I'm not falling in that trap.  
The way you're going, you'll travel alone  
'cause I'll never stay in the comfort zone.  
You didn't roll the dice, you didn't take the shot,  
You're all wrapped up in what you got.  
You're crying about the way you feel  
To the music of your spinning wheels.
