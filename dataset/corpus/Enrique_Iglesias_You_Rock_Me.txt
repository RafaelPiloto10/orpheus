Rock rock rock  
Swing baby swing, you're playing with my can  
And it feels right  
Jump baby jump, I'm one step behind  
And it's alright  
You got one mile to go, and your tank is still full  
And you don't stop (no, you don't stop)  
  
[Chorus:]  
You say, hold on tight, for the ride  
Ya, you're my destination  
And you rock me, all night long  
Yeah, you push me, all night long  
Yeah you love me, all night long  
You rock me all night long  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Come baby come, you got me blowing up  
And it feels right  
Slide baby slide, you're not the girl  
To put up a stop sign  
A bullet to my head and they're driving me insane  
And they don't stop  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Live baby live, there for today  
Fly baby fly, let's get away  
I don't care what they think, what they say  
And you know, yeah you know  
  
That you rock me  
Yeah, you rock me, oh yeah  
De, de, de, de rock me, all night long  
Yeah you push me, all night long  
Yeah you love me all night long  
You rock me all night long x 3
