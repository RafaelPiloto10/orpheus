I tried to be the perfect soldier  
I tried to be what everyone said was expected  
Somehow I was selected  
Well, my hands were steady, my aim was true  
But deep inside of my heart I knew  
That I lacked the will  
I just couldn't shoot to kill  
  
And still she treats me like a human  
She says she'll still be there  
I may not be a hero, but I'll be there  
Because I know she cares  
  
I worked hard to be the greatest lover  
I wanted to be sure that I was her only one  
That's how I thought it was done  
But I went too far, assumed too much  
The need to feel a younger one's touch  
Seemed important then  
Oh what a fool I've been  
  
And still she treats me like a human (like a human)  
She says she'll still be there (that she'll be there)  
I don't quite understand it, she's been too fair  
'Cause somehow she cares  
  
I guess that's the way it goes, the way that it goes  
And nobody knows what compels her  
She's seen my highs and lows and never let go  
  
Oh yes she treats me like a human (like a human)  
She says she'll still be there (that she'll be there)  
I don't quite understand it, she's been too fair  
'Cause somehow she cares  
  
I guess that's the way it goes, the way that it goes  
And nobody knows what compels her  
She's seen my highs and lows and never let go  
  
And when the world has turned its back on me  
I won't have to feel alone  
'Cause I know she cares
