Black and white,  
Male, female,  
For life and love  
Black and white,  
Male, female,  
For life and love  
Sometimes, when I fly  
So high  
Slowly in the sky  
M'yiten shama'i keri'oh  
Hamah gurah V'hamaym ka li retoh  
Ha samovim rachu'ah  
Hamah hareh 'al kah teru'ah  
For life and love  
For life and love  
Floating as I find  
My dreams aid me for the night  
For life and love  
For life and love  
Floating as I find  
My dreams aid me for the night  
In the beginning, G-d created  
The Heaven and the Earth  
And the light and the dark  
G-d created man  
In His own image  
In the image of G-d He created us  
Black and white,  
Male, female,  
For life and love  
For life and love  
Sometimes, when I fly  
So high  
Slowly in the sky  
M'yiten shama'i keri'oh  
Hamah gurah V'hamaym ka li retoh  
Ha samovim rachu'ah  
Hamah hareh 'al kah teru'ah
