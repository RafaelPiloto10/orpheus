Goin' out, got some time to use  
Baby, baby, baby, I just can't lose  
Truckin' round from town to town  
Got to get my rocks off the ground  
Going up, I've been down so long  
All I need is just one good song  
Take me out of this dead end gig  
Get my shot at some of the big  
If you want to rock  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody to roll  
I just signed my life away  
The record company's got to pay  
Got to chase that billboard bullet  
Nothin' left but to go out and do it  
If you want to rock  
You got to find  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody to roll  
Somebody to roll  
Goin' out, got some time to use  
Baby, baby, baby, I just can't lose  
Truckin' round from town to town  
Got to get my rocks off the ground  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody to roll  
Somebody to roll
