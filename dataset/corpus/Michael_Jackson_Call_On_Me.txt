There goes the sunshine  
Here comes the rain  
And heartache things  
What can I do but wait for you  
Darling the days  
I had looked cold  
  
Now our separate mays we go  
It seems you want more  
Than the love I can give  
But I can't make you stay  
  
And you got your life to live  
But if it gets too rough  
Call on me  
  
Dreams of golden glare  
Taking you away from here  
But if ever think that has to be  
Turns your dreams around  
  
Love and understanding is what you need  
If you can't get enough  
Call on me  
  
I'm so sad you're leaving  
It's going to kill me  
Not to be with you?  
But I want you to be happy  
  
If parting is what you want  
Then I want it too  
So goodbye with all my best  
For your happiness in a world that's there  
  
Should you write and it's not there  
Call on me  
(Call on me)  
  
Yes, happiness  
Wish you for elsewhere  
We remember this should  
You write and it's not there  
Call on me... call on me  
  
Yes, happiness  
Wish you for elsewhere  
We remember this should  
You write and it's not there  
Call on me...
