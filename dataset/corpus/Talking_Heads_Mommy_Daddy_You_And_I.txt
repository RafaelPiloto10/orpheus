All the way home from Baltimore  
We couldn't find a seat  
Conductor says he's sorry for  
The blisters on our feet  
  
Comes a-riding in a bus  
The high and the low  
Mommy, daddy, you and I  
Going on a trip  
  
And we're not going home  
Mommy, daddy, you and I  
Driving, keep driving  
Driving, driving all night  
  
Sleeping on my daddy's shoulder  
Drinking from a paper cup  
And I'm wearing my grandfather's clothes  
And they say that up North it gets cold  
  
Crawling out of bed one night  
Walking in my sleep  
We're not the only family  
To take this little trip  
  
Driving all the way up  
It's thirty below  
Mommy, daddy, you and I  
Even little kids  
  
Getting ready to go  
Mommy, daddy,you and I  
Chilly, chilly-willy  
It's colder the further we go  
  
Some are born to take advantage  
But saying it don't make it so  
So hold me and don't let me go  
'Cause the sidewalks are covered with snow  
  
He's speaking English now  
And he's smoothing out his clothes  
He's Mr. Button Down  
He's leaving home  
  
Making changes day by day  
And we still ain't got no plan  
How we gonna make our way  
In this foreign land?  
  
Well we'll keep driving, keep driving  
Driving with all of our might  
Changing, still changing  
Changing the water of life  
  
Keep that little man a shining  
See how the tail can wag the dog  
And we're all riding in this old bus  
And the driver is singing to us  
  
And we're wearing out grandfather's clothes  
'Cause we heard that up North it gets cold
