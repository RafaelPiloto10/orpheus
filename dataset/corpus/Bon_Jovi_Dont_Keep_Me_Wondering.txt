When I come home, it's late, I feel so all alone  
What was my mistake, baby, why don't you care at all?  
Well if it's just a change in you, I'll adjust,  
But if you're true give me a sign of your trust,  
And am I supposed to be true to you.  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', if you've given up  
  
When I come to bed, you're there, but I feel so all alone  
What can I do, short of sleepin' on the floor  
I might be slow girl but I'm not dumb  
The question arises, am I the only one?  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't you keep me baby  
  
I might be slow girl, I'm not dumb  
The question arises, am I the only one?  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't you give up baby
