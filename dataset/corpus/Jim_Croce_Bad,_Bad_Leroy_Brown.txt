Well the South side of Chicago  
Is the baddest part of town  
And if you go down there  
You better just beware  
Of a man named Leroy Brown  
  
Now Leroy more than trouble  
You see he stand 'bout six foot four  
All the downtown ladies call him "Treetop Lover"  
All the men just call him "Sir"  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown  
The baddest man in the whole damned town  
Badder than old King Kong  
And meaner than a junkyard dog  
  
Now Leroy, he a gambler  
And he like his fancy clothes  
And he like to wave his diamond rings  
Under everybody's nose  
He got a custom Continental  
He got an Eldorado too  
He got a thirty two gun in his pocket for fun  
He got a razor in his shoe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Friday 'bout a week ago  
Leroy shootin' dice  
And at the edge of the bar  
Sat a girl named Doris  
And ooo, that girl looked nice  
Well he cast his eyes upon her  
And the trouble soon began  
Cause Leroy Brown learned a lesson  
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well the two men took to fighting  
And when they pulled them from the floor  
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle  
With a couple of pieces gone
