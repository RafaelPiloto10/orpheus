Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well, she's all geared up, walkin' down the street  
And I can feel the slime, drippin' down her sleeve  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone  
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door  
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore  
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore  
I never should asked for black leather  
Black leather  
Ooh, black leather  
Ow black leather  
  
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far  
You can let her in, and you'll start it again  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Black leather [x 8]
