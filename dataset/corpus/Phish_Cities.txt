Think of London, small city  
Dark, dark in the daytime  
People sleep, sleep in the daytime  
If they want to, if they want to  
  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I've got it figured out  
I've got it figured out  
  
There's some good points, some bad points  
But it all works out, I'm just a little freaked out  
  
Find your city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
  
A lot of bridges in Birmingham  
A lot of ghosts, and a lot of houses  
Look over there, dry ice factory  
Good place to get some thinking done  
  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I've got it figured out  
I'm the one who got it figured out  
  
There's some good points, some bad points  
  
Find your city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
  
Did I forget to mention,  
Forget to mention Memphish  
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks  
Do I smell, I smell home cooking  
It's only the river, it's only the river  
  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I'm checkin' 'em out  
I've got it figured out  
I've got it figured out  
  
There's some good points, some bad points  
Are those things real? Denied!  
  
Find your city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city,  
Find yourself a city to live in  
I will find a city  
Find yourself a city to live in
