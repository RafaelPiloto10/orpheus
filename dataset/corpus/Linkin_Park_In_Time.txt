Time, why must it fly so slow  
Waiting, is something that's easy for you  
Pull the plug, send it down the drain  
Pain is easy to get used to  
What's in me, is in you  
What's got me, has got you  
And everything told, must come true  
  
Pretending to be real, forgetting who you are  
Sin, is always at my door  
Slice the vein, blood spilled on the floor  
Light shining in my eyes  
Death greets me with a smile  
Pain  
So much pain  
Pain  
So much pain
