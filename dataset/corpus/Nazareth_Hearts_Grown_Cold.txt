Go out and have your habit,  
Keep on takin' it  
Keep on fakin' it  
You're the one whose heart grows cold  
You're the one whose heart's grown cold.  
  
Go out and have your habit  
You're the one that's takin' it  
You're the one that's fakin' it  
You're the one whose heart's grown cold  
You're the one whose heart's grown cold.  
  
I touch your lips with my fingertips  
I hang on every breath you take  
You don't need me like,  
I need you  
You have your heartaches to climb  
Everyday, I just hope and pray  
I just hope that you still have,  
That you still have your dreams.  
  
Come down and tell me that it's better  
You're the one who's choosin' it  
You're the one who's losin' it  
You're the one who's got no soul,  
You're the one whose heart's grown cold.
