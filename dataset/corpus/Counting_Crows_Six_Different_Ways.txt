(Original by The Cure)  
  
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And every one I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give them more and more  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give the world and more  
They think I'm on my hands and head  
This time they're much too slow  
  
Six sides to every lie I say  
It's that American voice again  
"It was never quite like this before  
Not one of you is the same... "  
This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And everyone I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside
