I'm gonna drive on out  
To the river tonight  
Find a quiet spot  
Turn on my parking lights  
I'm gonna drink some beers  
Try to catch a buzz  
Turn my radio up  
And forget about us  
  
I'm gonna lay me down  
On the hood of this car  
Make another wish  
Upon a falling star  
I'm gonna think again  
About the way it was  
I'm gonna close my eyes  
And forget about us  
  
[Chorus:]  
I know it won't be easy  
But I've got a plan  
To just let my memory let go of your hand  
I'm gonna miss your touch  
But I know I must  
Forget about us  
  
When the morning sun  
Burns across my face  
I'll put my shirt back on  
Get up and walk away  
I'm gonna climb my frame  
Onto a greyhound bus  
Take a little blue pill  
And forget about us  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
By the time I get to Phoenix  
I won't know your name  
Those soft green eyes  
Warm skin  
And the way you say good morning  
And I'll be alright
