Why don't you try to do without him?  
Why don't you try to live alone?  
Do you really need his hands for your passion?  
Do you really need his heart for your throne?  
Do you need his labour for your baby?  
Do you need his beast for the bone?  
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady?  
I know you're going to make, make it on your own  
Why don't your try to forget him?  
Just open up your dainty little hand  
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions  
Many satisfying one-night stands  
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower?  
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave?  
Do you want to give your blessing to his power  
As he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave  
  
I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony  
Well, that is if I remember the way  
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery  
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray  
You can see they've finally taken cover  
They're willing, yeah they're willing to obey  
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other  
So let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way
