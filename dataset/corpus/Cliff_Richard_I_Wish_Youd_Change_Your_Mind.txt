I wish you'd change your mind and stay  
It's really much too late to play games  
All I want is just to talk with you  
I'll even sing it if you want me to  
  
You know my motives are sincere  
And the love's the reason that we're here  
Seeing you just makes me want to say  
Won't you change your mind for me and stay  
  
I just want to feel your arms about me  
Is that too much to ask or do  
You think that I'd be asking too much  
I wish you'd change your mind and stay  
  
It's really much too late to play games  
All I want is just to talk with you  
I'll even sing it if you want me to
