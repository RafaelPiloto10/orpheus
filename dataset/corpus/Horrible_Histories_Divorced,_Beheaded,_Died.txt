Divorced, beheaded and died.  
Divorced, beheaded, survived.  
I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives.  
Some might say I ruined their lives.  
  
Catherine of Aragon was one  
She failed to give me a son.  
I had to ask her for a divorce  
That broke her poor heart, of course  
  
Young Anne Boleyn she was two,  
had a daughter the best she could do  
I said she flirted with some other man  
And off for the chop went dear Anne.  
  
Lovely Jane Seymour was three,  
The love of a lifetime for me.  
She gave me a son, little Prince Ed,  
Then poor old Jane, went and dropped dead.  
  
Divorced, beheaded and died.  
Divorced, beheaded, survived.  
I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives.

Anne of Cleves came as four,  
I fell for the portrait I saw.  
Then laid on her face and cried, 'She's a horse! I must have another divorce.'  
  
Catherine Howard was five,  
A child of nineteen, so alive.  
She flirted with others, no way to behave.  
The axe sent young Cath to her grave.  
  
Catherine Parr she was last.  
By then all my best days were past.  
I lay on my deathbed aged just fifty-five,  
Lucky Catherine the last stayed alive.  
(I mean, how unfair!)  
  
Divorced, beheaded and died.  
Divorced, beheaded, survived.  
I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives.  
You could say I ruined their lives.
