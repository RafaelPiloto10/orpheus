I like to riff  
Doo-doo-doo-dat-da,  
I like to riff  
Ba-da-da-do-da-da,  
Riffing is the thing for me  
  
I like to riff  
'Cause it puts me solid in the groove  
I like to riff  
Oh, it's a sold killer  
Da-da-da-dod-doo-da-da,  
Riffing is the thing for me  
  
If you want to be a sender  
Knock your friends on the juice or bender  
Grab the major scale and run  
  
I like to riff  
'Cause it makes you feel so fine  
I like to riff  
It takes your troubles off your mind  
Bob-a-bob-a-da-da-razz-a-doo-doo-da  
Riffing is the thing for me  
  
You can riff like this  
Riff like this  
  
I like to riff  
'Cause it makes you feel so fine  
I like to riff  
Takes your troubles off your mind  
Bob-a-bob-a-da-da-razz-a-doo-doo-da  
Razz-a-doo-doo-da-razz-a-doo-da-da  
Razz-a-doo-doo-da-razz-a-doo-da-da  
Riffing, riffing is the thing for me
