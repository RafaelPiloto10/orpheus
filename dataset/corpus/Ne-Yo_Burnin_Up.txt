You Made Me... So Much Fronting  
Doing My... Drove For The... See You Kind Of...  
You See By The Moon Can't See Nothing New  
Drove My Way Over... Closer I Feel The Hit...  
Baby I Came Inside If I Feel Alright  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Burning Up  
But I Know Tonight I Want That Fire In Your Eyes  
...  
Feeling So... Touching... Like There Is Nothing  
Body Made... I Don't Care Let Me Tell You Baby  
... Without The... I Said I Can't...  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I... If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
You Know What To Do With Me  
Don't Know What To Do With Me And You  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Baby I... If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I... If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I... If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I... If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I... If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes
