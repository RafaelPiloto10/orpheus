You were built to last a lifetime  
Just not the life that you live.  
You don't have to make it worse  
'Cause the world isn't perfect  
And you don't need to give a toss  
But you'd make it better if you did.  
You did, you did, you did.  
  
You were made to be loving,  
Not a source of bitterness and hate.  
And when you turn them on yourself  
You make one more useless martyr.  
Make the best of here and now  
Heaven or hell can wait,  
They'll wait, they'll wait, let them wait.  
  
When you lose your appetite for self-destruction  
You can stop viewing life as tragedy.  
Give it a few more years and look from this angle,  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
  
Oh, you were made to be happy,  
Not mired in sorrow and regret.  
Misery comes around enough  
You don't need to invite him.  
And when he leaves you should grab  
All the joy you can get.  
You can get, you can get, you can get.  
  
When you lose your appetite for self-destruction  
You can stop viewing life as tragedy.  
Give it a few more years and look from this angle  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
Like comedy.  
Like comedy.  
Like comedy.
