Hi kids! Welcome to The Uncle Bobo Show!  
Are you ready to sing?  
Come on, let's go!  
Billy and his family  
Went on a holiday  
They went down to Florida  
To laugh and dance and play  
Bill went in for a swim  
He didn't see the harm  
But when he came back out again  
He was short an arm!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp  
  
Billy and his father  
Went out to play some catch  
But Billy missed the pass  
Because his arm was unattached  
The ball flew past his shoulder  
And it rolled into the swamp  
When he went wading after it  
His leg became a stump!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp..  
  
Billy and his father  
Joined a three-legged race  
They were tearing up the field  
No one could keep the pace  
But Billy tripped and did a flip  
And landed in the muck  
He was running out of limbs  
And also out of luck!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went CHOMP, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp  
  
Billy was all dirty  
He really had to wash  
But he couldn't use a towel  
'Cause his limbs had been gnawed off.  
He went into the water  
To get all clean and bright  
But when he was finished  
He was only half his height.  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp..  
  
Billy's father rolled his wheelchair  
Up upon a hill  
He wanted to take Bill  
Where he would not get killed  
But he left him on a slope  
And into a swamp he rolled  
They dragged out his head  
But there was nothing down below!  
  
'Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Rippy The Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!  
Passing the time By ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp..  
Passing the time by ending children's lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp  
(Down in the swamp..)
