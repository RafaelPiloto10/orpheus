Without a doubt, girl, you're ahead of your time  
Let's go out on the town  
Give it a piece of your mind  
You've been going 'round and 'round in your head  
So don't think twice  
You'll end up worse than you've been  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
And I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
  
So come on, shout it out so everybody can hear  
There's no need to rhyme it: the message is clear  
You know I can't ignore  
So I don't know what you're waiting for  
But you're trying hard not to show it  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
Well, I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
Come on, come on  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
  
Can't figure out how we made it this far  
If you don't mind me sayin'  
There's no sense in waiting so  
Shout it out, shout it out  
Shout it out, shout it out  
You can't deny it, you can't deny it  
  
'Cause I know that you've been thinkin' 'bout it  
And I know they think you're out of your mind  
All of this time  
I know that you've been waiting so  
You can't deny  
I know that you've been waiting for this  
I know that you've been waiting for this
