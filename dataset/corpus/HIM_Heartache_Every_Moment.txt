From lashes to ashes and from lust to dust  
In your sweetest torment I'm lost  
And no heaven can help us  
Ready, willing and able to lose it all  
For a kiss so fatal and so warm  
  
Oh it's heartache every moment  
From the start till the end  
It's heartache every moment  
With you  
Deeper into our heavenly suffering  
Our fragile souls are falling  
It's heartache every moment  
Baby with you  
  
And we sense the danger  
But don't want to give up  
'cause there's no smile of an angel  
Without the wrath of god  
  
Oh it's heartache every moment  
From the start till the end  
It's heartache every moment with you  
Deeper into our heavenly suffering  
Our fragile souls are falling  
It's heartache every moment  
Baby with you  
My darling with you  
  
From lashes to ashes and from lust to dust  
In your sweetest torment I'm lost  
And we sense the danger  
But don't want to give up  
  
Oh it's heartache every moment  
From the start till the end  
It's heartache every moment  
With you  
Deeper into our heavenly suffering  
Our fragile souls are falling  
It's heartache every moment  
Baby with you  
That's right
