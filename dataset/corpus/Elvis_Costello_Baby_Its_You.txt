(Sha, la, la, la...)  
It's not the way you look that touched my heart.  
It's not the way you kissed me, baby, that tears me apart.  
Many, many nights I tried. I sit alone at home and I cried over you.  
What can I do? I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.  
  
You should hear the things they say about you.  
They say you're never, ever, ever, ever gonna be true. Oh.  
I don't listen to a word they say. I'm gonna love you any old way.  
What can I do? It's true. I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.

Baby, it's you.
