Tell me, tell me, tell me please  
What is this that hovers me it's  
Driving me to a state of hopeless  
Having any sex at all  
Hasn't any worth at all  
Or is it just enough to bitch  
  
The funny thing that makes me do  
The things that I do to you  
Oh I know they are so damn very tall  
I'm in a state I can't explain  
My mind is gone, my mind is gone  
It seems so very little I can do  
  
Cause all these things I want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me, tell me, tell me please [Repeat: x3]  
Won't you tell me please  
  
I'm so full of emptiness  
It's so hard to sustain the mess  
I've no idea who I am at all  
So tell me, tell me, tell me please  
What is this that hovers me  
Before I smash my head against the wall  
  
Cause all these things I want to know  
  
[Chorus: x2]
