(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
It's the holiday season  
Candy Canes, cookies sprinkle the town  
Everyone's jolly, happy, and merry  
The dead sing carols in the cemetary  
I went up to the mall to meet a Santa Claus  
Why you wanna meet a Santa Claus??  
Just because  
He's a star and I wanna get his autograph  
Did you meet the fat bastard??  
You don't know the half  
So I waitin' line with my pad and pen  
I finally got up to the bitch and he had a grin  
He said he's been watchin' me and I'm a disgrace  
So I reach for the nine and shot him in the spine  
All the kiddies runnin', screamin' and cryin'  
Santa ain't breathin' I think that he's dyin'  
He's tryin' to move so I boot him in his grin  
Ha  
Bitch should've known about the Santa Claus killa  
  
(Chorus 2x)  
Santa Claus  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin'  
The Santa Claus killaz  
  
(Mike E. Clark)  
I'm a Santa Claus killa  
Bitch what the fuck you know about  
You know nothin  
So fuck turkey and stuffin  
I drink a straight 40  
Fuck that shitty egg nog  
Cause I'm a wicked clown straight up freak dog  
I gets paid I'm pickin up the G shit  
And Santa Claus ain't never brought me shit  
The fat slop doesn't drink my milk  
So don't come around bitch or get your cap peeled  
I'm Mike Clark  
I'm pimpin' through Clark Park  
In a 1981 Skylark  
And its dusted, dented and rusted  
Don't look or get your lips busted  
Santa Claus won't bring me a bm  
So I'mma choke that bitch when I see him  
Mc, Detroit big wheeler  
But on Christmas Eve I'm a Santa Claus killa  
  
(Fink)  
It's Christmas Eve  
Another time to decieve  
Got another trick up my sleeve  
He won't leave  
I just wait Tick-Tock-Ticky  
Someone told me what the fuck is Saint Nickie  
Nick, prick North Pole hick  
Bitch ass sap, what the fuck is that?  
Sounds like Rudolph and the whole clique  
Its time for some down with the clown G shit  
I hear the fat bitch in the chimney  
Spark up the matches  
Fire catches  
And I burn that motherfucker up  
Wha Wha What The fuck!  
Cooked his ass with a crackling sound  
Watch as the ash comes juggling down  
I smoke them bones and I get much illa  
Fink, The Eastside G  
The Santa Claus killa  
  
(Chorus 2x)  
Santa Claus  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin'  
The Santa Claus killaz  
  
(Violent J)  
One last minute  
I get's deadly  
Sit back children  
Check the medley  
Its cold out, I could give a fuck less  
Cause I'm waitin' on a bitch in a red dress  
A fat bitch with a big white beard  
Strapped with a big lead pipe I'm geared  
I hear bells, Jing-a-Ling-Jing-Ling-Ding-a-Ling  
That's the sound, the dead man here  
The dead man here when death is near  
I take my pipe and say fuck it  
Whip and Lug It  
Straight to the nugget  
Out cold in a flash, a dash  
Then I pushed his ass off the roof  
And straight jacked the sleigh  
The ghetto's payday from the Santa Claus killa  
  
(Chorus 2x)  
Santa Claus  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin'  
I'm comin'  
The Santa Claus killaz
