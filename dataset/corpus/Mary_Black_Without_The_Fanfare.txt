I know it's the same old song I'm singing  
But this time these words are just for you  
That's the only thing that's new  
I know that I've sung about a million  
Borrowed lines and phrases from a few  
This one's till as good as new  
Without the fanfare I love you  
By day I move words around like flowers  
I deliver by the afternoon  
"cause the piper calls the tune  
Today I made full use of the hours  
I explored the smallest avenue  
And that feeling still came through  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Sure I've lost my way sometimes  
But I've had to pay  
Sometimes I've gone completely overboard  
Moved a million phrases round, tried to make them leave the ground  
Still the only line that's soared  
Bidding all the rest adieu  
Sounding still as good as new  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Hello, do I still have your attention?  
I forgot to mention thanks again from the captain and the crew  
And so without the sweet perfume or roses  
I hope you can still believe it's true  
Stripped of all that much ado  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Without the fanfare I love you
