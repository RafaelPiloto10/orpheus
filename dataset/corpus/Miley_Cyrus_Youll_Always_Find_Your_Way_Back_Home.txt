You wake up, it's raining and it's monday  
Looks like one of those rough days  
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door (Out the door)  
Sometimes you feel like running  
Find a whole new life and jump in  
Let go, get out and hit the dance floor  
'Cause when the lights go down it's the ending of the show  
And you're feeling like you got knowhere to go  
Don't you know  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, and you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, and you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
Your best friends, your little hometown  
Are waiting up wherever you go now  
You know that you can always turn around  
Cause this world is big and it's crazy (crazy)  
And this girl is thinking that maybe  
This life is what some people dream about  
Cause when I'm feeling down and I am all alone (woah, Woah)  
I've always got a place where I can go  
Cause I know  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, and you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
Where they know exactly who you are  
The real you is the superstar  
You know it's never too far away  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
  
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes  
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes  
You can say goodbye, you can say hello  
But you'll always find your way back home  
You can change your style, and you can change your jeans  
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams  
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows  
You'll always find your way back home  
  
You'll always find your way back home...  
You'll always find your way back home...  
You'll always find your way back home...
