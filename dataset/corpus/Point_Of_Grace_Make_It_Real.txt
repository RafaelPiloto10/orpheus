Well we walk, down the road, everyday  
With a plastic smile and we wave like we're in a parade  
Oooh and then we pass one another  
With a nothing but a "how do you do"  
Oh but it would make me smile  
If we'd stop for awhile  
And just give me the truth now  
We can make it real  
Open your heart  
'Cause that's when you start  
To truly feel  
We can make it real  
Look in my eyes  
You feel it inside  
Yea you know you will  
We can make it real now now  
We can make it  
Let your mind take a walk in the rain  
Let your head roll back, taste the joy, remember the pain  
'Cause we can talk about the weather  
We can weather it together my friend  
Yes we can  
And the sun will shine on your heart and mine  
We will feel it again and again and again  
Chorus  
This life that we're liven  
It's all that we're given  
There's so little precious time  
Cause now it's the moment  
Let your emotions breathe in the open sky  
Fly  
We can make it real now  
We can try to make it real  
Oh yea  
Open your heart  
'Cause that's when you start  
To truly feel  
We can make it real  
Look in my eyes  
You'll feel it inside  
Yea you know you will  
Open your heart  
'Cause that's when you start  
To truly feel  
We can make it  
We can make it real  
Yea you know we can  
We can make it real  
Yea
