Do you know we reached somehow the end of every story  
Welcome to the final show, it's here in all its glory  
All we've been, all we see was born so long ago  
In times of joy and of tears, we carried on  
The winds were still, did no harm to our shores  
But the seed's already sown, now the storm will come  
Over and over we're downcast  
Only, it's only a dark past  
Do you know we reached somehow the end of every story  
Welcome to the final show, it's here in all its glory  
You can run but all you flee is a life of sorrow  
Time will tell what kind of fate will be waiting for us now  
Built on sand by our hands were all of our homes  
Turn around, realize this world is not our own  
So we have to succumb to the call of fate  
Hear it now, it leads us down to future's open gate  
Falling, we're falling with closed eyes  
Losing, now losing our old disguise  
Do you know we reached somehow the end of every story  
Welcome to the final show, it's here in all its glory  
You can run but all you flee is a life of sorrow  
Time will tell what kind of fate will be waiting for us now  
The end, the end, the end of every story  
Do you know we reached somehow the end of every story  
Welcome to the final show, it's here in all its glory  
You can run but all you flee is a life of sorrow  
Time will tell what kind of fate will be waiting for us now
