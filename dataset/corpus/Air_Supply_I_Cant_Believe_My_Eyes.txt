I've dance alone a thousand times  
To songs that no one else could even hear  
I've reached into the flame of love  
I couldn't hold it  
And it disappeared  
I've lived to learn to hate the blues  
I've lived with everything but you  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin' just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good, it's too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin' here with you  
ooh  
I can't believe my eyes  
  
I've felt the empty hands of time  
As they were stealin' all my life away  
I've heard the silence here inside  
Waiting for words that lovers  
Could not say  
You turn a little into stone  
With every night you spend alone  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin' just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good, it's too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin' here with you  
Ooh  
Still, when I see you lyin' here  
I can't believe my eyes
