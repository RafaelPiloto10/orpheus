Open up your window  
Open up your door  
I need a taste of your sweet, sweet love  
That's all I'm livin' for  
I've been down on my luck  
Down on my knees  
Just waitin' for a chance to show you, baby  
I only aim to please  
Hey, hey, honey  
I'm out on the edge, I'm on the borderline  
Hey, little honey  
You won't believe what's goin' through my mind  
I'll build a mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
Every time I think of you  
You'll feel a mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
See it risin' up, and all you've gotta do  
Is get high on my mountain of love  
There ain't no use in pretendin'  
'Cause I've got my eyes on you, baby  
The first time that I saw you girl, I knew  
Nobody else would do  
Hey, hey, honey  
Take a little trip, take a ride with me  
Hey, little honey  
'Cause I've got something you've just gotta see  
It's a mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
High enough to touch the sky  
You'll feel a mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
See it risin' up, and all you've gotta do  
Is get high on my mountain of love  
Hey, hey, honey  
I'm out on the edge, I'm on the borderline  
Say, little honey  
Come with me and we'll climb, climb, climb  
Up on a mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
High enough to touch the sky  
A mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
Can't you feel it burnin' up inside  
I'm gonna build a mountain of love  
Every time I think of you  
You'll feel a mountain of love  
(Mountain of love)  
Risin' up, and all you've gotta do  
Is get high on my mountain of love, yeah  
Get on up  
Build me that, babe  
Climb on top now  
Get up  
Oh, I'm gonna get high on my mountain of love  
Yeah, yeah
