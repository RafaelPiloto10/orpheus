Do you hear the thunder  
Raging in the sky?  
Premonition of a  
Shattered world that's gonna die  
  
In the Age of Reason  
how do we survive?  
The protocols of evil  
Ravaging so many lives?  
So many lives  
So many lives  
  
Mystifying silence  
Talking Peace on Earth  
We should judge each other  
For ourselves not what we're worth  
  
Sustainable extinction  
A fractured human race  
A jaded revolution  
Disappears without a trace  
without a trace  
without a trace  
Alrigth yeah  
  
Always felt that there'd be trouble  
Mass distraction hides the truth  
Prozac days and sleepless hours  
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit  
  
oh yeah,  
these time are heavy  
And you're all alone  
The battle's over  
But the war goes on  
  
Politics, religion  
Love of money too  
It's what the world was built for  
But not for me and you, oh yeah
