That slow burn wait while it gets dark,  
Bruising the sun, I feel grown up with you in your car  
I know it's dumb  
  
We've both got a million bad habits to kick  
Not sleeping is one  
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip  
I'm biting my tongue  
  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When People are talking, people are talking  
  
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough, get away with it  
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone  
We're all alone  
We're alone  
  
All my fake friends and all of their noise  
Complain about work  
They're studying business, I study the floor  
And you haven't stopped smoking all night  
Maybe the Internet raised us  
Or maybe people are jerks  
  
When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)  
When people are talking, people are talking  
  
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough, get away with it  
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone  
We're all alone  
We're alone  
  
All the double-edged people and schemes  
They make a mess then go home and get clean  
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone,  
We're all alone  
We're all alone  
  
I know we're not everlasting  
We're a train wreck waiting to happen  
One day the blood won't flow so gladly  
One day we're all get still  
When people are talking, people are talking  
Get still  
  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
  
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough, get away with it  
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone  
We're all alone  
We're alone  
  
All the double-edged people and schemes  
They make a mess then go home and get clean  
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone  
We're all alone  
We're all alone  
  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
When people are talking, people are talking  
  
Let 'em talk
