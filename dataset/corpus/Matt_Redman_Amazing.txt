A love so undeserved, a gift that's free  
You lavish me  
A peace I could not earn  
And mercy for the freedom of my soul  
  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
  
Forgiveness runs so deep  
Within Your heart of loving kindness  
And should a soul forget  
The cross of Christ reminds us every day  
  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
That's what's so amazing about Your grace  
Lord, every day pour on me  
Your blessings of eternity  
And that's what's so amazing about Your grace  
  
Freely I've recieved, now freely to give  
Freely I've recieved, now freely to give  
Freely I've recieved, now freely to give  
Give my life to You...
