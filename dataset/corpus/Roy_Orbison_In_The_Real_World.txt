In dreams we do so many things  
We set aside the rules we know  
And fly the world so high  
In great and shining rings  
  
If only we could always live in dreams  
If only we could make of life  
What, in dreams, it seems  
  
But in the real world  
We must say our goodbyes  
No matter if the love will live  
It will never die  
  
In the real world  
There are things that we can't change  
And endings come to us  
In ways that we can't rearrange  
  
I love you, and you love me  
But sometimes we must let it be  
In the real world  
In the real world  
  
When we were dreaming heart to heart  
I wish that we had stayed right there  
For when the dreamers do awake  
The dreams do disappear  
  
In the real world  
There are things that we can't change  
And endings come to us  
In ways that we can't rearrange  
  
I love you, and you love me  
But sometimes we must let it be  
In the real world  
In the real world
