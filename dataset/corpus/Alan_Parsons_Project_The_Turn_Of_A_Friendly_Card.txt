The Turn of a Friendly Card (Part 1)  
(Lead vocal - Chris Rainbow)  
There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains  
And a wheel in perpetual motion  
And they follow the races and pay out the gains  
With no show of outward emotion  
And they think it will make their lives easier  
For God knows up till now it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west  
Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise  
And not all's the king's horse and all the king's men  
Have prevented the fall of the unwise  
For they think it will make their lives easier  
And God knows it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine  
As he enters inside the cathedral...
