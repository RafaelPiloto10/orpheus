That's the two we are you and me.  
I can't make you talk, I'll make you see  
Us and them just can't agree.  
We can't write the songs we want  
To make it up to eachother  
So we'll just take it out on our brothers.  
I'll see you 'round the world.  
See you 'round the world.  
Make your mother proud, yeah.  
Never a blemish on your face  
Skinniest guy I could never replace.  
We'll drag another round, yeah.  
And create another problem  
And spill it out on our favourite album.  
Is it be cool if I grab a little of your time?  
I feel my heart over crowded  
Steal everything you say and make it mine.  
If my head would allow it  
Never trust anybody with a clear face.  
Shouldn't have to shout it  
Your the enemy I know I'd never replace.  
See you 'round the world.
