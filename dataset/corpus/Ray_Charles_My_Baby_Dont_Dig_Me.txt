Sometimes I stop and wonder  
How can this thing go on  
For when I'm with my baby  
She always make me feel alone  
  
No, my woman don't dig me, no, no  
Boys, I know I'm gonna  
Know the reason why  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, we're as far from each other  
As the Earth is from the sky  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, I put my arms around her  
She'll flinch and move away  
And that's not just one time  
You know that's each and every day  
  
I tell you, my woman  
She don't dig me now  
No, no, no, no, now, now  
Boys, I know the reason why  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, we're far from each other  
Hey, yeah, as the Earth  
Is from the sky  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
We don't have enough in common  
To act like lovers should  
I think that's the reason  
Our love affair's no good  
  
You know my woman don't dig me  
No, no, no, no  
Now people I tell you  
I know the reason why  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, we're far from each other  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
As the Earth is from the sky  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)...
