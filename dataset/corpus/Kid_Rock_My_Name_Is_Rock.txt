Fly with new blast, get gas  
Kid Rock some folks thought I'd flew right past  
Faded fast, ran outta gas  
Here I come again, all back in that ass  
  
No questions, I tell no lies  
Rely Kid Rock is on the rise  
Like a sky scraper  
I'm back like smack, and so are the vapors  
  
And the papers, cause I'm gonna rhyme  
Right, jump right back up into the lime light  
And I'm rackin my brain where the pain was  
No I got more soul than the train does  
  
Mid western funkin, car pumpin from the amps in the trunkin  
Ya can't stop this boy, this time  
I'm the real macoy  
And you know My name is Rock  
  
You know My name is Rock [Repeat: x 7]  
  
So hey punk, feel the funk  
Feel the wrath of the rock  
Non stop, I got a glock in my pants  
I don't dance, I sit around  
  
I don't sip 40's, I pound  
I been around too long, commin too strong  
Kid Rock got it goin on  
See me, see you, see through, emcee's who knew  
  
Fly like the wind, I hang like a hinge  
Been gone like rhymes on a drinkin binge  
So don't cringe at the sight of Rock  
Ya want to fight the rock, ya gotta fight this glock  
  
And you can say my beats are fake  
But it don't mean shit when your gettin paid  
Hip-Hop, the jam don't stop  
  
You know My name is Rock [Repeat: x 7]  
  
I'm the D to the O, P to the D  
O to the straight up G see  
I been around like Jesus layin tracks  
But I had to come back, I had to come back  
  
Back from the dead, enough said  
Still trippin like Fred  
Be red, ya got a head full of holes  
I got a head full of bowls  
  
I'm the K-I straight from the D, punk  
From the home of the be funk  
Ain't no frontin here, I won't disapear  
I'll be around next year  
  
I'm the Jiffymack  
In the rack, writin off for some ify crack  
Last year, this year it's all the same  
But you know my name is Rock  
  
You know My name is Rock [Repeat: x 8]  
  
K-I-D's the name
