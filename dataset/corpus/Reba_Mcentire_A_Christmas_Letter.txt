At an antique desk  
An old man sits alone  
It's Christmas Eve  
And it's almost time to go  
  
He signs his name to a letter he just wrote  
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow  
  
[Chorus]  
I want peace on earth for Christmas  
In a world where there's not one hungry child  
They would hope and faith  
Conquers fear and hate  
All I'm asking for is a little more love  
  
Then he walks outside  
And he climbs up on his sleigh  
And calls out to his reindeer  
Off they fly away  
Oh tonight he'll make a million dreams appear  
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That they would hope and faith  
Conquers fear and hate  
All I'm asking for is a little more love
