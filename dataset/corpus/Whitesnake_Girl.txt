I have never known a woman  
Who loves me like you do,  
You treat me like a dog  
An' make me shake my tail for you  
I know the game you're playing  
When you're turning all your tricks  
It's written on your face  
You just want your business fixed  
  
No, I don't need a crystal ball  
To see what's in your mind  
If I don't give you what you want  
You treat me so unkind,  
But if I'm good and give you love  
You throw me down a bone,  
But if I'm bad you make me sad  
An' leave my love alone  
  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
Just a pretty little crazy white girl,  
Pretty little crazy white girl  
Girl, girl  
Pretty little crazy white girl  
  
I know, baby, you ain't fooling  
With all your high class schooling,  
You want everything your own way  
If I could, I would  
Do every little thing a good man should,  
Baby, I'd really give it to you  
Every day  
  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
Just a pretty little crazy white girl,  
Pretty little crazy white girl  
Girl  
  
Mean mistreater,  
There ain't no one to beat you,  
But you treat me so bad  
I've never known a woman  
Who loves me like you do,  
You treat me like a dog  
An' still I shake my tail for you  
  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
Just a pretty little crazy white girl,  
Pretty little crazy white girl  
Girl, girl  
  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
Girl, she treat me so bad  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
Girl, come on baby  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
I love the way you make me  
Girl  
Pretty little crazy white girl,  
Girl  
Pretty little crazy white girl
