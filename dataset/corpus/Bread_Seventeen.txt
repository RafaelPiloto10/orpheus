Seventeen, it's been a while since I was seventeen  
And the years since have been mighty lean  
But there's no use complaining  
  
And forty-two has a way of creeping up on you  
And my chances left are getting few  
But there's still time remaining  
  
And I've been waiting for someone, who loves the way I do  
Girl I got my fingers crossed, in hopes it might be you

Twenty-one, that's how many different jobs I've done  
I remember quitting every one  
With no hesitating  
  
And thirty-three, that's how many women left on me  
I don't have too good a history  
But I don't mind waiting  
  
Cause it really doesn't matter how many years we've seen  
Cause love is always seventeen  
  
Wonder if you'll be the one to end this lonesome heart  
Cause girl I got a lot to give and I'd sure like to start  
  
Cause it really doesn't matter how many years we've seen  
Cause love is always seventeen
