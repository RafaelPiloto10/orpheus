In the dead of night  
I become someone else  
Cut all my ties  
Blow my mind off the shelf  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and no strain  
  
Let it rise  
Way out of control  
You can't disguise  
What's inevitable  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, no strain  
  
Ooo-aaoh  
Ooo-aaoh  
Ooo-aaoh  
  
'Cause your time is getting more than ever  
  
In the dead of night  
I become someone else  
Cut all my ties  
Blow my mind off the shelf  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, no strain  
  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night and, up all night  
We're the lawless brigade  
Up all night, no strain
