Night-  
And the world is fast asleep  
I will hold you here and keep  
All our secret dreams and plans  
  
You-  
Never thought our love could last  
Now you've put that in the past  
Cause you finally understand  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all  
  
We-  
All the promises we made  
All the words we never said  
Never knowing what was right  
  
You didn't know-  
That the love we used to share  
Wasn't cause it wasn't there  
We'll make up for it tonight  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all  
  
We were young  
And your dreams took you places far from me  
I was wrong  
To believe  
That you'd go  
Cause here you are  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all
