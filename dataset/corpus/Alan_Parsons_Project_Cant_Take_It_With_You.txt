Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just a humble servant with a message here for you  
Well I know you have good reasons and there's things you've got to do  
But the boatman won't be waiting and he's leaving here with you  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
  
(one more mile, one more road, one last bridge, one less load)  
  
Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just obeying orders, I'm a simple soul like you  
Well you really are persuasive, but I've heard it all before  
And the boatman's getting restless as he stands upon the shore  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
Can't take it with you
