What's your name is it Jane  
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool?  
It's just I tired of wasting my hours  
Talking to trees and watching flowers grow  
Watching birds chasing bees  
Little boys scraping knees  
Even my tears have all dried  
Can I sit by your side?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't misunderstand me  
I'm just an old man with no place to go  
And if you oblige me and sit here beside me  
I'll tell you a story a beautiful story  
That you might not know Please don't go  
  
Pardon me mister tree  
I hope I didn't offend you before  
You are my friend but I wanted much more  
But now I'm back once again  
Like always before  
Watching birds chasing bees  
Little boys scraping knees  
Even my tears have all dried  
Can I sit by your side?  
  
[Chorus]
