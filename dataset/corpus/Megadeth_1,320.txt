Grinding my teeth, white knuckles grasp at the wheel  
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline, it's all that I feel  
As quick as a bolt of lightning, a rocket ride in a bucket seat  
It doesn't get any better than this, it just feeds my need for speed  
  
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming  
Fire spiting from the pipes  
A burnout by the flame throwing fury  
8, 000 horses ignite  
Full throttle, hit the ground running  
With a tank full of nitro  
And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line  
  
My hands hold tight, a fire breathing stampede  
I fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns green  
In a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayers  
Man and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin air  
  
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming  
Fire spiting from the pipes  
A burnout by the flame throwing fury  
8, 000 horses ignite  
Full throttle, hit the ground running  
With a tank full of nitro  
And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line
