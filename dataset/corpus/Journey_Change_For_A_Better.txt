Down the lowest I can go  
With no one left to turn  
On the edge, I lose control  
Before I crash and burn  
Can I turn around  
Slow it down, oh  
  
Hold on, we've still got living to do  
So far gone  
See life for someone like you  
In your eyes  
You showed me reasons to live  
Take time  
The time it takes to forgive  
  
It's my life, it'll change for the better  
I've faced the light  
It's worth the fight  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
Make it change for the better  
  
I was dying, a drowning man  
And I wish you well  
Pull me from the darkness  
And save me from myself  
  
Wake up, shake it off  
Let go  
What I'm pretending to be  
I know  
I'm still the man I could be, yeah  
  
It's my life, it'll change for the better  
I've faced the light  
It's worth the fight  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
Make a change for the better  
  
I'm waking up to find  
A different state of mind  
There was a new place, I'm okay  
I've changed for the better  
  
I've opened up my eyes  
I'm glad to be alive  
It's never too late  
To cheat fate  
Changed for the better  
  
And now then there is no hope  
Until we are faced without  
We can never fall in love  
Until we learn to live without  
In our love we can't find peace  
Without conflict in our lives  
And the healing won't begin, oh  
'Til we open up our eyes  
  
It's my life, it'll change for the better  
I've faced the light  
It's worth the fights  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
It all comes together  
  
Made my mind up  
There's still time enough  
I'm all right  
Made a change for the better  
  
Change for the better  
Change for the better, yeah  
Oh, oh, oh  
Yeah, I'm all right  
Oh
