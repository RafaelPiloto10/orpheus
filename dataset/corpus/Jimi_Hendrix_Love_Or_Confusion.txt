Is that the stars in the sky or is it rain fallin down?  
Will it burn me it I touch the sun, yeah  
So be it so round?  
Will I be truthful, yeah  
In a, choosing you as the one for me?  
  
Is this love baby  
Or is it a, just confusion?  
  
Oh, my mind is so messed up goin' round 'n' round  
Must there be all these colors without names  
Without sounds, babe  
My heart burns with feelin' but  
Oh but my mind is cold and reeling  
Is this love, baby  
Or is it confusion?  
  
Oh my head is pounding pounding  
Going 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round  
Must there always be these colors?  
Without names without sound?  
My heart burns with feelin' but  
Oh but my mind is cold and reeling  
Is this love, or is it just confusion?  
  
Ah you tell me baby  
Is this love or confusion  
We must get together and find out  
Exactly what we're trying to do  
  
Confusion
