Hold me, touch me, make me your woman  
I will love you with sweet surrender  
Tonight our hearts will beat as one  
So won't you hold me, make me your woman  
  
Tonight, something in your eyes I see  
A pure and simple honesty  
Won't you hold me in your arms  
Tonight will last forever  
Let's not waste this precious time  
This moment's our's to treasure  
  
Won't you hold me in your arms  
Don't make me wait forever  
When the morning sun appears  
We'll find our way together  
  
Believe you when you say that you love me  
Know that I won't take you for granted  
Tonight our hearts will beat as one  
Hold me, make me your woman  
  
Tonight, something in your eyes I see  
I won't betray your trust in me  
Won't you hold me in your arms  
Tonight will last forever  
Let's not waste this precious time  
This moment's ours to treasure  
  
Won't you hold me in your arms  
Don't make me wait forever  
When the morning sun appears  
We'll find our way together  
  
Hold me, touch me  
Make me your woman tonight
