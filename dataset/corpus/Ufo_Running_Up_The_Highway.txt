Quit my job at the 7-11  
3-d vision and a glance of heaven  
Picked up my six string began to play  
Just one touch and it started to say  
  
All your dreams will come true  
Lovely mansion with a pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife  
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
  
A thousand motels waiting to trash  
Tv dinners, well I love that bash  
And if you Eddie, just say hi  
This party's open so drop on by  
  
All your dreams will come true  
A sunny haven from the inland revenue  
Hot nights in Paris a chance to dance  
Since I signed up I've been living in a trance  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
  
I'm feeling sick like dawn of the dead  
I've got marines marching through my head  
John-boy Walton, he's so nice  
So come in this must be paradise  
  
All your dreams will come true  
That lovely mansion with it's pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife  
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I can't see
