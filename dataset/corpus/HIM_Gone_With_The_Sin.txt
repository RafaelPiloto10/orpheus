I love your skin oh so white  
I love your touch cold as ice  
And I love every single tear you cry  
I just love the way you're losing your life  
  
My Baby, how beautiful you are  
My Darling, completely torn apart  
You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are  
You're gone with the sin my Darling  
  
I adore the despair in your eyes  
I worship your lips once red as wine  
I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine  
I just love the way you're running out of life
