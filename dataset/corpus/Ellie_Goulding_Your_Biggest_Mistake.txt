Take cover  
Signs don't show  
You drove me  
Off the road  
  
But you let go  
'Cause your hope is gone  
And every question fades away  
  
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from  
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off  
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake  
  
You tread water  
Fighting for the air in your lungs  
Move  
Move closer  
Maybe you can right all your wrongs  
  
But you let go  
'Cause your hope is gone  
And every answer fades away  
  
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from  
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off  
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake  
  
Wipe the mud spray from the face stop the engine  
Stop pretending  
Wipe the mud spray from your face stop the engine,  
Stop pretending, that you're still breathing  
  
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from  
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off  
Would it take the end of time to hear your hearts false start?  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake  
  
You know this is your biggest mistake  
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste  
And of all the things you never explained  
Well you know this is your biggest mistake
