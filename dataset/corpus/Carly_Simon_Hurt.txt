Hurt to think that you lied to me  
Hurt way down deep inside of me  
You said your love was true and we'd never part  
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart  
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know  
Hurt because I still love you so  
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do  
I would never, never hurt you
