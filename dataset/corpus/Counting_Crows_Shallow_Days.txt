Mary Jane says, it's all right  
She's just around the corner from the main light  
Any day now, it's all right  
She's standing on the precipice of big time  
  
And I know I'm a little uptight  
I got to go before the sun shines  
We're just a couple small people squeezing out a life  
We need a little good time  
  
It's not far from here  
Mary comes and goes  
Drifting through the scenery  
Of shallow days below  
Now that's everybody knows  
  
You follow trains out of town  
And they vanish somewhere under the horizon  
Yeah well, I saw Mary Jane drag her shadow  
Down the tracks, stare off in the distance  
  
It's not far from here  
Mary waves 'Hello'  
Smiling though she's sinking  
In the shallow days below  
  
Oh no, I can't find a way out of here  
Out on the road again  
I'm much, much too concerned about Mary Jane  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she said but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
Through the shallow days down below  
  
You know I heard a band  
Playing waltzes in a grange hall  
The sun is sinking lower  
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself  
And nobody really knows her  
  
Any day now it's all right  
She tells herself that this will be the last time  
Then Mary Jane pulls her hair back and wonders  
What she'll do with all her free time  
  
Not too far from here  
Mary turns to go  
Smiling while the waltz begins  
Dancing down the road  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mr. Freedom  
What are we supposed to think?  
'Cause I'm a very tiny person and it worries me  
  
I'm all alone again and  
I like what she says but not what it means  
She leaves me drowning  
In the shallow days way down below  
  
"I'm sorry", she said  
"I know it's not the kind of thing you want"  
I'm falling, falling down  
"I'm sorry", she said  
"I know I'm not the kind of girl you want"  
We're falling, falling, falling, falling down
