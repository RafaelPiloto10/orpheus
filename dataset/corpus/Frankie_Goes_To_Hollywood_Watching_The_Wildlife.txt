Watching the wildlife  
On my way home, the state of Rome  
People gliding on the floor  
Pleased with life not needing more  
Sunset on the river  
People go home in the rain  
Familiar faces on the train  
Running scared, and staying sane  
  
If you live by the sword  
Well that's your own reward  
So don't walk with me  
Watching the wildlife  
The beast within you  
Eats your heart out  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
Boys in the backyard  
The girls are hanging out the lines  
Washing the day, wash your troubles away  
It's game we have to play  
Ghosts are chasing you round  
Things that happen in the past  
Don't make that mistake again  
The sun beats down the streets of passion  
  
If you live by the sword  
Well that's your own reward  
So don't talk with me  
Watching the wildlife  
The beast within you  
Eats your heart out  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
Your own worst enemy  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
If you live by the sword  
Watching the wildlife  
Watching you  
The beast within you too  
Watching the wildlife  
  
Get in love, get in love  
  
Watching the wildlife  
We all live in a dream in home  
We watch TV and drive a car  
We go outside, but not too far  
Watching the wildlife  
We walk the water like a sun  
Living cuts you like a knife  
Living here watching the Wildlife  
  
Get in love, get in love
