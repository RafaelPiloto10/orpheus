I've been lately thinking  
About my life's time  
All the things I've done  
And how it's been  
And I can't help believing  
In my own mind  
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end  
  
I've seen a lot of sunshine  
Slept out in the rain  
Spent a night or two all on my own  
I've known my lady's pleasures  
Had myself some friends  
And spent a time or two all on my own  
  
And I have to say it now  
It's been a good life all in all  
It's really fine  
To have a chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long it's been since yesterday  
And what about tomorrow  
And what about our dreams  
And all the memories we share  
  
The days they pass so quickly now  
Nights are seldom long  
And time around me whispers when it's cold  
The changes somehow frighten me  
Still I have to smile  
It turns me on to think of growing old  
For though my life's been good to me  
There's still so much to do  
So many things my mind has never known  
I'd like to raise a family  
I'd like to sail away  
And dance across the mountains on the moon  
  
I have to say it now  
It's been a good life all in all  
It's really fine  
To have the chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long it's been since yesterday  
What about tomorrow  
What about our dreams  
And all the memories we share
