Run away  
Leave all your worries behind you  
Run away  
Run for your life never turn back  
Run away  
Run from the wrong that surrounds you  
Run away  
Run like a fool and you just might make it  
(chorus)  
And soon you will be  
Right ware you wanna be  
Free to live the way you want to  
And soon you will find  
Just what you're lookin' for  
All the good times you never, never knew  
Run away  
Follow the voice deep inside you  
Run away  
Follow the sun, find a new life  
Run away  
Run from the lies that destroy you  
Run away  
Run like a fool and you just might make it  
(chorus ii)  
And soon you will be  
Right ware you wanna be  
Free to live the way you want to  
And soon, I said soon, you will find  
Just what you're lookin' for  
All the good times you never, never knew  
Run away  
Run away  
Run away  
Run away  
Run away  
Run away
