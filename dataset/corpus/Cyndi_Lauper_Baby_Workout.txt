Hey you! Come on here on the floor  
And let's rock some more  
Come on here on the floor  
Honey lets rock some more, yeah.  
Now when you get out here don't cha have no fear  
Put your hand on your hip  
And let your backbone flip and work out.  
Mama, mama move up, party move back  
Shuffle to the left, wobble to the right  
Now it's plain to see you're a heading for me  
But it's a natural fact, huh, I like that so work out.  
Work it baby work out, honey work out  
Work out baby, workout baby work out, work it baby work.  
Shout until it's jumped out, work it baby work out.  
Work out, work out, work out, work out, work all night long.  
Round and round and round and round we go...  
Round and round I know. Don't you know, don't you know,  
Round and round we go where we stop nobody knows  
Yeah! The band is swinging on the stand  
We're moving in, we're moving out  
People stop right now, here's a dance with a shout so work out.  
Now when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it.
