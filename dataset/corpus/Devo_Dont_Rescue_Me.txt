Don't rescue me  
I don't want to be  
Let you and me be  
Out of control  
Just because I can't sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
You, you're the one  
Turn me inside out  
You, you're the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You, you're the one  
De-railroaded me  
You, you're the one  
Don't rescue me  
You make me move  
Where I never been  
Lost in orbit  
All over you  
Just because I can't sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
Don't bring me back  
I beg to differ in fact  
You can question why  
But what good is that  
Don't rescue me I won't go back no I  
Don't rescue me  
I don't want to be  
Let you and me be  
Out of control  
You, you're the one  
Turn me inside out  
You, you're the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You, you're the one  
De-railroaded me  
You, you're the one  
Don't rescue me  
Just because I can't sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
You, you're the one  
Turn me inside out  
You, you're the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You, you're the one  
De-railroaded me  
You, you're the one  
Don't rescue me
