Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you  
It's all served up on a gold plated plate  
And we don't even have to talk to you  
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred  
And that's the way you're going to stay  
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel  
But someone else's finger's on the control panel  
  
What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero  
Don't you want to be brother - Zero the hero  
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero  
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero  
  
You sit there watch it all burn down  
It's easy and breezy for you  
You play your life to a different sound  
No edge no edge you got no knife have you  
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere  
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there  
Where the heroes sit by the river  
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver  
  
You stand there captain we all look  
You really are mediocre  
You are the champion in the Acme form book  
But I think you're just a joker  
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity  
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around  
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing  
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing
