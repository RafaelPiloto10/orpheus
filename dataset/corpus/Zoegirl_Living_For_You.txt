There was a time when I'd believe in anything but you,  
I closed my eyes and let You in,  
Ready to let my life begin,  
It just hit me, couldn't ignore it,  
Heard your voice calling, now I know it!  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna see Your face,  
I wanna speak Your name,  
I wanna tell the whole world how my life has changed,  
I'm gonna lift my voice,  
Ever to sing Your praise,  
As long as I'm alive know that I  
I'm living for You.  
  
Lord, here I stand before You now,  
I want to give You everything,  
No matter what may come my way,  
You give me a smile they can't take away.  
Holding onto all You brought me though,  
You're the strength that I'll always cling to!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some may question what is right,  
In my heart I can't deny,  
Once I was blind but now I see,  
You have my soul and I am Your for eternity!  
  
Oh, Lord, I wanna see Your face,  
I always wanna sing Your praise,  
I wanna be the first to say,  
Forever I'm living for only You!  
  
[Chorus: x2]
