I've seen you somewhere before your eyes  
Your eyes draw me back to the songs, it's been many moons  
My mind is too young and I can't place it  
The spirit within me breathes now  
These old people sit here with me  
My feet turned up, inside I receive it  
And I feel it in every breath in it  
It circles inside my head and I  
I fear it with each new day  
And every way these whispers reach  
These whispers reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
These are friends of country and time  
And this knowledge so long denied  
But I thank you, oh oh and I thank you  
The day will be recognized  
But our children still we deny  
This is school culture simply too young to feel it  
As I feeling with every breath in it  
It circles inside my head and I  
I fear with each new day  
And every way these whispers reach  
These whispers reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
Now these whispers they reach  
Now whispers they reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
They're whispers they reach  
The whispers they reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
Whispers  
Whispers  
Whispers
