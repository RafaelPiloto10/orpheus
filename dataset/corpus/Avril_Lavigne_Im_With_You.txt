I'm standing on a bridge  
I'm waitin' in the dark  
I thought that you'd be here by now  
There's nothing but the rain  
No footsteps on the ground  
I'm listening but there's no sound  
  
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?  
Won't somebody come take me home?  
  
It's a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Won't you, take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
  
Mm-ee-mm  
  
I'm looking for a place  
I'm searching for a face  
Is anybody here, I know  
Cause nothin's going right  
And everythin's a mess  
And no one likes to be alone  
  
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?  
Won't somebody come take me home  
It's a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Won't you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you.  
I'm with you, yeah you.  
  
Oh, why is everything so confusing?  
Maybe I'm just out of my mind  
Yea yea yea, yea yea yea, yea, oh  
  
It's a damn cold night  
Tryna figure out this life  
Won't you take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
I'm with you.  
  
Take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
I'm with you  
  
Take me by the hand  
Take me somewhere new  
I don't know who you are  
But I, I'm with you  
Oh  
I'm with you  
I'm with you
