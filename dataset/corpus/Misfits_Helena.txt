If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs  
Would you still love me anyway?  
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed  
Would you still love me anyway?  
Why don't you love me anyway?  
  
Cutting with the knife, blood is spilling everywhere  
She will be my wife  
Secondary spine  
Incisions must be accurate  
I know just what to do  
My hands are trembling  
I can't spare to slip up with this knife  
  
Her beauty so illogical  
The beast come gliding in  
Hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin  
Dance to the burning flame  
Pleasure exhumes the pain  
The night bursts into flame  
Dance Helena... Dance  
  
If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs  
Would you still love me anyway?  
There's a spot on the floor where your limbs used to be  
And I close the door on my fantasies  
Why don't you love me anyway
