Flying to Salt Lake City  
Seats 3a and be  
I was down and needed  
A window  
But in 3a sat Mitzi Dupree  
She said hi I am Mitzi  
The queen of the ping pong  
Where you going boy  
I said nowhere  
She said I'm moving on  
I thought what is this  
I cannot resist  
Here she is  
And I've always wanted a girl  
With a name  
A name like Mitzi Dupree  
  
She said what do you do  
I said I'm a singer in a band  
She said ya I'm an entertainer  
Reached out and took my hand  
She was going to a mining town  
Way up north to do her show  
I said it must be cold up there  
She said depends on who you know  
Oh that look in her eye  
I can tell you no lies  
I'm just a man  
She made me feel like a king in my mind  
I love you Mitzi Dupree  
  
I said what is this queen of the ping pong business  
She smiled what do you think  
It has no connection with china  
I said ow have another drink  
Well I knew right away  
That I'd seen her act before  
In a room behind a kitchen in Bangkok  
And three or four times more in Singapore  
She may not be the first  
But I know she ain't the worst  
She was mine but I ran out of time  
I miss you I love you Mitzi Dupree  
My darling Mitzi Dupree
