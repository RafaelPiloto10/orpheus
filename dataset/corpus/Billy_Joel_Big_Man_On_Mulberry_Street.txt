Why can't I lay low  
Why can't I say what I mean  
Why don't I stay home  
And get myself into some boring routine  
  
Why can't I calm down  
Why is it always a fight  
I can't get unwound  
Why do I throw myself into the night  
  
I'm on the outside  
I don't fit into the groove  
Now I ain't a bad guy  
So tell me what am I trying to prove  
  
Why can't I cool out  
Why don't I button my lip  
Why do I lash out  
Why is it I always shoot from the hip  
  
I cruise from Houston to Canal Street  
A misfit and a rebel  
I see the winos talking to themselves  
And I can understand  
Why is it everytime I go out  
I always seem to get in trouble  
I guess I made an impression on somebody  
North of Hester and south of Grand  
  
And so in my small way  
I'm a big man on Mulberry street  
I don't mean all day  
Only at night when I'm light on my feet  
  
What else have I got  
That I'd be trying to hide  
Maybe a blind spot  
I haven't seen from the sensitive side  
  
But you know in my own heart  
I'm a big man on Mulberry street  
I play the whole part  
I leave a big tip with every receipt  
  
I'm so romantic  
I'm such a passionate man  
Sometimes I panic  
What if nobody finds out who I am
