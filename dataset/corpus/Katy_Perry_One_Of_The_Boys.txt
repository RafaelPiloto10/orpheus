I saw a spider  
I didn't scream  
'Cause I can belch the alphabet  
Just double dog dare me  
And I chose guitar over ballet  
And I take these suckers down cause they just  
Get in my way  
The way  
You look at me  
Is kinda like a little sister  
You high-five  
Your goodbyes  
And it leaves me nothing but blisters  
  
So I don't want to be one of the boys  
One of your guys  
Just give me a chance  
To prove to you tonight  
I just wanna be one of the girls  
Pretty in pearls  
Not one of the boys  
  
So over summer something changed  
I started reading Seventeen  
And shaving my legs  
And I studied Lolita religiously  
And I walked right in school  
And caught you  
Staring at me  
'Cause I know  
What you know  
But now your gonna' have to take a number  
Its OK  
Maybe one day  
But not until I get my  
Diamond ring  
  
'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys  
One of your guys  
Just give me a chance  
To prove to you tonight  
I just wanna be your homecoming queen  
A pin up poster dream  
Not one of the boys  
  
I wanna be a flower  
Not a dirty weed  
And I wanna smell like roses  
Not a baseball team  
And I swear maybe one day  
Your gonna' wanna' make out make out make out with me  
  
(Don't wanna be)  
Don't want to be  
(Don't wanna be)  
Don't want to be  
(Don't wanna be)  
  
'Cause I, I don't wanna be one  
One  
One of the boys  
I just wanna be one of the girls  
So pretty in pearls  
Not one of the boys
