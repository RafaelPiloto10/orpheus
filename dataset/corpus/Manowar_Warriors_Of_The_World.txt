Here our soldiers stand  
From all around the world  
Waiting in a line  
To hear the battle cry  
All are gathered here  
Victory is near  
The sound will fill the hall  
Bringing power to us all  
We alone are fighting  
For metal that is true  
We only ride to live the fight  
We're here for all of you  
Now swear the blood upon your steel  
Will never dry  
Stand and fight together  
Beneath the metal sky  
  
Brothers everywhere  
Raise your hands into the air  
We're warriors, warriors of the world  
  
Like thunder from the sky  
Swore to fight and die  
We're warriors, warriors of the world  
  
Many stand against us  
But they will never win  
We said we would return  
And here we are again  
To bring them all destruction  
Suffering and pain  
We are the hammer of the gods  
We are thunder wind and rain  
There you wait in fear  
With swords in feval hands  
With dreams to be a king  
First, what should be a man  
I call them out  
And charge them all  
With a life that is a lie  
And in a final hour  
They shell confess before they die  
  
Brothers everywhere  
Raise your hands into the air  
We're warriors, warriors of the world  
  
Like thunder from the sky  
Swore to fight and die  
We're warriors, warriors of the world  
  
If I should fall in battle  
My brothers who fight by my side  
Gather my horse an weapons  
Tell my family how I died  
Until then I will be strong  
I will fight for all that is real  
All who stand in my way will die by steel  
  
Brothers everywhere  
Raise yo
