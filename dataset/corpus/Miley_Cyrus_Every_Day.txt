Everday,  
Something happens to me.  
And you'll see,  
I'm on my way  
  
I want to be changed.  
I want to be rearranged yeah.  
Open a door,  
In my life that's such a bore.  
  
Full of life,  
Full of dreams.  
That's what I want to be.  
A new chapter in my book,  
Gonna write my own story.  
  
I want to be changed,  
I want to be rearranged yeah.  
Open a door,  
In my life that's such a bore!
