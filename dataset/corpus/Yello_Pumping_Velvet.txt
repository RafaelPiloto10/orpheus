Dynamite  
  
Putz karam sheoba kitsch daboum  
Waiting for the lady in the red balloon  
Putz dada sheoba sleik dabich  
Looking for a groove she stares at me, that witch  
  
Dynamite  
  
Poud karoud sheoba diba duglak  
Leather and lace, she's wearing black  
Poud karoub sheoba diba diboum  
Believe it or not, she doesn't know my name  
  
Dynamite  
  
Putz karam sheoba kitsch daboum  
Putz dada sheoba sleik dabich  
Poud karoub sheoba tipa ziglack  
Poud karoub sheoba dib diboum  
Putz karam sheoba kitsch daboum  
  
She's spinning circles around my balloon  
Putz karam sheoba kitsch daboum  
She's dynamite the lady and that's unfair  
I'm stuck in my balloon, stuck in the air
