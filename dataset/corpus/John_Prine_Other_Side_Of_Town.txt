Why do you always seem to criticize me  
Seems like everything I do just turns out wrong  
Why don't you come on out and despise me  
So I could pack my bag and baby I'd be gone  
  
Remember when you used to call me honey  
I'd turn around and call you honey too  
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny  
To hurt someone who's so in love with you  
  
Chorus:  
A clown puts his makeup on upside down  
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown  
You might think I'm here when you put me down  
But actually I'm on the other side of town.  
  
My body's in this room with you just catchin' hell  
While my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell  
You might think I'm listening to your grocery list  
But I'm leaning on the jukebox and I'm about halfway there  
  
I'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear  
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer  
When you get done talking I'll come back downstairs  
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm Across the river on the other side of town  
In my mind I'm on the other side of town
