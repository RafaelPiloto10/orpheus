Well, I got a problem  
And it just won't wait  
I've been getting on one  
With the man who guards your gate  
When he says you're sleeping  
In your hideaway  
It is what he's keeping back  
That gives your game away  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
You're walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
You're walking astray  
And I'd like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  
Yes, I got a problem  
Like you've never seen  
I've been getting bothered  
By the man who locks your screen  
When he says you're hiding  
And in your room you'll stay  
It is what he's holding back  
That says what he can't say  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
You're walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
You're walking astray  
And I'd like to say that I like this  
More than I do today  
I'm just a lazy man  
Who has to hear the truth  
And I hear what's true from you  
Come quit your crazy lowdown ways  
You're walking astray  
Come quit your weary worn out ways  
You're walking astray  
And I'd like to say that I like this  
More than I do today
