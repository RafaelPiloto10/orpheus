Looking in my mirror  
Took me by surprise  
I can't help but see you  
Running often through my mind  
Helpless like a baby  
Sensual disguise  
I can't help but love you  
It is getting better all the time  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I can't help it if I wanted to  
I wouldn't help it even if I could  
I can't help it if I wanted to  
I wouldn't help it, no  
  
Love to run my fingers  
Softly while you sigh  
Love came and possessed you  
Bringing sparkles to your eyes  
  
Like a trip to heaven  
Heaven is the prize  
And I'm so glad I found you  
You're an angel in disguise  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
