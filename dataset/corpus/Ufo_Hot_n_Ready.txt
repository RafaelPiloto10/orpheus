You knock me out you're like a well oiled Smith and Wesson  
Hot and ready, ready to use  
Dressed to the nines, you know you don't look fifteen, there's no question  
Not and ready, ready to use  
I'm coming through I've gotta get to you babe  
I'm coming through I've gotta get to you babe  
Don't need i.d. and there's no house detective to crowd you...  
Hot and ready, ready to use  
Slip in the back door and slip out of what ever your into  
Hot and ready, ready to use  
I'm coming through I've gotta get to you babe (2x)  
  
I'm coming through, I've gotta get to you babe (2x)
