This could be our last good night together  
We may never pass this way again.  
Just let me enjoy it 'til it's over, or forever  
Please don't tell me how the story ends.  
  
See the way our shadows come together  
Softer than your fingers on my skin  
Someday these may be all we remember of each other  
Please don't tell me how the story ends.  
  
Never's just the echo of forever  
Lonesome as a love that might have been.  
Let me go on lovin' and believin' 'til it's over  
Please don't tell me how the story ends.
