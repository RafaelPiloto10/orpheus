[Chorus]  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
  
I've been lost in Boston, Austin Texas is always sweet  
I stumbled around that Texas town but I never left Sixth Street  
You know it's always hard to keep my feet from tryin' to run away  
And it seems I spent a lifetime tryin' to make everything ok  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
  
I'd do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I wish sometimes that I could say she never told me so  
And I'd walk a million miles on down the same old broken road  
Now you can always reap just what you sew I know that's true  
And I pray some day that I wake and my poor feet won't fit these shoes  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
I'd do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
If I listened closely I can hear it oh so clear  
  
Like a south bound train like fallin' rain like a whisper in my ear  
Everything I'd like to hear you know I don't hear much no more  
But I know someday that you'll come my way and you'll walk right through that
door  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
I'd do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright
