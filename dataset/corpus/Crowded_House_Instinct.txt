I lit the match  
I lit the match  
I saw another monster turn to ash  
Felt the burden lifting from my back  
Do you recognise a nervous twitch  
That exposes the weakness of the myth  
When your turn comes round  
And the light goes on  
And you feel your attraction again  
Your instinct can't be wrong  
Separate the fiction from the fact  
A (get) little slow to react  
But it's nearly time to flick the switch  
And I'm hanging by a single stitch  
Laughing at the stony face of gloom  
When your turn comes round  
And the light goes on  
And you feel your attraction again  
Your instinct can't be wrong  
Feel this come and go  
Where the true present lies  
Calling down, calling down, calling  
Laughing at the stony face of gloom  
When your turn comes round  
And the days get long  
And you feel your attraction to him  
Your instinct can't be wrong  
Calling down  
Calling down
