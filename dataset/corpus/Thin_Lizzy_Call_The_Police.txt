Betty was worried about the lover that she has married  
And she didn't know what to do  
He'd been hit by a hammer on the head and he lay dead  
An' all her worst fears had come true  
  
[Chorus]  
Call the police  
Call the police  
Call the police  
Call the police  
  
Johnny was a joker and a very heavy smoker  
And he never ever broke the law  
Thin miss lizzy was a-kept very busy  
And sometimes very dizzy, we knew what for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And take 'em all away  
Lock 'em up  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Louie was a loner and a big time Al Capone-er  
Doin' all his dipping from the door  
He knew a shady dealer who had done a dirty DJ,  
The sooner he could even the score  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And lock 'em up  
Help ya have a birthday, say  
Take 'em all away
