Christmas Day is getting closer but there's sadness mixed with joy  
Every day a few more questions from our little girl and boy  
Not alone but they'll be lonely for their daddy won't be here  
And just like the air at Christmas there'll be a chill upon the chill  
Christmas without daddy will be such a lonesome day  
We'll send a prayer and all our love to you so far away  
Your son just wrote to Santa asked him to send you home  
Yes Christmas without daddy we'll be blue and all alone  
[ steel ]  
Christmas without daddy I don't know what we're gonna do  
On the present from your baby she wrote daddy I love you  
Your son just wrote to Santa asking him to send you home  
Yes Christmas without daddy we'll be blue and all alone
