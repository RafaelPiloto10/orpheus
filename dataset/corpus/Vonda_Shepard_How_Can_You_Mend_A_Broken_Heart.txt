I can think of younger days when living for my life  
Was everything a man could want to do  
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend a this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees  
And misty memories of days gone by  
We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
