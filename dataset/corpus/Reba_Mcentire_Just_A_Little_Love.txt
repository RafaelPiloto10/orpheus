When our check bounces at the store  
And the whole world seems at war  
You bring me peace of mind once more  
With just a little love  
  
When the boss says I'm ten minutes late  
And the stack of bills just won't wait  
Oh, you take the worries away  
With just a little love  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little love  
And affection  
You bring a touch of perfection  
To a world that's sometimes crazy  
And so mixed up  
Just a little love  
You have changed me  
You make me see why the good Lord made me  
And you can do miracles  
With just a little love  
  
When our old car won't run  
And all my dreams come undone  
You'll make it right won't ya hun  
With just a little love  
  
When it seems like all the truths are gone  
When I'm trying so hard to hold on  
You make it easy to be strong  
With just a little love  
  
[Chorus]
