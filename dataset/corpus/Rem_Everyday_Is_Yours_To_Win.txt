With the walk (walk)  
And the talk (talk)  
And the tick tock clock (clock)  
  
With the rock (rock)  
And the roll (roll)  
And the bridge (bridge)  
And the toll (toll)  
  
With the brilliance (brilliance)  
And the light (light)  
With the stink (stink)  
And the hide (hide)  
And the road ahead of you.  
  
I cannot tell a lie  
It's not all cherry pie  
But it's all there waiting for you  
Yeah you  
  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
I know  
  
With the walk (walk)  
And the woods (woods)  
And the subterfuge (subterfuge)  
There's an old look bitter and blue  
  
While I'm nothing but confused (confused)  
With nothing left to lose (lose)  
And if you buy that  
I've got a bridge for you  
  
Hey yeah (hey yeah)  
Hey yeah (hey yeah)

Every day is new again  
Every day is yours to win  
And that's how heroes are made  
  
I wanted (I wanted) to win (to win)  
So I'd said it again:  
That's how heroes are made  
  
Hey yeah (hey yeah)  
Hey yeah (hey yeah)  
Hey yeah  
I know  
  
Hey yeah (hey yeah)
