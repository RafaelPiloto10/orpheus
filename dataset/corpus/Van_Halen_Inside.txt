It's not what you are  
It's how you dress  
That's one thing I've learned from the guys  
I must confess  
Now me, look, I got this job not just being myself  
Huh uhh  
I went out and bought some brand new shoes  
Now I walk like someone else  
Maybe I'm crazy or just too high  
But all this can't be worth my  
Piece of the pie  
Sittin 'round just gettin' high  
Temporarily pacified  
I guess less is more  
Something special, something new  
Some brand new group to sink my teeth into  
Sittin 'round just getting high  
Temporarily pacified  
  
That's what's going down on the inside  
Don't let this get around to the outside  
This ain't no party, this ain't no show!  
So don't be tryin' to putt no mo jo on my butt, anyway  
  
Chorus x4
