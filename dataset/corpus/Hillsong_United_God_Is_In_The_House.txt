Verse 1:  
As for me God came and found me  
As for me He took me home  
As for me He gave me a family  
And I'll never walk alone  
  
In my life I'm soaked in blessing  
And in heaven there's a great reward  
As for me and my house, we're gonna to serve the Lord!  
  
Bridge:  
I've got Jesus, Jesus  
He calls me for His own  
And He lifts me, lifts me  
Above the world I know  
  
Chorus:  
God is in the house, there is no doubt  
God is in the house, can't keep Him out  
As for you (As for you)  
As for me (As for me)  
We're gonna serve the Lord!
