Rescue me  
I can't dream this dream any more, my dream oh my dream  
Set me free  
I keep holdin' on but  
I don't know what for  
  
All I know  
Is that I've breathed your name for what feels like a lifetime  
I can't let go, you're a part of me  
  
And I die each time  
I lose a little more of you  
And I look for a sign, to give me hope  
We'll find a love we once knew  
  
And all I know  
Is when we're face to face when there's no one between us  
With one last embrace, we'll let time heal the pain  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in the dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please, only you, lonely me  
  
It's not enough, to simply talk about love  
As if it were in our control  
Now as I struggle with the past, I can't think about the future  
It's so hard to let go  
  
And all I know  
Is I still whisper your name, girl it won't be the last time  
As our lives go separate ways  
And let time heal the pain  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please, only you, lonely me  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please  
  
Keep your hand on my heart don't let go  
I can't see you're too close to me  
Don't leave me in dark, keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please, only you, lonely me  
Only you, lonely me
