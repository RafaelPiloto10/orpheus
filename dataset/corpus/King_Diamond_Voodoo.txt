Saturday evening  
  
A narrow path runs along the river  
From the burial ground you might see it  
Leading to a temple of secrets  
Where they meet once a week  
To dance and feast  
  
Lula is dancing to the voodoo drums  
Twisting, turning, round and round  
  
She is ready to receive the LOA  
She is ready for the God  
This one is Damballah  
  
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo  
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo  
Total emptiness inside  
As Damballah gets ready for her ride  
  
Casting out from Lula's head  
One of two souls that seems to be dead  
Traveling deep in a trance  
Lula's legs are getting weak  
"The LOA has seized its horse"  
  
Lula is not the one that's speaking now  
Lula is not the one that's lying now  
  
Drink, drink girl, drink the chicken's blood  
Drink, drink girl, drink and feed the God  
  
If this is all you think they do, oh you better think again  
'Cause there is so much more to voodoo, oh than meets the eye  
  
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo  
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo  
  
Human hair on waxen dools, pins through their knees  
Pins through their little heads, and through their bellics  
Ahh they're coming to get you, they're coming for you  
Ahh they're coming to get you, they're coming for you now  
  
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo  
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo... Voodoo.....
