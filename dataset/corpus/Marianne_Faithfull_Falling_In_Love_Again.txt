I'm much too sentimental,  
My heart is never free.  
Perhaps it's accidental  
That love should come to me.  
  
Some little thing within me  
Protects me for a while  
Till someone comes to win me  
With only a smile.  
  
Falling in love again,  
Never wanted to.  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it.  
  
Love's always been my game,  
Play it, how I may.  
I was made that way  
Can't help it.  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame.  
  
Falling in love again,  
Never wanted to.  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it.  
  
Sonst gar nichts.  
Ha!
