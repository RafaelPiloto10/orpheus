I'm through with love,  
I'll never fall again,  
Said adieu to love,  
Don't ever call again,  
For I must have you or no one,  
That's why I'm through with love.  
  
I've locked my heart,  
I keep my feelings there.  
I have stocked my heart like an icy Frigidaire,  
For I need to care for no one,  
That's why I'm through with love.  
  
Why did you lead me to think that you cared?  
You didn't need me,  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear,  
Their deep devotion emotion, to you  
  
Goodbye to spring,  
And all it meant to me,  
It could never bring the things that used to be,  
For I must have you or no one,  
That's why I'm through with love.  
That's why I'm through with love  
  
Goodbye to spring,  
And all it meant to me,  
It could never bring the things that used to be,  
For I must have you or no one,  
And so I'm through with love.
