Such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
Oh, I, just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I  
  
Hey, I should have never fallen  
Back in love with you  
Knowin' how you get a pleasure  
Breaking my poor heart in two  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said  
"I'm your woman, you're my man"  
Now I really need you  
And I sit here a loser again  
  
I guess I'm just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh I  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, fool am I, mmm  
  
I should have never trusted  
In my heart to lead the way  
Now my mind is all busted  
That's a fool's price to pay  
  
You made it sound so convincin'  
When you said you'd never, never go away  
I should have never listened  
To anything you had to say  
  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh  
Such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh yes I am  
I'm such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah  
I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh  
Silly, dilly
