[Verse:]  
Water You turned into wine  
Opened the eyes of the blind  
There's no one like You  
None like You  
Into the darkness You shine  
Out of the ashes we rise  
There's no one like You  
None like You  
  
[Chorus:]  
Our God is greater  
Our God is stronger  
God You are higher than any other  
Our God is healer  
Awesome in power  
Our God, our God  
  
[Verse]  
Into the darkness You shine  
Out of the ashes we rise  
There's no one like You  
None like You  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
[Tag] 2x  
And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us?  
And if our God is with us, then what could stand against?  
What could stand against?  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
[Tag]  
  
[Chorus:]
