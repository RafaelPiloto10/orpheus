At first I was afraid  
I was petrified  
Kept thinking I could never live  
Without you by my side  
But then I spent so many nights  
Thinking how you did me wrong  
I grew strong  
I learned how to get along  
  
And so you're back  
From outer space  
I just walked in to find you here  
With that sad look upon your face  
I should have changed that stupid lock  
I should have made you leave your key  
If I had known for just one second  
You'd be back to bother me  
  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye  
You think I'd crumble  
You think I'd lay down and die  
  
Oh no, not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
And I'll survive  
I will survive (hey hey)  
  
It took all the strength I had  
Not to fall apart  
Kept trying hard to mend  
The pieces of my broken heart  
  
And I spent oh so many nights  
Just feeling sorry for myself  
I used to cry  
Now I hold my head up high  
And you see me  
  
Somebody new  
I'm not that chained up little girl  
Who fell in love with you  
And so you felt like dropping in  
And just expect me to be free  
Now I'm saving all my loving  
For someone who's loving me  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye  
You think I'd crumble  
You think I'd lay down and die  
Oh no, not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
And I'll survive  
I will survive (oh)  
  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye  
You think I'd crumble  
You think I'd lay down and die  
Oh no, not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
And I'll survive  
I will survive  
I will survive... !
