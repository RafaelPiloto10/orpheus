Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky  
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by  
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I  
When we're alone  
  
From all of society, we'll stay aloof  
And live in propriety there on the roof  
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth  
When we're alone  
  
We'll see life's mad pattern  
As we view old Manhattan  
Then we can thank our lucky stars  
That we're living as we are  
  
In our little penthouse, we'll always contrive  
To keep love and romance forever alive  
In view of the Hudson just over the drive  
When we're alone  
  
We can thank our lucky stars  
That we're living as we are  
  
In our little penthouse, we'll always contrive  
To keep love and romance forever alive  
In view of the Hudson just over the drive  
When we're alone
