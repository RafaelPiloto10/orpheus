I know that fan is moving air, I can see it in your hair  
But I can't bear to breathe it in somehow  
I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now  
I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now  
  
Salt is sweet upon my mouth  
And dark throws sparks against my house  
The stain of love's a smudge on my brow  
But you see through me and you can't fail me now  
You see right through me, you can't fail me now  
  
I've bit off more than I can chew  
It's something that I tend to do  
When fewer words are what we need and how  
You bite my tongue, you can't fail me now  
I rant and rail but you can't fail me now  
  
I've lost the thread among the vines  
And hung myself in story lines  
That tell the tales I never would allow  
God knows the name of every bird  
It fills my mind like angry words  
But you know all my secret heart avows  
  
We're taught to love the worst of us  
And mercy more than life but trust me  
Mercy's just a warning shot across the bow  
I live for yours and you can't fail me now  
I live for your mercy,  
You can't fail me now  
You can't fail me now
