It was just another day  
It was just another fight  
It was words strung into sentences  
It was doomed to not be right  
There is something wrong with me  
There is something wrong with you  
There is nothing left of us  
There is one thing I can do  
Lying on your bed, examining my head  
This is the part of me that hates  
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch  
Somewhere the electric chair awaits  
Hey! This was my life  
Hey! This was my fate  
This was the wrong thing to do  
This was the wrong one to be doing  
This was the road to destiny  
This was the road to my ruin  
Now there's motives for the suspect  
Now there's nothing left to say  
Now there's method to the madness  
Now there's society to pay  
In our life there's if  
In our beliefs there's lie  
In our business there's sin  
In our bodies there's die  
This was my life  
This was my fate
