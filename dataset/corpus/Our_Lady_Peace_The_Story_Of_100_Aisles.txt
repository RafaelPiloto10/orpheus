Help yourself  
If you know why you came  
Cause if you need help she says  
There's something I've got saved  
This is not what you wanted  
These candy coated fakes  
This is not what you wanted  
This is pain  
Anacin, we're stumbling again  
It's the story of a hundred aisles  
Walk away from simple on a tray  
Cause if you need help she says  
These fancy pills don't rate  
This is not what you wanted  
A miracle today  
Time is not for sale today  
Time seems so far away  
You need more than this  
Depressed come here try this
