I am your main man if you're looking for trouble  
I take no lip no ones tougher than me  
I'd kick your face you'd soon be seeing double  
Hey little girl, keep your hands off me  
  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a roller too baby  
I'm a rocker  
  
Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stompin'  
Bippin' an a boppin', telling a dirty joke or two  
In walked this chick and I knew she was up to something  
and I kissed her right there out of the blue  
  
I said "Hey baby, meet me I'm a tough guy"  
Got my cycle outside, you want to try?  
She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes  
And said "Ooh I'd do anything for you 'cause you're a rocker"  
  
That's right I'm a rocker  
I'm a roller too honey  
I'm a rocker  
  
I love to rock and roll  
I get my records and I Rock On stall  
rock and roll  
Teddy boy, he's got them all  
  
I love to rock and roll  
I get my records and I Rock On stall  
sweet rock and roll  
Teddy boy, he's got them all  
  
I'm a rocker!
