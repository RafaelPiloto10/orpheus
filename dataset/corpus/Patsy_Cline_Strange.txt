Strange, how you stopped loving me  
How you stopped needing me  
When she came along  
Oh, how strange  
  
Strange, you changed like night and day  
Just up and walked away  
When she came along  
Oh, how strange  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I guess that I was just your puppet  
You held on a string  
To think I thought you really loved me  
But look what thoughts can bring  
  
Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a funny thing  
I still care for you  
Oh, how strange  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Strange, you're still in all my dreams  
Oh what a funny thing  
I still care for you  
Oh, how strange  
  
How strange
