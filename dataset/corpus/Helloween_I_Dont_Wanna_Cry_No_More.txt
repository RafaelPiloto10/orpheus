Hey, brother  
I miss you so  
You knocked on heaven's door  
And we won't see you anymore  
It must be crazy  
What we're living for  
'Cause God's stopped keeping you  
On the ladder of your life  
I call your name with tears in my eyes  
  
I don't want to cry no more  
Past gave me happiness and pain  
Life is fleeting like a flower  
From a distance, after sorrow  
I pray the Lord to keep your soul  
I don't want to cry no more  
We're still missing you  
  
Life's like walking  
On a high wire  
You slipped away  
I've seen you dying in a vein  
High as a mountains seem all the problems that I have  
But when I hear your voice Far away out of the dark  
You just go on and on in the back of my mind  
  
I don't wanna  
  
Skin and bone won't touch the sky  
I hop you'll find passage out of the dark  
To the other side of the sea  
And I know that I'll see you again  
  
I don't wanna
