Skip de skip, up the road  
Off to school we go  
"Don't you be a bad boy Johnny  
Don't you slip up  
  
Or play the fool"  
"Oh no Ma, Oh no Da,  
I'll be your golden boy  
I will obey ev'ry golden rule"  
  
Get told by the teacher  
Not to day-dream  
Told by my mother:  
  
Be good Be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good be good (Johnny)  
Be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good (Johnny)  
Be good be good.  
  
"Are you going to play football this year, John?"  
"No!"  
"Oh, well you must be going to play cricket this year then,  
Are you Johnny?"  
"No! no! no!"  
"Boy, you sure are a funny kid, Johnny, but I like you! So tell me,  
What kind of a boy are you, John?"  
  
I only like dreaming  
All the day long  
Where no one is screaming  
  
Be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good be good (Johnny)  
Be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Johnny!
