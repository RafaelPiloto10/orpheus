(Wait a minute)  
Dope new styles of rhyme, not breakin science  
Down with the Rhyme Syndicate alliance  
You're on the tip but in the crack of a whip  
You know the saying about ships and slips with a lip?  
You'll be sunk while I be gettin drunk  
With the bottle of rose I keep in my trunk, punk  
Don't try to get none, know where I'm comin from?  
I don't care if you do got a gun  
You better step off before I go off  
And don't dare bug, riff or show off  
Cause then I break hard, you think I'm a fanatic  
Speak my rhymes in English, not breakin no mathematics  
Cause that's for other people, boy, I ain't got 'em  
But in almost every other rhyme I can spot 'em  
Get off it, get off the bandwagon  
Runnin the same old styles you keep draggin  
Everlast is here with rhymes ready to drop  
Hey yo, here I go again  
I'm the foreman of this rap, this rhyme style construction  
You're on the eve of destruction  
(Wait a minute)  
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) (4x)  
Step forward face up, meet the grim reaper  
You're aimin for the top as the ladder gets steeper  
To my man Divine I send this dedication  
To let him know that with his help I got a Syndication  
With the dope rhymes I write, the styles I recite  
Don't follow this leader, I'm not your guiding light  
To the groove I'm smooth like a hit from a buddha  
I might smoke an herb but I won't sniff or shoot up  
Not hangin with gangs or messin with thugs  
Not slingin no caine or dealin no drugs  
Cause I'm straight like an arrow, the path I follow is narrow  
On the rise Everlast will sore like a sparrow  
Through the sky, so don't ask me why  
If you're dazed and confused you must be high  
So before you try and break make sure that you're sober  
Cause I'll snatch your crown, boy, then I'll destroy ya  
(Wait a minute)  
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) (8x)  
To all you new jack MC's writin your rhymes in haste  
Get dissed, put out of business, don't it seem like a race?  
Face death, your final breath jumpin up in my face  
I'm a single not a pair, not a deuce I'm a ace  
As you hear the treble clack hear my bass tone kick  
Take three out in a snap like a flat hat trick  
Everlast is educated, energized for endurance  
Properly protected with a 100 g insurance  
For my mouth (mouth) (mouth)  
Wet my whistle at a party with a Coke and a stout  
Take heed duck MC's cause Everlast has the clout  
So break north, suckers, the top's why I came  
Don't wanna hear beefin, cryin or complainin  
From you or any other party or set  
The pied piper of rhyme, it's time to pay your debt  
Pay the piper, the sniper, who wanna get hyper  
On the microphone there's no other type of  
MC gettin with the E  
Down with Divine and DLC  
Def Lyric Creations on radio stations  
Everlast reigns supreme and I'm in Syndication  
(Wait a minute)  
(Keep on singin, keep on singin) (4x)  
Hey yo, come here, lend me your ear  
Everlast is the name of me and my gear  
So get up, get with it, come on, admit it  
The rhyme I just spoke, you wish you did it  
Like I do and you tried to  
But I'd quit while I'm ahead if I were you  
But I'm not, I'm givin all I got  
Get the girls on the floor, make em hot to trot  
For the Caucasian Sensation there's no hesitation  
Everlast reigns supreme and I'm in Syndication  
(Wait a minute)  
(Keep on singin, keep on singin)  
(Everlast is here with)  
(Rhymes ready to drop)
