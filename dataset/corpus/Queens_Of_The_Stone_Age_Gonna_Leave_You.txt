Wait by the phone  
Late alone  
He can't help you  
But I know I could  
  
Free is too long  
You know this is wrong  
Everything scars the skin  
Push it in, break it off  
  
I'm gonna leave  
I'm gonna leave you  
  
I gave it starts  
I stomped on your hearts  
This the is the end,  
No more pictures, we ain't friends  
It's raining in my room  
There's blood in my spoon  
You're out of my highchair  
I'm out of your womb  
  
I'm gonna leave  
I'm gonna leave you  
  
Free is too long  
You know this is wrong  
Everything scars the skin  
Push it in, push it in, break it off  
  
I'm gonna leave  
Gonna leave you  
  
I'm gonna leave  
I don't need you
