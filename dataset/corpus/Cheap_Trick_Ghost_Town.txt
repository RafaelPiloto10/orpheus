Well the streets are all crowded  
Lots of people around  
And there's music playing  
But I can't hear a sound  
  
Just the sound of the rain  
Falling silently down  
Livin' ain't been livin'  
Since you put down  
  
Yeah, life goes on around me every day  
But it might as well be half a million miles away  
It's like a ghost town without your love  
Like a ghost town without your love  
  
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?  
It's a ghost town until you come back to me  
oh, oh, till you come back to me  
  
Well I wish I still had you  
Had you here next to me  
Baby, where did you go?  
Baby, why did you leave?  
  
Though the world, it keeps turnin'  
But it don't turn for me  
Without you in my life  
My life ain't no place to be  
  
There's only lonely days and empty nights  
Ain't the same without you, baby, nothin' feelin' right  
Darlin', I want to leave this town  
Don't want to be around  
  
I'm gonna leave this town
