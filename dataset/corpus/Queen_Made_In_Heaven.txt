I'm taking my right with destiny  
Willing to play my part  
Living with painful memories  
Loving with all my heart  
  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
It was all meant to be, yeah  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
That's what they say  
Can't you see  
That's what everybody says to me  
Can't you see  
Oh I know, I know, I know, that its true  
Yes its really meant to be  
Deep in my heart  
  
I'm having to learn to pay the price  
Theyre turning me upside down  
Waiting for possibilities  
Don't see too many around  
Made in heaven, yes made in heaven  
Its for all to see  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
That's what everybody says  
Everybody says to me  
It was really meant to be  
Oh can't you see  
Yeah, everybody, everybody says  
Yes it was meant to be  
Yeah, yeah  
  
When stormy weather comes around  
It was made in heaven  
When sunny skies break through behind the clouds  
I wish it could last forever, yeah  
Wish it could last forever, forever  
  
I'm playing my role in history  
Looking to find my goal  
Taking in all this misery  
But giving it all my soul  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
It was all meant to be  
Made in heaven, made in heaven  
That's what everybody says  
Wait and see, it was really meant to be  
So plain to see  
Yeah, everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so  
Yes it was plain to see, yes it was meant to be  
Written in the stars...  
Written in the stars...
