Is there something about you  
That I don't already know?  
Something about me  
That'll make you break my heart and go?  
Been through it all  
More than a thousand times  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my ordinary  
More than any  
Legendary love  
  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
You say you're looking for someone  
From a cover of a magazine  
Romance and beauty  
But it isn't always what it seems  
Look into my eyes  
My tears won't lie  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my ordinary  
More than any  
Legendary love  
  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
For the last time  
Come and wake me up  
Be a sign  
Be my legendary love  
  
Wo-ooh  
Never thought I'd see the day  
Never thought I'd see the day love come your way  
Ooh yeah, yeah  
Never thought I'd see the day  
Never thought I'd see the day love come your way  
  
She's got to be  
She's got to be  
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)  
She's got to be  
She's got to be  
  
(Wo-ooh, wo-ohh, yeah)  
She's got to be the queen of angels above  
(Legendary love)  
She's got to be a true angel of love  
In the world  
Never thought I'd see the day  
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Wo-ooh ohh-ho
