In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
With an aching in my heart and a pocket full of sand  
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with no place to go  
Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go  
But I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow  
And where the whiskey it was boss and the women they were fine  
Well now there she goes my friend, she's a'rolling down the line  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time  
This old airport's got me down it ain't no earthy good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be  
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a railroad train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
