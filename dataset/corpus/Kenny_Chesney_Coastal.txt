Tank top, love handles  
Tube socks, Jesus sandals  
Cheap blender, ice bucket  
Raw oysters, yeah, give me one and shuck it  
  
Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri  
And laughs, here's to the boys at the factory  
  
No more building transmissions  
He's going deep sea fishing  
Catch a marlin, catch a tan  
Catch a local cover band  
  
Hey, you gotta watch that man  
He'll go coastal on ya  
  
Silver hair, silver Buick  
Winter's coming, better move it  
Southbound before they get snowed under  
Call the kids, tell 'em see you next summer  
  
No more freezing their tails off  
It's cataract sunglasses and a round of golf  
Red skin, green plaid, margarita, dog track  
Before you know it Mom and Dad  
They'll go coastal on ya  
  
Sounds so good, got me thinking  
What do y'all say after I'm done singing  
  
We just take a little getaway  
Cruise it down the A1A  
Florabama to the Keys  
Better keep your eye on me  
  
I'll go coastal on ya  
I'll go coastal on ya  
Yeah, I'll go coastal on ya
