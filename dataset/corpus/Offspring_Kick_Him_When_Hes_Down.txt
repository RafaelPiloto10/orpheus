'Hey, you're a riddle',  
I say as I move aside  
(Like I really need your advice)  
But you won't leave it alone  
  
Little men try but don't get a lot done  
Living in sin doesn't move me either way  
I get a feeling you're so vague  
Like I said before  
Little men come when anything goes  
  
[Chorus]  
When the rain comes I sit home and pray  
Make it all numb  
I wish it all away  
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away  
Kick him when he's down  
Here alone I'll put up and fight  
Kick him when he's down  
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night  
Kick him when he's down  
Hey, don't worry, I'll get along home alright  
  
Hey, everybody's supposed to be the same  
So how come they're so lame?  
It's like taking a fall  
Keep on running back into that wall  
  
Awake in a dream, get up and go to work  
But I'm feeling like such a jerk  
Like I said before  
Little men come when everything goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Hey, you're a riddle' I say as I move aside  
(Like I really need your advice)  
But you won't leave it alone  
Little men try but don't get a lot done  
  
Living in sin doesn't move me either way  
I get a feeling you're so vague  
Like I said before  
Little men come when anything goes
