The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year  
And something in my mind just got away  
Being in the places where we used to be  
Somehow being there without you's not the same.  
  
Parking lots, office parks and shopping malls  
And all you left were bills you hadn't paid.  
The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year  
And something in my mind just got away  
  
It's all behind you now,  
You're moving on.  
They'll never find you now,  
You're moving on, on, on.  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
  
Alcohol, cigarettes and luxury goods,  
Christmas lights look desperate in this room.  
Winter's light left me in the dark last night  
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom.  
  
Winter's trees freezing in the bitter wind  
And autumn's leaves have all been blown away.  
Being in the places where we used to be  
Somehow being there without you's not the same.  
  
It's all behind you now,  
You're moving on.  
They'll never find you now,  
You're moving on, on, on.  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
  
It's all behind you now,  
You're moving on.  
They'll never find you now,  
You're moving on, on, on.  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa
