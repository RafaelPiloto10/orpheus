Somewhere on the waterfront  
Johnny's hiding with a gun  
Swears he'll kill any man that tells his story  
He's ain't sorry for what he's done  
  
He broke into a drugstore  
Just to cure his daily need  
Didn't mean to shoot the guard  
But he was blinded by the greed  
  
Oh, Johnny  
  
See that nun, she's his sister  
She doesn't know that he's gone bad  
When they told it to his papa  
It drove the old man mad  
  
Just as his mother warned him  
From her dying bed  
It's alright to lose your heart  
But never lose your head  
  
Oh, Johnny  
  
Now the cops have got him surrounded  
And he doesn't stand a hope  
He wonders how he could be in so much trouble  
Over just a little dope  
  
Five to one he gets away  
That's the odds I'm going to give  
Five to four they blast him away  
Three to one he's going to live  
  
Oh, Johnny  
Oh, Johnny, you better run  
  
Back in the alley where he was slain  
Thought I heard something move  
Beside the trash can lay a heart and chain  
The picture had been removed  
  
Just another junkyard piece  
Looking for a bed  
It's alright to lose your heart  
But never lose your head  
  
Oh, Johnny  
  
Lookout!
