Another night slowly closes in and I feel so lonely  
Touching heat freezing on my skin  
I pretend you still hold me  
I'm going crazy I'm losing sleep  
I'm in too far  
I'm in way too deep over you  
I can't believe you're gone  
You were the first  
You'll be the last  
  
[Chorus]  
Wherever you go I'll be with you  
Whatever you want I'll give it to you  
Whenever you need someone  
To lay your heart and head upon  
Remember after the fire After all the rain  
I will be the flame  
I will be the flame  
  
Watching shadows move across the wall  
Feels so frightening  
I want to run to you I want to call  
But I've been hit by lightning  
Just can't stand up for falling apart  
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you  
You'll always be the one  
You were the first  
You'll be the last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm going crazy  
I'm losing sleep  
I'm in too far  
I'm in way too deep over you  
You'll always be the one  
You were the first  
You'll be the last  
  
[Chorus]
