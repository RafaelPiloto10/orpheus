It's no use pretending  
That I understand  
The hide and seek we play with facts  
It changes our demand  
  
Tilt my hat at the sun  
And the shadows they burn dark  
Light me and I'll burn for you  
And the love song never stops  
  
I like the look in your eyes  
When you talk that certain way  
I love the day in the life  
When you know that lover's way  
  
Minding my own business  
When you came along  
Temperature's been running hot  
The fever was so strong  
  
Tilt my hat at the sun  
And the shadows they burn dark  
Light me and I'll burn for you  
And the love song never stops  
  
It's always an adventure  
The fantasies we make a fact  
You're the secret I desire  
I can't keep that to myself  
  
When we're not together  
It doesn't feel so bad  
We could be so far apart  
But our love's not sad  
  
It's no use pretending  
'Cause I understand  
The hide and seek we play with facts  
It changes our demand
