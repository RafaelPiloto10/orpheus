When I get up in the morning  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
And nothin' seems too easy  
When your clock's tickin' quarter to five  
Make my way down to the door  
Can't put my troubles on no shelf  
Cause when nobody worries for you  
You got to worry for yourself  
  
Cruisin' in my four wheels  
It's got everything I need inside  
Think I'll stop and fill it up for the ride  
Man said that be twenty dollars  
Mister, by the way how's your health  
I said mister here's your money  
Now you keep your questions for yourself  
  
And it's my life that I'm livin'  
Wouldn't want to be no one else  
So if you don't like how I dot it  
Ya better keep it to yourself  
Kick it in  
When I get up in the morning  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
And nothin' seems too easy  
When your clock's tickin' quarter to nine  
Make my way down to the door  
Can't put my troubles on no shelf  
Cause when nobody worries for you  
You got to worry for yourself  
  
And it's my life that I'm livin'  
Wouldn't want to be no one else  
So if you don't like how I do it  
Ya better keep it to yourself  
  
And it's my life that I'm livin'  
Wouldn't want to be no one else  
So if you don't like how I do it  
Fuckin' keep it to yourself
