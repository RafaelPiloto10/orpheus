Seaside whenever you stroll along with me  
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside  
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine  
You say you will if you could but you can't  
I love you madly  
Let my imagination run away with you gladly  
A brand new angle highly commendable  
Seaside rendezvous  
  
I feel so romantic can we do it again?  
Can we do it again sometime I'd like that  
Fantastic see'est la vie mesdames et messieurs  
And at the peak of the season  
The Mediterranean  
This time of year it's so fashionable  
  
I feel like dancing in the rain  
Can I have a volunteer?  
Just keep right on dancing  
What a damn jolly good idea  
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact  
So 'tres charmant' my dear  
  
Underneath the moonlight  
Together we'll sail across the sea  
Reminiscing every night  
Meantime I ask you to be my Valentine  
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can  
I'll be your Valentino  
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino  
Get a new facial start a sensational  
Seaside rendezvous so adorable  
Seaside rendezvous ooh  
Seaside rendezvous  
Give us a kiss!
