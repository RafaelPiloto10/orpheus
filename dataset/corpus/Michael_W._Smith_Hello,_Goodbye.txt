Where's the Navigator of your destiny?  
Where is the Dealer of this hand?  
Who can explain life and its brevity  
Cause there is nothing here that I can understand  
  
You and I have barely met  
And I just don't want to let go of you yet  
  
[Chorus]  
Noah, hello, goodbye  
I will see you on the other side  
Noah, sweet child of mine  
I will see you on the other side  
  
And so I hold your tiny hand in mine  
For the hardest thing I've ever had to face  
Heaven calls for you before it calls for me  
When you get there, save me a place  
  
A place where I can share your smile  
And I can hold you for more than just a while  
  
[Chorus]
