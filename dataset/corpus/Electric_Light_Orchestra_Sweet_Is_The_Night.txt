When the day is done and there's nowhere to run  
And the people of the city have all lost and won  
In your city dress you stand and stare  
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair  
  
And the light that shines  
Paints a trace of sadness  
On the street I wait  
But I can't seem to get to you.  
  
Well, you start to sway, check your Cartier  
'Cause it's getting late, you can't afford to wait  
So you move along where it's going on  
And the people of the night are playing 'til the dawn  
  
And the sun that shines  
Paints a trace of sadness  
In your eyes that cry  
Wishing and hoping  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Sweet, sweet is the night  
Now you are near  
Dark, dark were the days  
They disappear  
Sweet, sweet is the night  
Now you are near.  
  
Well you did your thing and you lost your wings  
And you hurt so bad you lost everything  
And the tears that fall on the city wall  
Will fade away with the rays of morning light that shines  
Paints a smile across your pretty face  
I know  
  
Everything is alright  
Alright  
  
[Chorus]
