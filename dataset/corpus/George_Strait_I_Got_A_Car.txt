She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress  
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess  
With a story that could only be anybody's guess  
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance  
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said  
Hey, I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot  
She said, I saw you comin' over, I already thought it over  
And OK, so now what  
  
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something  
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing  
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are  
And she said, where do you think all this is going  
I said, there ain't no way of knowing  
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far  
But I got a car  
  
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down  
We let ourselves go all the way through town  
She never said stop and I never asked her why  
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere  
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there  
And I kinda wish this day would never end  
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where  
  
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something  
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing  
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are  
And she said, where do you think all this is going  
I said, there ain't no way of knowing  
I really hadn't thought it through that far  
And I can't promise you the moon and stars  
But I got a car  
  
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days  
'Til we finally found a stopping place  
When the doctor's said, you know what's on the way?  
And we found ourselves in a little white house  
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down  
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out  
  
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now?  
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something  
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running  
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are  
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're goin'?  
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far  
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are
