Put on the dress in which you were married.  
Pull down the veil till your eyes are hid.  
  
Can you remember where we both came from.  
Let us do as we did.  
  
Look at tomorrow today.  
Making tomorrow today.  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today.  
  
Put back the photo under the window.  
Put down the 'phone that you hold in your hand.  
  
Put away these things that stand in between us.  
Let us be what we can.  
  
When it seems, hopeless.  
When it seems, hopeless.  
  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today.  
  
What better measure of what you were doing here  
Than what you can leave behind.  
  
All the children of your children's children.  
Do you ever think what they're going to find.  
  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow.  
Where the sacred met the scared.  
  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow.  
Where the dreamer's dream is dared.  
  
In each one of us, a dream can burn like the sun.  
Let's try it all one more time to get this lesson learned.  
  
Sitting up in a spaceship.  
Looking down at the earth.  
You wonder what they're struggling for.  
What's it all really worth.  
  
Making tomorrow today.  
Making tomorrow today.  
Make tomorrow. Make tomorrow.
