Leaves were falling, just like embers,  
In colors red and gold, they set us on fire  
Burning just like moonbeams in our eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody said they saw me, swinging the world by the tail  
Bouncing over a white cloud, killing the blues.  
  
Now I'm guilty of something  
I hope you never do  
Because there is nothing  
Any sadder than losing yourself in love.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And then you've ask me, just to leave you  
To set out on my own  
And get what I needed.  
You want me to find what I've already had.  
  
[Chorus x2]
