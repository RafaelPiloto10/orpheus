Heart-breaker soul-shaker I've been told about you  
Steam-roller the midnight shoulder  
What they been sayin' must be true  
  
Red hot mama oh that charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch  
  
Talking jive and poison ivy  
You ain't gonna cling to me  
Minute-taker fall-faker  
I ain't so blind I can't see  
  
Red hot mama oh that charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus: repeat 4x]
