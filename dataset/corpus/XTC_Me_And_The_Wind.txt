Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Me and the wind are pulling kites and pushing tress  
Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Me and the wind are feeling freer than air should ever be  
Should ever be should ever be should ever  
  
And when you lured me into your syrup  
All I could think of was what a lovely way for me to go  
I never really realised that  
  
Just like the struggling summer flies that  
I was drowning no matter how sweet or how slow  
  
Have I been such a fool  
Have I been sitting on your stool  
While you cracked the whip  
While you cracked the whip  
  
I danced imprisoned in your drumbeat  
Your tune of spring had me whirling like a mad march  
Merry hare  
It never really came to mind that  
  
The strings of your instrument were strangling me  
Inside their snare  
  
Have I been such a fool  
Have I been sitting on your stool  
While you held the hoop  
While you held the hoop  
  
Now that I'm out and I'm shouting in doorways  
Freed from a love more like murder  
I should be singing but in liberation  
Feel like a ship with no rudder  
  
Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Have I been such a fool
