Say I'm crying  
I'm looking at what's on TV  
Pain and suffering  
And the struggle to be free  
It can't ever be denied  
And I never will ignore  
But when I see you coming  
I can take it all  
  
You're so fine  
Lose my mind  
And the world seems to disappear  
All the problems  
All the fears  
And the world seems to disappear  
  
Say you're mine  
And give yourself to the feelings that you know  
I'm needing all that you can give me  
All the things that you do so well  
Words are healing  
Sweet anticipation  
Making spells as the shadows close in  
Fall across all our yesterdays  
  
Say if I could  
Look into myself and reason  
But I could never never see  
Or make sense of the dealings  
Turn around  
Am I looking at salvation  
Make me realize all that I am  
You put the light inside this man
