There were flashing lights when we met  
Not the typical place you would be  
In a flash of time my mind was set  
I knew you were the girl there for me  
  
And though you just wanted to leave  
Imagine how great it could be  
The F-you-T-you-are-E (spells the future girl)  
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (where you going girl?)  
  
Come and sit with me don't be so quick to leave (please)  
I really like you girl (girl, girl)  
Let's trade thoughts and words explore the universe (verse)  
But just don't leave me girl (girl, girl)  
I really like you girl (girl) girl (girl)  
From the moment (the moment) that we met (we met)  
I really like you girl (girl) oh girl (girl)  
And I know (I know) this is it (this is it)  
  
Against the wall is where ya lean  
The most beautiful girl that I've seen  
Out of this world my God you bling  
I'm surprised that you are a human being  
  
And though you just wanted to leave  
Imagine how great it could be  
The F-you-T-you-are-E (spells the future girl)  
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (where you going girl?)  
  
Come and sit with me don't be so quick to leave (please)  
I really like you girl (girl, girl)  
Let's trade thoughts and words explore the universe (verse)  
But just don't leave me girl (girl, girl)  
I really like you girl (girl) girl (girl)  
From the moment (the moment) that we met (we met)  
I really like you girl (girl) oh girl (girl)  
And I know (I know) this is it (this is it)  
  
Come and sit with me don't be so quick to leave (please)  
I really like you girl (girl, girl)  
Let's trade thoughts and words explore the universe (verse)  
But just don't leave me girl (girl, girl)

And I know (I know)this is it (this is it)  
  
Yo... I think I got the one now (uh-huh)  
Never me man never me... never in a million years (uh-huh)  
But I do... Haha... Whoo!
