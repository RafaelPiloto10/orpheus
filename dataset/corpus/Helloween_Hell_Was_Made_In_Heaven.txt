There was a time eating your mind  
Eating your heart and your soul  
Down to the bone always alone  
Nobody waiting at home  
  
Now allow that we unite our fires  
Shout it out  
Give yourself to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hell was made in heaven  
I was made for you  
Hell was made in heaven  
Made for loving you in sin  
  
Ten years ago you made the vow  
Promised your life and your love  
Before you have paid, nothing returned  
What is enough is enough  
  
Now allow that we unite our fires  
Shout it out  
Give yourself to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hell was made in heaven  
I was made for you  
Hell was made in heaven  
Made for loving you in sin  
  
Now allow that we unite our fires  
Shout it out  
Give yourself to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hell was made in heaven  
I was made for you  
Hell was made in heaven  
Made for loving you in sin, in sin  
In sin, in sin
