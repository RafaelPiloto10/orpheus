I been gettin' lonely, too much these days.  
I been gettin' lonely, I guess I better get away.  
But where can I go that's real? life's a stage on a ferris wheel.  
And the actors are all fighting just to see who gets the lead in the play.  
  
Oh, no, no.  
I gotta' find me a better day.  
  
Talk about down, I feel so lonely.  
Talk about down, I'm startin to worry.  
Don't really want to be all alone. I can't get along with the chicks at home.  
The world just don't seem right, my head is spinnin', and I hate what's goin'
down.  
You gotta' find me a better day.  
  
Oh, gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
You gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
You gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find, gotta' find,  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find, gotta' find,  
Gotta' find,  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.
