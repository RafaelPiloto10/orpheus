My father's name was Hannibal, Mama was Hanna-Mariah.  
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire  
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry.  
We lost it all only love was left, and that was the one thing money can't buy.  
  
We're all dust bowl children  
Singin' a dust bowl song  
And the crops won't grow,  
And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone.  
When the green grass growing fields are gone.  
When the green fields are gone.  
When the green grass growing fields are gone.  
  
Well, they said in California, there was work of every kind.  
The only work that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line.  
Once I had a dollar, once I had a dream.  
But now all the work is being done by a big ol' machine.  
  
We're all dust bowl children  
Singin' the dust bowl song  
And the crops won't grow  
And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone
