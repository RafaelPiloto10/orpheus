When I was young and the world belonged to me,  
I thought that love meant pain and jealousy.  
It was a cross on my shoulder.  
Oh, Lord, now I feel so much older.  
Mmm. Mmm.  
  
Time had a way of making me see my lonely life has taken its toll on me.  
Now, I feel the emptiness and I don't wanna live like this.  
Now, I've heard stories, I've heard songs telling me believe my heart.  
Don't wait too long with words that don't ring true until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine until the end of time.  
  
How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel,  
And how deep my soul, how much can I reveal?  
I'm lost in love's mystery, caught between time and eternity.  
Now, there's a door that opens wide.  
Slowly I will find my way and I'll reach inside.  
But I couldn't make it through until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine and only when I see  
The light of love shine until the end of time.  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire.  
And when I see the light of love shine in your eyes when they meet mine,  
Only then I'll know it's you and I until the end of time.
