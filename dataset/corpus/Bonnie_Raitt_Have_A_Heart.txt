Hey!  
Shut up.  
Don't lie to me.  
Hey!  
Mister, how do you do.  
Oh pardon me I thought I knew you.  
Would you stand back baby 'cause I want to get a better look.  
The big man who couldn't handle the little bit of love you took.  
  
Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.  
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?  
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?  
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.  
  
Oh darling, I love you so.  
I told you yes, and then you told me no.  
Baby, how can you say  
You should be free and I should pay and pay  
And you talk and talk about you and what you need  
But sooner or later your love is gonna make me bleed.  
  
Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.  
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?  
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?  
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.  
Oh, oh.  
  
Talk on, talk on, but love is what you need.  
And sooner or later that love is gonna make you bleed.  
  
Hey, hey, have a heart, hey, have a heart.  
If you don't love me, why don't you let me go?  
Have a heart, please, oh don't you have a heart?  
Little by little you fade while I fall apart.  
But don't you run away baby.
