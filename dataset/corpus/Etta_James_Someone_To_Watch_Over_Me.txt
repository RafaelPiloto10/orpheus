There's a saying old, says that love is blind  
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"  
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind  
  
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet  
He's the big affair I cannot forget  
Only man I ever think of with regret  
  
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram  
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?  
  
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see  
I hope that he, turns out to be  
Someone to watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could, always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may not be the man some  
Girls think of as handsome  
To my heart he carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh, how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh, how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
Someone to watch over me
