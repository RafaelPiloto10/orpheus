Ah, crush, ah  
  
I see ya blowin' me a kiss  
It doesn't take a scientist  
To understand what's going on baby  
If you see something in my eye  
Let's not over-analyze  
Don't go too deep with it baby (baby)  
  
So it'll be, what it'll be  
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me  
Here's what I'll do  
I'll play loose  
Not like we have a date with destiny  
  
It's just (aah) a little crush (crush)  
Not like I faint every time we touch  
It's just (aah) some little thing (crush)  
Not like everything I do, depends on you  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
  
It's raising my adrenaline  
You're banging on a heart of tin  
Please don't make too much of it baby  
Say the word "forever more"  
That's not what I'm looking for  
All I can commit to is "maybe"  
  
So it'll be what it'll be  
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me (crazy over you and me)  
Here's what I'll do  
I'll play loose  
Not like we have a date with destiny (Ooh ooh)  
  
It's just (aah) a little crush (crush)  
Not like I faint every time we touch  
It's just (aah) some little thing (crush)  
Not like everything I do depends on you  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
  
Vanilla skies  
White picket fences in your eyes  
A vision of you and me  
  
It's just (aah) a little crush (crush)  
Not like I faint every time we touch  
It's just (aah) some little thing (crush)  
Not like everything I do (everything I do) depends on you  
Sha-la-la-la (ah hey yeah yeah)  
Sha-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la (oh babe not like everything I do depends on you)  
Sha-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la (ah hey yeah yeah)  
Sha-la-la-la
