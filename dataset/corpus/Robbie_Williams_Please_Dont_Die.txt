Let me lie down  
Please don't wake me  
Nothing's sacred  
And no one saved me  
  
In my black eye  
I can feel it  
Moving closer  
Can't you hear it  
  
The only gift you gave to me  
Was self-fulfilling prophecy  
I need to change the sounds  
That shape my life  
  
And if you die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one here  
To love me and hold me  
  
Take me dancing  
I love music  
Keep on singing  
We won't lose it  
  
Picture me there  
Missing no one  
If young hearts run free  
Why can't we go on  
  
Go on 'til they kick us out  
We've everything to talk about  
I could bring a song into your life  
  
If you should die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one here  
To love me and hold me  
  
Maybe I've been away too long  
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong  
They say there's nothing I can do  
But talk to strangers and wait for you  
  
If you should die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one  
To love me and hold me  
  
If you should die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one  
To love me and hold me
