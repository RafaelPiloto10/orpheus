All these feelings  
I'm tired of them  
Ruined all of my life again  
Emotions aren't my friend  
I gave keep ordered as best I can  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
How about the weather?  
  
All these people  
I'm tired of them  
Sifting into my life again  
Their questions, the how and when  
I try and answer the best that I can  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
How about the weather?  
  
All my worries, they come and go  
They tend to leave when I let you know  
On bad days I take it slow  
I try to dance when I hit a low  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
It will all get better  
  
All the days, they go so fast  
I can't believe what is in my past  
The future's here at last  
I don't need to have what she has  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
It will all get better  
  
Sing it out  
Sing it loud  
Sing it loud  
Sing it loud  
Be proud, come out  
Be proud, come out  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
We can make it better  
  
We will have it better
