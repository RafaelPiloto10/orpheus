When the darkness closes in  
And I'm on my knees again  
  
I call Your Name  
I call Your Name  
'Cause it is the sweetest Name I know  
Jesus  
  
When my soul begins to soar  
And my heart longs for more  
I call on Your Name  
I call on Your Name  
I call on Your Name  
Jesus  
  
There's power in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus  
  
There's healing in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus  
  
There's freedom in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus  
  
There's power in  
The Name above all other names  
Jesus
