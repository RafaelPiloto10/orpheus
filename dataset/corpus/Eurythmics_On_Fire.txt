With your long black hair covering your face  
Perfect teeth behind velvet lips  
I fell in love with a mystery  
The strangest thing that ever happened to me  
Well I carved your name on the hanging tree  
When the sun went down it went down on me  
On fire now I'm on fire  
On fire now I'm on fire  
All over all over yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm the jack of hearts (he's the jack of hearts)  
In a losers game  
But if I lose it all I guess I'll take the blame  
On fire now I'm on fire  
On fire now I'm on fire  
All over all over  
On fire now I'm on fire  
On fire now I'm on fire  
All over all over  
I'm on fire  
With your long black hair going down to your hips  
With your perfect teeth behind your velvet lips  
I fell in love with a mystery  
Well she mean as a witch... But she's a woman to me  
On fire now I'm on fire now  
On fire now I'm on fire now  
All over all over  
On fire now I'm on fire now  
All over all over  
I'm on fire now I'm on fire now I'm on fire now  
I'm on fire fire all over  
Ah baby on fire now
