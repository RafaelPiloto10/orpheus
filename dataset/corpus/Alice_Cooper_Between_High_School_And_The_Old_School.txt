Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
I guess I'm a loner and I don't fit in (No...)  
I ain't too comfortable in my skin (oh...)  
An' I don't play well with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
  
Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
Nobody wants me hanging round  
Unless it's from a tree in the middle of town  
And I'm out of step with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
So I defy maybe all rules maybe no rules  
  
My clothes don't make me  
My hair ain't cut right  
And I don't care much  
No I don't care at all  
  
I guess my brain is out of synch, I think  
  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide, I just can't decide  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Aw...
