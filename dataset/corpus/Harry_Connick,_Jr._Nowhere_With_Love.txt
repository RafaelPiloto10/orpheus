In a way, I really don't know much at all  
And if you say that I'm simple, you're on the ball  
On the ball to say that I'm going nowhere  
But I'm going nowhere with love  
  
They all say that I'm not impressive at best  
That's O. K., I've got nobody to impress  
My impression is they'd rather be elsewhere  
Oh, I'm staying nowhere with love  
  
Well, it's better to be happy in a cardboard shack  
Than to be alone in a castle  
All you get for your money is a heart attack  
I'd just as soon alleviate the hassle  
  
Every day, I watch the go-getters go by  
Even they say the ladder is much too high  
Why should I go high, I'm happy below there  
Right here in nowhere with love
