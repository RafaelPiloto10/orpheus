Another night in any town  
You can hear the thunder of their cry  
Ahead of their time  
They wonder why  
  
Shadows of a golden age  
A generation waits for dawn  
Brave carry on  
Bold and the strong  
  
Only the young can say  
They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire  
  
They're seein' through the promises  
And all the lies they dare to tell  
Is it heaven or hell?  
They know very well  
  
Only the young can say  
They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire  
  
Only the young can say  
They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire  
  
Only the young can say  
Only the young can say  
Only the young can say  
Only the young can say  
Young can say
