I said I wouldn't cry  
The day you say goodbye  
It's not like I'll never see you again  
I guess the things you need  
You just can't get from me  
But you still can reach out to me now and then  
  
My head is spinning round  
All my defenses down  
I have held the world in my hands  
But I can't keep you from slipping away,  
  
If time will show me grace  
And you to a better place  
Then I can live knowing it wasn't in vain  
It hurts so much to know when love means letting go  
And no one can tell me that they've felt my pain  
  
No strength can stop you now  
Will someone show me how  
How to live it over again  
'cause I can't keep you from slipping away  
  
I will never break your power over me  
I could never shake the thought of you burning in my mind  
You're all I see  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Oh, I can't keep you from slipping away  
Oh, Slipping away,
