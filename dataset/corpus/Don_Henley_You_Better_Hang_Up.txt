Out here in the country where the weather gets so mean  
She thinks about the places that she ain't never seen  
She knows that she's married but she can't remember why  
And she wonders what it might feel like with some other guy  
  
And though she's hotter than an oven  
Just to fill your lovin' cup  
If a man answers, you better hang up  
  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
  
You're from New York City where they don't say no prayers  
Anything goes and nobody cares  
And the country girl might thrill ya but you better pass her by  
'Cause her ol' man love to kill ya for the look that's in your eye  
  
And though you're hotter than an oven  
Just to fill her lovin' cup  
If a man answers, you better hang up  
  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up  
You better hang up
