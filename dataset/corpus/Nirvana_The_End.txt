This is the end  
My only friend, the end  
This is the end  
My only friend, the end  
  
I'll offer you some  
I'll offer you sexualism and a masculine man  
You can rephrase my friend (Alt: You can deface my grave, my friend)  
  
The killer woke up in Belgium  
And he poured a lot of syrup on his waffles  
And he walked on down the hall  
And he said, all I want is to have some hasbrowns and some grits  
And then he walked on down the hall  
And then he said, listen I got a quarter in my pocket  
And I see that waffle house jukebox  
And I'm gonna walk up to the coinslot  
And then there's a direst line between my pupil and that cionslot  
And I lift that quarter out of my pocket  
And I said, I wanna hear the waffle house theme  
So I walk up to the jukebox, And I said  
Come on in  
I believe I will, I believe I will  
At the waffle house  
  
I got a six pack and nothin' to do
