Once I thought I saw you  
In a crowded hazy bar  
Dancing on the light  
From star to star  
Far across the moonbeam  
I know that's who you are  
I saw your brown eyes  
Turning once to fire  
You are like a hurricane  
There's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer  
Where the feeling stays  
I want to love you  
But I get so blown away  
I am just a dreamer  
But you are just a dream  
You could have been  
Anyone to me  
Before that moment  
You touched my lips  
That perfect feeling  
When time just slips  
Away between us  
On our foggy trip  
You are like a hurricane  
There's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer  
Where the feeling stays  
I want to love you  
But I get so blown away  
Once I thought I saw you  
In a crowded hazy bar  
Dancing on the light  
From star to star  
Far across the moonbeam  
I know that's who you are  
I saw your brown eyes  
Turning once to fire  
You are like a hurricane  
There's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer  
Where the feeling stays  
I want to love you  
But I get so blown away
