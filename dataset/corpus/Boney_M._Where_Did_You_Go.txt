I'm looking out the window pane  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
But you're not here  
Where did you go  
  
I want to know what made you go away  
What went wrong?  
I'm looking out my window pane  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
  
There's no-one here to laugh with me  
To make the dark clouds disappear  
My love, what went wrong?  
Where did you go - there is no answer  
  
I need you now much more that ever  
Where did you go - why can't you be with me  
Where did you go - we were so tender  
Where did you go - why not surrender  
  
Only you can set me free  
I'm looking out my window pane (Oh yes)  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
I think of you, of someone who can  
  
Always count on love so true  
And I'm here - where are you?  
Tell me...  
I think of you, of someone who can  
  
Always count on love so true  
And I'm here - where are you?  
Where did you go - there is no answer  
I need you now much more that ever  
  
Where did you go - why can't you be with me  
Where did you go - we were so tender  
Where did you go - why not surrender  
Only you can set me free  
  
Where did you go - there is no answer  
I need you now much more that ever  
  
Where did you go - why can't you be with me  
Where did you go - we were so tender  
Where did you go - why not surrender  
Only you can set me free
