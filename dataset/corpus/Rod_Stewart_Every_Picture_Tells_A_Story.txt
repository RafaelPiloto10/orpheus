Spent time feelin' inferior standing' in front of my mirror  
Combed my hair in a thousand ways, but I came out lookin' just the same  
Daddy said, son, you better see the world  
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave  
But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your
bread  
So I got out  
  
Paris was a place you could hide away, if you felt you didn't fit in  
French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person  
Down along the left bank, minding my own  
Was knocked down by a human stampede  
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot, when all I wanted was a cup of tea  
I was accused  
  
I moved on  
Down in rome I wasn't getting enough  
Of the things that keep a young man alive  
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck  
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction  
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction  
I wasn't ready for that, no, no  
  
I moved right out east, yeah  
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here  
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon  
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural  
She took me up on deck and bit my neck  
Oh, people, I was glad I found her  
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here  
  
I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me  
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be  
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe  
They wouldn't give you the time of day  
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet  
God, I was glad I found her  
  
And if they had the words I could tell to you  
To help you on your way down the road  
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats  
'Cause it's all been said before  
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off  
You didn't have to come here anyway, so remember
