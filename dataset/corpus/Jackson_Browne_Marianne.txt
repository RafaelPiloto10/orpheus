Marianne, marianne  
With your voice like silver strings ringing  
And sounds of laughter and singing  
Keep repeating, marianne, marianne  
  
Marianne, marianne  
Oh I can tell better than anyone else could  
That there's more to you than just bad or good  
There's a teardrop or a shaft of light for your heart  
  
Marianne, oh, marianne  
The dawn will be breaking soon  
And my voice will fade with the moon  
And the sunlight will remind me of you
