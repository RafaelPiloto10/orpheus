I been out on the road with my thumb in the air,  
I'm a long way from home but I just don't care.  
The dust from the road makes it dry in my mouth,  
When it's cold up north, that's when I head south.  
  
'cause I been tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah.  
Tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah.  
  
I passed through new york just the other day,  
The smog was bad but not as bad as l.a.  
Sometimes I wonder what the world's comin' to.  
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna' do.  
  
Chorus  
'cause I been tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah.  
I been tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah.  
  
I been out on the road with my thumb in the air,  
I'm a long way from home but I just don't care.  
The dust from the road makes it dry in my mouth,  
When it's cold up north, that's when I head south.  
  
Tryin' to, tryin' to get away.  
Tryin' to, tryin' to get away.  
Tryin' to, tryin' to get away.  
Tryin' to, tryin' to get away.  
  
Chorus  
  
'cause I been tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah, yeah, yeah.
