Welcome to my nightmare  
I think you're gonna like it  
I think you're gonna feel you belong.  
A nocturnal vacation, unnecessary sedation,  
You want to feel at home 'cause you belong  
Welcome to my nightmare whoa, ho, ho, ho  
  
Welcome to my breakdown  
I hope I didn't scare you  
That's just the way we are when we come down  
We sweat and laugh and scream here  
'Cause life is just a dream here  
You know inside you feel right at home, here  
Yeah, welcome to my nightmare yeah, hey, hey, hey  
  
Welcome to my nightmare  
I think you're gonna like it  
I think you're gonna feel you belong  
We sweat and laugh and scream here  
'Cause life is just a dream here  
You know inside you feel right at home, here  
  
Welcome to my nightmare  
Hoo, hoo, woo, hoo  
Welcome to my breakdown  
Yeah
