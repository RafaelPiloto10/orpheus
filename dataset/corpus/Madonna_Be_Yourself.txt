Too much of a good thing  
Has really burnt me out  
I'm sick of satisfaction  
And living in a drought  
  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to, baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
  
The center of attention  
Is living on the edge  
The thirty of second floor  
I'm standing on a ledge  
  
Got to get this straight  
Cos we're running too late  
  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to, baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to, baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to, baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to, baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can  
Just be yourself  
Anyway, baby  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you can
