You might think you've peeped the scene  
You haven't  
The real one is far to mean  
The wattered down, the one you know  
Was made up centuries ago  
They it sound all wack and corny  
Yes its awful blasted boring  
Twisted fiction, sick addiction  
Well gather round children  
Zip it listen!  
  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher?  
So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I fantasized about this back in Chicago  
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago  
That's me, the first year that I blow  
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo  
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo  
Me found bravery in my bravado  
D.J's need to listen to the model's  
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?  
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)  
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?  
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow  
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo  
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow  
  
Can we get much higher?  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion  
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis  
Beyond the truest  
Hey, teacher, teacher  
Tell me how do you respawn the students?  
And refresh the page and restart the memory?  
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?  
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies  
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me  
The plan was to drink until the pain over  
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?  
Fresh air, rolling down the window  
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low  
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh  
Don't make me pull the toys  
And fire up the engines huh  
And then they make noise  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
At the mall there was a seance  
Just kids, no parents  
Then the sky filled with heroines  
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron  
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us  
(And the fires did declare us)  
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)  
(And moved her back in Paris)  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh  
  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Can we get much higher? So high  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
