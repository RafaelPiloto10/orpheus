Act sleazy  
Behave like a tart  
It's so easy  
To get what you want  
  
Yeah  
You can't get enough  
  
Hey baby  
We all know your name  
It's sex  
That will lead you to fame  
  
Don't don't don't give it up  
Don't don't die of a broken heart  
  
Your ego  
Is never at fault  
If you believe it  
You'll get all you want  
  
Yeah  
You can't get enough  
  
Don't don't die of a broken heart  
  
I feel your pulse  
Beating blue  
And I feel your skin crawls  
When we, we ,we, we  
Fuck  
  
Don't don't die of a broken heart
