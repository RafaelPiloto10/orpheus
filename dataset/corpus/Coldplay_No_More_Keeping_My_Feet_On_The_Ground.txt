Sometimes I wake up when I'm falling asleep  
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me  
But I wake up, yes I wake up smiling  
  
[Chorus]  
So what I feel fine  
I'm okay, I've seen the lighter side of life  
I'm alright I feel good  
So ill go, ill try to start moving  
  
Sometimes I wake up and I'm falling asleep  
But I've got to get going, so much that I wanted to do  
But I wake up smiling  
  
And this could be my last chance  
Of saving my innocence  
And this could be my last chance  
No more keeping my feet on the ground  
  
Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising  
Surprisingly good to be moving around  
And I move, and I wake up smiling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And this could be my last chance  
Of saving my innocence  
And this could be my last chance  
No more keeping my feet on the ground  
  
And there's nothing to keep them  
Nothing to keep them down  
And there's nothing to keep them  
There's nothing to keep them down.
