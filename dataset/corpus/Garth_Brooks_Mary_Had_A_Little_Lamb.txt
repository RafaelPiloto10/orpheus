Mary Had A Little Lamb  
One Holy Morning  
Neath The Star Of Bethlehem  
A Brand New Day Was Forming  
Guided By The Shining Light  
And The Angel's Voice  
Wise Men Traveled Through The Night  
To See The Baby Boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause Mary Had A Little Lamb  
King Of Kings And Son Of Man  
Mary Had A Little lamb Of God  
  
They Gathered Round To See The Lamb  
In The Manger Sleeping  
Such A Humble Throne For Him  
The Promise Of God Was Keeping  
There The Shepherds Bowed Their Heads  
Among The Cattle Lowing  
The First Ever Christmas Gift  
Was Wrapped In Swaddling Clothes  
  
(Chorus)  
  
For The World A Sacrifice  
Mary Did Give Birth  
The Way She Held Him In Her Arms  
Is How He Holds The Earth
