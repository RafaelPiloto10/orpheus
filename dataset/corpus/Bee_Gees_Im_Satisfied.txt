With you , baby I'm satisfied , making my love to you  
'Cause you got me hypnotized  
And you came to me alone girl  
I was a heart that's made of stone girl  
  
And you broke it down in pieces  
And you took me for your own girl  
I lie beneath your ecstasy  
You can pour it all over me  
  
I won't break the chains of loving you  
We got everything , anybody needs  
And it's here with me ,with you  
Baby I'm satisfied , makin' my love to you  
  
(Makin' my love , makin' my love)  
'Cause you got me hypnotized  
Before you took me by the hand girl  
I was a statue in the sand girl  
  
I was broken down for reasons  
You could never understand girl  
I was living on desire  
But that was just the way we were  
  
'Til you make a world of love in you  
We got everything , anybody needs  
And it's here with me , with you  
Baby I'm satisfied , making my love to you  
  
'Cause you got me hypnotized  
Anytime you wander, get yourself back to me girl  
Any cloud you're under , you got to get yourself free girl  
Ahh, ahh, baby with you  
  
Baby I'm satisfied , making' my love to you  
'Cause you got me hypnotized , oh baby , with you [Repeat]
