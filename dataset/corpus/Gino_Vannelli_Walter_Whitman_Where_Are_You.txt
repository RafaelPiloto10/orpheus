Walter Whitman where are you  
Among the stars or, in the earth beneath my shoe  
It's just cause I'm wondering  
Could you walk with me a mile  
And maybe heaven could spare you awhile  
  
Walter Whitman, I confess  
My faith is shaken  
And my life's a holy mess  
Yes, I need deliverance  
But I'd settle for a smile  
Now maybe heaven can spare you awhile  
I thought I heard you yawpin' from the yonder tree  
I swore I heard you say  
"Don't worry boy, shut up, enjoy, be free"  
  
Walter Whitman, I declare  
I could sing songs of joy  
Through my darkness and despair  
It's just I'm hoping  
You could shed a little light  
That is if heaven can spare you tonight  
  
Don't worry boy, shut up, enjoy, be free  
  
Walter Whitman, I declare  
I could sing songs of joy  
Through my darkness and despair  
It's just I'm hoping  
You could coax a problem child  
Now maybe heaven could spare you awhile  
  
Walter Whitman where are you?
