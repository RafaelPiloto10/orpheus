There's a thousand voices in my head  
Long ago  
Come inside, see yourself tonight  
Let me in, floating on the wind  
Oh, I don't know  
The sound your hear  
Are silent in the night  
  
God I'm dying on a trail of tears  
Where tomorrow never knows  
A resurrection closer to a  
Light I've never known  
Play the game existence to the  
Living end I go  
Take me down to the trail of tears  
Where tomorrow never knows  
  
The lost road of destiny  
I ride away home  
Head to lay on velvet nails tonight  
And will I lay  
Me down to close my eyes  
Oh, I don't know  
Spirit wind with broken wings to fly  
  
God I'm dying on a trail of tears  
Where tomorrow never knows  
A resurrection closer to a  
Light I've never known  
Play the game existence to the  
Living end I go  
Take me down to the trail of tears  
Where tomorrow never knows  
  
My feet are raw from the  
Trail where I've been  
Oh God these tears are evermore  
My heart is gone  
Oh to never come back again  
I'll walk the stars  
On my way home  
  
Oh I'm on a trail of tears  
Where tomorrow never knows  
Oh I'm closer to a light  
I've never known  
Play the game of existence to the  
Living end I go  
Down to the trail of tears where  
tomorrow never never knows  
Let my people go
