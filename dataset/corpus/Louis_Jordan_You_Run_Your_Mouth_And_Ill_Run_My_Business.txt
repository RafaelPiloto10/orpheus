You catch me beatin' up your chops?  
I ought to turn you over to the cops,  
But dig this spiel I'm going to lay on you, gate,  
Don't cop your broom, park the body and wait.  
  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You tell everybody I'm busted,  
You talk so much you got me disgusted.  
But you run your mouth and I'll run my business,  
Brother.  
  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You start in tellin' me you're my pal,  
And end up tellin' me how to handle my gal,  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother.  
  
You run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business,  
Brother,  
Just run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business,  
Brother,  
You always tellin' me what to do,  
Sayin', "I wouldn't do that if I was you!"  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother.  
  
Just clap your liver lips and I'll run my business,  
Brother,  
Clap your liver lips and I'll run my business, brother,  
If I'd followed your advice on how to make dough,  
I'd been in the jailhouse long ago.  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother.  
  
Do you dig me, Jack?
