Pennies in a stream  
Falling leaves a sycamore  
Moonlight in Vermont  
  
Gentle finger waves  
Ski trails down a mountain side  
Snow light in Vermont  
  
Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway  
As they travel each bend in the road  
And when people meet, in this romantic setting  
They're so hypnotized be the lovely  
  
Evening summer breeze  
Sweet warblings of the meadowlark  
Moonlight in Vermont
