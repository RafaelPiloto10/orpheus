You can look to the stars in search of the answers  
Look for God and life on distant planets  
Have your faith in the ever after  
While each of us holds inside the map to the labyrinth  
And heaven's here on earth  
  
We are the spirit the collective conscience  
We create the pain and the suffering and the beauty in this world  
Heaven's here on earth  
  
In our faith in humankind  
In our respect for what is earthly  
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding  
  
I've seen and met angels wearing the disguise  
Of ordinary people leading ordinary lives  
Filled with love, compassion, forgiveness and sacrifice  
Heaven's in our hearts  
  
In our faith in humankind  
In our respect for what is earthly  
In our unfaltering belief in peace and love and understanding  
  
Look around  
Believe in what you see  
The kingdom is at hand  
The promised land is at your feet  
We can and will become what we aspire to be  
If Heaven's here on earth  
  
If we have faith in humankind  
And respect for what is earthly  
And an unfaltering belief that truth is divinity  
And heaven's here on earth  
  
I've seen spirits  
I've met angels  
I've touched creations beautiful and wondrous  
I've been places where I question all I think I know  
But I believe, I believe, I believe this could be heaven  
  
We are born inside the gates with the power to create life  
And to take it away  
The world is our temple  
The world is our church  
Heaven's here on earth  
  
If we have faith in humankind  
And respect for what is earthly  
And an unfaltering belief  
In peace and love and understanding  
This could be heaven here on earth  
  
Heaven's in our heart
