I was down, nowhere bound  
Needed love, any love  
Something new, breezy and bashful but true  
Changing my whole point of view  
Suddenly someone, a midnight romancer  
A Romeo dancer in blue  
But only with you  
Only with you  
  
No more rain, no more chains  
No more cold lonely sleepless nights  
Laughing eyes, wider than midsummer skies  
Crazy but don't ask me why  
Suddenly someone, a midnight romancer  
A Romeo dancer in blue  
But only with you  
Only with you  
  
Once a Lone Star rider who danced in super cool  
Now a Romeo, it's true  
But only with you  
Only with you
