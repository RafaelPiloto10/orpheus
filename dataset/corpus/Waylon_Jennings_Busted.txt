My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes. but I'm busted  
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound. and I'm busted  
I got a cow that's gone dry and a hen that won't lay  
A big stack of bills gettin' bigger each day.  
The county will haul my belongings away, 'cause I'm busted  
  
I went to see my brother, gonna ask him for a loan, I was busted  
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone, but I'm busted  
My brother said there ain't one thing I can do  
Wife and the kids they're all down with the flu  
I was just thinking about calling on you, 'cause I'm busted.  
  
I ain't no thief but a man can go wrong, when he's busted  
The food that we canned last summer is gone, and I'm busted  
Well, the fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow  
Me and my family gotta pack up and go  
I'll make a living but where I don't know, I'm just busted.
