Words that pull the trigger  
Fear the laughing sound  
Haunts you  
To consider  
Love might turn you around  
To face a blind emotion  
Words like 'hey let's try'  
Words like 'thinking it over'  
They just don't apply  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm the boy (you made me)  
I'm the boy  
I'm the boy  
I'm the boy (you made me)  
I'm the boy  
I'm the boy  
  
Love is...  
What you make it  
Love the overflow  
Play if you can take it some...  
They just don't know  
If all the rules they're making  
Break somebody's heart  
What's the use in taking  
Baby's fall apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You made me realize  
That love is just a word  
That goes unheard in a situation  
Where love is nothing  
And you...  
Are all I can see  
  
This boy's in love with you  
You're everything  
I can see  
This boy's in love with you  
You have taken it all  
Away from me
