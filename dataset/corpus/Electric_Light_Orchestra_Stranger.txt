On a cold and windy morning  
Said goodbye to my old friends  
They were hangin' around the corner  
They were stayin' till the end  
  
On the other side of midnight,  
I was lookin' for a place to stay  
And one thing's sure for certain  
I ain't never goin' back again  
  
The streetlights looked so pretty  
As they spread into a town  
I was lookin' for another sundown  
And my head was spinning round and round  
  
Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger  
Lookin' through the eyes of danger  
Lookin' at the all-night dancer  
Never takin' all the chances  
  
As I walked into the main street  
Saw a crowd across the square  
And I heard a guitar playin'  
And I saw you standing there  
  
Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger  
Lookin' through the eyes of danger  
Lookin' at the all-night dancer  
Never takin' all the chances  
  
Distant bells they started ringing  
Somewhere far off in the night  
And the place was full of loneliness  
That disappeared from sight
