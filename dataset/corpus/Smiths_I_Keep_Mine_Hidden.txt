Hate, love and war  
Force emotions to the fore  
But not for me, of course  
Of course  
I keep mine hidden  
Oh...  
  
I keep mine hidden  
But it's so easy for you  
Because you let yours flail  
Into public view  
Oh, oh...  
  
Yellow and green  
A stumbling block  
I'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock  
With a past where to be 'touched'  
Meant to be 'mental'  
  
Ooh, I keep mine hidden  
The lies are so easy for you  
Because you let yours slide  
Into public view  
Oh...  
  
Use your loaf!
