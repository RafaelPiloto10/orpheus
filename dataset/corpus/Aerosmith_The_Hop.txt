Thinkin 'bout the night life  
In the ladies powder room  
Brother's like a howlin' wolf in the light of the silvery moon  
Joey's like a Pavlo's dog when he starts to salivate  
A Hardly man himself is hard to shake his rattle snake  
  
Me, I got a brand new babe  
You know something just ain't right  
I say yeah, yeah  
Can't stop rockin' tonight  
  
Hangin' at the shopping mall  
With a watchman full of sash  
Leave your smile outside the door  
'Cause the kids be kicking ass  
My old boot heels be smokin'  
You really got to understand  
We're burning down the town tonight  
When the new shit hits the fan  
  
Me, I got a brand new babe  
You know something just ain't right  
I say yeah, yeah  
Can't stop rockin' tonight  
  
Yeah, yeah, can't stop rockin' tonight  
Lyin' on your back tonight  
Watch the moon eclipse  
Maybe eatin out tonight  
But ya just ain't leavin' tips  
So you best watch out what you do  
And who you do it with  
'Cause you'll be kickin' ass tonight  
With the boys in Aerosmith
