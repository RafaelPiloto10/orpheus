How sad are we?  
And how sad have we been?  
We'll let you know  
We'll let you know  
Oh, but only if, you're really interested  
  
You wonder how  
We've stayed alive 'till now  
We'll let you know  
We'll let you know  
But only if, you're really interested  
  
We're all smiles  
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles  
That make us hostile  
Oh  
  
We will descend  
On anyone unable to defend  
Themselves  
Oh  
  
And the songs we sing  
They're not supposed to mean a thing  
La, la, la, la  
  
Oh  
You're lonely  
Oh, you're lonely  
Oh  
Get off the roof!  
Oh  
  
Your arsenal!  
  
We may seem cold, or  
We may even be  
The most depressing people you've ever known  
At heart, what's left, we sadly know  
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know  
We are the last truly British people you will ever know  
You'll never never want to know
