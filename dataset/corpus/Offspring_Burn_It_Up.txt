I think I'm burning up inside  
I think I'll take a little ride  
I'm gonna light up everything in sight  
I'll drive on by your yard  
And throw a Molotov cocktail at your car  
Then another in the local bar  
  
[Chorus]  
Ignition  
They call it an obsession but I think it's kinda bitchen'  
I think it's kinda neat  
Yeah, I'm a pyro  
I want to burn it up  
Yeah, I'm a pyro  
  
Tonight this 'hood will be a pyre  
I'm gonna set your house on fire  
I'll dance around the pretty flames  
Such a wonderful game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to make a tiki torch  
I'm gonna throw it on your porch  
Then I'm gonna run away  
And come back another day  
So many houses, so little time  
So many reasons, I'm not a crime  
I'd like to set you up  
I'd like to set you up
