Everybody wants to leave  
Just like you and I  
I have all year to smile  
A tear for every eye  
  
Life closed it's eyes, broke my world, now I cry  
I've got to tell you, I've got the reasons  
'Cause I'm a man, a man for all seasons, alive  
  
And would I pray  
What makes the world go round  
I haven't got today  
My mind is lost and found  
  
Life closed it's eyes and said goodbye, now I cry  
But I've got to tell you, I've got my reasons  
'Cause I'm a man, a man for all seasons, alive  
And would I pray what makes the world go round  
I haven't got today, my mind is lost and found  
Do do do do do do do  
  
I'm a man for all seasons [Repeat: x4]
