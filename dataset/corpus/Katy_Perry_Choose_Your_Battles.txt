You are my hurt locker lover  
Keep me walking on a wire  
Don't know when you'll blow  
So I tip toe through your triggered mine  
You fight me but I'm on your side  
Defeated, now retreating  
  
Why you trying to make me your enemy  
All I really need is a little peace  
I just wanna be your lover  
Oh, this is not a competition  
So baby why the ammunition  
I don't wanna be the last one standing  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
Then you win the war  
Stop digging your own grave  
There's so much to live for  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore  
I am not fighting anymore  
  
I try to pick off your red flags  
But dancing up on broken glass  
Your mind games hit like glue names  
Your course just like the Kennedys  
But you somehow get me on my knees, defeated  
Not retreated  
  
Why you trying to make me your enemy  
All I really need is a little peace  
I just wanna be your lover  
Oh, this is not a competition  
So baby why the ammunition  
I don't wanna be the last one standing  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
Then you win the war  
Stop digging your own grave  
Within, so much to live for  
  
Choose your battles, babe  
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore, no  
I am not fighting anymore  
  
If you wanna go, then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby  
I am not fighting anymore  
If you wanna go, then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
I don't wanna fight no more  
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore  
  
If you wanna go, then go  
If you wanna stay then stay  
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby  
  
If you wanna go, then go (choose your battle babe)  
If you wanna stay then stay (then you win the war)  
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby (stop digging your own grave)  
  
If you wanna go, then go (choose your battle babe)  
If you wanna stay then stay (then you win the war)  
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
