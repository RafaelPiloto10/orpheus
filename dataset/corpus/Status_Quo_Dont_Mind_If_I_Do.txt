Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
You don't give a damn  
  
When you are out there on your own  
Saying you can't find your way home  
Do you think you know what is real?  
And do you know what you want from me?  
I'm being the best that I can be  
Now I know nothing feels the same  
  
Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
I'm all in a jam  
I don't lie to you, I don't need to  
I won't cry for you, I don't feel to  
Don't you cry to me, I've seen through you  
You don't give a damn  
  
Can I be honest with you now?  
I'm feeling a fool again somehow  
Maybe I should be moving on.  
  
Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
I'm all in a jam  
I don't lie to you, I don't need to  
I won't cry for you, I don't feel to  
Don't you cry to me, I've seen through you  
You don't give a damn  
  
Take it or leave it seems to be  
The only way open left for me  
Should I be feeling how I feel?  
  
Don't mind if I do, don't mind if I  
Don't care much at all, can't think that much  
I'm climbing the walls, losing my touch  
I'm all in a jam  
I don't lie to you, I don't need to  
I won't cry for you, I don't feel to  
Don't you cry to me, I've seen through you  
You don't give a damn
