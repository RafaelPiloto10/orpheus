Verse 1:  
I'm gonna make you love  
If it's the last thing I do  
I'm gonna make you with  
That there were two of you  
Bridge 1:  
I think you're gonna need help  
'cause I've been saving my love  
For nobody but you  
I'll make you melt  
Like the snow in the summer  
'cause you're blowin' my mind  
I know it's gonna be all better  
When you touch me (oh, oh, give it to me baby)  
Love can't wait, you'll never get away  
Chorus:  
Tearin' it up, tearin' it up  
You were tearin' it up  
Tearin' it up, tearin' it up  
You were tearin' it up  
Verse 1  
Bridge 2:  
Sittin' here checkin' you out  
I know your moves  
And all your grooves  
And there's no doubt  
That you give off a love vibe  
That's all the way live  
It's a woman's prerogative to change her mind  
Hurry up, please stop wastin' time  
Just give up, you'll never get away  
Chaka: I'm gonna make you love me  
Male: girl, I'm gonna make you love me too  
Chaka: I'm gonna make you love me, boy  
Chorus  
I know you can make it,  
Keep holdin' on because times is hard  
It feels so good  
To get close to you, can't give it up  
Let me satisfy your life's desires  
I wanna take you there  
Opportunity knocks with passion and emotion  
Male: I'm gonna make you love me  
Chaka: ooh, say it again and again and again and again  
Male: I'm gonna make you love me if it's the last thing I do  
Chaka: I'm gonna make you wish that there were two of you  
Gonna make you love me, babe, gonna make you love me (7x)  
Gonna make you love me, babe, again and again and a-  
Gonna make you love me, babe, gonna make you love me  
Gonna make you love me, babe, again and again and a-
