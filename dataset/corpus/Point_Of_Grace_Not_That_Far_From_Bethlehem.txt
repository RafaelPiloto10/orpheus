Underneath the stars  
Just a simple man and wife  
Somewhere in the dark  
His words cut the silent night  
Take my hand, for the child  
That you carry is God's own  
And though it seems the road is long  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For in our arms, we'll cherish Him  
We're not that far, from Bethlehem  
Let us celebrate  
As the Christmas's go by  
Learn to live our days  
With our hearts near to the child  
Ever drawn, ever close  
To the only love that lasts  
And though 2000 years have passed  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him  
We're not that far  
We're not that far from Bethlehem  
Where all our hope and joy began  
For when our hearts still cherish Him  
We're not that far  
We're not that far, from Bethlehem
