Some say, I'll be better without you,  
They don't know you like I do,  
Or at least as far as I thought I knew  
I can't bear this time,  
It drags, as I lose my mind  
Reminded by things I find  
I know some clothes you left behind.  
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done  
I won't rise until this battle's won  
My dignity is become undone  
  
But I won't go  
I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,  
If this is ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,  
What if I lose my heart and fail, declined  
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying  
I heard his voice today  
I didn't know a single word he said  
Not one resemblance to the man I met  
Just a vacant broken boy instead  
  
But I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
There will be times, we'll try and give it up  
Bursting at the seams, no doubt  
We almost fall apart and burn to pieces  
So watch them turn to dust  
But nothing will never taint us  
  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
I won't go, I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
Will he, will he still remember me?  
Will he still love me even when he's free  
Or will he go back to the place where  
He will choose the poison over me?  
When we spoke yesterday  
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait  
I'll be home soon, I won't be late  
  
He won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
He's willing to take the risk  
So I won't go, He can't do it on his own,  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk  
  
'Cause he won't go  
He can't do it on his own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
We're willing to take the risk  
I won't go! I can't do it on my own  
If this ain't love, then what is?  
I'm willing to take the risk
