She, she belongs to me  
But she doesn't know it  
She comes walking down the street  
She don't notice me  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb  
  
I'm twisted metal tongue  
When I get around you  
I stutter incomplete  
I can't keep a beat  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb  
  
She comes round my door  
She gets me everytime  
She doesn't even notice me  
When she goes walking by  
  
She, she belongs to me  
But she doesn't know it  
She comes walking down the street  
She don't notice me  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb  
  
And she comes round  
She know how to turn me inside out  
Inside out, upside down  
She's got the bomb
