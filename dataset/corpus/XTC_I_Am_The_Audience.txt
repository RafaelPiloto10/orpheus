I am the audience  
There's no doubt, no consequence  
I could make the morning papers  
If I use my capers  
Let's be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected, as the audience...  
  
Oh I...am the audience  
No doubt, no consequence  
Cause I'm the audience  
  
Let's be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected  
I am the audience  
Breakdown the pretence  
No longer be silent  
Let's turn to violence  
  
I am the audience
