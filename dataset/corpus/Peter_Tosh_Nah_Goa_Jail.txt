Nah Goa Jail  
Said me Nah Goa Jail  
Fe ganja no more  
I'm a Nah Goa Jail  
[Chorus:]  
This here smoke  
That you see me with sir  
I just got it from an officer  
And this here little bit of green sensimilla  
I just got it from an inspector  
He's my friend  
Chorus  
When you see me  
Walking down the street  
It is time that you respect to me  
'Cause from I ever know myself  
I don't know why you always harass me  
Chorus  
I hear one leader say  
If it wasn't for the little sensi  
Him no know what happen to the economy  
I see another leader  
Go in a Half Way Tree  
And he set them ganja prisoners free  
Chorus  
This here spliff that you see me with sir  
I just got it from a priest sir  
And this little bit of brown sensimilla  
I just got it from a minister  
My my my friend  
Chorus  
I been there too many times...  
Too many work to do...
