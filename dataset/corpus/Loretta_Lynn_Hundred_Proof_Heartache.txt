I've got a hundred proof heartache and a case of the blues  
My baby's gone and left me I've lost all I can lose  
I've got a hundred proof heartache my world keeps turning round  
This hundred proof heartache's got me down  
You waded through my tears then said goobye  
You didn't seem to care how much I'd cry  
You made your home the tavern down the street  
And this old heart cries out with every beat  
I've got a hundred proof heartache and a case of the blues  
You're holding someone else tonight I just got the news  
You left a hundred proof heartache for a love that's second hand  
This hundred proof heartache I can't stand  
[ piano - steel ]  
I've got a hundred proof heartache my world keeps turnin' round  
This hundred proof heartache's got me down
