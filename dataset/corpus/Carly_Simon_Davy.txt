Davy, is there a song out there in the night  
For us?  
Davy, is there the kind of smile that you  
Read about?  
There are ghosts who would warn me  
Keep me alone  
Davy, are you the heat I feel in my  
Foolish heart?  
Davy, there's not a day that I haven't prayed  
To feel something so worthy  
For someone like you  
  
Davy, could there be love so bright  
Like to jump off the sea?  
Davy, did I imagine it or did you look at me  
With a look so bold that I had to look away?  
  
But if it feels alright  
If it feels alright and it feels alright  
Davy, Davy, Davy!
