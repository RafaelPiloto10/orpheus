I know all there is to know  
About the cryin' game  
I've had my share  
Of the cryin' game  
First there are kisses  
Then there are sighs  
And then before you know where you are  
You're sayin' goodbye  
One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon  
About the cryin' game  
And if he knows  
Maybe he'll explain  
Why there are heartaches?  
Why there are tears?  
And what to do, to stop feeling blue  
When love disappears  
First there are kisses  
Then there are sighs  
And then before you know where you are  
You're sayin' goodbye  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
Don't want no more  
Of the cryin' game  
No more
