You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Every night when I see your eyes  
You look like no other  
Even though the world has all kinds  
You can find friends and lovers  
  
[Chorus]  
Where have you been all my life?  
Why did you wait so long? (wait so long)  
I've been lookin' every night  
I'll be with you from now on  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
  
If you feel left out in the crowd  
You are not the only  
You can go where the music is loud  
And you won't be so lonely  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Ready to go
