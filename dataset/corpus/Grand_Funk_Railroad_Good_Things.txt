Oh I don't know now baby, just what it is you got.  
But whatever it is now babe, I sure do like it a lot.  
I like all the good things you gave me, baby late last night.  
I like the things you been givin' me, oh mama now you're treatin' me right,
yeah.  
  
Chorus  
Good things, good things, my baby's been treatin' me right.  
Good things, good things happen to me every night.  
  
Come a little bit closer baby, and rub off some of your stuff.  
Until I holler and scream now baby, I just ain't had it enough.  
Ain't had enough of the good things you gave me, baby late last night.  
Ain't had enough of what you're givin' me, oh mama now you're treatin' me
right, yeah.

Chorus  
  
Good things, good things, good things, good things.  
Good things, good things, good things, good things.  
Good things, good things, good things, good things.  
Good things, good things, good things, good things.  
Good things, good things, good things, good things.
