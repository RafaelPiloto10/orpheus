Virginia was a "lot lizard" from F.L.A.  
She had a compound fracture in the "trunk"  
It started when she ran away  
Thumbs out on the interstate  
She hitched a ride to misery  
  
"Mr. Whirly" had a catastrophic incident  
He fell into a city by the bay  
He liquidated his estate  
Now he sleeps upon the Height  
Panhandling misery  
  
He's gonna get high high high  
When he's low low low  
The fire burns from better days  
And she screams why oh why  
I said I don't know  
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday  
Of misery  
  
Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam  
He ran the drug cartel in "Tinseltown"  
They found him in a Cadillac  
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name  
Of misery  
  
Gina hit the road to new york city  
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked  
She stopped in Vegas to elope  
With Virgina and the dope  
And kissed the bride eternally  
  
They're gonna get high high high  
When they're low low low  
The fire burns from better days  
And she screams why oh why  
I said I don't know  
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday  
Of misery  
  
Hell hounds on your trail now once again, boy  
Its groping on your leg until it sleeps  
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow  
Because its not what you make, its what you leave  
  
And we're gonna get high high high  
When we're low low low  
The fire burns from better days  
And she screams why oh why  
I said I don't know  
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday  
Of misery
