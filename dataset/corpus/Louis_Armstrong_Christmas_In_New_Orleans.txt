Magnolia trees at night  
Sparkling bright  
Fields of cotton look wintery white  
When it's Christmas time  
In New Orleans  
  
A barefoot choir in prayer  
Fills the air  
Mississippi folks  
Are gathering there  
When it's Christmas time  
In New Orleans  
  
You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus  
Leading the band  
To a good old Creole beat  
And golly what a spirit  
You can only hear it  
Down on Basin Street  
Your cares will disappear  
When you hear  
Hallelujah St. Nicholas is here  
When it's Christmas time  
In New Orleans  
  
You'll see  
A dixieland Santa Claus  
Leading the band  
To a good old Creole beat  
And golly what a spirit  
You can only hear it  
Down on Basin Street  
Your cares will disappear  
When you hear  
Hallelujah old St. Nicholas is here  
When it's Christmas time  
In New Orleans  
  
When it's Christmas time in  
It's Christmas time in in New Orleans
