The place I love is a million miles away,  
Its too far for the eye to see  
Still its me at least, and you can't come there  
No one is allowed at all  
Only animals that love, will always, only, ever could be  
And its always at the back of my mind.  
The place I love is overgrown now  
With beautiful moss and colorful flowers  
And goldfish that swim in a pool, there's a small brick wall  
  
With neon lighting controlled by lightning  
I'm making a stand against the world  
there's those who would hurt us if they heard.  
  
The place I love is no where near here,  
Not within a mile of those trendy dos,  
Where dogs bodies pick you up, and graciously give you a lift,  
  
With cherished thoughts and bitterness.  
I'm making a stand against the world,  
there's those who would hurt us if they heard  
And that's always in the back of my mind
