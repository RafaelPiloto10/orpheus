Should've listened when you said I'd miss you  
Should've listened but I could not hear  
You said I'd want you back  
I said not a chance  
Now I can see I was so blind  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
I'm sorry now  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know, now I know  
You're right I was wrong  
  
Couldn't see it when I had you with me  
Couldn't see that I had everything  
And now I see it clear  
And you're not here  
You said someday I'd change my mind  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
I'm sorry now  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know, now I know  
You're right I was wrong  
  
If I could have one more chance to hold you  
I would keep you here in my arms  
And never let you go  
Because now I know  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever leave you  
I made a mistake  
I'm sorry now  
  
You're right I was wrong  
To ever let you go  
Now I know, baby now I know  
You're right I was wrong
