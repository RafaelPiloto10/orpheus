Can't keep me down, down  
Can't keep me down  
No you can't keep me down  
I said you can't keep me down  
  
Hey, hey, man! What's your problem?  
I see you tryin' to hurt me bad  
Don't know what you're up against  
Maybe you should reconsider  
Come up with another plan  
Cuz you know I'm not that kinda girl  
That'll lay there and let you come first  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give up  
You can treat me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, down  
  
Can't keep me down, down  
Can't keep me down, down, down  
Can't keep me down, down  
  
Hey, hey, girl! Are you ready for today?  
You got your shield and sword?  
Cuz it's time to play the games  
You are beautiful  
Even though your not for sure  
Don't let him pull you by the skirt  
You're gonna get your feelings hurt  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give up  
You can treat me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, down  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give up  
You can treat me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down  
  
Everywhere that I go  
There's someone waitin' to chain me  
Everything that I say  
There's someone tryin' to short change me  
I am only this way  
Because of what you have made me  
And I'm not gonna break!  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give up  
You can treat me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give  
I won't give up  
You can treat me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, no  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run me over with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give up  
You can treat me like a slave  
I'll go underground (I'll go underground, ground, ground ground..)  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, down (Can't keep me down!!!)
