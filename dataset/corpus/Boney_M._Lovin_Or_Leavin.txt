It's nice to spend the time with you  
I know you've got a lot to go for  
I like the things you say and do  
And yet what do I have to show for  
Nice to pass away  
Then another break of day  
Lovin',  
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'  
I'm for lovin', lovin' or leavin'  
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'  
I said lovin', lovin' or leavin' yeah...  
We play the old familiar game  
Cause life is short, let's keep on movin'  
It's fun alright, but just the same  
There's more to it then all that showed  
All the things come to  
I know it will, and so do you  
Lovin',  
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'  
I said lovin', lovin' or leavin'
