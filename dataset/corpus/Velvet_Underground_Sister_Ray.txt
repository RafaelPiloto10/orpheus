Duck and Sally inside  
They're cooking for the down five  
Who're staring at Miss Rayon  
Who's busy licking up her pig pen  
I'm searching for my mainline  
I said I couldn't hit it sideways  
I said I couldn't hit it sideways  
Oh, just like Sister Ray said  
Live it on  
  
Rosey and Miss Rayon  
They're busy waiting for her booster  
Who just got back from Carolina  
She said she didn't like the weather  
They're busy waiting for her sailor  
Who says he's just as big as ever  
He says he's from Alabama  
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar  
I'm searching for my mainline  
I said I couldn't hit it sideways  
I couldn't hit it sideways  
Oh, just like Sister Ray said  
Play on  
  
Cecil's got his new piece  
He cocks and shoots between three and four  
He aims it at the sailor  
Shoots him down dead on the floor  
Oh, you shouldn't do that  
Don't you know, you'll stain the carpet?  
Now don't you know you'll stain the carpet  
And by the way, have you got a dollar  
Oh, no, man, I haven't got the time time  
Too busy sucking on a ding-dong  
She's busy sucking on my ding-dong  
Oh, she does just like Sister Ray said  
I'm searching for my mainline  
I said I couldn't hit it sideways  
Oh, couldn't, couldn't hit it sideways  
Oh it, it just, just all over the floor, the floor  
  
Now, who's that knocking  
Who's that knocking on my chamber door  
Now could it be the police  
They come to take me for a ride ride  
Oh, but I haven't got the time time  
Hey, hey, hey she's busy sucking on my ding-dong  
She's too busy sucking on my ding-dong  
Oh, now, just like Sister Ray said  
I'm searching for my mainline  
I couldn't hit it sideways  
I couldn't hit it sideways  
Oh, just like
