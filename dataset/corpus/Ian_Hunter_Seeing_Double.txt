Doctor, doctor, am I alright?  
I keep on stayin' up - all through the night  
Smokin', drinkin', watchin' t.v. 'til the light  
  
It's been a long time since I slept  
All I seem to think about is what I ain't yet  
I'm seeing double  
  
Doctor, doctor, am I in need?  
Seems like there's somethin' wrong with me  
Underneath this stone lies a different guy  
  
My head says yeah - my body says no  
I can't seem to get up - I can't seem to go  
  
I'm seeing double  
In the middle of my life - it's just a little strange  
All those people - they're alright - if they'd stop messin' with my brain  
  
I remember when the world was new  
Doctor, doctor, what can you do?  
  
I'm tired of runnin' - give me something to slow down  
Ain't been to bed in over a week  
I can't catch up son sleep - it's playing hide 'n' seek  
I'm seeing double
