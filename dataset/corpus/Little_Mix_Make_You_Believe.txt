Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Down on your knees  
She made you feel like you're worthless  
You just don't deserve this, no no  
How does it feel?  
To think that you gave all you could  
Wish you did but you would  
  
I'll be the ears you talk to  
The doors you walk through  
The arms to hold on to  
You're save with me  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes weren't open  
Trust is broken  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So we'll live longer  
You've lost your faith in love  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Where do you run?  
Who do you turn to, and burn to  
cause you though that she was the one  
She threw it away  
Let's do it nothing with pain  
You won't feel love again  
  
I'll be the ears you talk to  
The doors you walk through  
The arms to hold on to  
You're save with me  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes weren't open  
Trust is broken  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So we'll live longer  
You've lost your faith in love  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
I'll give you the strength that you need to forget  
I'll be the last thing that you would regret  
Make you believe in love again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes weren't open  
Trust is broken  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So we'll live longer  
You've lost your faith in love  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
I'll make you believe  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again
