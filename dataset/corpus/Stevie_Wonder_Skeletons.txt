Skeletons in your closet  
Itchin' to come outside  
Messin' with your conscience  
In a way your face can't hide  
  
Oh things are gettin' real funky  
Down at the old corral  
And it's not the skunks that are stinkin'  
It's the stinkin' lies you tell  
  
What did your mama tell you about lies  
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one  
What did your daddy tell you about lies  
He said one white one turns into a black one  
  
So, it's gettin' ready to blow  
It's gettin' ready to show  
Somebody shot off at the mouth and  
We're gettin' ready to know  
  
It's gettin' ready to drop  
It's gettin' ready to shock  
Somebody done turned up the heater  
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop  
  
Crevices in your pantry  
Now what do we have in here  
Havin' a daytime nightmare  
Has always been your biggest fear  
  
Oh things are gettin' real crucial  
Up the old wazoo  
Yet you cry, why am I the victim?  
When the culprit's why-o-you  
  
What did your mama tell you about lies  
She said it wasn't polite to tell a white one  
What did your daddy tell you about lies  
He said one white one turns into a black one  
  
So, it's gettin' ready to blow  
It's gettin' ready to show  
Somebody shot off at the mouth and  
We're gettin' ready to know  
  
It's gettin' ready to drop  
It's gettin' ready to shock  
Somebody done turned up the heater  
An'a it's gettin' ready to pop  
  
It's gettin' ready to seep  
You're gettin' ready to freak  
Somebody done picked up the talk box  
We're gettin' ready to speak  
  
It's gettin' ready to jive  
You're gettin' ready to gel  
Somebody done gone let the lid off  
We're gettin' ready to smell  
  
They're gettin' ready to deal  
You're gettin' ready to ill  
Somebody done just dropped the big dime  
And they're gettin' ready to squeal  
  
It's gettin' ready to turn  
We're gettin' ready to learn  
Somebody done fired up the brimstone  
And you're gettin' ready to burn  
  
It's gettin' ready to shake  
You're gettin' ready to ache  
Somebody done snitched to the news crew  
And it's gettin' ready to break  
  
You're gettin' ready to lie  
They're gettin' ready to spy  
Somebody's been put on the hot seat  
And you're gettin' ready to fry
