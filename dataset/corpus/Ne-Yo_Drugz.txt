My guitar is jealous of our relationship  
Cause' she don't get half the attention that you get  
Lately, I don't know how it happened  
But it did  
And now, baby now  
All I ever seem to want is...  
  
(CHORUS)  
A kiss, a hug, some sort of affection  
Ooh I need it  
You've become my crutch, a drug  
You're my new addiction  
Gimme my fix, ooh your love is  
(Drugz)Ooh your touch is  
(Drugz)Ooh your kiss is  
(Drugz)Baby you are  
(Drugz)Oooh you're just like drugz  
  
I am not what you would call a crazy chick  
But you've got me on, some of that crazy  
Shiverin...  
Like i'm cold when it's nice and warm  
Sittin' by the phone  
Waiting for you to call  
Cause' it be callin me  
Baby all I need is...  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
I, I, I, I  
Really need a fix  
(oooh, I really need a fix baby)  
I, I, I, I  
Really need a fix  
(won't you come and fix me?)  
I, I, I, I  
Really need a fix  
(I really need a fix)  
I, I, I, I  
Really need a fix  
(won't your come and fix me?)  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
Oooh I need it  
Become My crutch, my drug  
You are my fix, ooooh your love is
