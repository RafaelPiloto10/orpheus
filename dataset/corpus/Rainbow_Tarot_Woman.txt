I don't want to go  
Something tells me no, no, no, no  
But traces in the sand  
The lines that set my hand  
Say go, go, go  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
I'll never return, how do you know?  
Tarot woman  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
She can take you there  
The entrance to the fair  
Mine, mine, mine  
  
Ride the carousel  
And cast a magic spell  
You can fly, fly  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
I'll never return, how do you know?  
Tarot woman, well I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
  
Something in the air  
Tells me to beware, no, no, no  
Her love is like a knife  
She'll carve away your life  
So go, go, go  
  
Beware of a place  
A smile of a bright shining face  
  
I'll never return, how do you know?  
Tarot woman, I don't know  
I don't know  
I don't know  
Hey, I don't know
