I will give you life  
You'll serve only me  
And my will to kill  
You will kill for me  
  
All that I desire  
All that I command  
You are here for me  
I'm your master  
  
My creation  
  
I will make for you  
A soul mate to love  
Unlike your love for me  
And you will take my name  
  
She will be your bride  
She will serve me too  
And I will introduce you to  
The Bride of Frankenstein
