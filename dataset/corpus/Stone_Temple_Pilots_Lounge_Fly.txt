It's ok, it's ok, ok relieve me  
Pins in me, pins in me, in me you kill me  
The lounge fly  
The lounge fly  
The fly you bring me  
I think I'm free but the dogs they  
Won't release me  
  
Don't have a nickel or a dollar but you feed me  
My bottle's empty but you always refuel me  
I feel I'm sinking but you wont let me drown me  
I wanna fuck I wanna fuck but do you need me?  
  
I can't give What I take away And the other understands  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man  
And I can't live this way  
Please refill my soul  
  
(Repeat Above Once, Then Continue Down.)  
  
  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man (x3)  
  
I can't give What I take away And the other understands  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man  
And I can't live this way  
Please refill my soul  
  
  
(Repeat Below until Song is Over)  
She said she'd be my woman She said she'd be my man
