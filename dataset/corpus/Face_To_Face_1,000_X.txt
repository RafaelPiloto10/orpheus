i've tried to ask the question must be a million answers that just aren't
there you try to find yourself i'll try to live my life i just don't care take
a look at your life tell me can you say you've done no wrong? ask yourself the
question do you realize where you belong? i've been down i've been out i've
been there i've been down this road a thousand times nothing ever looks the
same it seems there's something more i might never see
