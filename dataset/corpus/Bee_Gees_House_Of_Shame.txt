First you say you needed me,  
Then you give me sympathy.  
They say good girls never win.  
Something good in giving in.  
How do I get through to you?  
You must be made of stone.  
  
Just when I was safe and sound.  
Love, you built a wall around.  
You take a hard line attitude.  
Time to send me back to school.  
Or take me, take me to your  
  
House of shame,  
Easy on your body when you got no name.  
Hold me like you know me,  
I'm a falling star,  
Catch me if you can,  
Show me the way inside.  
  
You can knock on any door.  
I know what I'm looking for.  
Red light, hit and run.  
Time to turn the engine on.  
Pretty girl lives all alone.  
I must be going home.  
  
Hot as hell and cold as ice.  
Everything I sacrifice.  
I got to pick up on what you do.  
I just can't get over you.  
You take me, take me to your  
  
House of shame,  
Easy on your body when you got no name.  
Hold me like you know me,  
I'm a falling star,  
Catch me if you can,  
Show me the way inside.  
  
Tell me what you really want from life,  
Loving you, darling,  
You got me infatuated,  
Good love is not for sale,  
I nearly gave myself away.  
  
Pretty girl lives all alone,  
Take me to your, take me to your  
House of shame,  
Easy on your body when you got no name.  
Hold me like you know me,  
I'm a falling star,  
Catch me if you can,  
Show me the way inside.
