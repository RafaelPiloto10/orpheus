You go on your way  
I'll go on mine  
Please don't you call me  
Or drop me a line  
  
I'll be better off now  
With somebody new  
And you should find someone  
More suited to you  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Let's fight another round  
  
I couldn't explain it  
I can't tell you why  
I've got such a talent  
For making you cry  
  
And one day you'll thank me  
For saying so long  
For making an end to  
A love that was wrong  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Let's fight another round  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other...
