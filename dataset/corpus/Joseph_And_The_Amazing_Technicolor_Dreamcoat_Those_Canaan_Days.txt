Simeon  
  
Do you remember the good years in Canaan?  
The summers were endlessly gold  
The fields were a patchwork of clover  
The winters were never too cold  
We'd stroll down the boulevards together  
And averything round us was fine  
Jacob  
  
Now the fileds are dead and bare  
No joie de vivre anywhere  
Et maintenant we drink a bitter wine  
Brothers  
  
Those Canaan days we used to know  
Where have they gone, where did they go?  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
To those Canaan days  
Simeon  
  
Do you remember those wonderful parties?  
The splendour of Canaan's cuisine  
Our extravagant, elegant soirees  
The gayest the Bible has seen  
It's funny but since we lost Joseph  
We've gone to the other extreme  
No-one comes to dinner now  
We only eat them anyhow  
I even find I'm missing Joseph's dreams  
  
Brothers  
  
Those Canaan days we used to know  
Where have they gone, where did they go?  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
To those Canaan days  
Simeon  
  
It's funny but since we lost Joseph  
We've gone to the other extreme  
Perhaps we all misjudged the lad  
Perhaps he wasn't quite that bad  
And how we miss his entertaining dreams  
Brothers  
  
Those Canaan days we used to know  
Where have they gone, where did they go?  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
Simeon  
  
To those Canaan days  
Brothers  
  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
To those Canaan days
