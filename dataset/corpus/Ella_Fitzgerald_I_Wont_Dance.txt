I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance madame with you  
My heart won't  
Let me feet do things that they should do  
  
You know what, you're lovely you know what, you're so lovely  
And you know what you do to me  
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore  
I feel so absolutely  
Stumped on the floor  
  
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle  
Especially when you do the Continental  
But this feeling isn't purely mental  
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos  
And that's why I  
Won't dance, why should I?  
  
I won't dance, how could I?  
I won't dance, Merci beau coup  
  
I know  
That music lead the way to romance  
So if I hold you in arms I won't dance  
  
I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance, don't ask me  
I won't dance madame with you  
My heart won't let me feet do things that  
They want to do  
  
You know what, you're so lovely, ring a ding-ding, you're lovely  
And you know what  
You do to me  
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore  
I feel so absolutely stumped on the  
Floor  
  
When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle  
Especially when you do the Continental  
But this feeling isn't purely mental  
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos  
And that's why I won't dance,  
I won't dance  
  
I won't dance, Merci beau coup  
I know that music leads the way to romance  
  
So if I hold  
You in arms I won't dance
