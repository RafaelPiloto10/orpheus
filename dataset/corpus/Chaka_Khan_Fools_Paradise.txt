Fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
People living in the world for material things  
Love has a playful heart  
That's where the hatred starts  
Causin' harm and replacin' the joy true love can bring  
  
Chorus:  
It's just a fool's paradise  
It's just a fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
  
Whoa -  
  
(And you don't know)  
Just like a concrete dream  
Fool's paradise is strange  
People buying time don't seem like a natural thing  
Souls are lost to sea  
Souls that will never be  
Returning to this place of living misery  
  
It's a fool's paradise  
It's just a fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Fool's paradise  
  
(ooh it's just a)  
  
Fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
Whoa -  
  
Souls are lost to sea  
Souls that'll never be  
Returning to this place of living misery  
  
Fool's paradise  
Was it very nice?  
(repeat to fade)
