So long we've been married  
Life's burdens we carried  
Though faith kept us humble and made our love true  
But plans that we make up  
Someone seems to break up  
Oh, darlin', what else can we do?  
  
We may have to leave here  
To find peace of mind, dear  
Someplace where we can live a life of our own  
I know you love me And happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
  
When I go out walkin'  
There's lots of loose talkin'  
They say we're unhappy, and we'll drift apart  
But darlin' it's not true  
Because I still love you  
And I do with all of my heart  
  
They say you are leavin'  
That you are deceivin'  
But you tell me they say the same about me  
Oh, but we'll show them they're wrong  
That loose talk can do harm  
And hope that the truth they will see  
  
We may have to leave here  
To find peace of mind, dear  
Someplace where we can live a life of our own  
I know you love me  
And happy we could be  
If some folks would leave us alone  
If some folks would leave us alone
