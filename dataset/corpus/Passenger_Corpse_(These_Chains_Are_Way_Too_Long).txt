Hey, see you soon  
Sail through your room  
I'll meet you there  
  
Hey, be my friend  
Stay 'til the end  
Don't walk away  
Hey, hey, hey-hey  
  
Hey, take them off  
Don't talk that way  
Don't hear my lover say  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Chains, move that thing  
Chains, we don't see  
My chain's way too long  
Chains  
  
Chains, move that thing  
Chains, we don't see  
Chains are way too long  
And hear my song  
Hear my song
