Feeling good bout the way i am,  
How come you can't just let me be.  
Oh, I've got no use for your master plan,  
No one's running this life but me.  
  
Oh cause i, i have to stand on my own,  
No i can't lean on nobody else.  
'Cause i, i learned a long time ago,  
I've got to keep looking out for myself.  
  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself.  
You keep warning me about the way I'm going,  
But my future's looking just fine.  
And I've got no use for your scary tales,  
  
I'm sure I've got long till i die.  
'Cause my time, you know, it more important to me,  
Then to talk about angels and hell.  
'Cause i, I've read the bible before,  
  
And it keep it right there on the shelf.  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself.  
Yes, I'm feeling real good bout my life right now,  
And I'm sure that for you it's all true.  
  
If it makes you happy, enjoy yourself,  
I'm so glad it's working for you.  
But for me, you know, I've got to stand on my own,  
No, i can't lean on nobody else.  
  
'Cause i, I've learned a long time ago,  
Got to keep looking out for myself.  
And you can keep all that jive to yourself.  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself.  
  
And you can keep all that junk to yourself.
