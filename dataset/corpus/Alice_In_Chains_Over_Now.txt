Yeah, it's over now  
But I can breathe somehow  
When it's all worn out  
I'd rather go without  
  
You know its been on my mind  
Could you stand right there  
Look me straight in the eye and say  
That it's over now  
  
We pay our debt sometime  
  
Well it's over now  
Yet I can see somehow  
When its all gone wrong  
It's hard to be so strong  
  
You know its been on my mind  
Could you stand right there  
Look me straight in the eye and say  
That it's over now  
  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime  
  
Guess it's over now  
I seem alive somehow  
When it's out of sight  
Just wait and do your time  
  
You know its been on my mind  
Could I stand right here  
Look myself in the eye and say  
That it's over now  
  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime
