Hushaby, don' you cry  
Go to sleepy little baby  
  
When you awake you shall have cake  
And all the pretty little horses.  
Blacks and Bays, Dapples and Grays  
Coach, and a six a little horses.  
  
So hushaby, etc.  
  
Way down yonda', down in the medder  
There's a poor little lambie.  
Bees an' the butterflies peckin' out his eyes  
Poor lambie cried fo' his mammy.  
  
But hushaby, etc.
