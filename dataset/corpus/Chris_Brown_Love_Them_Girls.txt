I know why you want love in the middle of the night  
Don't be looking out scary  
When you've been looking for this for long long time  
Come on over here baby you can love me in the dark,  
You can love me in the light  
... Looking out crazy, 'cause you're going on me and we left behind  
They can come to baby  
What's... As long as they're fine,... Can't help it  
Tell them one night the time and they all like...  
  
Chorus:  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
... Once, love me, love me, love me love me love me  
You're looking for the...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
She... Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
  
You can come to daddy, I'll be your lover whatever you lie  
Let me live... Don't you mack me after the next try  
'Cause... And the... In town for one more night  
You ain't the only hear it, so many girls ain't lie going crazy outside.  
  
Chorus:  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
... Once, love me, love me, love me love me love me  
You're looking for the...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
She... Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
  
To the... After... And we can do whatever you tell me  
You smell me,... Come long...  
But when I'm home I'm rambo silvester stalone  
And she know that, pincher... Like...  
Listen the body... Tell em the whole that  
And if you see a...  
  
[Chorus:]
