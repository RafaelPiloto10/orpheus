Everyone's creeping up to the money god,  
Putting tongues where they didn't ought to be.  
On stepping stones of human hearts and souls,  
Into the land of "nothing for free."  
  
Well the way that we're living,  
Is all take and no giving,  
There's nothing to believe in,  
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way,  
To be king for a day.  
  
Everyone's licking up to the new king pin,  
Trying to get way up with a smile.  
Sing for your supper boy and jump to a finger click,  
Ain't my way of living in style.  
  
Cause the ladder gets longer,  
And ambition gets stronger,  
I can't satisfy the hunger,  
That bad old moon has got you in its sway,  
To be king for a day.  
  
You're only here once so you got to get it right.  
(No time to fuss and fight.)  
Cause life don't mean much if measured out with someone else's plight.  
(In time you'll see the light.)  
  
Cause the way that we're living,  
Is all take and no giving,  
There's nothing to believe in,  
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way,  
To be king for a day.
