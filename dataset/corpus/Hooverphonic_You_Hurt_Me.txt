I must have been blind adoring the blues  
In everything lies a small kind of truth  
But than again,  
Just when I thought you were staying for good  
You left for no reason, was that all you could  
You're still a man  
  
It's not what I want  
It's not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her, oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
We live in denial, adoring what's new  
In everything lies a small kind of blues  
But than again,  
Just when I thought you were leaving for good  
You stayed for no reason although we were through  
You're still a man  
  
It's not what I want  
It's not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her, oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
But then again,  
It's not what I want  
It's not what I need  
Nothing but lies and way too much heat  
Just when I thought you were telling the truth  
I caught you with her, oh you fool  
  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
An' everytime again,  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
Everytime again,  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give  
  
But then again,  
You hurt me  
When I've got so much more to give
