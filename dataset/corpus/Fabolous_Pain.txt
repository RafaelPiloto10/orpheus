[Fabolous]  
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a f-ck  
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck  
If you're cool being taken down and giving up  
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!  
I done felt pain, waited but no help came  
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane  
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain  
Ever been told "go to hell" and felt flames  
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper  
It's all down hill and it only gets steeper  
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper  
  
It cost to be the boss, it aint get no cheaper  
But there's a man above that we all under bro  
No bread truck but he work wonders though!  
After you wake up, everything is wonderful  
You can overcome anything you undergo  
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture  
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you  
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses  
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches  
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses  
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches  
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?  
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious  
So I sold weed and crack, business  
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious  
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses  
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness  
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business  
Beef is only good when you in the burger business  
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal  
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will  
But for real you loaded up to kill  
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will  
And I don't owe these niggas nothing  
Put that in a nigga will
