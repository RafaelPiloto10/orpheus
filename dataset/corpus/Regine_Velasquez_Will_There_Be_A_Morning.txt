Will there really be A morning

Will there really be a morning  
When the night is gone  
Will there be a dawn  
To greet me urge me to go on  
Is there no home for me  
To even love again  
  
Will there really be a morning  
Or is this the end  
Will there really be a sunrise when  
The darkness dies  
Will the strength to last'll be there  
To fight the fears inside  
The nights are so endless  
Endless as it seems  
  
Will there really be a morning or  
Is this a dream  
Days have come and days have passed  
I wish the morning stayed  
I pray that they would last  
For in those mornings I  
Could see what it meant to be free  
Will there really be light again  
When this tunnel fades  
Will I reach out and touch it  
Ir will I be afraid  
I just hoped that  
I'll still be there just that  
I may see  
Will there really be a morning to  
Come for me  
For in those mornings  
I could see what it meant  
To be free  
  
Will there really be a morning to  
Come for me
