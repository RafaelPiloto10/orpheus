If you really knew how many times I've tried to help you  
Make your mind up in the matters of the heart, you'd not be bothered  
By the miscues or the bad trips that seem to come and plague us  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
I was stone cold sober, it was daylight in October  
When you reached across the table put your hand upon my shoulder  
And my lips were warm with kissing while we found the missing pieces  
To all the empty spaces I sure would like to talk that way again  
  
We have soared above the clouds, we've heard the angels breathing  
While we made love in the morning, there was never talk of leaving  
We would lie that way for hours with our arms around each other  
It was all so easy, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
'Cause I'm stone cold sober, the daylight has crossed over  
In the night, a touch of sadness  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I was stone cold sober when I woke the morning after  
Having shattered the illusions of the object of my passions  
With a will made out of iron and a mind that is her own  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to her again  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I hope that we can see each other often  
That our points of view will blend into each other,  
Like the sea and the horizon  
And the sun will shine upon us as we live our lives forever  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again
