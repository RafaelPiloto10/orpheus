Well I look out the window and what do I see  
The breeze is a blowin' the leaves from the trees everything is free
everything but me  
I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger  
And throw it just as far as I can slinger cause I want to be free  
  
When my baby left me everything died  
But a little bluebird was singin' just outside singin' twidle-de-dee fly away
with me  
Well you know I think I'm a gonna live gotta lotta love left in me to give  
So I want to be free  
  
I released my heart my soul and my mind and I'm a feelin' fine  
I broke the chains the ring of gold before it broke my mind  
Well look who's cryin' and it ain't me but I can't hardly hear and I can't
have see  
Oh I want to be free  
  
I released my heart my soul...  
Do I want to be free yeah I want to be free free
