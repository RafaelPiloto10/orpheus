Someone told me long ago  
There's a calm before the storm  
I know  
It's been comin' for some time  
When it's over, so they say  
It'll rain a sunny day  
I know  
Shinin' down like water  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?  
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain  
Comin' down on a sunny day?  
  
Yesterday, and days before  
Sun is cold and rain is hard  
I know  
Been that way for all my time  
Till forever, on it goes  
Through the circle, fast and slow  
I know  
It can't stop, I wonder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]
