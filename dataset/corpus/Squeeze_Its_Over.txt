Hey wait a minute  
That's not right  
I didn't want this to cause a fight  
All I'm saying is  
Nothing new  
Listen to me, believe it's true  
What's there to hide, it baffles me  
Throw out those thoughts of jealousy  
So don't you cry and hold your head  
It's over  
So wait a minute  
Let me explain  
Out of the blue she called again  
To offer me  
A peaceful meal  
So we can talk see how we feel  
It's nothing more than face to face  
So trust in me I know my place  
I know it's hard to let me go  
It's over  
All over  
  
Have confidence  
Have faith  
There is no attraction there  
And believe me  
This way  
I can wash her from my hair  
  
Hey wait a minute  
What's going on  
I'm coming home where I belong  
It's nothing more than face to face  
Give me the time to pack my case  
I know it's hard to let me go  
It's over  
  
What's there to hide it baffles me  
Why should you waste your energy  
But I won't leave if you're not sure  
It's over  
It's all over
