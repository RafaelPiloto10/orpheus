Gather 'round me, everybody  
Gather 'round me while I preach some  
Feel a sermon comin' on me  
The topic will be sin  
And that's what I'm agin  
If you want to hear my story  
Then settle back and just sit tight  
While I start reviewing  
The attitude of doing right  
  
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive  
E-lim-i-nate the negative  
And latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister inbetween  
  
You got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom down to the minimum  
Have faith, or pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate my last remark  
Jonah in the whale  
Noah in the ark,  
What did they do  
Just when everything looked so dark?  
Man, they said, we better  
  
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive  
E-lim-i-nate the negative  
And latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister inbetween  
Don't, don't mess with mister inbetween  
  
To illustrate my last remark

E-lim-i-nate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister inbetween  
No don't mess with mister inbetween
