I love you  
It's murder  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But don't like  
The other one  
You don't know  
But you don't want to  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But don't like  
The other one  
You don't know  
But you don't want to  
  
I love you  
It's pointless  
In my soul  
If I live or die  
This life  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But don't like  
The other one  
You don't know  
But you don't want to  
  
I have two faces  
One of which you know  
The other one  
For your sake  
I never would show  
  
It's just because I love you  
I cannot bear to be around you  
And if only one or the other  
Of us would drop down dead  
  
I am, I am...
