Cold as steel the darkness waits, it's hour will come  
A cry of fear for the chosen worshipping the sun  
Mother natures black revenge on those who waste her life  
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice  
  
[Chorus]  
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires  
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires  
Sunrise is gone, Sunrise is gone  
  
Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes  
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly  
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas there's nowhere left to run  
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Around the world the nations wait  
For some wise words from their leading light  
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools  
"Is this the end" the millions cried  
Clutching their riches as they died  
Those who survive must weather the storm  
  
Gone are the days when man looked down  
They've taken away his sacred crown  
To be so free, it took so long  
It's not the journeys end, it's just begun
