The fact that you think you can  
Speak to me the way you do  
Bleeds me to believe that you  
Never stepped out of the  
Skin you live within, but when  
And if this day occurs  
Your tongue the taste will imitate  
A battery the anti-equilibrius  
Your stomach becomes the floor  
  
The look on your face was priceless  
  
A light goes on upstairs  
The attic ablaze  
This island isn't big enough  
For both of us who will swim  
In ell infested oceans  
Kiss the sand goodbye because  
The tide is coming up and in  
Ya water water water everywhere  
And every chance to sink  
  
Its an amalgamation of the things  
You aren't the ways you wish you were  
A split second perceiving of the way  
You really look to everyone of them  
I wish that you could get a glimpse  
I wish that you could see because  
  
The look on your face was priceless!
