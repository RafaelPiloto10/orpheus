I would have waited forever  
If I'd known that you'd be here  
We could have shared our lives together  
And held each other close all through the years  
But I've met someone before you  
And my heart just couldn't wait  
So no matter how much I adore you  
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made  
  
[Chorus]  
Where were you  
When I could have loved you  
Where were you  
When I gave my heart away  
All my life I've been dreaming of you  
You came along one promise too late  
You came along one promise too late  
  
I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you  
I can't have you but I never will forget you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
