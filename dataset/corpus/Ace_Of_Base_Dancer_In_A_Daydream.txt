What an odd situation  
What you got is basic emotions  
Can you feel them  
I want to be your lover  
But you're so shy  
What you need is perfect assistance  
Let me guide you  
To a land you're never seen before  
  
I guess you see  
I have another daydream  
I guess you see  
That I have another daydream  
  
Come and be a dancer  
Dance into my daydream  
Join me in my daydream wet and wild  
  
Come and be a dancer  
Dance into my daydream  
Join me in my jungle wet and wild  
  
To help another person  
Will make you feel important  
You got my invitation  
But you're so shy  
Come and let your wild side show  
And be a dancer  
A dancer in a daydream we can share  
  
I guess you see  
  
Help me take control  
Of my full imagination  
I'm looking for a man  
Who will watch my situation  
I'm thinking about the people  
Waiting down the line  
I am the limelight now's my time  
  
I guess you see  
  
What you gonna do I'm a bold explosion
