Armalite, street lights, nightsights  
Searching the roofs for a sniper, a viper, a fighter  
Death in the shadows he'll maim you, he'll wound you, he'll kill you  
For a long forgotten cause, on not so foreign shores  
Boys baptised in wars  
Morphine, chill scream, bad dream  
Serving as numbers on dogtags, flakrags, sandbags  
Your girl has married your best friend, loves end, poison pen  
Your flesh will always creep, tossing turning sleep  
The wounds that burn so deep  
Your mother sits on the edge of the world  
When the cameras start to roll  
Panoramic viewpoint resurrect the killing fold  
Your father drains another beer, he's one of the few that cares  
Crawling behind a Saracen's hull from the safety of his living room chair  
Forgotten sons, forgotten sons, forgotten sons  
And so as I patrol in the valley of the shadow of the tricolour  
I must fear evil, for I am but mortal and mortals can only die  
Asking questions, pleading answers from the nameless faceless watchers  
That stalk the carpeted corridors of Whitehall  
Who orders desecration, mutilation, verbal masturbation  
I in the guarded bureaucratic wombs  
Minister, minister care for your children, order them not into damnation  
To eliminate those who would trespass against you  
For whose is the kingdom, the power, the glory forever and ever, Amen  
Halt who goes there, Death, approach friend  
You're just another coffin on its way down the emerald aisle  
When your children's stony glances mourn your death in a terrorist's smile  
The bomber's arm placing fiery gifts on the supermarket shelves  
Alley sings with shrapnel detonate a temporary hell  
Forgotten Sons  
From the dole queue to the regiment a profession in a flash  
But remember Monday signings when from door to door you dash  
On the news a nation mourns you unknown soldier, count the cost  
For a second you'll be famous but labeled posthumous  
Forgotten sons, forgotten sons  
Peace on earth and mercy mild, Mother Brown has lost her child  
Just another Forgotten Son
