I feel a hot wind on my shoulder  
And the touch of a world that is older  
I turn the switch and check the number  
I leave it on when in bed I slumber  
I hear the rhythms of the music  
I buy the product and never use it  
I hear the talking of the dj  
Can't understand just what does he say?  
  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
  
I dial it in and tune the station  
They talk about the you. S. Inflation  
I understand just a little  
No comprende, it's a riddle  
  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
  
I wish I was in Tijuana  
Eating barbequed iguana  
I'd take requests on the telephone  
I'm on a wavelength far from home  
I feel a hot wind on my shoulder  
I dial it in from south of the border  
I hear the talking of the dj  
Can't understand just what does he say?  
  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
  
Radio radio...  
What does he say?
