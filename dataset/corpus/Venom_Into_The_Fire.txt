Sleepless nights,drenched in sweat.  
A lust for life,endless death.  
  
We're dancing in the fire,  
We're lost in the Flame.  
We're lost in the Fire,  
Nothing stays the same!  
  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
  
Day to night,night to day,  
Lost in dreams,that fade away!  
  
Into the fire,  
We're dancing in the flame!  
We're lost in the fire,  
Well nothing stays the same!  
  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
  
In the night,alone and dark,deep within the source,  
Tourtured feel the flames of Hell, rising to the cause!  
  
Onbe,two,three,four!  
  
All my life,drenched in pain!  
All my needs,all the same.  
  
We're dancing in the fire,  
We're lost in the falme.  
Dancing in the fire,  
Well nothing stays the same!  
  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!
