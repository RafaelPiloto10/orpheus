What you gonna do? Time's caught up with you  
Now you wait your turn, you know there's no return  
  
Take your written rules, you join the other fools  
Turn to something new, now it's killing you  
First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm  
Disillusioning, you push the needle in  
From life you escape, reality's that way  
Colours in your mind satisfy your time  
  
You're having a good time  
But that won't last  
You make a fool of things  
You're living too fast  
Go on and destroy yourself  
Don't bottle it in  
You need someone to help you  
To put the needle in, yeah  
  
Now you know the scene, your skin starts turning green  
Your eyes no longer see life's reality  
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin  
  
Head starts spinning 'round, you fall down to the ground  
Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave  
It's too late to turn, you don't want to learn  
Price of life it's high, now you're gonna die!
