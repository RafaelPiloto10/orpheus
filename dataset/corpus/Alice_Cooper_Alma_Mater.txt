Rain is falling down my cheek  
Searching for the sea  
Tomorrow, like the rain  
I'll be back home again  
  
I watch, the bus  
As it pulls out of view  
Someday like that bus  
I will be leaving too  
  
But you know  
It breaks my heart  
To leave you  
Camelback  
My high school  
  
And now, alone  
Crying in my beer  
Cause old friends said goodbye  
I guess I'll be leaving too  
  
But you know  
It breaks my heart  
To leave you  
Cortez  
I'll miss you  
  
Yes I will  
Yes I will  
You know I will  
Yes I will  
Yes I will  
You know I will  
  
Well so long, so long  
Everybody, everybody  
I hope that I would see you again, again  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Everybody, everybody  
I finally grew up  
They finally let me out of school  
  
Hey, remember the time, 'member the time  
We took that snake  
And put down little Betsy's dress?  
Now I don't think Miss Axelrod  
Was much impressed  
No I don't think Miss Axelrod  
Was much impressed  
Well I don't think Miss Axelrod  
Was much impressed  
  
Oh, goodbye  
Everybody  
I hope that I would see you again  
So long  
Everybody  
How do you like that  
They finally let me out of school  
Goodbye  
Ah, I want to get out of here  
They let me out of school  
How 'bout that, uh?  
Goodbye  
Hey, goodbye, guys  
Maybe I'll see  
Maybe I'll see you around some time, uh?  
Hey, don't make a stranger of yourself, uh?  
Remember the Coop, uh?  
May, I ho  
I hope you don't forget me or nothing  
Goodbye
