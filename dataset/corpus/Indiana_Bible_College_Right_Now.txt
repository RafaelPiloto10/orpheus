[Verse:]  
Here we are we're gathered here right now We're assembled in one accord  
The Spirit's movin' and He's ready to bless Liberty is knocking at our door  
  
But some of you are still holdin' back some are weary and heavy laden  
But God is still here knocking at your door So, go ahead and let Him in  
  
[Chorus:]  
Right now Someone needs a blessing You've been waiting much too long,  
Too long Right now God is here among us somebody call out His name Jesus  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When I consider all the things that He's made And how the heavens He formed  
  
How He died for me, to give me life And how I'm not a slave to sin anymore  
How can I just sit right here, knowing all of these things  
So, I'm gonna clap my hands and do my dance And let God have His way  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
[Tag] 4x  
Somebody ought to Praise Him  
We've got a right to Lift Him up
