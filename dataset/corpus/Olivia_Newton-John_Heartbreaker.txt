And there's no need to tell me I'm just wasting time  
But if you tell me break it slowly  
I'm in deep water and I'm hanging on a line  
And you're the only one can save me  
But if you gotta go  
I think you better know  
  
Oh, heartbreaker, if you want to leave  
I won't make you stay  
If you want to go, better go away  
Oh, you loser, offered you a love  
You refused her  
What you gonna do when she goes away  
  
I know the memories melt their pictures in my mind  
Too bad to see they could be fading  
But I'll come home to you  
If someday you should find  
You want me back then I'll be waiting  
But if you gotta go  
I think you better know  
  
Oh, heartbreaker, if you want to leave  
I won't make you stay  
If you want to go, better go away  
Oh, you loser, offered you a love  
You refused her  
What you gonna do when she goes away  
  
Um, heartbreaker, if you want to leave  
I won't make you stay  
If you want to go, better go away  
Oh, you loser, offered you a love  
And you refused her  
What you gonna do when she goes away  
Oh, what you gonna do when she goes away
