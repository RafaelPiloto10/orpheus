I know that its over I hate when its over,  
The more I think about you the more I want to call  
(I think I'll call)  
  
Now that you see me can you belive me,  
Why do you look so scared,  
(please don't cry)  
  
I don't know if I can live without you  
(what is left of me without you)  
  
I don't know if I am free without you  
(how can I obsess without you!)  
  
The more I think of you the more it intenceifies my heart,  
Hideing in a sea of lies,  
Once I swore I die for you now I'm not so sure,  
(I don't think you are real enymore)  
  
I can't change you,  
(you can't change me)  
  
Now we'are through  
  
I don't if can live without you  
(what is left of me without you)  
  
I don't know if I am free without you  
(how can I obsess without you)  
  
She's gone, what is left of me without you (how can I obsess without you)  
She's gone, what is left of me without you (how can I obsess without you)  
She's gone, what is left of me without you (how can I obsess without you)  
  
She's gone!!!!! (without you)
