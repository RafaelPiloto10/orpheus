I Love Your Breasts The Way They Are  
(I Love You Just The Way You Are-Billy Joel)  
  
Don't go padding your bra to please me  
You never had much chest before mmmm  
And don't imagine your hoots is Jewed-ah  
'cuz I don't need a whole lot more  
  
Oh You'd probably leave me if they were bigger  
Your bust would keep me from your heart mmmmm  
I'd miss the good times. I love the flat times  
I love your breasts the way they are  
  
I need to know that you will always wear  
A trainer a-cup 32  
Oh  
How could you think that they're not pleasing me  
The way that I've been squeezing you  
  
Woah, I don't want heaving mounds of cleavage  
I never want to work that hard  
Ohhhh  
I just want something that I can fondle  
I love your breasts the way they are  
Ohhhhhhh
