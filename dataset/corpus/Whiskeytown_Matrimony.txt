Well I'm saving this dress for my wedding day  
Momma wouldn't have it any other way  
She says when she married  
Her waist was twenty three  
  
I guess I'll never wear it anyway  
I don't believe I care to marry  
Though I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
  
Matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die  
I'm saving all my money for my wedding day  
You know my momma wouldn't have it any other way  
  
She says when she married  
She didn't have a dime  
But I guess I'll spend that money some other way  
Because I don't believe I care to marry  
  
Although I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
That matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die  
  
Well I'm saving my best thing for my wedding day  
Because my poppa wouldn't have it any other way  
He says if I lose it early  
I'll have thrown my life away  
  
But I swear I'll use my cherry my own way  
I don't believe I care to marry  
Though I cannot explain exactly why  
It somehow seems to me  
  
Matrimony is misery  
Simply a faster way to die
