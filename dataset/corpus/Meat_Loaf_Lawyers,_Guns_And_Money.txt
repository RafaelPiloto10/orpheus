Well, I went home with the waitress  
You know the way I always do  
Well how was I to know  
She was with the Russians, too  
I was gambling in Havana  
You know I took a little risk  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Daddy, won't you get me out of this  
I'm an innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck  
Between a rock and a hard place  
And I'm down on my luck  
Oh yea, I'm down on my luck  
Oh yea, I'm down on my luck  
Oh baby, I'm down on my luck  
I'm so far down, I don't think I'll ever get up  
If it weren't for bad luck  
Oh if it weren't for bad luck  
I wouldn't have no luck at all  
Now I'm stranded in Honduras  
I'm a desperate man  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Get me out of this  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
You know the shit has hit the fan
