On a day like today  
We pass the time away  
Writing love letters in the sand  
  
How you laughed when i cried  
Each time i saw the tide  
Take our love letters from the sand  
  
You made a vow that you would ever be true  
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you  
  
Now my broken heart aches  
With every wave that breaks  
Over love letters in the sand  
  
Now my broken heart aches  
With every wave that breaks  
Over love letters in the sand
