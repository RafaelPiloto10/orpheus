Somewhere tonight, there's somebody cryin'  
And feelin' completely alone  
Somewhere tonight, there's somebody tryin'  
To find a way back home  
  
Mmm-mm I don't know why  
Mmm-mm but sometimes angels can't fly  
  
How many times have you judged a stranger  
Shakin' your head in shame  
And wondered how could they fall so far  
Well maybe they're not to blame  
  
Mmm-mm I don't know why  
Mmm-mm but sometimes angels can't fly  
  
They've got their wings and they've got their will  
There's blue sky all around  
But sometimes it seems that we're destined to be  
Forever on the ground  
  
I don't know why, no  
  
Look at us runnin' around in circles  
Chasin' our peace of mind  
Searchin' in vain for our wayward halos  
That some of us never find  
  
Mmm-mm I don't know why  
Mmm-mm sometimes angels can't fly  
Mmm and I don't know why  
Mmm sometimes angels can't fly  
Mmm
