Ooooh, babe  
Don't leave me now.  
Don't say it's the end of the road.  
Remember the flowers I sent.  
  
I need you, babe  
To put through the shredder  
In front of my friends  
Ooooh babe.  
  
Don't leave me now.  
How could you go?  
When you know how I need you  
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night  
Ooooh babe, don't leave me now.  
  
How can you treat me this way?  
Running away.  
Ooooh babe,  
Why are you running away?  
Oooooh babe!
