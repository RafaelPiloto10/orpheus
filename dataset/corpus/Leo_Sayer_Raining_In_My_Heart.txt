The sun is out, the sky is blue  
There's not a cloud to spoil the view  
But it's raining  
Raining in my heart  
  
The weatherman says fine today  
He doesn't know that you've gone away  
And it's raining  
Raining in my heart  
  
Aww, aww misery, aww misery  
Aww what's gonna become of me oh woe  
I tell myself, my blues won't show but I know  
That soon all my tears will flow come a  
Raining down, raining in my heart  
  
Aww oh aww misery, oh you misery  
Aww, what's gonna become of me woah  
  
The sun is out, the sky is blue  
There's not a cloud to spoil the view  
But it's raining, oh it's raining in my heart
