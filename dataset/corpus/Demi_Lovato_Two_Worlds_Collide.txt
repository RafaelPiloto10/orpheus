She was given the world  
So much that she couldn't see  
And she needed someone to show her,  
Who she could be.  
And she tried to survive  
Wearing her heart on her sleeve  
And I needed you to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
You had your dreams, I had mine.  
You had your fears, I was fine.  
You showed me what I couldn't find,  
When two different worlds collide.  
  
She was scared of it all, watching from far away.  
She was given a role, never knew just when to play.  
And she tried to survive  
Living her life on her own  
Always afraid of the throne  
You give me strength to find hope.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was scared  
Unprepared.  
Lost in the dark.  
Falling apart,  
I can survive,  
With you by my side.  
We're gonna be alright.  
This is what happens when two worlds collide.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You had your fears, I was fine.  
You showed me what I couldn't find,  
When two different worlds collide.  
When two different worlds collide.
