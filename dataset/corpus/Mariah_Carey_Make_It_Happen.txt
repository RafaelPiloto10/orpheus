Not more than three short years ago  
I was abandoned and alone  
Without a penny to my name  
So very young and so afraid  
No proper shoes upon my feet  
Sometimes I couldn't even eat  
I often cried myself to sleep  
But still I had to keep on going  
Never knowing if I could take it  
If I would make it through the night  
I held on to my faith  
I struggled and I prayed  
And now I've found my way  
  
If you believe in yourself enough  
And know what you want  
You're gonna make it happen  
(Make it happen)  
And if you get down on your  
knees at night  
And pray to the lord  
He's gonna make it happen  
(Make it happen)  
  
I know life can be so tough  
And you feel like giving up  
But you must be strong  
Baby just hold on  
You'll never find the answers  
if you throw your life away  
I used to feel the way you do  
Still I have to keep going  
Never knowing if I could take it  
If I would make it through the night  
I held on to my faith  
I struggled and I prayed  
And now I've finally found my way  
  
If you believe in yourself enough  
And know what you want  
You're gonna make it happen  
(Make it happen)  
And if you get down on your  
knees at night  
And pray to the lord  
He's gonna make it happen  
(Make it happen)  
  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
I got my feet on solid ground  
Thank you Lord  
If you believe within your soul  
Just hold on tight  
And don't let go  
You can make it happen  
(Make it happen)  
  
If you believe in yourself enough  
And know what you want  
You're gonna make it happen  
(Make it happen)  
And if you get down on your  
knees at night  
And pray to the lord  
He's gonna make it happen  
(Make it happen)
