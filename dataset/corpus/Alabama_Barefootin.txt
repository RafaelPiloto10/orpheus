Everybody get on your feet you make me nervous when you're in your seat  
Take off your shoes and pat your feet we're doin' a dance that can't be beat  
We're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'  
Went to a party the other night long tall Sally was out of sight  
Threw 'way her wig and her high sneakers too she's doing a dance without any
shoes  
She's barefootin' she's barefootin' she's barefootin' she's barefootin'  
Hey little girl with your red dress on bet you can barefoot all night long  
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away come back and get 'em another day  
We're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'  
Everybody be barefootin' take your shoes off  
Little John Henry he said to Sue if I barefoot would you barefoot too  
Sue told John I'll stir your stew I was barefootin' ever since I was two  
I'm barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'  
Barefootin' we're barefootin' don't have no shoes on we're barefootin'  
We're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'
