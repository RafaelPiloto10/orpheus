You want to know why you feel so hollow?  
Because you are.  
You're missing out? Well if you say so  
Then you're missing out  
  
Everybody knows that you are insane  
You want to know just how long you can hide from what you are?  
Not very long  
I have been lost. Down every road I follow out in the dark  
On my way home  
  
But I feel nothing. Am I better yet?  
  
Everybody knows that you are insane
