I fell in love with Rinfy the gypsy.  
He said when I grew up he'd marry me,  
Carry me away on his steed.  
  
"Don't worry, my baby!  
Don't die, my funny little darling!  
I'm going away for a little while,  
And shouldn't be gone for very long. "  
  
Ooh, then I really fell for Geoffrey, our gardener.  
He said he'd marry me, too.  
Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool.  
  
"Don't worry, my honey!  
Don't die, my funny little doll!  
I'm going away for a little while.  
Shouldn't be gone for very long. "  
(Ooh, long, long, long...)  
  
Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,  
Playing canasta in cold rooms,  
Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,  
And in my lover's... Ooh...  
  
I met a boy who took me upstairs,  
Then took me in his arms  
And told me I comforted him, uh-huh.  
  
"Don't worry, my dear,  
Don't cry, you weird little stranger.  
I'm going away.  
You probably won't ever see me again. "  
  
Oh, yes, I know, I'm always falling,  
Gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes.  
How could I not lie there with you?  
  
"Don't worry, my darling!  
Don't die, my silly little baby!  
I'm going away for a little while,  
And shouldn't be gone for very long. "  
(Ooh, long, long, long!)  
  
Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,  
Playing canasta in cold rooms,  
Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,  
And in my lover's... Ooh...
