When I get to the bottom  
I go back to the top of the slide  
An' I stop, an' I turn, an' I go for a ride  
'Til I get to the bottom  
An' I see you again  
Yeah  
  
Do you, don't you, want me to love you?  
I'm comin' down fast, but I'm miles above you  
Tell me, tell me, tell me  
Come on, tell me the answer  
Well, you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Lookout  
  
Helter Skelter  
Helter Skelter  
Helter Skelter, Yeaah  
  
Will you, won't you, want me to make you?  
I'm comin' down fast  
But don't let me break you  
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter Skelter  
Helter Skelter  
Helter Skelter  
Lookout  
  
When I get to the bottom  
I go back to the top of the slide  
An' I stop, an' I turn, an' I go for a ride  
Til I get to the bottom  
An' I see you again  
Yeah  
  
Do you, don't you, want me to make you?  
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you  
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer  
Well, you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter Skelter  
Helter Skelter  
Helter Skelter  
  
Helter Skelter, Yeah
