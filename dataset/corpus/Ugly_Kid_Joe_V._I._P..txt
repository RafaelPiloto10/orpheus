Shut up, talking out your ass  
With your fake-ass grin and your backstage pass  
Front row at every single show  
But your heart's in the wrong place  
  
It's in the rat race  
I don't know what you're trying to prove  
Always fucking at my band  
When we're laying down a fat groove  
  
I got no jealously not towards security  
Why are you always bringing me  
Stay the fuck away from me  
I'm talking to you V.I.P.  
  
I'm talking to you  
I know the power you possess  
Playing cool rock for the all access  
Big which, it's jealousy  
  
I see that your heart's in the wrong place  
You can't follow me  
I don't know why you're kissing my ass  
Cause as soon as I turn my back you start stabbin'  
  
I'm reality, you can't just even bother me  
I'm the one they came to see  
Stay the fuck away from me  
I'm talking to you V.I.P.
