Here we are, now where are we?  
It's like nothing I've ever seen we got hoarse-throated huckster's whispered
gimmicks  
Rubbernecking the curious cynics and headlong-walkers,  
One born every minute do I plug it in? or do I stick it in?  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't think I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the  
Verge  
  
Here we are, now who are you? the long lost queen's of some hoodoo?  
Well we're the last of the big-time penetrators playin'  
Dead to fuck the undertaker the movie'll come out a little bit later the men,  
The legend, the goat, the satyr  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't say I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the verge  
  
Here we are, now don't ask how the time to leave was kind now well don't cry,  
Baby, there's no cause for grief  
  
Deadheading's never gonna kill the chief it's an empty road without relief  
And I'm a highway romance milking thief  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't think I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the verge
