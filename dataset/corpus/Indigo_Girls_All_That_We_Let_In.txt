A hard knock  
A cold clock  
Ticking off my time  
A long look  
But no luck  
Couldn't seem to find  
Or unwind  
Into peace of mind  
Though I was trying  
  
A quick glance  
A big chance  
My heart beat like a drum  
I saw you  
And I knew  
Chances just don't come  
Round again  
Not like this  
First a laugh  
Then the kiss  
  
And I'm free in you  
I've got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
  
The lost time  
The self crime  
My big mistakes  
The clear voice  
Of bad choice  
Sounding like an ache  
In my day  
Not too bad  
But too real  
To go away  
  
But now I'm free in you  
I got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
  
And I don't know  
How you show  
Such gentle disregard  
For the ugly in me  
That I see  
That for so long  
I took so hard  
(i took so hard)  
But I truly believe  
(i truly believe)  
That you see the best in me  
(that you see the best in me)  
I'm enough  
For your love  
(enough for your love)  
And the thought  
Sets me free  
(and I'm free)  
Free in you  
Got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
Yes I'm free  
In you
