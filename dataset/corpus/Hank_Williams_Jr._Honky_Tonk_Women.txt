I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis  
I tried to take her upstairs for a ride  
I had to heave her right across my shoulder  
I just don't seem to drink you off my mind  
  
Honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris  
As naked as the day that I will die  
  
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris  
They just don't seem to sail you off my mind  
  
It's a honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
