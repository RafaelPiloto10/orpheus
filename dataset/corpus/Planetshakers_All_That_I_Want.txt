My soul sings  
To my Saviour King of Kings  
I need You  
You are everything to me  
I love You  
So much more than anything  
I'll live for You  
Jesus You are everything  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I need  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I live for in this world  
(Repeat)  
Jesus  
You are all I need  
Jesus  
You are everything
