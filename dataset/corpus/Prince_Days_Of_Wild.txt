(Hold... hold... hold onto your wits!)  
  
Break down  
This is a bust (Hold onto your wits!)  
All you sorry motherfuckers up against the wall  
If you don't play, bite the dust  
Cause in a couple of simple fuckin' phrases  
I'm gonna hip you to the fuckin' place of  
The brand new mad style, uh  
Cause these are the days of wild - hit me!  
  
[Repeat: 2X]  
(Hold onto your wits!)  
  
Pop guns and weed?  
Brother please!  
We're to wise for now, since the other 90's was better suited for that biz  
Back when Dick was fuckin' Liz  
Before soda pop had fizz  
Don't blame it on a jockstrap full of jizz  
Mentality so insane  
I got a Tech-9 to and it's called my brain  
Shoot another brother? Not today  
Death from envy is the only way  
Here I can tear shit up 'cause that's my style  
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild  
  
Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so  
I only knew one and never told her though  
I thought about many times (Diss me?)  
But that's the kind of shit that make you check your mind  
Is your blood type the type that flows  
Or is your blood type the type just stereo?  
A woman every day should be thanked  
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked  
And if a woman ever said I did  
Uh, she's a motherfuckin' liar and I'm a set-up kid  
And I can tear shit up y'all 'cause that's my style  
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)  
  
Oh oh oh, by the way, I play guitar!  
  
Tennis shoes and caps, now that's phat  
Up until the day another want to laugh behind your back  
Sayin' we all look the same, huh  
God bless America, home of the brave  
I'd rather dress to make a woman stare  
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare  
It's a freezer burn compared to cool  
And if you still got loot, then who's the fool?  
Everybody want to take the stand  
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man  
I can tear shit up y'all 'cause that's my style  
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)  
These are the days of wild - hit me!  
  
Much props to the upside down double six  
Baddest, freezer burnin', head turnin', make a brother yearnin',  
Sister walkin' the face  
You know who you are  
For love  
  
[Repeat: 2X]  
(Hold onto your wits!)  
  
[Repeat to fade]  
Hit me!
