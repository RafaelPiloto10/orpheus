All the life, she has seen  
All the meaner side of me  
They took away the prophet's dream  
For a profit on the street  
Now she's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
All his life, he's been told  
He'll be nothing when he's old  
All the kicks and all the blows  
He will never let it show  
Cause he's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
When you've fighting for it all your life  
You've been working every day and night  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
  
[Verse 2]  
All the hurt, all the lies, all the tears that they cry  
When the moment is just right  
You'll see fire in their eyes, because he's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
When you've fighting for it all your life  
You've been working every day and night  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
  
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power  
  
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power  
  
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power  
  
[Bridge]  
She's got a lions in her heart, a fire in his soul  
He's a got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control  
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow  
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode  
  
She's got a lions in her heart, a fire in his soul  
He's a got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control  
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow  
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode  
  
[Chorus]  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
When you've fighting for it all your life  
You've been working every day and night  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
  
Oh yeah! Every day, every hour turn the pain into power!  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Every day, every hour turn the pain into power!  
  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
