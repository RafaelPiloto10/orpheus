I started this  
It's all for me  
What's yours is mine and mine is mine  
That's plain to see  
So give it up  
I've got to have  
I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow  
Be aggressive  
Be-e aggressive  
Be-e-a-g-g-are-e-s-s-I-v-e  
What someone else  
Would leave behind  
And spit it out, let go to waste  
I claim as mine  
You're my flavour of the week  
I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow  
Tall and reckless  
Ugly seed  
Reach down my throat  
You filthy bird  
That's all I need  
The empty pit  
I've got to feed  
To prove I'm fit  
A healthy man  
I've got to be  
Malnutrition, my submission  
You're the master and I take it on my knees  
Ejaculation  
Tribulation  
I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow  
Be aggressive  
Be-e aggressive  
Be-e-a-g-g-are-e-s-s-I-v-e  
Go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, win
