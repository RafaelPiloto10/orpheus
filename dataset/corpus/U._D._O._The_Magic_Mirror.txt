God have the Ten Commandments  
Moses passed them all  
A look at Jesus' blessings  
The sun belonged to Ra  
  
Nero played with fire  
Caesar was a laugh  
The beauty Cleopatra  
Ramses had it all  
  
Drunk a skull with Odin  
And rode with Ghingis Khan  
Saw Attila, the great one  
The Alps with Hannibal  
  
Merlin and King Asrthur  
A feast with Robin Hood  
Friends with Leonardo  
Columbus and the plot  
  
With empires arising  
And holy nations fall  
The magic mirror shows you  
Kings and Queens and all  
  
Just take a look in the magic mirror  
Don't turn around at what you see  
Just take a look in the magic mirror  
You're gonna see what you may be  
  
Luther nailed our destiny  
Beethoven wrote the scores  
Napoleon and his triumph  
Rasputin and the Tsar  
  
Imagine our history  
Without those famous names  
It makes the world remember  
That life is not in vain
