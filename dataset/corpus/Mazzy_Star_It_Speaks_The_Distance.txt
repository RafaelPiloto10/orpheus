Sometimes my life  
Is just a torch  
They go away  
And come back to me  
It's just no way  
It can be found  
It's a view  
Come on take it  
The touch of your hand  
It speaks the distance  
It speaks the distance  
In your heart  
Behind my life  
There's a silent storm  
It brings a vision  
Into your mind  
It's in between  
All the dark of hearts  
My heart beats and say  
Come on, there's question of why  
There's no question of why  
Beat your door  
To knock it through  
You took his watch  
His solitude  
In my eyes  
It may be  
Behind my eyes  
There's different kinds  
They go away  
And come back to me
