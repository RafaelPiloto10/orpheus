Words and music by brian may  
  
When I'm gone no need to wonder  
If I ever think of you  
The same moon shines  
The same wind blows for both of us  
And time is but a paper moon  
Be not gone  
  
Though I'm gone it's as though  
I hold the flower that touches you  
A new life grows  
The blossom knows there's no one else  
Could warm my heart as much as you  
Be not gone  
  
Let us cling together as the years go by  
Oh my love my love  
In the quiet of the night  
Let our candle always burn  
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned  
  
Teo torriatte konomama iko  
Aisuruhito yo  
Shizukana yoi ni  
Hikario tomoshi  
Itoshiki oshieo idaki  
  
Hear my song still think of me  
The way you've come to think of me  
The nights grow long  
But dreams live on  
Just close your pretty eyes  
And you can be with me  
Dream on  
  
Teo torriatte konomama iko  
Aisuruhito yo  
Shizukana yoi ni  
Hikario tomoshi  
Itoshiki oshieo idaki  
  
When I'm gone they'll say we were all fools  
And we don't understand  
Oh be strong don't turn your heart  
We're all you're all we're all for all for always  
  
Let us cling together as the years go by  
Oh my love my love  
In the quiet of the night  
Let our candle always burn  
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned
