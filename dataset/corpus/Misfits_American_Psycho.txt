Whoa-oh, whoa-oh,  
Oh-Oh-Oh,  
whoa  
Go  
  
Inside a Wall Street mind a psycho lurks  
Lines of cocaine cut in Hell  
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck  
Compulsively you'll die.  
I hate people  
  
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, whoa-oh  
Struggling to breathe, go  
  
The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment  
Sex puts me in the mood to make you die  
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck  
Look into sick eyes  
I hate people  
  
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, whoa-oh  
Struggling to breathe  
  
Go  
A machine of penalty  
Go  
The sweet insanity  
Go  
Fade to black tranquility  
  
Go  
You're looking through the eyes of a psycho, whoa-oh  
An American Psycho, whoa-oh  
An American Psycho, whoa-oh  
An American Psycho  
  
Psycho  
Inside a Wall Street mind a psycho lurks  
Lines of cocaine cut in Hell  
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck  
Compulsively you'll die... I hate people  
  
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, whoa-oh  
Struggling to breathe  
  
Go  
A machine of penalty  
Go  
The sweet insanity  
Go  
Fade to black tranquility  
Go  
You're looking through the eyes of a psycho, whoa-oh  
An American Psycho, whoa-oh  
An American Psycho, whoa-oh  
An American Psycho  
  
Psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho
