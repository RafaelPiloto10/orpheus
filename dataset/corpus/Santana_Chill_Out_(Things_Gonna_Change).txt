One of these days things gonna change  
One of these days things gonna change  
You'll try not baby  
After while gonna be mine, gonna be mine  
  
One of these days  
I'm old and lonely baby  
Cry, crying won't be long, long  
Things gonna change  
  
Sometime, in the middle of the night  
You're so long, and so long and so long  
Things gonna change, things gonna change  
Change, change, change, things gonna change  
  
Further on up the road baby, things gonna change  
Change, change, change, change, change, change  
Change baby, you'll try not to leave  
But after while gonna be, my time, my time baby  
Things gonna change, change, change, change  
Change, change, change, things gonna change, yes it is  
  
Things gonna change, change, change, change  
Change, change, change, change, change  
Things gonna change, got the blues  
Things gonna change, things gonna change  
Change, change, change, change, things gonna change
