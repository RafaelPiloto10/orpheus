A Cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say  
About the things caught in my mind  
As the day was dawning my plane flew away  
With all the things caught in my mind  
  
And I want to be there when you're...  
Coming down  
  
And I want to be there when you hit the ground  
So don't go away say what you say  
But say that you'll stay  
Forever and a day...in the time of my life  
  
'Cause I need more time yes I need more time  
Just to make things right  
Damn my situation and the games I have to play  
With all the things caught in my mind  
  
Damn my education I can't find the words to say  
About all the things caught in my mind  
Me and you what's going on?  
All we seem to know is how to show  
  
The feelings that are wrong
