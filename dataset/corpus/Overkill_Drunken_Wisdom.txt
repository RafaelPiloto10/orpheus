Stop cryin'.  
Ain't feeling sorry for you.  
Why don't you fade away?  
Got no time.  
No time for what I gotta do.  
And get a message through.  
Kiss my ass.  
Your bitchin's a bore.  
Don't want to hear it no, more.  
So stop cryin'.  
Ain't feelin' nothing for you.  
Don't like it there's the door.  
  
Sorry if I'm not as nice as you could be!  
Why don't you take the time to see?  
That the world! does not revolve around only you.  
And we got better things to do.  
  
You're starvin'.  
Just startin' to talk.  
I think you know it all  
I'm sick.  
I eat this shit everyday,  
Why don't we give you a call.  
Authoritative.  
And a reason to live.  
You answer questions for me!  
Opinionated.  
With a brain like a sieve,  
Why don't you let it be?  
  
Come back here, drink our beer,  
Bend my ear with no idea!  
Wrong or right,  
A true philosopher.  
Defining our performance.  
  
Why don't you get yourself a life?  
Just get the fuck out.  
  
We don't care, what they say,  
We'll be there tomorrow! like we're here today.  
And all the criticism in the world,  
Won't change a note we play!!!  
  
Mix it up, throw it down,  
We came to play, not to mess around.  
We don't care, what they say,  
We'll be there tomorrow like we're here today.  
Don't do it for the money.  
Do it for the thrill.  
True to life is what you get,  
We're, livin' for the kill.  
  
Drunken  
Wisdom
