That hot old summer sun make you beg for your next breath  
So you best be on the creek bank laid in the shade  
Chewin on a hickory twig, pass that bottle, I'll have me a swig  
I ain't got a lot, but I think I got it made, in the shade  
  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
Catchin these fish like they're goin out of style  
Drinkin this homemade wine  
Hey, if the sun don't come up tomorrow  
People, I've had a good time  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
  
I bet the old man's in the kitchen  
He's got my kind of music on his radio  
Oh, drinkin his beer and dialin up the request line  
Momma and old Aunt Joan  
Probably in the dining room tryin to use the phone  
Me, I'm thinkin about that girl and later tonight  
Oh, yeah  
  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
Hey, I'm atchin these fish like they're goin out of style  
I'm drinkin this homemade wine  
And if the sun don't come up tomorrow  
People, I've had a good time  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
  
You know, the red necks and the hippies  
They are in their discos and honkytonks  
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace  
Lord, I know just how they feel  
You gotta get out and kick up your heels  
And ain't it great to be livin in the usa  
  
Me, I'm laid up here in a country state of mind  
Catchin these fish like they're goin out of style  
And drinkin this homemade wine, all the time  
If the sun don't shine tomorrow  
People, I have had a good time  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
(I know where Hank Jr is)  
  
Yodel-ay-ee-oh, yodel-ay-ee-oh  
Yodel-ay-ee-hee  
Hee, hee
