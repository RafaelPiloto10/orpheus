Well I guess it would be nice  
If I could touch your body  
I know not everybody  
Has got a body like you, uhh  
  
But I've got to think twice  
Before I give my heart away  
And I know all the games you play  
Because I play them too  
  
Oh but I  
Need some time off from that emotion  
Time to pick my heart up off the floor  
Oh when that love comes down  
Without devotion  
Well it takes a strong man, baby  
But I'm showing you the door  
  
'Cause I gotta have faith  
I gotta faith  
Because I gotta to have faith faith  
I gotta to have faith, faith, faith  
  
Baby  
I know you're asking me to stay  
Say please, please, please, don't go away  
You say I'm giving you the blues  
Maybe  
You mean every word you say  
Can't help but think of yesterday  
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules  
  
Before this river  
Becomes an ocean  
Before you throw my heart back on the floor  
Oh baby I reconsider  
My foolish notion  
Well I need someone to hold me  
But I wait for something more  
  
Yes I've gotta have faith  
Unh I gotta faith  
Because I gotta to have faith, faith, faith  
I gotta to have faith, faith, faith  
  
I just got to wait  
Because I got to have faith  
I gotta have faith  
I gotta, gotta, gotta have faith  
  
Before this river  
Becomes an ocean  
Before you throw my heart back on the floor  
Oh baby I reconsider  
My foolish notion  
Well I need someone to hold me  
But I wait for something more  
  
'Cause I've gotta have faith  
Unh I gotta faith  
Because I gotta to have faith, faith, faith  
I gotta to have faith, faith, faith
