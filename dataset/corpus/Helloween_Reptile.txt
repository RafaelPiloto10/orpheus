Coming from the sewerage creepin' through the pipes  
Born from modern chemistry a thing that is alive  
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes  
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive  
  
The scientists got no way to fight  
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right  
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on  
You just can't stop a thinking that the officials do you wrong  
  
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm  
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm  
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door  
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore  
  
You won't believe 'till you know that it's real  
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel  
You need a shit so you head off to the loo  
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do !  
  
[Chorus]  
There's the Reptile (Reptile)  
Just see his eyes  
Reptile (Reptile)  
Can you see the beast arise  
  
[Chorus]  
Reptile (Reptile)  
Creeping up on you  
Reptile (Reptile)  
There's nothing left that you can do  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's the Reptile (Reptile)  
Hidden till now  
Reptile (Reptile)  
But now it's there you don't know how  
  
[Chorus]  
Reptile (Reptile)  
Just watch it grow  
Reptile (Reptile)  
And there's no more human being left but you  
  
Oerrrps !
