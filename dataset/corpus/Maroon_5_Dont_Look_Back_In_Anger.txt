[Oasis cover]  
  
Slip inside the eye of your mind  
Don't you know you might find  
A better place to play  
  
You said that you've never been  
But all the things that you've seen  
They slowly fade away  
  
So I'll start a revolution from my bed  
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside the summertime's in bloom  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
And so, Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
Take me to the place where you go  
Where nobody knows  
If it's night or day  
  
Please don't put your life in the hands  
Of a rock and roll band  
Who'll throw it all away  
  
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed  
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head  
Step outside, cause summertime's in bloom  
  
Stand up beside the fireplace  
Take that look from off your face  
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
  
So, Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
My soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
So, Sally can wait  
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by  
Her soul slides away  
But don't look back in anger  
Don't look back in anger  
I heard you say  
  
At least not today.
