Mother said come home  
Father said come home  
Sisters said come home  
So my friends said come home  
  
I said  
Let me be, I'm alright  
Can't you see, I'm just fine  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm asleep anyway  
Then I heard a voice  
  
Said son you have a choice  
I then slapped my face  
Let me be, I'm okay  
I'm awake anyway  
It's too bright over there  
I can shift, cannot steer  
  
So I drive them away  
For a while, then I stay  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm awake anyway  
Now I have to go home  
Do as, when in Rome  
  
Let me be, I'm alright  
Can't you see I'm just fine  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm asleep anyway  
Let me be, I'm okay  
I'm awake anyway  
Toby's still laughing. It sounds fuckin' pretty good  
I'm laughing. That's tight as shit, what are you talkin' about?
