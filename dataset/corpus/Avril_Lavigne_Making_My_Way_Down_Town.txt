Making my way downtown, walking fast  
Faces pass and I'm home bound  
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way  
Making a way through the crowd...  
  
And I need you  
And I miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by... ?  
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you...  
Tonight  
  
It's always times like these when I think of you  
And I wonder if you ever think of me...  
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong  
Living in your precious me-mo-rys...  
  
'Cause I need you  
And I miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by oh  
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you...  
Tonight  
  
And I... , I...  
Don't want to let you know  
I... , I...  
Drown in your memory  
I... , I...  
Don't want to let this go  
I, I don't...  
  
Making my way downtown, walking fast  
Faces pass and I'm home bound  
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way  
Making a way through the crowd...  
And I still need you  
And I still miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky...  
Do you think time would pass us by...  
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by  
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
If I could just hold you  
Tonight...
