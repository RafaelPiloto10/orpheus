I know a dark secluded place  
A place where no one knows your face.  
A glass of wine, a fast embrace.  
Its called Hernandos Hideaway. Ole!  
  
All you see are silhouettes  
And all you hear are castanets  
And no one cares how late it gets  
Not at Hernandos Hideaway. Ole!  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
At the golden finger bowl or anyplace you go  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
you'll meet your uncle Max and everyone you know  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
But if you are sitting close and making love to me  
you may take my heart, you may take my soul, but not my key  
  
Just knock three times and whisper low  
That you and I were sent by Joe  
Then strike a match and you will know  
you're in Hernandos Hideaway. Ole!
