Someone to care  
Someone to share  
Lonely hours and moments of despair  
To be loved, to be loved  
Oh what a feeling to be loved  
  
Someone to kiss  
Someone to miss  
When you're away  
To here from each day  
To be love, to be loved  
Oh what a feeling to be loved  
  
Some wish to be a king or a queen  
Some wish for fortune and fame  
But to be, truly, truly, truly loved  
Well, is more than all of these things  
  
Someone to kiss  
Someone to miss  
When you're away to here from each day  
To be loved, to be love  
Oh what a feeling to be loved  
  
But to feel truly love baby  
There's more one of these things  
  
Someone to miss  
someone to kiss  
When you're away to here from each day  
To be loved, To be loved  
Oh what a feeling  
To be loved To be loved  
To be loved To be loved  
Oh what a feeling  
To be loved
