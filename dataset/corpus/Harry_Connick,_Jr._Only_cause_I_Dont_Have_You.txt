Turn off the music  
Take down the signs  
Pack up the boxes  
Put away the wine  
No toast for the future  
No reward for the find  
  
If looks could kill  
This mirror would do  
Only 'cause I don't have you  
  
Don't bother with ovations  
Leave off the fanfare  
Let the candles melt down  
Till the smoke's all that's there  
Leave the veil in place  
A tear, la mer  
I could say it was nothing  
Now that there's nothing new  
Only 'cause I don't have you  
  
Not built on a wisp or whim  
Twist an arm, break a leg  
Tear me limb from limb  
If there's a point you've made it  
If there's a fare I've paid it  
  
Later on good wishes  
Later on good try  
I'm afraid won't do  
It's not justified  
You go from the privy  
And you end up deprived  
On top of the world  
But still there's no view  
Only 'cause I don't have you
