Never treat me sweet and gentle  
The way she should  
'Cause I got it bad, and that ain't good  
  
My poor heart is so sentimental  
And it's not made of wood  
Now, I got it bad and that ain't good  
  
When the weekend's over  
And Monday rolls around  
I end up like start out  
Just crying my heart out  
  
She don't love me like I love her  
Nobody could  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
  
Now when the weekend's over  
Monday rolls around  
I end up like I start out  
Just crying  
  
Oh, she don't love me like I love her  
Nobody could  
I got it bad and it sure is good
