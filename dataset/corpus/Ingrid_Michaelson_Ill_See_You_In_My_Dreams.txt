Though the days are long  
Twilight sings a song  
Of a happiness that used to be  
Soon my eyes will close  
(Soon my eyes will close)  
Soon I'll find repose  
And in dreams, you're always near to me  
I'll see you in my dreams  
Hold you in my dreams  
Someone took you out of my arms  
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms  
Lips that once were mine  
Tender eyes that shine  
They will light our way tonight  
I'll see you in my dreams  
In the dreary gray  
Of another day  
You are far away and I am blue  
Still I hope and pray  
(Still I hope and pray)  
Through each weary day  
For it brings the night and dreams of you  
I'll see you in my dreams  
Hold you in my dreams  
Someone took you out of my arms  
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms  
Lips that once were mine  
Tender eyes that shine  
They will light our way tonight  
I'll see you in my dreams  
They will light our way tonight  
I'll see you in my dreams
