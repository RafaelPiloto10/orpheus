You've got it. I want it.  
Surrender. Don't run away.  
Some say I'm cold-blooded.  
I'd say I'm just not that way.  
  
I need someone tonight.  
Someone to hold on to me tight.  
I need someone tonight.  
  
If I could convince you,  
If you would just say all right.  
I'd treat you so tender.  
Then leave you and never write.  
  
I need someone tonight.  
Someone to hold on to me tight.  
I need someone tonight.
