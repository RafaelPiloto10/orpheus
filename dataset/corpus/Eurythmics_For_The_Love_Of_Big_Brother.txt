Like a train passing in the distance  
Black bird in flight, I hear you call  
And even though there's no one  
Dark shadows move across the wall  
I still hear the echo  
Of your footsteps on the stairs  
Still recall the images that  
Seem to live out there  
First you see my fingerprints  
Like skeletons of leaves on the wall  
People changing places  
I stand for a moment and it's gone  
I still hear the echo  
Of your footsteps on the stairs  
Still recall the images that  
Seem to live out there  
Like a train passing in the distance  
Black bird in flight I hear you call  
And even though there's no one  
Dark shadows move across the wall  
I still hear the sound of  
Conversations from the hall  
Look to see who's coming  
But it's nothing and there's no one there at all  
No one there at all, no one there at all  
No one there at all, no one there at all
