When I was nineteen,  
I threw my stuff in the car  
I headed up to the Rockies, got a job at this bar  
Sellin' beer to the locals, just barely gettin' by  
On the tips from the rich kids, their on Daddy's dime  
But when I saw her walk in one night  
I knew that I'd be alright in...  
  
[Chorus]  
Telluride  
The snow fallin' down  
I was wakin' up with her in that sleepy little town  
In her eyes my world came so alive  
  
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride  
  
We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire  
Castin' shadows on the cabin wall, drownin' in desire  
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud  
So high up on that mountain  
I thought we'd never come down  
It was a dream we were livin' in  
And I was the happiest I'd ever been, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telleride  
  
It ended just like a movie scene  
And I had to play the part  
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave  
And me with the frozen heart, in....  
  
[Chorus]  
I never will forget the day she said good bye, in Telluride  
  
[Chorus]  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride  
  
Telluride [Repeat until fade]
