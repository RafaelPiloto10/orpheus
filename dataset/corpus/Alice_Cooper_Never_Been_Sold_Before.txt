You ask me, baby  
Can you work tonight  
I've been up, babe  
Since broad daylight  
  
I just can't believe  
That you're sellin' me  
You never sold me before  
I just can't recall  
You're like a whore  
  
Oh yeah, I'm bad tonight  
You really like my style  
If you want me  
Can't even buy my smile  
  
Now I find come around  
Just to lay this money on you, babe  
I'm sick of tradin' tricks and dicks  
And I'm, I'm really sick of you  
Oh I -  
  
Never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
No, I never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
  
I just can't believe  
That you're sellin' me  
You never sold me before  
I just can't recall  
You little whore, no no no no no  
  
Never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
No, I never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
  
Never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again  
No, I never been sold before  
And I'll never be hurt again
