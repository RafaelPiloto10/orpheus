Shorty knows she my babygirl and  
Playa hatas try hard to get her  
But she'll be loungin' in my cradle tonight  
Oh  
Typically a thug wouldn't say this  
But to see your love has got me faded  
No girl ever made me feel like you do, ow  
  
Oh  
I'ma be here night after night to  
Feel your lovin' arms around me baby, baby, baby, baby  
You make it alright  
No one but you baby, baby  
Can make me feel the way you make me, make me, make me feel  
Oh

Oh, don't you let it end  
Make it last forever and ever  
Thank God I found you  
  
Your touch is wonderful  
Your love is so marvelous  
Joy, that's what I feel when I'm with you  
Yeah  
Nothing, no one

Could compare to what we have  
(Oh no, baby)

Thank You, Lord (yeah)  
That I found love  
That I found my true love  
Oh, baby  
See I was so lost without your love  
I was lost without you, my every wish and dream  
Became reality  
  
Oh, I was so lost  
Oh, I  
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  
Oh yeah  
My baby I'm so thankful

Thank God I found you, I was so lost without you  
My every wish and every dream somehow became reality  
Brought the sunshine  
Completed my whole life  
Make it last forever, baby

You, you, you  
You, you
