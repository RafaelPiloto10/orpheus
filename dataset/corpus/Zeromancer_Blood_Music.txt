Lowlifes on gossip  
Bypass the mind  
Head for the heart  
  
Do you feel love?  
  
It's not like I don't care  
We are not going anywhere  
Thinking loud and clear  
Where will I be in a year?  
Two hearts slamming  
As one  
It's blood music  
  
Pop up leeches  
You know a climax ain't the end of it  
  
Do you feel love?  
  
It's not like I don't care  
We are not going anywhere  
Thinking loud and clear  
Where will I be in a year  
Come on  
Two hearts slamming  
As one  
It's blood music
