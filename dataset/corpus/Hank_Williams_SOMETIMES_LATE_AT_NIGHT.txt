(E) SOMETIMES LATE AT NIGHT,  
WHEN OUR (A) FRIENDS ARE FAST A- (E) SLEEP,  
YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE A STROLL WITH (B7) ME,  
THO (E) WE ARE WED TO OTHERS, AND (A) IT MAY NOT BE (E) RIGHT,  
I HAVE (A) LONGED TO HOLD YOU (E) IN MY ARMS,  
(B7) SOMETIMES LATE AT (E) NIGHT.  
CHORUS:  
I'VE (A) CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP,  
A (E) THOUSAND TIMES OR MORE,  
BUT WHEN I DREAM OF YOU, MY HEART IS (B7) LIGHT,  
NO (E) MATTER WHAT OUR FRIENDS MAY (E7) SAY,  
AND (A) IT MAY NOT BE (E) RIGHT,  
I (A) LOVE YOU SO, YOU (E) KNOW I'LL GO,  
(B7) SOMETIMES LATE AT (E) NIGHT.  
REPEAT CHORUS.
