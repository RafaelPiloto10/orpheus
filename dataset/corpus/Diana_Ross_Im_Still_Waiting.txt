I remember when  
I was five and you were ten, boy  
You knew that I was shy  
So you teased and made me cry  
But I loved you  
  
Then one day you came  
You told me you were leaving  
You gave your folks the blame  
And made me cry again  
When you said  
  
Little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
Ooh, little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
And I'm still waiting  
  
I'm waiting  
Ooh, still waiting  
I'm just a fool  
Ooh, I'm a fool  
To keep waiting  
  
Then someone finally came  
He told me that he loved me  
I put him off with lies  
He could see I had no eyes  
So he left me once again alone  
Like a child without her playmate  
I had to face the truth  
I was still in love with you  
But you said:  
  
Little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
Ooh, little girl  
Please don't wait for me  
Wait patiently for love  
Someday will surely come  
And I'm still waiting  
  
Love has never shown his face  
Since the day you walked out that door  
You filled my life with empty space  
Come back  
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for  
  
Don't you know I'm waiting  
I'm waiting for love  
For you, I miss you  
I'm waiting  
Come on back, boy  
I need you  
I want you  
That's what my friends says
