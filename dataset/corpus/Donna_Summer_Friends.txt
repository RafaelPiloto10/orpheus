In our childhoods days  
Together we would play  
People said we were inseparable  
  
Like a brother then  
My protective friend  
He would always take good care of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Friends that's what we are just  
Friends no more or less oh  
Here we are sharing so much fun  
Friends why can't he see that I want him  
To be more than my friend  
  
Years have come and gone  
Still our friendship's strong  
Now he's more than just the boy next door  
  
I'm in love with him  
Guess I've always been  
He doesn't know he's all I'm living for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd like to tell him that I need him bad  
But I'm afraid if I do I might lose  
The only friend that I have  
  
[Chorus]
