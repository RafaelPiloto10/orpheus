It's been a cold, cold, cold, cold night tonight  
And I can't get you off my mind  
God knows I've tried  
Did I throw away the best part of my life  
When I cut you off, did I cut myself with the same damn knife  
Hide my tears in the pouring rain, had my share of hurt and pain  
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try  
Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye  
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long time  
Since I've had your love here in my hands  
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it  
But, nothing's fair in love and hate  
You lay it all down and walk away , before it's too late  
We danced all night as the music played  
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made  
There in the stains , we remain,  
No one left to blame  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try  
Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye  
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Go on, get on with your life, Yeah - I'll get on with mine  
Broken hearts can't call the cops, yeah it's the perfect crime  
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning  
I'm burning alive  
I'm paying the price again  
But I'll see the light again  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try  
Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye  
It's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Oh I'm going, gonna walk out the door  
Saying you don't care for me anymore  
That's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight
