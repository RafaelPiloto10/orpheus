Wind blows back and the batons charging  
It winds all the way  
Right to the butt of my gun  
Maybe now your time has come  
  
From the back streets there's a rumbling  
  
Smell of anarchy  
No more nice time, bright boy shoe shines  
Pie in the sky dreams  
  
Lights out, lights out in London  
Hold 'em tight till the end  
Better now you know we'll never  
Wait till tomorrow  
Lights out, lights out in London  
Hold 'em tight till the end  
God knows when I'm coming on my run  
  
Heaven help those who help themselves  
That's the way it goes  
The frightening thoughts of what's been taught  
And now it shows  
  
You keep coming, there's no running  
Tried a thousand times  
Under your feet grass is growing  
Time we said goodbye  
  
Lights out, lights out in London  
  
Lights out, lights out in London
