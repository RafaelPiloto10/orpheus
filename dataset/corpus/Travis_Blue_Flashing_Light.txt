Saturday evening  
Saturday evening at a quarter to five  
I would see him arrive at the door  
Pushed you aside as he staggered inside  
  
Spilling alcohol over the floor  
A storm is abrewin' and it's sure to fall soon  
As I look at you from the shore  
So  
  
You better hold on  
'Cause it's Saturday night  
And your friends are all out  
And you feel like shit  
  
'Cause they never call you  
No they never call you  
No they never call  
Never call  
  
Never bloody ever  
Call me a name and I'll hit you again  
You're a slut, you're a bitch, you're a whore  
Talked to your daddy in that tone of voice  
  
There's a belt hanging over the door  
So you run to your room  
And you hide in your room  
Thinking how you could settle the score  
  
But  
Saturday night at a quarter to six  
And your friends are all out  
And you're live in the sticks  
  
Still they never call you  
No they never call you  
No they never call  
Never call  
  
Never bloody ever call  
Blue flashing light last Saturday night  
Brought the neighbours all out on the street  
They watched as the firemen carried you out  
  
And they stared at each other's feet  
Now everyone sees and yet nobody says  
How we're all just afraid of the heat  
But  
  
It's Saturday night  
And I'm lying alone in the bed that I made  
Disconnected the phone  
Still they never call you  
  
No they never call you  
No they never call  
Never call  
Never bloody ever call  
  
Never bloody ever  
Never  
Never do  
Never do
