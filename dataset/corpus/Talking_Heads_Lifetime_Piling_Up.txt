I have tried marijuana  
I get nervous every time  
There will come a knockin' at the door  
Why is everybody makin' eyes at me?  
I don't want to know  
Excuse and pardon me  
Stay for a while  
Maybe we'll never meet again  
  
I can see my lifetime piling up  
I can see the days turn into nights  
I can see the people on the street  
Open those windows up  
A hundred floors below me  
Pilin' those houses up  
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher  
I can feel them swayin' back and forth  
Building it higher, higher  
This tower's learning over  
  
I got bad coordination  
Stuck a pencil in my eye  
I can hardly wait to get back home  
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid?  
I's only havin' fun  
Scum-bags and superstars  
Tell me your names  
I'll make a bet, you're  
Both the same  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin' up  
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars  
I can see the house where I was born  
When I was growin' up - they say that  
I could never keep my trousers up  
I remember days and crazy nights  
Are there any pirates on this ship?  
And if they sober up - they'll have us  
Home by morning  
  
Cry, cry, cry  
It's just you and I  
Like an automobile  
With no one at the wheel  
Spinning out of control  
We're all over the road  
In our sexy machine  
All the passengers scream  
Scream, scream!  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin' up  
I can see it smashin' into yours  
It was not an accident at all  
Open your window up - I hear you laughin'  
  
Goin' one, two, three, four, five  
Goin' from the bottom to the top  
Maybe I'm holding on too tight  
And now I'm growin' up  
I got a funny feeling  
Pilin' those houses up  
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher  
Building that highway to the stars  
And turning the music up - Hey!  
I got a winning number
