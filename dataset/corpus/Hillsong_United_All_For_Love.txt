All for love a Father gave.. For only love could make a way... All for love
the heavens cried.. For love was crucified.  
  
Oh, how many times have I broken your heart... But still you forgive if only I
ask..  
And how many times have you heard me pray..Draw near to me..  
  
Everything I need is You  
My beginning and forever  
Everything I need is You  
  
Let me sing all for love.. I will join the angel song. Ever Holy is the Lord,
King of Glory, King of All.  
  
All for love a Saviour prayer.. Abba Father have your way.. Though they know
not what they do.. Let the cross draw man to you
