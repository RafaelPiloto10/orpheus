Think I'll just fall to pieces  
If I don't find something else to do  
This sadness never ceases  
I'm still in love with you  
  
My head, it keeps on reeling  
It's got me in a crazy spin  
Darling, darling, darling  
Is this the end?  
  
They say time has a way of healing  
Dries all the tears from your eyes  
But darling it's this empty feeling  
My heart can't disguise  
  
After all that we've been through  
I try my best but it's no use  
I guess I'll keep on loving you  
Is this the end?  
  
Now that it's all over, woman  
There's something I think you should know  
Baby, baby, think it over  
Just one time before you go  
  
Call on me baby  
If there's anything I can do for you  
Call on me baby  
Help me see it through  
  
Call on me baby  
why don't you call on me baby  
aww help me see it through  
I'm in love, so in love with you
