Baby, what we gon' do?  
I need you to talk to me, c'mon  
  
Suddenly, I feel the need, to pull you close to me  
But I don't know, if it's what you want, baby  
Girl show me some kind of sign  
That tells me that you're, miiiine, all mine, baby  
It's gettin' awfully warm, off in this room  
I'm gettin' head up off yo' sweet perfume  
And I'm ready, to explore, every part of you  
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, then now you  
Ooooooooooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo baby  
Baby, tonight we'll be, naked  
Oooooooh, oooooooh, oooooooh, ooooooooh  
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love  
And show you so, so much  
Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture  
Gettin' you open like matchin' doors  
Sheets and covers on, the floor  
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer  
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you  
Want to tell, what I want from you  
  
Baby tonight I want to see you naked  
So dim the lights  
Baby tonight I want to see you naked  
I want to see you tonight  
Baby tonight I want to see you naked  
Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight  
Baby tonight I want to see you naked  
Ohhh-ohhh, naked
