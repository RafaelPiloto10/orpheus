Hey my friend, I know too well  
The pressures in this life are real  
You gotta come out fighting when they ring your bell  
Stand up for the way you feel  
You can't let it get you down  
You can't let it make you run away  
Got to keep your dreams alive  
We can do it, but we'll only make it work together  
When it all comes down to the push and shove  
We can make it through, we can rise above  
'Cause you know that we've got the power of  
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love  
Now I can see that you're feeling sad  
Some one's chosen your heart to steal  
Hey, my friend, you can take my hand  
And I'll show your heart a power that's real  
It will never let you down  
It will always open any door  
So pick the pieces off the ground  
Because you may have lost the battle but we'll win this war  
When it all comes down to the push and shove  
We can make it through, we can rise above  
'Cause you know that we've got the power of  
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love  
So wipe away your tears, you can put away your gun  
And get ready to receive the strongest medicine  
When it all comes down to the push and shove  
We can make it through, we can rise above  
'Cause you know that we've got the power of  
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love
