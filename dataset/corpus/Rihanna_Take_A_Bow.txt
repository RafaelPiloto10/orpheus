How 'bout a round of applause?  
Standin' ovation  
Oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
You look so dumb right now  
Standin' outside my house  
Tryin' to apologize  
You're so ugly when you cry  
(Please)  
Just cut it out  
  
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not  
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught  
  
[Chorus]  
But you put on quite a show  
You really had me goin'  
But now it's time to go  
Curtains finally closin'  
That was quite a show  
Very entertaining  
But it's over now  
Go on and take a bow  
  
Grab your clothes and get gone  
(You better hurry up)  
Before the sprinklers come on  
Talkin' 'bout "Girl, I love you you're the one"  
This just looks like a re-run  
(Please)  
What else is on?  
  
And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not  
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the award for the best liar goes to you  
For makin' me believe  
That you could be  
Faithful to me  
Let's hear your speech out  
Oh  
  
How 'bout a round of applause?  
Standin' ovation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But it's over now
