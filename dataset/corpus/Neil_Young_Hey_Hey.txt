Well, I've seen some women  
They put your soul on ice  
They want a piece of the action  
But they never let you roll the dice.  
  
That's the kind of woman  
Bring a good man down  
That's the kind of woman  
I don't want around  
Hey hey.  
  
I got a woman that dances  
She knows how to jump and shout  
Now she don't want to use me  
'Cause she knows how it wears me out.  
  
Yeah, she's the woman  
With the magic touch  
She don't want to lose me  
'Cause she loves me too much  
Hey hey.  
  
Hey hey, my woman looks good to me  
Hey hey, my woman looks good to me.  
Yeah, she knows how to please me  
She knows how to set me free.  
  
Get off of that couch  
Turn off that M.T.V.  
Get off of that couch  
Turn off your M.T.V.  
Hey hey, my woman looks good to me.
