Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
1, 2, 3, 4!  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what? I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way, yeah!  
Sometimes I'm in a jam  
I've gotta make a plan  
It might be crazy  
I do it anyway  
No way to know for sure  
I figure out a cure  
I'm patchin? up the holes  
But then it overflows  
If I'm not doin' too well  
Why be so hard on myself?  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
Again and again  
'Til I get it right  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobody's perfect  
Sometimes I work a scheme  
But then it flips on me  
Doesn't turn out how I planned  
Gets stuck in quicksand  
But no problem can't be solved  
Once I get involved  
I try to be delicate  
Then crash right into it  
But my intentions are good, yeah yeah yeah  
Sometimes just misunderstood  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
Again and again  
'Til I get it right  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
I know in time I'll find a way  
Nobody's perfect  
Sometimes I fix things up  
And they fall apart again  
Nobody's perfect  
I know I mix things up  
But I always get it right in the end  
You know I do  
Next time you feel like  
It's just one of those days  
When you just can't seem to win  
If things don't turn out the way you planned  
Figure something else out  
Don't stay down, try again, yeah!  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what? I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way  
Everybody makes mistakes  
Everybody has those days  
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin? 'bout  
Everybody gets that way  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
Again and again  
'Til I get it right  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobody's perfect  
I gotta work it  
I know in time I'll find a way  
Nobody's perfect  
You live and you learn it  
'Cause everybody makes mistakes  
Nobody's perfect  
(Nobody's perfect)  
No no  
Nobody's perfect!
