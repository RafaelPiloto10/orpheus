Here I am a man in a new generation  
Keep hanging on to where I belong  
I believe the world is one  
Behind this masquerade  
Reach out of the darkness  
And bring in the light into day  
Here I am a man with a old fascination  
(just an old fascination)  
Still holding the line on my time  
'cause I believe the day will come  
When things will work out right  
Reach out to your brothers  
And save every mother and child  
Well I want you to know  
I believe that a love can find a way  
And I believe that a heart of stone can break  
I believe that a wise man hears a call  
And the writing's on the wall  
And it's shining so bright and clear  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I believe what's done is done  
And what will be will be  
Reach out to each other  
A moment is all you need  
Well I want you to know  
I believe that a love can find a way  
And I believe that a heart of stone can break  
I believe that a wise man hears a call  
And the writing's on the wall  
And it's shining so bright and clear
