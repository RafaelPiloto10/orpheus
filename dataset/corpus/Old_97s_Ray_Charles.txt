We put on Ray Charles and broke up  
You were packed and gone when I woke up  
Ray just kept on singing, he had Georgia on his mind  
You just keep on leaving, you keep leaving all the time  
Wonder if the stars will die tonight  
Yeah I wonder if the cats and dogs are gonna fight  
There's no rest for the restless, so I doubt that you'll sleep well  
I don't think that I will, my head's ringing like a bell  
Love is blind and I don't blame her  
'Cause lately I ain't been too much to see  
I'd bring some girl home but then I'd have to pay her  
Won't you come home with me Rosemary?  
When I walked in the bar you tried to hide  
But I took my old place right by your side  
You looked like a raccoon with those circles round your eyes  
If my offer is improper, please come home with me tonight  
Well, I'll prick myself and see if blood comes out  
I'll play until the whole damn tape runs out  
I'll put on that Ray Charles record, if you'll make some drinks  
Nothing is the matter, it don't matter what you think  
Love is blind and I don't blame her  
'Cause we all could use a little sympathy  
I'd bring some girl home but then I'd have to pay her  
Won't you come home with me Rosemary?  
Love is blind and I don't blame her  
'Cause lately I ain't been too much to see  
I'd bring some girl home but then I'd have to pay her  
Won't you come home with me Rosemary?
