I am opening  
I am opening up  
  
Birth Energy  
Be my teacher  
Birth Energy  
Heal my fears  
Teach me trust  
Teach me compassion  
Walk me into the darkness  
And into your light  
  
Birth Energy  
You are Woman  
Birth Energy  
Within the Man  
Ever constant  
Ever changing  
Let your winds blow  
Rock me in your storm  
  
Let the bough break  
Let me fall  
Into your arms  
It is you I trust  
When I say  
I'm trusting Love  
  
INVOCATION:  
I stand among the Sisters of the Moon  
I am held by the Creator of the world  
I am opening  
I am unbounded  
I am luminous  
I am powerful  
I surrender to this power  
Life and newness are continued and  
renewed through me  
  
You are the ocean  
I ride upon your waves  
I am opening  
I am blown apart by your caress  
I surrender to you  
I embrace you  
  
I am ready now to sing the Moon  
To be Her voice  
I am The Singer  
And Life is Her song  
I sing Creation  
I sing joy and pain  
Beginning and ending  
Giving and taking  
Existence  
Goddess  
I embrace you  
I am opening  
I am opening up
