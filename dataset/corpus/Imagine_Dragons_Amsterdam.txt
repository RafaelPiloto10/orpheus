I'm sorry, mother I'm sorry, I let you down  
Well, these days I'm fine  
No these days I tend to lie  
I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam  
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man  
  
I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down  
Well, these days you're fine  
No these days you tend to lie  
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam  
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man  
  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
But I keep coming up short  
  
I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down  
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie  
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be  
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone"  
  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
  
But the rain won't fall for the both of us  
The sun won't shine on the both of us  
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way  
  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down  
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down  
And I keep coming up short
