Used to hear me say  
Baby, I need you, I'm lonely and deprived  
And without your love I can't get through the day  
When you're gone my world just slowly fades away  
And I  
  
Gave you my lovin' every time you asked  
Gave my heart, held nothing back  
Now I see that you couldn't handle that  
Oh, how things have changed  
  
Maybe it was that I was insecure  
That won't happen anymore  
That was before  
No, I'm not, no, I'm not the same  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
So don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My only problem was loving you  
I'm stronger now  
  
Used to cry and cry  
Sit around and wait for you to dry my eyes  
And I know you're thinking here we go again  
Your broken heart that I have to mend  
  
Gave you my lovin' every time you asked  
Gave my heart held nothing back  
Now I see that you couldn't handle that  
Oh, how things have changed  
  
Maybe it was that I was insecure  
That won't happen anymore  
That was before  
No, I'm not, no, I'm not the same  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
So don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My problem was loving you  
I'm stronger now  
  
Oh, you know I used to love you  
But oh, my friend, I can live without you  
Don't need your sympathy  
I'm letting you go free  
  
It used to be so predictable  
So innocent and so simple  
I can tell that you're surprised  
I'm someone you don't recognize  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
So don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My problem was loving you  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
But don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My problem was loving you  
I'm stronger now
