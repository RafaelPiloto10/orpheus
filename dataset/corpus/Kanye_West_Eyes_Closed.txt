And I can see it with my eyes closed, now  
Feeling like my life froze  
I'm about to hit the ground  
  
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal  
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal  
This game you could never win  
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again  
Get away from me misery  
Get away from me lonliness  
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness  
Get away from me wack tracks  
I can only make only hits  
I'm an only child lost in the World  
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring  
It's Feeling like hell rings  
Bringing me back down  
Checking my background  
It's ironic what's happening  
Imagine if I didn't have the ends  
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends  
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk  
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk  
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more  
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore  
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him  
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again  
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul  
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed  
  
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now  
Feeling like my life froze  
I'm about to hit the ground  
  
I sold my soul to the devil,  
I know it's a crappy deal,  
At least it came with a few toys,  
Like a Happy Meal,  
I'm spaced out dog,  
I be on that moontalk,  
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?  
You know the entertainment Angels  
Adriana for Giselle,  
Lets exchange Angels  
Photoshoot at my crib,  
Lets exchange angles  
Rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles,  
I'm so anxious I'm gettin anxiety  
Begging one of these f-ckin fashion houses to hire me,  
They say I've been an asshole,  
I said if you acquire me,  
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting  
Give me your herbal chai tea  
I'll be calm as Tai Chi  
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T  
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off,  
I'm Paranoid Like bonin' Raw dog  
And wakin up with a slight cough  
Yea, that'll make ya dick quite soft  
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off  
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off  
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
