I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Adore you, and want you so  
I'm just a no one,  
With nothing to give you but Oh  
I Love You  
  
He, He buys you diamonds  
Bright, sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, dear when I say,  
That he can give you the world,  
But he'll never love you the way  
I Love You  
  
He can take you anyplace he wants  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
  
I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Must watch you, go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else  
When darling it's I  
Who Loves you  
  
I Love You  
I Love You  
  
I Looove Yoooou
