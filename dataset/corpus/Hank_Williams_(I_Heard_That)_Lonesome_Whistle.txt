I was riding Number Nine,  
Heading south from Caroline.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
Got in trouble, had to roam,  
Left my gal an' left my home.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
Just a kid, acting smart,  
I went and broke my darling's heart,  
I guess I was too young to know.  
They took me off the Georgia Main,  
Locked me to a ball and chain.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
  
All alone I bear the shame,  
I'm a number, not a name.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
All I do is set an' cry  
When the evening train goes by.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  
  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
An' my hair turns whiter than snow.  
I'll never see that gal of mine.  
Lord, I'm in Georgia doing time.  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
