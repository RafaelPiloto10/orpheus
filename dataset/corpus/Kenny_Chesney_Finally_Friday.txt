Finally Friday, Kenny Chesney  
  
I got a hundred dollars smoking in my bill fold  
I know I outta save it but it's burning a hole  
Right through my pocket and into my skin  
Come Monday morning i'll be broke again  
  
Cause It's finally Friday, I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday, I'm outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
I got a little sugar baby down the road  
She's sittin' on ready and rockin' on go  
We'll dance up a storm and later on tonight  
We'll be working on a doing all the wrong things right.  
  
Cause It's finally Friday, I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday, I'm outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
Monday i'll be hurtin with my head in a vice  
Tuesday i'll be wondering if i'll ever survive  
Wednesday and a Thursday i'll be slowly tuning in  
Friday i'll be rev-in up my motor again  
  
Finally Friday, I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday, I'm outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
Finally Friday, I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
  
It's finally Friday,  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll
