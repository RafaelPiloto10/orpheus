Ooh she's just a broken doll - she ain't no  
Use at all - since you've been gone  
Ooh she's just a broken toy - she's no ones  
Pride and joy - look what you've done  
You had her on a string  
You made a fool of her  
And that's an awful thing  
She thought she'd paid her fare  
Now you've gone and you just don't care  
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll  
You can't wind her up - although the key fits  
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll  
Someone's thrown away all the pieces  
Now you've played your wicked game  
Don't you feel no shame  
Look what you've done!  
Now she's just a broken girl while you're  
All around the world - having your fun  
She had you in her heart  
You made a fool of her right from the very start  
She thought she'd paid her fare  
Now you've gone and you just don't care  
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll  
You can't wind her up - although the key fits  
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll  
Someone's thrown away all the pieces  
Ooh she's just a broken toy - she's no ones  
Pride and joy - look what you've done  
You had her on a string  
You made a fool of her  
And that's an awful thing  
She thought she'd paid her fare  
Now you've gone and you just don't care
