I wonder if you sleep right now  
Do you realize I'm clinging to  
The edge of this bed I have  
Nowhere to go, I have nowhere  
  
If I leave, you'll call me quitter  
If I stay, you'll punish me with silence and somehow  
You'll fall asleep... You'll fall asleep  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well do you know that I won't sleep,  
No I won't sleep all night long  
As your silhouette turns its back on my spoon  
I'm mesmerized by the ricochet moon  
Leaping this leprechaun's (Rumplestiltskin's) wall  
  
I'm so disenchanting  
Intoxicated by my own tear's soul  
And come tomorrow  
When my beauty is old  
Like a speckled princess  
I'll try to cash in clovers for gold  
So I'll light a candle and begin to  
Write, turn to my work as refuge  
  
Though my womb is a rush hour taxi  
Ride, but I will try  
To metamorphose pain along my plight  
But I'll despise each word I write  
So I am clinging to the  
Edge, like some soap-opera star  
With her ten second fade  
As the light cascades  
Do you love me anymore?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll try to spin straw into gold  
Straw into gold... Straw into gold... Straw into gold  
Spinning for mercy  
Spinning for hope  
Spinning for love  
Spinning for gold
