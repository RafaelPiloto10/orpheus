[Fabolous]  
It goes however I wanted to  
These bitches never say can't  
I just call it angel, she look like heaven in pants  
Big house, couple rides  
Call that shit Neverland Ranch  
Tre Pounds, shoot fast, call that shit Kevin Durant  
You n-ggers beneath me  
Now go get f-cking stomped son  
No I run this city I am Brooklyn's Nucky Thompson  
If they make me go in  
I'ma go right away  
Mny fly ass can't be stopped no flight delay  
Gotta a crew of bad bitches  
Call em the nice girls  
Yo b-tches look scary  
But she aint no spice girl  
It's 9am when you clock, you're an office worker  
It's big Bens in my pocket I'm a rothsberger  
Coconut ciroc and pineapple, easy order  
Now I got this chick showing me what Yeezy taught her (Amber Rose?)  
Welcome to the funeral pay respect  
Me and your girl, unibrow, may connect wait a sec  
Let it breath...  
  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  
  
It's goes getting more money  
They come with more problems  
I used to be Mac'ing but now I'm Steve Jobbin' man  
See you got 2 choices  
You can stay broke or grind  
Life is a bitch, and I'm just tryna Oprah mine  
Gettin' more money, it comes with more problems  
Man used to be Mac'ing but now I'm Steve Jobbin'man  
Got 2 choices  
You can stay broke or grind  
Life is a bitch, and I'm just tryna Oprah mine  
  
[Paul Cain]  
Always been a squeezer, I've been on the hollow n-ggas  
Alwyas been a leader no twitter, I don't follow n-ggas  
F-ck glass, drink Rose out the bottle n-gga  
I promised to keep it 1000 you know my motto n-gga  
Don't just talk it, be about it  
You talk it, but we about it  
We do it, you read about it  
Leave 'em don't speak about it  
We live it, you dream about it  
How could you even doubt it  
Couldn't get a quarter round here  
Unless we allowed it  
This is our city, our town, our turf  
We eatin' and y'all thirst  
Do shoot back, bomb first  
Get 'em gone first  
Let em fire, arms burst  
Regardless of size or status  
Stuff em in that long hearse  
I think I'm Malcolm X, Huey Newton  
Marcus Garvey, I'm surrounded by my army damn  
Damn, n-gga try and harm me  
F-ck what a hater think  
How could n-ggas try to rob me  
If I'm out in Abu Dhabi, ferrari's and Maserati's  
Fleets pulling up in Nobu's and Cipriani's  
Or that F1 race track, good look tryna find me  
Wherever I'm at, I'm smoking some Bob Marley  
7 star hotels, you can see the ocean from the lobby  
Riding in the goose, riding to the Goose  
Believe the great deal with stress  
I've been through the most  
Changed my whole way of thinking, got a new approach  
Fly private if it aint first class, I'm through with coach  
Street fam for life, this we all owe the los  
Whole gang bottles in the air  
I propose a toast  
We dun seen the World  
Partied with emirates  
We all come from nothing, always remember that  
So you should be thankful everytimeyou spend a stack  
For the all classy restaurants we ate dinners ate  
All the cars, audemars with the different straps  
But always strive for more, never be content with that  
No beginner rap, no number 1 contender jack  
Arnold Swarzenegger returns, Decembers back
