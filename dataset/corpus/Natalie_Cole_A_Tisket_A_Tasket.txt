A tisket a tasket  
A brown and yellow basket  
Well, I wrote a letter to my mommie  
On the way I dropped it  
  
I dropped it, I dropped it  
Yes, on the way I dropped it  
A little girlie picked it up  
And she put it in her pocket  
  
She was truckin' on down the avenue  
Without a single thing to do  
She went a-peck, peckin' all around  
Then she spied it on the ground  
  
She took it, she took it  
My little yellow basket  
And if she doesn't bring it back  
I think that I will die  
  
A tisket a tasket  
You know I lost my yellow basket  
And if that girlie don't return it  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
Oh gee, I wonder where my basket can be?  
So do we, so do we, so do we  
Oh gee, I wish that little girlie I could see  
So do we, so do we, so do we  
  
I did not take care of that little basket of mine  
Oh, that itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine  
  
A tisket a tasket  
I lost my yellow basket  
Won't someone help me find my basket  
And make me happy again, again?  
  
Was it blue? No, no, no, no  
Was it green? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Was it Prada? Oh, that's not fair  
My little yellow basket
