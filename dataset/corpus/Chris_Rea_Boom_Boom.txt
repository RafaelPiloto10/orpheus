Take a look what's be going on behind me  
I swear to God this ain't no making of my own  
  
That stupid cupid arrow  
Lost for years and never found me  
Now she's dancing on my history  
And she drives the dagger home  
  
'Cause when I see that angel walking past my window  
When I see that angel walking past my door  
I know what this tired old heart's been waiting, waiting for  
Boom boom  
Boom boom  
  
And I can't win  
There ain't no us denying  
So many years of experience  
Tell me it's so  
  
That stupid cupid arrow  
Lost for years and never found me  
Now she's dancing on my history  
And she drives the dagger home  
  
'Cause when I see that angel walking past my window  
When I see that angel walking past my door  
I know what this tired old heart's been waiting, waiting for  
Boom boom  
Boom boom
