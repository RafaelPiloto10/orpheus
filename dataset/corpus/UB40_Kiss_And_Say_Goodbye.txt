Had to meet you here today  
There's just so many things to say  
Please don't stop me till I'm through  
This is something I hate to do  
We've been meeting here so long  
I guess what we done, oh was wrong  
Please darlin', don't you cry  
Let's just kiss and say goodbye  
  
Many months have passed us by  
I'm gonna miss you  
I can't lie, I've got ties, and so do you  
I just think this is the thing to do  
  
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie  
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy  
Understand me won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try  
Let's just kiss and say goodbye  
  
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie  
Understand me, won't you try  
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie  
Take my handkerchief and wipe your eyes  
Maybe you'll find, you'll find another guy  
Let's just kiss and say goodbye.
