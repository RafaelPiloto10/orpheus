Hello one and all  
Was it you I used to know  
Can't you hear me call  
On this old ham radio  
All I got to say  
I'm alive and feeling fine  
If you come my way  
You can share my poison wine  
  
[Chorus]  
No marigolds in the promised land  
There's a hole in the ground  
Where they used to grow  
Any man left on the Rio Grande  
Is the king of the world  
As far as I know  
  
I don't want your bread  
I don't need your helping hand  
I can't be no savage  
I can't be no highwayman  
Show me where you are  
You and I will spend this day  
Driving in my car  
Through the ruins of Santa Fe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm reading last year's papers  
Although I don't know why  
Assassins cons and rapers  
Might as well die  
  
If you come around  
No more pain and no regrets  
Watch the sun go brown  
Smoking cobalt cigarettes  
There's no need to hide  
Taking things the easy way  
If I stay inside  
I might live til Saturday  
  
[Chorus]
