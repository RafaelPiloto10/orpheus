Another New York waltz at four a.m.,  
In the canyons lost at night  
The city's just a jail for me, full of high rise prison walls  
And I'm riding through this darkness,  
'cause I know there's life within  
And I'm searching through the shadows,  
Just to find that light again  
  
Keep driving (keep driving),  
Let the meter run  
Keep driving (keep driving),  
Oh the night's not really done  
  
Keep driving  
  
And I'm hanging on a memory, and I feel it in the air  
I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets,  
But I know I'll find you there  
And oh Lord, you look so pretty,  
But you can see it in my eyes  
And just before my tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside  
It seems so real until the light turns green  
  
Don't wake me up, don't ruin this dream, don't take me from my scene  
  
Keep driving, keep driving,  
Keep driving, keep driving,  
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone  
  
They don't tell you when the music stops,  
Or how the movie ends  
Is it too late once the feeling's gone,  
To back it up and start it all again?  
  
Oh Lord you look so pretty,  
And you can see it in my eyes  
And just before that tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside  
  
(Keep driving) keep driving, driving  
  
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone  
  
(Keep driving) let the meter run,  
(keep driving) don't take me home  
  
(Keep driving) ooh, the night's still young  
  
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) ooh find someone,  
(keep driving) I gotta find someone,  
(Keep driving) find someone,  
(keep driving) find someone,  
(Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving)
