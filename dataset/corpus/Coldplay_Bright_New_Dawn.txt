Hold me tight don't let go  
Forever be yours in this bright new dawn  
Open up your eyes for a big new suprize  
Listen to me now in the bright new dawn  
Fixing what's wrong seeing the people who don't belong we will try to hide are
dispise but it always comes out on the inside.  
Corus: Nobody said it was easy together we can help change the world. come
with me now on this island of love running away from all sivilization Open
your eyes to a bright new dawn  
  
Over all we have done good.  
My heart is beating ever so quickly don't shade your eyes from the bright new
dawn
