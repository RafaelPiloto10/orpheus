A hierarchy  
Spread out on the nightstand  
The spirit of team  
Salvation is another chance  
A sore loser  
Yelling with my mouth shut  
A cracking portrait  
The fondling of trophies  
The null of losing  
Can you afford that luxury?  
A sore winner  
But I'll just keep my mouth shut  
It shouldn't bother me  
But it does  
The small victories  
The cankers and medallions  
They keep me thinking  
That someday  
I might beat you  
But I'll just keep my mouth shut  
The little nothings  
It shouldn't bother me  
But it does  
If I speak at one constant volume at one constant pitch at one constant rhythm
right into your ear, you still won't hear  
You still won't hear  
You still won't hear  
You still won't hear  
You still won't hear  
You still won't hear  
You still won't hear
