Verse:  
  
You are here as we lift you up  
You are riding on our praise  
Be enthroned over everything  
You are seated in our praise  
  
Pre-chorus:  
  
This is prophetic I can feel it in the air  
We lift our praise and you change the atmosphere  
With hearts open now everybody sing it loud  
Oh!  
I am free!  
  
Chorus:  
  
Turn it up this sound of praise  
Make it louder than any other  
Lift him up and shout his name over all  
  
Verse:  
  
As we praise I can feel the change  
As your presence now invades  
Hear the sound of the broken chains  
Prison doors are giving way  
  
Bridge:  
  
Our praise goes up  
Your rain comes down  
Our praise goes up  
Your rain comes down  
  
With shouts of praise we celebrate  
King of glory enter in  
You are riding on our praise  
Oh lord
