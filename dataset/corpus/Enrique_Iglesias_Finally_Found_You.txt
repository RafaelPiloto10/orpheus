You know I'm gon' get ya, yeah  
Whatever it takes to get there  
No, I won't drop you  
Like everybody else does  
  
Forget about your friends they don't care where we go  
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people  
I've been looking for you forever baby we go  
Together baby we go, we go  
  
In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few  
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you  
'Cause I finally found, I finally found you  
You never have to worry if what I say is true  
Girl, I've been looking for you  
And when I saw you I knew, that I finally found,  
I finally found you  
  
I'm coming I'll get ya, yeah  
We have a connection, that's right  
'Cause girl I'm not letting go  
I'm gonna make you feel right, oh yea  
  
Forget about your friends they don't care where we go  
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people  
I've been looking for you forever baby we go  
Together baby we go, we go  
  
In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few  
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you  
'Cause I finally found, I finally found you  
You never have to worry if what I say is true  
Girl, I've been looking for you  
And when I saw you I knew that I finally found,  
I finally found you  
  
I finally found, I finally found you  
  
Okay, so can I get love, too much to ask for  
Really so tough  
Find yourself moving with sex of the drums  
Got my hands full, grabbin' all these girls, girls  
Hands up, hands up, dance floor chillin' while I hold two cups  
Can't stop spilling, 'cause I'm drunk as fuck  
And my song comes on, and the club goes nuts  
Every time the side goes, seems to ya sleep, best that to ya know  
Running around, and doing all these shows  
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl  
And you need to think of it  
Just wrap for the night, baby live a bit  
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip  
You can make a scene and party, are you into it  
  
In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few  
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you  
'Cause I finally found, I finally found you  
  
Finally finally finally found you  
Finally finally finally found  
Finally found, I finally found you  
  
You know I'm gonna get yeah
