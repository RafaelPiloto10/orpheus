It's like jail, it's like flight  
It's a dream that breaks in the middle of the night  
It's like chains, it's like an open door  
Love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
It's coming home, it's lost at sea  
It's a hopeless addiction to sweet misery  
It's the poison, it's the candy store  
Well, love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you  
Oh, it's the one thing that I can't ignore  
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
It's like freedom, it's like a trap  
It's a short trip to Heaven and a long ride back  
Well, dance on the ceiling and crawl on the floor  
And love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you  
Oh, it's the one thing that I can't ignore  
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
I can't hide from the truth, this love I feel for you  
Oh, it's the one thing that I can't ignore  
I know I can't explain the pleasure or the pain  
Your love is everything and nothing I've been looking for  
Well, love is everything and nothing I've been looking for
