Gaston  
  
Crazy old Maurice, hmmm?  
Crazy old Maurice...  
Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking  
  
Lefou  
  
A dangerous pastime  
  
Gaston  
  
I know.  
But that whacky old coot is Belle's father  
And his sanity's only "so-so"  
Now the wheels in my head have been turning  
Since I looked at that loony, old man  
See, I've promised myself I'd be married to Belle  
And right now I'm evolving a plan  
  
Gaston  
  
If I. .. (whisper)  
  
Lefou  
  
Yes?  
  
Gaston  
  
Then we. .. (whisper)  
  
Lefou  
  
No! Would she. ..  
  
Gaston  
  
(whisper) Guess!  
  
Lefou  
  
Now I get it!  
  
Both  
  
Let's go! No one plots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
Takes cheap shots like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
Yes, I'm endlessly, wildly resourceful  
  
Lefou  
  
As down to the depths you descend  
  
Gaston  
  
I won't even be mildly remorseful  
  
Both  
  
Just as long as I (you) get what I (you) want in the end  
  
Gaston  
  
Who has brains like Gaston?  
  
Lefou  
  
Entertains like Gaston?  
  
Both  
  
Who can make up these endless refrains like Gaston?  
And his marriage we soon will be celebrating  
My what a guy Gaston!
