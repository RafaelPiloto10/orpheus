'When all is said and done, there's just you and me.'  
  
Please come out tonight I need you here  
Its been a long, long time and I can't wait  
Let's find out, let's see what it's like out there  
If it rains we'll find somewhere, somewhere dry and warm  
  
You'll say "my, it's been a long, long time"  
I'll say "how are you? I've been fine"  
  
Please come out tonight, let's go out and see the world  
We can try to find, find somewhere  
It seems so long ago, I can hardly remember the time  
It's all I want, it's all I want, so let's see what we find  
  
You'll say "there's so much you need to know"  
I'll say "are you really sure you have to go?"  
  
We don't need a reason, no explanations  
Just stay with me here, tonight  
I won't say a word  
I just need you here  
  
Please come out tonight, let's go out and find ourselves  
You can lean your head on my shoulder, remember?  
  
You'll say "My, is that the time?"  
I'll say "why not stay with me tonight?"  
  
We don't need a reason  
It's so warm inside  
There's no one between us  
If someone comes we can hide  
Just lay here beside me  
Just see what it's like  
  
Please come out tonight
