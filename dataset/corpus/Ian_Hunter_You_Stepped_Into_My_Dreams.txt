That's it baby, take one last look  
We gotta go catch a plane  
Then you won't die, and I won't die  
But we won't ever be the same  
Oh I can feel a mood coming down on me  
Such a good thing disappears  
I can sense the loss creeping up on us  
And it's deeper than any tears I've known  
You stepped into my dreams  
You opened up the door  
You stepped into my dreams  
I want you back for more  
You stepped into my dreams tonight  
In the shadows of the night you're sorry  
In the morning we was gone  
Won't you blow a kiss to me baby  
We both gotta be moving on  
Sometimes you see a lover and she's made for love  
But you let that lover slip by  
You believe and yet she's so hard to get  
And you never know the reasons why  
She stepped into your dreams  
She opened up your door  
She stepped into your dreams  
You want her so much more  
She stepped into your dreams tonight yeah  
Oh when you're doing what you're doing  
What do you think of me babe  
There ain't much else to say  
In another time, in another place  
Things might have turned out okay  
I can feel a darkness I can never conceal  
Sometimes I get just a little insane  
I can feel emotions like the mighty oceans  
They're driving me again, and I know  
You stepped into my dreams  
You opened up the door  
You stepped into my dreams  
I want you back for more  
You stepped into my dreams  
And I don't know what to do  
I'm so scared of losing you.
