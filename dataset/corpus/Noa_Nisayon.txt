Lyrics: Leah Goldberg  
Music: Achinoam Nini  
  
Transliteration:  
Lecha nishba'ati, El elion,  
Velo eda ha'akayem:  
Eich a'amod banisayon  
Nisyon ha'osher hashalem.  
  
Eichah tachil eyni haor ?  
Yaday rafot, yaday hozot --  
Eychah esa velo eshbor  
Simchah kazot, brachah kazot ?  
  
Mikoved ol eich lo epol,  
Eich lefaneicha etyatsev,  
Zkufah, gdolah, noset be'ol  
Shel osher enoshi shalev.  
  
Translation:  
I swore to you, oh Lord  
But unsure of my ploy...  
How can I bear the burden  
Of a perfect joy?  
  
Can my eyes contain the light?  
I'm delirious and weak  
How to keep from shattering  
The happiness that all men seek?  
  
How can I keep my feet on board  
'neath a weight as great as this?  
I want to stand up tall, oh Lord  
And bear the yolk of perfect bliss
