Hey, clowns, have you dug the latest jive on the south side?  
No, man!  
Well they got him.  
They got who?  
You know, that man that's been cooking up that jive,  
Selling it to these folks 'round town,  
Makin 'em have them funny dreams.  
You mean the hoodoo man?  
Yeah!  
Oh no, that cat thought he was just too grand!  
Well gay, somebody done hoodoo'd the hoodoo man  
Smack me down with the story gay  
  
Ol' Joe Hannah from Louisiana,  
A hoodoo king in every manner  
But I found out with out a doubt,  
The tables had turned on him  
  
He ain't got a tooth in his head,  
Poor Ol' Joe is almost dead  
Somebody done hoodoo'd the hoodoo man  
  
10, 10, double 10, 45, 15,  
Joe can't drink no gin  
Ain't nothing go over the devil's back  
That don't buckle under his chin  
  
His face looks just like gravel sand  
And everybody's got Joe on the pan  
Somebody done hoodoo'd the hoodoo man  
  
Somebody done cooked up some stuff in a pot,  
Not too cold and not to hot  
They dropped a few drops in Joe's beef stew  
Now he's blowing his top, he don't know what to do  
  
They don't know who did it  
They can't find out  
But he's done hoodoo'd his last hoodoo without a doubt  
  
Somebody done hoodoo'd  
Done hoodoo'd the hoodoo man
