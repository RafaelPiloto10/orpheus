Willie we've been constant companion you know the light and shade  
We have spent a million dollars find out what we made  
We have made the maidens marvel the things we do and say  
Down down and out brother up up in the way  
If you see me gettin' smaller I'm leavin' don't be grieving  
Just got to get away from here  
If you see me gettin' smaller don't worry and no hurry I've got the right to
disappear  
  
God bless old Philadelphia they were standing in the rain  
Out in front of a main yard wet and lonely train  
Who knows who they came to see a mad man full of beer  
A four piece band and a charter bus my border-line career  
If you see me gettin' smaller
