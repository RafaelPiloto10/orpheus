She told me why  
She told me lies  
I always take care of this  
I told her how  
I've always stayed  
Always waited for nothing  
  
When I get out of here  
Will I leave you behind?  
I found that the years passed despite  
  
When I get out of here  
Will I leave you behind?  
I found that the years passed despite  
  
And I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow  
Yes I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow  
  
When you get out of here  
When you leave me behind  
You find that the years passed us by  
  
When you get out of here  
When you leave me behind  
You find that those years passed us by  
  
And I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow  
Yes I can see you  
Running through the fields of sorrow
