Last week I saw you out  
And I knew we would be a match in heaven  
Just the coolest kind of team  
  
I I know there ain't now way that we won't  
Cuz we won't stop till we go  
Go the distance we're a distance  
Baby I believe it  
I still believe it  
And you know won't be defeated  
In my heart I believe it yeah  
You and me are gonna win it  
  
Baby I'm gonna take you out, take you out, take you out  
We're gonna show this town what I know we're about  
Shoot it run it what's it called?  
Everybody loves it, football.  
Shoot it run it what's it called?  
Everybody loves it, football.  
  
I've got the feeling that this year could be the one  
We're gonna tear it up and burn out everyone  
I I know there ain't now way that we won't  
  
Cuz we won't stop till we go  
Go the distance we're a distance  
Baby I believe it  
I still believe it  
And you know won't be defeated  
In my heart I believe it yeah  
You and me are gonna win it  
  
Baby I'm gonna take you out, take you out, take you out  
We're gonna show this town what I know we're about  
(Shoot it run it what's it called?  
Everybody loves it, football.) x4  
  
New york, london, paris, munich  
Everybody talks about pop music  
(I still believe it  
And you know won't be defeated  
In my heart I believe it yeah  
You and me are gonna win it  
Baby I'm gonna take you out, take you out, take you out  
We're gonna show this town what I know we're about) x2
