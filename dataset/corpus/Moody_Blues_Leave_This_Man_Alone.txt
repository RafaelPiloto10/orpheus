Ah, leave this man alone, Ah, leave this man alone  
Young girls with long faces come to me at night and stay the night  
Why am I so lonely?  
Tell me is it right? (Is it right?)  
Leave them, leave them, leave them, leave those things alone  
Leave them, leave them, leave them, leave those things alone  
Someone said I loved you, but I can't think where (I can't think where)  
You know so much about me  
So don't stand and stare, stand and stare  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave my mind alone  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave this man alone  
Ah, ah, leave this man alone  
Ah, ah, leave this  
Ah, ah, leave this man alone  
Ah, ah, leave this  
Someone said I loved you, but I can't think where (I can't think where)  
You know so much about me  
So don't stand and stare, stand and stare  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave my mind alone  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave this man alone  
Ah, ah, leave this man alone  
Ah, ah, leave this man alone  
Ahhhh
