Teach me a full  
And I'd teach you to sing  
When live keeps stealing your melody  
Around your finger I'll be a string  
I will forget everything I know  
About love, I don't know, about love  
Sure feels good at first  
  
I'd learn to dance if you promise not to laugh  
And I'll end up in a cast  
For falling over  
And you can't get mad when some girl you think I have  
Puts a story in your head  
When I hardly know her so  
About love, I don't know, about love  
Sure feels good at first  
  
Oh, every spring needs a honey bee that stings  
Some things can't change  
Oh, every fire get too close and it reminds you  
Things can change in love  
But Sure feels good at first  
  
For every heartbreak, there's a sermon to be said  
And this pastor in my head's preaching to the choir  
Don't get me wrong cause it's too soon to decide  
But the same in my first rodeo when my heart spent road down town  
In love, I don't know, about love  
But sure feels good at first  
  
Oh, every arm kalescome, that you forgotten  
Some things can't change  
Ooh every frost some live and some are lost  
So things can change in love  
But Sure feels good at first  
  
Na na na na na, na na na na na mmmmmm  
Na na na na na, na na na na na mmmmmm  
  
But sure felt good at first
