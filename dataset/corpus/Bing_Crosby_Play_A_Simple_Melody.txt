Won't you play some simple melody  
Like my mother sang to me  
One with a good old fashioned harmony  
Play some simple melody  
  
Musical demon set your honey a dreaming  
Won't you play me some rag  
Just change that classical nag  
To some sweet beautiful drag  
If you will play from a copy  
Of a tune that is choppy  
You'll get all my applause  
And that is simply because  
I want to listen to rag
