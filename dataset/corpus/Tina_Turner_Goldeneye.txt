See reflections on the water  
More than darkness in the depths  
See him surface and never a shadow  
On the wind I feel his breath  
  
Goldeneye, I found his weakness  
Goldeneye, he'll do what I please  
Goldeneye, no time for sweetness  
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees  
  
You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child  
You'll never know how it feels to be the one who's left behind  
You'll never know the days and the nights, the tears, the tears I've cried  
But now my time has come and time, time is not on your side  
  
See him move through smoke and mirrors  
Feel his presence in the crowd  
Other girls they gather around him  
If I had him I wouldn't let him out  
  
Goldeneye, not lace or leather  
Golden chain take him to the spot  
Goldeneye, I'll show him forever  
It will take forever to see what I've got  
  
You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child  
You'll never know how it feels to get so close and be denied  
It's a gold and honey trap I've got for you tonight  
Revenge is a kiss this time I won't miss  
Now I've got you in my sight  
  
With a goldeneye  
Golden, goldeneye  
With a goldeneye, goldeneye
