When a spirit is broken  
Why go on  
When there's nothing to say  
And a love just a token  
It was strong  
Now it's fading away  
  
Ah but I'm free as a bird  
As I walk right out that door  
You have my word  
I won't bother you no more  
Yes I'm doing alright  
As I face the lonely night  
  
And our love it was over  
Long ago  
But we just didn't say  
And the years they have fallen  
One by one  
How they drifted away  
  
But now I'm free as a bird  
As I walk out that door  
You have my word  
I won't bother you no more  
Yes I'm feeling OK  
As I face the brand new day  
As I face the brand new day  
  
You know I'm free as a bird  
As I walk right out that door  
You have my word  
I won't bother you no more  
Yes I'm doing alright  
As I face the lonely night  
As I face the lonely night  
  
No more sorrows will I find  
I've got tomorrow on my side  
No more teardrops will I cry  
Left my teardrops way behind  
No more sorrows will I find  
I've got tomorrow on my side  
No more teardrops will I cry  
Left my teardrops way behind  
No more heartaches bother me  
Don't wear my heartaches on my sleeve  
  
It's gonna be a brand new story  
What's the use of former glory  
It's better not to do if you can't do right  
It's time to get to celebrating  
After all the years of waiting  
I'm gonna have a ball if it takes all night
