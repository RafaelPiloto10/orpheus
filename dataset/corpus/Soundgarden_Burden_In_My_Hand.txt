Follow me into the desert  
As thirsty as you are  
Crack a smile and cut your mouth  
And drown in alcohol  
'Cause down below the truth is lying  
Beneath the riverbed  
So quench yourself and drink the water  
That flows below her head  
  
Oh no there she goes  
Out in the sunshine the sun is mine  
  
I shot my love today would you cry for me  
I lost my head again would you lie for me  
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand  
I lost my head again would you cry for me  
  
Close your eyes and bow your head  
I need a little sympathy  
'Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone  
Who isn't me  
So kill your health and kill yourself  
And kill everything you love  
And if you live you can fall to pieces  
And suffer with my ghost  
Just a burden in my hand  
Just an anchor on my heart  
Just a tumor in my head  
And I'm in the dark  
  
So follow me into the desert  
As desperate as you are  
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven  
And all the little pigs have God
