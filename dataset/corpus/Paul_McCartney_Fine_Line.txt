A one, two  
  
There is a fine line  
Between recklessness and courage  
It's about time  
You understood which road to take  
It's a fine line  
When your decision makes a difference  
Get it wrong, you'll be making a big mistake  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on brother  
All is forgiven  
We all cried when you were driven away  
Come on brother  
Everything is better  
Everything is better  
When you come home and stay  
  
Whatever's more important to you  
You've got to choose what you want to do  
Whatever's more important to be  
That's the view that you've got to see  
  
There is a long way  
Between chaos and creation  
If you don't say  
Which one of these you're gonna choose  
It's a long way  
And in every contradiction  
Seems to say  
It's a game you are bound to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on back, come on back  
Come on back to me  
  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
Whatever's more important to you  
It's a fine line  
You've got to choose what you want to do  
It's a fine line  
Whatever's more important to be  
It's a fine line  
Well, that's the view that you've got to see  
  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line
