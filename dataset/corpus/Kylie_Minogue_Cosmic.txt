I wanted to write a song called 'Cosmic'  
I wanted to get a view of the earth  
I wanted to be a lonesome cowboy  
I wanted to love you till it hurt  
  
I wanted the right to misbehave  
To say she ain't my crave  
  
[Chorus]  
I put these things aside for years  
'Til laughter took the place of tears  
It's like I was asleep yet now I'm here  
I'm here  
  
I wanted to take your place just sometimes  
To know the things you know and why you did the things you do  
To say 'no' one time and believe it  
Oh I wanted so much but only needed you  
  
Wasn't it just my choice to make?  
The bed in which I lay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanted to be able to talk without the interruption  
I wanted to sing exotic words  
I wanted to find a way to put the end to all of my destruction  
I wanted to re-know what I was worth  
  
But wasn't it just my choice to make?  
The bed in which I lay  
  
[Chorus]
