We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now  
We need you with us  
Come and join us now  
Look inside your mind  
See the darkness is creeping in  
I can see the softness there  
Where the sunshine is gliding in  
Fill your mind with love  
Find the world of future glory  
You can meet yourself  
Where the sour turns to sweet  
Leave your ugly selfish shell  
To melt in the glowing flames  
Can you sense the change  
See your eyes, now you listen  
We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now  
We want you with us  
Come and join us now  
Paint your face all white  
To show the peace inside  
Drift away while the saffron burns  
To the land where the rainbow ends  
Can you sense the change  
See your eyes, now focus  
We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now  
We need you with us  
Come and join us now ...  
We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now  
We need you with us  
Come and join us now  
Look inside your mind  
See the darkness is creeping in  
I can see the softness there  
Where the sunshine is gliding in  
Fill your mind with love  
Find the world of future glory  
You can meet yourself  
Where the sour turns to sweet  
Leave your ugly selfish shell  
To melt in the glowing flames  
Can you sense the change  
See your eyes, now you listen  
We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now  
We want you with us  
Come and join us now  
Paint your face all white  
To show the peace inside  
Drift away while the saffron burns  
To the land where the rainbow ends  
Can you sense the change  
See your eyes, now focus  
We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now  
We need you with us  
Come and join us now ...
