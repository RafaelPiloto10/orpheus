Go west young man the signs all seem to say there's San Diego Frisco or LA  
Leave that cold cold woman far behind warm yourself in that California
sunshine  
Go west young man become a movie star or anything except the fool you are  
Expose the lonely corners of your mind to a little dad of that California
sunshine  
  
I need a change I've headed up to here she's just playing game that's very
clear  
But her play mate will soon be hard to find cause I'll be in that California
sunshine  
  
They say those California girls are fine they know how to really walk your
mind  
Well one of you get ready cause you're mine I'm headin' for that California
sunshine  
I need a change I've headed  
  
Baby I'll be in that California sunshine
