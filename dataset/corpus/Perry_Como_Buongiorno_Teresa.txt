Buongiorno Teresa  
Like the sun you brighten up my day  
Good mornin' Teresa  
Smile at me an' send me on my way!  
You sit by the tower,  
The world rushes by,  
Sell me a flower,  
An' straighten my tie!  
I'll walk home this evening  
Through the lonely market place  
I'll sleep well, I'll dream well,  
Because tomorrow I can say "Buongiorno Teresa"  
I love you more each day!  
  
I'll walk home this evening  
Through the lonely market place  
I'll sleep well, I'll dream well,  
Because tomorrow I can say "Buongiorno Teresa"  
I love you more ( I love you more! ) each day!  
Teresa!  
I love you more each day!  
Teresa!  
I love you more each day!
