(Chorus)  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
  
They say lightning, they say lightning  
Lightning never strikes twice in a row  
  
Generations, generations  
First they fight and then they forget  
What they were fighting about in the first place  
  
Here it comes, the big explosion  
Haven't I seen that once before  
Or is it just some deja vu  
Just some long forgotten dream  
Just some silly memory  
History does not repeat, it never, never does  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Bridge)  
I should know  
I've been hit three times (or was it four?)  
I'm a walking testimony  
Come here, look at these holes  
I'm a walking testimony  
Just look at these holes, look at these holes!  
  
Generations, generations  
Fathers never teach their sons  
And grandpa never talked to them and so on  
  
Memories are inconvenient  
When there's lessons to be learned  
That just might rock the boat too much  
Cause anxiety and such  
We cannot walk without our crutches  
We cannot walk, we cannot walk, we never, never could  
  
(Repeat Chorus and Bridge)  
  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
Hey, what's all the fuss about?  
They say lightning, they say lightning  
Lightning never strikes twice in a row
