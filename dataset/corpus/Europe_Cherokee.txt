They lived in peace, not long ago  
A mighty Indian tribe  
But the winds of change,  
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
The white man's greed, in search of gold  
Made the nation bleed  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.  
  
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.  
  
They were driven hard, across the plains  
And walked for many moons  
Cause the winds of change,  
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
So much to bear, all that pain  
Left them in despair  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.
