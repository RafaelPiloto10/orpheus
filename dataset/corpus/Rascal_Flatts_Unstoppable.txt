Yeah yeah yeah, hey  
  
So, so you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Cracked a rib when you hit the wall  
Yeah, you've had a pocket full of regrets  
Pull you down faster than a sunset  
Hey, it happens to us all  
  
When the cold hard rain just won't quit  
And you can't see your way out of it  
  
[Chorus]  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
You take back what's been taken  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing, don't give in  
It'll come and make you whole again  
It always will, it always does  
Love is unstoppable  
  
Love, it can wear the ring of stone  
Bring you back to being born again  
oh, it's a helping hand when you need it most  
A lighthouse shining on the coast  
That never goes dim  
  
When your heart is full of doubt  
And you think that there's no way out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a river keeps on rolling  
Like the north wind blowing  
Don't it feel good knowing, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is unstoppable  
So you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Love, love is unstoppable
