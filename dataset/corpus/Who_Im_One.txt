Every year is the same  
And I feel it again  
I'm a loser, no chance to win  
Leaves start fallin'  
Come down is callin'  
Loneliness starts sinking in  
  
But I'm one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
You'll all see  
I'm the one  
  
Where do you get  
Those blue, blue jeans  
Faded, patched secret so tight?  
Where do you get  
That walk oh so lean?  
Your shoes and your shirt all just right  
  
I'm one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
You'll all see  
I'm the one  
  
I got a Gibson  
Without a case  
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face  
Ill fitting clothes  
And I blend in the crowd  
Fingers too clumsy  
Voice too loud  
  
But I'm one  
I am one  
And I can see  
That this is me  
And I will be  
You'll all see  
I'm the one  
  
I'm the one  
  
I'm the one!
