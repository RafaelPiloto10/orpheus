Ain't got no heart  
I ain't got no heart to give away  
I sit and laugh at fools in love  
There ain't no such thing as love  
No angels singing up above today  
Girl I don't believe  
Girl I don't believe in what you say  
You say your heart is only mine  
I say to you, you must be blind  
What makes you think that you're so fine  
That I would throw away  
The groovy life I lead  
'cause baby, what you've got, yeah  
It sure ain't what I need  
Girl you'd better go  
Girl you'd better go away  
I think that life with you would be  
Just not quite the thing for me  
Why is it so hard to see my way  
Why should I be stuck with you  
It's just not what I want to do  
Why should an embrace or two  
Make me such a part of you  
I ain't got no heart to give away  
Away  
No no no no no no no  
Ain't got no heart  
Ain't got no heart  
I ain't got no heart to give away
