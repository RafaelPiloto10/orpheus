My friend Fats, he's a hell of a guy.  
Let me tell you why.  
He's the epitome of neighborly.  
  
My friend Fats, he's a hell of a guy.  
Let me tell y'all why.  
He drips personality.  
  
My friend Fats, he's a heck of a Joe.  
You should watch him go,  
Bopping in the band shine  
With a bota bag of fried wine.  
  
My friend Fats, he's a hell of a guy.  
Let me tell you why.  
He's lowbrow nobility.  
  
My friend Fats, he's a jovial sort.  
When he's holding court,  
The anecdotes go round  
And the lager goes down.  
  
My friend Fats, he's a hell of a guy.  
And just as long as he's high  
He has no anxiety  
About his chemical dependencies.  
  
Fats has no concerns  
About the candle that burns  
Both ends simultaneous,  
Both ends simultaneous.  
  
My friend Fats, he's a hell of a guy.  
Let me tell y'all why.  
Not much for punctuality,  
But heck on debauchery.  
  
Fats, he's a hell of a man,  
Can't y'all understand.  
Him taunting his mortality,  
He's unnerved by sobriety.
