I haven't time to sympathise  
With all this nonsense and your lies  
You are the king of nothing  
But you shall hold me  
You've got your finger on the pulse  
And in my pocket, yes of course  
I am the voice of treason  
But you betrayed me  
  
I used up nearly all my luck  
I didn't have to try  
But yesterday is gone  
And now I need an alibi  
If this gets any stranger things are gonna change  
Cause I can't stand the music, always lying  
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)  
I'll keep on right on through it (on through it)  
  
So please believe me when I say  
I wouldn't give the time of day  
Because then I'd be faking  
When I could tell the truth  
Were you abandoned in your youth  
Because if not, you will be soon  
I'm growing tired of waiting  
For you to say goodbye
