Listen here  
You don't have to love me always Cindy  
You don't need to see me every day of the week  
You don't have to notice my brand new shoes  
But please, please say hello some time  
  
You know I've tried to impress you Cindy  
I even lent ya my library book  
I guess you forgot, good God you soon forgot it woman  
I don't mind but please say hello some time  
  
And your mother she can't stand my face  
And your brother keeps me from your door  
But I'll stay around yes I'll stay around honey  
I'll even watch over your garden fence  
  
I've watched your friends Cindy laugh in my face  
But I won't apologize for the way that I am  
If only they knew baby, yes if only they knew  
That you've already spent one night with me honey
