Waiting for darkness  
Doesn't anybody see  
  
Deafened by silence  
Doesn't anybody hear.  
(I'm waiting darkness)  
Playing with fire  
But they're screaming  
When they're burned  
Out of the sunlight  
Hasn't anybody learned  
I know what they find  
Is in their mind  
Its what they want to see  
Spare me from the light  
Here comes the light  
And here I'll stay  
Waiting for darkness  
  
Promise me rebirth  
And then you tear me from the womb  
Give me my freedom  
And then you lock me in a tomb  
  
I'm waiting for darkness  
You gotta believe, you gotta believe its true  
I'm waiting for darkness  
I just can't concieve why darkness is overdue.  
  
Who knows the answers  
Is it friend or is it foe  
Don't ask me questions  
There are things you shouldn't know
