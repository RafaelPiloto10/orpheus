I Go To The River  
Words by Ray Boltz and Brent Alan Henderson, Music by Ray Boltz, Brent Alan
Henderson, and Steve Millikan  
I have walked in a garden  
The morning after the rain  
I have watched in silent wonder  
As everything changed  
Oh, what a gift from the Father  
Is the Water of Life  
Like a river that flows  
Deep in my soul  
Its from an endless supply  
Chorus I:  
Where do I go  
When I'm thirsty and dry?  
I go to the river  
And I always find  
Rest for my soul  
Peace for my mind  
I go to the river  
When Jesus prayed in the garden  
His brow was furrowed with pain  
And what appeared to be drops of blood  
Were falling down like the rain  
He found strength for the journey  
He found it down on His knees  
And where He knelt a river flows  
And it flows for you and me  
Chorus I  
Chorus ii:  
What do I do  
When I'm covered with stains  
I go to the river and I wash them away  
Everythings new  
Everythings changed  
I go to the river  
Its a river of healing  
Its a river of faith  
Its a river of gladness  
Its a river of grace  
Its a river of mercy  
Its a river of love  
Its a river of freedom  
Its a river of blood  
Chorus I, chorus ii  
Chorus I, chorus ii
