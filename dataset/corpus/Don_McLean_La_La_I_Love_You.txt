If you wanna make me happy  
Here's all you gotta do  
Just take me where you're going  
And I'll take care of you  
'Cause I've got this need that's growin'  
To keep you satisfied  
And if you keep your green light showin'  
Then you can take me for a ride  
  
'Cause I la la la la la la love you  
And I la la la la la la care  
And I really want you with me baby, everywhere  
  
Well I like the way you're movin'  
And I like the way you go  
Well I like the way you let your  
Locomotion show  
'Cause my drivin' wheel is drivin'  
And my pistons are workin' good  
And if your motor gives you some trouble, baby  
I'll take a look underneath your hood  
  
'Cause I la la la la la la love you  
And I la la la la la la care  
And I really want you with me baby, everywhere  
  
Well, I know you like your transportation  
With a motor and a rubber wheel  
But when you move you cause a transformation  
In this lover and the way I feel  
  
So if you wanna make me happy  
Here's all you gotta do  
Just let me ride your box car  
And I'll hobo with you  
'Cause all I got is on my shoulders  
I'm walkin' on my travellin' shoes  
And before I get much older  
I'm gonna kick these lovesick blues  
  
And I la la la la la la love you  
And I la la la la la la care  
And I really want you with me baby, everywhere
