Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way  
There's something wrong your love is gone I've no reason now to stay  
We live and love we meet and part and broken hearts must pay  
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way  
Your love sweetheart I won't forget you're always on my mind  
You're all the happiness I knew so thoughtful sweet and kind  
For old time sake I'm asking you to think of me some day  
And let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way  
[ guitar ]  
I wish you happiness sweetheart in everything you do  
May good luck always come your way and every dream come true  
I'll remember you and the love we knew our love of yesterday  
So let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
