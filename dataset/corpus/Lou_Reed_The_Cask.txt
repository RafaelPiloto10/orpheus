[Edgar:]  
Never bet the devil your head  
When I was an infant  
My mother treated me like a tough steak  
To her well regulated mind  
Babies were the better for beatings  
But she was left handed  
And a child flogged left handed  
Is better left unflogged  
The world revolves from right to left  
It will not do to whip a baby from left to right  
If each blow in the right direction  
Drives an evil propensity out  
A blow in the opposite direction  
Knocks it's quota of wickedness in  
Hence my precocity in vice  
My sensitivity to injuries  
The thousands of injuries heaped upon me by Fortunato  
And then finally his rabid insults for which I vowed revenge  
I gave no utterance to threat  
But the knowledge of "avengemenship"  
Was so definite so precise  
That no risk could befall me  
By neither word  
Nor deed had I given cause to doubt my good will  
I would punish with impunity  
I will fuck him up the ass and piss in his face  
I will redress the wrong  
But lips and psyche  
Mind be silent  
Fortunato approaches  
  
[Fortunato:]  
Don't take me to task  
For loving a cask  
The cask of Amontillado  
Please don't make a pass  
You can go kiss my ass  
All I want is this mythical cask  
The cask of Amontillado  
I've heard so much through the grapevine  
I've heard so much on the line  
But the one thing that I lust after  
Is the one thing I've never had  
So is it too much to ask  
Too have just one taste of the cask  
Why you could go kiss my ass for the cask  
Of Amontillado  
Edgar old fellow  
Dear bosom friend  
Hail fellow well met  
Oh great elucidator  
Great epopee  
  
[Edgar:]  
Haha..
