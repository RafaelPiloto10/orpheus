The cats were on the table  
They were waiting for their dinner  
'Til the children came and shooed them all away  
  
Daddy's at the racetrack  
Desperate just to pick one winner  
Will he ever be their hero of the day  
Mom paid the price  
She sacrificed for nothing of value  
And why is it I buy this shit  
That nobody wants to  
  
More love for the money  
That's all I'm after  
More buzz for the honey  
And a bit more laughter  
  
Why is that so much to ask  
More for the money  
Baby better get mine fast  
  
At the mall again  
I'm feeling desperate and uncertain  
God it's got to be here somewhere I believe  
My demographic profile  
Knows it's show time  
Raise the curtain  
Start the comedy and let me be naive  
  
A circus flea from A to be  
I jump for my keeper  
In search of true enlightenment  
For ten per cent cheaper  
  
More love for the money  
That's all I'm after  
More buzz for the honey  
And a bit more laughter  
  
Why is that so much to ask  
More for the money  
Price had better come down fast  
  
If there's a place beyond these shadows  
Of this dreary road I tread  
Then for me that's all that matters  
Just the promise of arriving  
Maybe getting there before I'm dead  
  
More love  
More love for the money  
Now keep it coming  
More buzz for the honey  
They'll all come running  
  
Put it right here in my hand  
More for the money  
Get me to the promised land  
More for the money  
Get me to the promised land
