In the cool of the evening  
I don't know the reason  
But I long to touch  
Some young tender hearts sometimes  
So I go to this party  
With a bunch of me hardies  
They say don't get too cute  
Don't get too smart  
'Cause these people are crazy  
They toot coke and drink wang-too  
And they talk in some crazy tongue  
There's a slit-eyed lady  
Say'n don't you be so stupid  
I may be old but I'm still good fun  
Still good fun  
Yeah I'm still good fun  
  
Well I ain't that choosy  
I'll flip-flop with a floozy  
If I figure there's no strings attached  
But sometimes I loose my feet  
Underneath the back seat  
And I have to fly my heart at half mast  
Well this old bitty  
She was smart and she was witty  
She was really out of control you know  
It was stumble or fall  
I had my back to the wall  
I didn't know to bet on win, place or show  
  
Chorus:  
Welcome to Chinatown, she said  
I'm gonna lay your body down, she said  
I ain't no queen, but I'm wearin' this crown  
She said  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown  
  
Well she shimmered and she shook  
What she wanted she took  
She shook like some rickshaw ride  
She stuck her fingers down my throat  
'Till I almost choked  
I thought I'd gone heaven and died  
Well she took me by the ear  
And said what do you want to hear boy  
You want to hear those crazy old lies  
I said nothing you can say girl  
Can drive me away  
Just check my complexion  
Make sure I'm still alive  
  
Chorus:  
Welcome to Chinatown, she said  
I'm gonna lay your body down, she said  
I ain't no queen, but I'm wearin' this crown  
She said  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown
