I'd say it was the right time  
To walk away  
When dreaming takes you nowhere  
It's time to play  
Bodies working overtime  
Your money don't matter  
The clock keeps ticking  
When someone's on your mind  
  
I'm moving in slow motion  
Feels so good  
It's a strange anticipation  
Knock, knock, knocking on wood  
Bodies working overtime  
Man against man  
And all that ever matters  
Is baby who's ahead in the game  
Funny but it's always the same  
  
Playing, playing with the boys  
Playing, playing with the boys  
After chasing sunsets  
One of life's simple joys  
Is playing with the boys  
  
Said it was the wrong thing  
For me to do  
I said it's just a boys' game  
Girls play too  
  
My heart is working overtime  
In this kind of game  
People get hurt  
I'm afraid that someone is me  
If you want to find me, I'll be  
  
Playing, playing with the boys  
Staying, playing with the boys  
After chasing sunsets  
One of life's simple joys  
  
I don't want to be the moth around your fire  
I don't want to be obsessed by my desire  
I'm ready, I'm leaving  
I've seen enough  
...with the boys  
I've seen enough  
You play too rough  
  
Playing, playing with the boys  
I'll be staying, playing with the boys  
After chasing sunsets  
One of life's simple joys  
Is playing with the boys  
Playing with the boys  
Playing  
Playing  
Playing  
Playing
