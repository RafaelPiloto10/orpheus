Christmas wish  
  
Can't believe it's Christmas time  
And you're not here with me  
Guess some things are really just not meant to be  
I thought I'd spend these cold December nights with you  
And as the yuletide carol plays  
I'd feel the warmth of your embrace  
  
But life goes on  
I'll count my blessings and be on my way  
Everyday, I think of what the season means and pray  
That all the love the little baby in a manger gave  
Would fill my soul  
And make the heartache go away  
And someday  
  
Refrain:  
I'll wake to Christmas morning  
And the right one will be there  
I won't stop dreaming though so many times  
I've gotten nowhere  
And so I sing this song to those  
Who feel the same way too  
Let this be our Christmas wish this year  
  
Instrumental:  
  
That all the love the little baby in a manger gave  
Would fill my soul and lake the heartache go away  
And someday  
  
Repeat refrain
