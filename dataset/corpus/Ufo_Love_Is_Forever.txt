(instrumental intro)  
I don't want to settle down  
Stop my heart and turn around  
Rebel nature, just got to be free  
I'm in the right place, right place to be  
Washers, dryers, dealers, and souls  
Looking into the fire  
Flat caps, whippets, lovers, and wives  
Balanced out on the wire  
And she said  
Love is forever babe  
Love is a tool  
Servant for jesus  
A slave for a fool  
I look out through love's back door  
I escape but not any more  
Revelation help me see  
I'm in the wrong place, the wrong place to be  
Washers dryers dealers and souls  
Looking up to rise higher  
Flat caps whippets lovers and wives  
Balanced out on the wire  
And she said  
Love is forever babe  
Love is a tool  
Servant for jesus  
Slave for a fool  
Love is for worshipped  
Love is a test  
Love is a firebrand burnin'  
A hole in her breast  
Love is ...  
(instrumental)  
Washers dryers dealers and souls  
Looking into the fire  
Flat caps, whippets, lovers and wives,  
Balanced out on the wire  
And she said  
Love is forever babe  
Love is a tool  
Servant for jesus  
Slave for a fool  
Love is for worship  
Love is a test  
Love is the firebrand burning  
A hole in her breast  
Love is a blossom  
Love is a lie  
She said be careful boy  
This ain't no wild cherry pie  
Love is forever, love is forever, love is forever (fade out immediately)
