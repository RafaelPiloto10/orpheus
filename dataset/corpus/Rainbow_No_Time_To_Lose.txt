The other family gets no sleep  
Somewhere down the love got to take and keep  
Think about the future, nothing in the past  
God, things never last  
  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take your love  
Get down, get down, get down  
Down the road  
  
It ain't no lie  
You're hurting  
And you don't know why  
No time to lose  
We get no time to lose  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
  
Ever had the feeling something's going wrong?  
Hanging 'round a lover where you don't belong  
Waiting for a reason, lookin' for a clue  
But you know what you gotta do  
  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take your love  
Get down, get down, get down  
Down the road  
  
It ain't no lie  
You're hurting  
And you don't know why  
You got no time to lose  
We get no time to lose  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
  
Your brother's at the bar  
Three girls in the car  
Your sister's on the telephone  
That ain't low  
Your mother's going blue  
Your dad is going gray  
There's nothing here for you to stay  
  
Come on, come on, come on  
Take your love  
Get down, get down, get down  
Get down that road, get down you  
  
It ain't no lie  
You're hurting  
And you don't know why  
No time to lose  
No time to lose  
You gonna have to choose  
You go and shake the blues  
You got no time to lose  
You got to choose  
No time to lose
