I can't play these games with you no more  
I get my fingers caught inside the door  
Now everything I say is just a joke  
Spend my money now you leave me broke  
Living someone's life in clear blue skies  
Fairy tales and dreams and alibis  
All you want from me are things for you  
Use me til I don't know what to do  
You live in your own world anyway  
Twisting every single thing I say  
In my hometown I feel out of place  
Change my name and find a different face  
  
You tell me  
No more cool Mr. Wonderful  
No more nice Mr. Clean  
No more cool Mr. Ideal  
It's driving me out of my mind  
  
Yeah  
I can hear the wolves outside the bar  
Sometimes I don't know which one you are  
Imitation's all that you accept  
Shadows of myself that you once met  
Bottles in the alley break and smash  
Get into the car for one-car crash  
  
You tell me  
No more cool Mr. Wonderful  
No more nice Mr. Clean  
No more cool Mr. Ideal  
It's driving me down  
Driving me down to my knees  
  
No more cool Mr. Wonderful  
No more nice Mr. Clean  
No more cool Mr. Ideal  
It's driving me down to my knees  
  
Mr. Wonderful  
No more nice Mr. Clean  
No more cool Mr. Ideal  
It's driving me out of my mind  
  
No more cool Mr. Wonderful  
No more nice Mr. Clean  
No more cool Mr. Ideal  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No way Mr. Wonderful  
No way  
No way  
Ideal  
Wonderful  
Ideal  
Wonderful  
Ideal
