Well this car could be systematic  
Hydromatic  
Ultramatic  
Why it could be Greased Lightning! (Greased lightning!)  
  
We'll get some overhead lifters and some four barrel quads  
Oh yeah  
(Keep talking, whoa, keep talking)  
A fuel injection cutoff and chrome plated rods oh yeah  
(I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money)  
With a four speed on the floor, they'll be waiting at the door  
You know that ain't no shit, we'll be getting lots of tit  
In Greased Lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
Go Greased Lightning, you're burning up the quarter mile  
(Greased Lightning, go Greased Lightning!)  
Go Greased Lightning, you're coasting through the heat lap trial  
(Greased Lighting, go Greased Lightning)  
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for Greased Lightning  
  
We'll get some purple French tail lights and thirty inch fins  
Oh yeah  
A Palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins  
Oh yeah  
With new pistons, plugs, and shocks I can get off my rocks  
You know that I ain't bragging, she's a real pussy wagon  
Greased Lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
(Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning  
Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning!)
