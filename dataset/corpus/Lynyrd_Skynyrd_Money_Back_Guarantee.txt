She's on the left, I'm on the right  
Oh, here comes trouble and I  
Ain't even seen her yet  
Oh, she's something I'll regret  
She's got it good, I got it bad  
Can't seem to get her walk  
And her talk outta my head  
Oh, you know I'm just a mess  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it up, give it up  
Give it to me  
Can't you see honey  
I'm down on my knees  
Wanna feel your touch  
I need you so much  
Don't you know I come with  
A money back guarantee  
(Oh you ain't gonna get my money)  
  
I'll buy the house, you drive my car  
I'll take you anywhere  
Oh, you can call my bluff  
I will shower you with  
Diamonds and rings  
I'll feel a little angel baby  
Can't you see  
  
Wanna feel your touch  
I need you so much  
Don't you know I come with  
A money back guarantee  
Oh, you can have it all baby  
Here it comes, here it comes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah oh oh  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Yeah yeah  
Money back, money back guarantee  
Yeah, yeah, oh the girl I see  
Oh, you can have it all baby  
Say baby, money back guarantee  
Oh, you can keep your  
Money back guarantee
