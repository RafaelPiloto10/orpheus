Well hello there  
My it's been a long, long time.  
How ya doing? How am I doing?  
Well I guess I'm doing fine.  
But it's been so long, but it seems like  
It was only yesterday.  
  
Ain't it funny how time slips away.  
  
Well how's your new love, how's your new love.  
Well I hope he's doin fine.  
I heard you told him, I heard you said "you'd love him til the end of time"  
Now that's the same thing you told me it seems like just the other day  
  
Ain't it funny how time slips away.  
  
Well I've got to go now, I've got to go.  
Well I guess I'll see you around.  
I don't know when though, cause I don't know when I'll be back in town.  
But remember what I tell you cause in time your gonna pay.  
  
Ain't it funny how time slips away.  
Oh it's suprising how time slips away.
