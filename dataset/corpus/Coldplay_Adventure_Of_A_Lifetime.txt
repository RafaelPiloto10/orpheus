[Verse 1]  
Turn your magic on  
Umi she'd say  
Everything you want's a dream away  
We are legends, every day  
That's what she told me  
  
[Refrain]  
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say  
Everything you want's a dream away  
Under this pressure, under this weight  
We are diamonds  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Now I feel my heart beating,  
I feel my heart underneath my skin  
And I feel my heart beating  
Oh, you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
Alive again  
Oh, you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said I can't go on, not in this way  
I'm a dream I die by light of day  
Gonna hold up half the sky and say  
Only I own me  
  
[Chorus 2]  
And I feel my heart beating  
I feel my heart underneath my skin  
Oh, I can feel my heart beating  
Cause you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
Alive again  
Oh, you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
  
[Refrain]  
Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say  
Everything you want's a dream away  
Under this pressure, under this weight  
We are diamonds taking shape  
We are diamonds taking shape  
Repeated: (Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
  
[Bridge]  
If we've only got this life  
This adventure, oh then I  
And if we've only got this life  
You get me through  
And if we've only got this life  
This adventure, oh then I  
Want to share it with you  
With you, with you  
Yeah I do  
  
[Outro]  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
