Dont let the sun catch you crying  
The nights the time for your tears  
Your heart may be broken tonight  
But tomorrow in the morning light  
Dont let the sun catch you crying  
  
The night-time shadows disappear  
And with them go all your tears  
But the morning will bring joy  
For every girl and boy, so  
Dont let the sun catch you crying  
  
They say that cryings not a bad thing  
But stop your crying when the birds sing  
  
It may be hard to discover  
That youve been left for another  
But dont forget that loves a game  
And it can always, always come again  
  
So, dont let the sun catch you crying  
Dont let the sun catch you crying  
Oh, no, no, no, no
