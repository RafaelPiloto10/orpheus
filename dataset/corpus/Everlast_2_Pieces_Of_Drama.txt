Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire  
He rocks a big blue ? cable, a ping pong table for a ring  
He's mentally unstable, to him murder it ain't no thing  
He'll do you dirty style, he's holding dirty vile  
He's out pumping on the corner, trying to stay warm and keep it cool like
Miles  
He keeps it fundamental  
He's got the jeans and the bubblegoose on  
There's murder on his mental  
He's got the deuce deuce in his palm  
And y'all know the fable, how Cain did Abel  
Ever since the beginning, the world keeps spinning just like a turntable  
Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire  
La la la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la  
When it's selling out back, likes to pump crack  
To the fiends that be getting high  
He keeps a hand on the pump, he's ready to dump  
On any chump that would even try  
He got a finger on the trigger, he ain't scared to pull it  
Head full of liquor, boy you might catch a bullet  
The hoes in the stable and drugs on the table  
Everybody's sittin' round watchin' cops on the cable  
Dressed like a slob, keeps his hair braided  
He's never been robbed, he's only been raided  
He's never known joy, the boy is so jaded  
He's never been loved, he's only been hated  
His soul's on ice, his heart is stone  
Just another dead king rotting on his throne  
With a pain that would cut you down to the bone  
You're born alone, boy, you die alone  
Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire  
Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall  
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall  
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire  
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire
