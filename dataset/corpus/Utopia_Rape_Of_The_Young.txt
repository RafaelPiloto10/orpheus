Hey Mister Exxon  
Won't you have pity  
Won't you have pity on the guiltless ones  
Hey Mister Chrysler  
Won't you think about it  
Won't you think about it? Judgment Day has begun  
What will become of tomorrow's children  
Who gives a damn for tomorrow's children  
Pay no mind, you just keep on takin'  
Keep on takin' 'til there's nothing at all  
Sit on your hands and don't say nothin'  
Cover your eyes, you won't see nothin'  
Cry for the innocent sent to war  
(Don't tell a soul)  
Shed a tear for the one's waiting at the door  
(They'll never know)  
It's the last generation of a world gone blind  
(You better watch your tongue)  
It's the violation of the unborn child  
It's the rape of the young  
Hey Mister General  
Can't you find something  
Can't you find something else to do for a buck  
Hey Mister President  
Nobody listens  
Nobody listens 'til we've run out of luck  
Nobody cares for unborn troubles  
Why should you care, it's too much trouble  
You got yours so it just don't bug ya  
It just don't bug ya 'cause you won't be around
