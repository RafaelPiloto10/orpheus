A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails  
An' all the wood I can find  
I'll build me a cabin on top of the hill  
Got all the plans in my mind . . .  
Where the tree tops talk to the wind  
Where the eagle flies  
I'll bring her to see it the minute I'm through  
Won't she light up with surprise!  
A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails  
An' just my two hands, but with some help from above  
The walls will start risin', the roof will go on  
The final touch will be love . . .  
Where the tree tops talk to the wind  
Where the eagle flies  
The preacher will bless us as we hurry to  
Our happy home in the skies . . .  
As soon as we're married,  
We're movin' in to  
Our happy home in the skies . . .  
( A hatchet, a hammer, a bucket of nails . . . )  
Our happy home in the skies . . .
