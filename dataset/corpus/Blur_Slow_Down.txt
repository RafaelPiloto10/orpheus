It's up to you  
You know it is  
I can't convince you  
All you have to do is  
Slow down  
  
I've always said  
It will never change  
All you have to do  
Just you be you  
I think that's all I want to say  
  
All these things  
That I told you  
I didn't mean at all  
I didn't mean at all  
I'd forget you  
  
So if you come here  
If you come here  
All you have to do  
Just you be you  
I think that's all I want to say to you
