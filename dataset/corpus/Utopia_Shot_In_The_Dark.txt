Shot In The Dark Lyrics  
Everyday it's the same old situation  
I face the same old line of empty faces  
Sit at my desk while the clock counts up my wages  
  
Pick up my pay every Friday and take off like a  
Shot in the dark  
I took off like a shot in the dark  
I split the scene like a shot in the dark  
  
Ain't got no target, don't aim for no mark  
'Cause I'm off like a shot in the dark  
It was only a game when we first started  
The novelty wore away and the fun departed  
  
I can't live up anymore to those things I spouted  
And if you say you feel the same way  
I'll be off like a  
Shot in the dark  
  
There's no changes going down  
There's no lesson to be found  
Makes no sense to hang around  
If that's all there is to that  
  
(That's what she said)  
Someone just tossed a bomb through  
Kitchen window  
And in the middle of a shoo-fly pie  
  
Mama took off like a  
Bat out of hell  
She took off like a shot in the dark
