You can't win them all  
'Cause sometimes you fall flat on your face on the floor  
You can't win them all  
It's no good at all if you feel that your life is a bore  
  
You've got to hang loose to keep from the noose  
And you've got to learn to use your brain  
You've got to live right and keep to the right  
Then, you're free if you don't go insane  
  
I've seen a lot of people  
They've all blown it out  
You can't win them all is what they all shout  
You've got to keep tryin'  
Got to stand up a gain  
You can't lose them all, babe  
'Cause one day you'll win  
  
You've got to have taste or life is a waste  
And you don't ever tune yourself in  
You've got to keep on or they'll get you, my son  
And they know that you just can't win
