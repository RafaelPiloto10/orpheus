Just a shoulder to cry on  
That's all I've been to you  
Just someone to rely on  
When your world is empty and blue  
  
I'm just someone you call dear  
Anytime you choose  
I'm someone you run to  
Someone you use  
  
I'm just someone to talk to  
And that's all I'll ever be  
Just a clown you can laugh with  
Someone to treat as you need  
  
I'm just a fool you can love on  
Any time you choose  
I'm just someone you run to  
Someone you use  
  
I'm just someone you run to  
I'm just someone you use  
Don't you know when you need me  
My little heart just can't refuse  
  
I'm just someone who loves you, baby  
I can't win and I can't lose  
I'm just someone you run to  
I'm just someone you use
