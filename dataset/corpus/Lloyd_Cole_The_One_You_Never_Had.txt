Well, I don't know, but I've been told and  
Seen what you've left behind  
And I don't know if I like what I see  
When it's knocking at my door  
  
[Chorus:]  
And you don't know if you're laughing or crying  
And I don't know if I care  
'Cause I know right here  
I've got me something that you never had  
You might laugh, but what are you looking at?  
Sending your own valentines to the one you never had  
  
Well, I don't know, but I've been told and  
Seen what you've left behind  
And all those ladies you left standing on the corner  
They're laughing at you now  
  
(You never had, you never had)  
So you drink all night and you sleep all day  
'Cause you see what you've left behind  
And standing on the corner - hey lady, got a quarter?  
She's passing you by  
  
[Chorus]
