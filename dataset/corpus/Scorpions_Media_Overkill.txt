They're watching me  
They're watching you  
Taking all the world under control  
They make you laugh  
They make you blue  
In the end they try to eat your soul  
  
Satellites transmit the latest thrill  
We can't escape the media overkill  
  
A purple flash  
The biggest crash  
Totally in tune around the world  
They take you high  
They make you cry  
We are at the point of no return  
  
Satellites transmit the latest thrill  
We can't escape the media overkill  
  
Over and over and over
