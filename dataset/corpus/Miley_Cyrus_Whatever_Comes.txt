Hey, I see you trying to tell them all about me  
Saying that I'm just a wannabe well guess what  
I don't need nobody else to help me on my way, I'm fine  
  
Hey hey, I hear you've started rumours 'bout my family  
Telling everybody that I'm in it for the money  
I'd give it all away before I'd let your words get through, alright?  
  
Cos somebody out there, somebody somewhere loves me for me and nobody else
will...  
Stop me from dreaming, stop me from believing  
I'm on my own tonight  
  
(Chorus:)  
And whatever comes, whatever goes  
Whatever happens I'll be fine  
I am strong, the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
I'll pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again, up again...  
  
You, I know you're trying to get me angry and mad  
I don't care I'm not gonna resort to being nasty  
I don't need nobody else to help me on my way, I'm fine  
  
You, you, I betcha any money that you're lonely  
Making me feel worse than yourself (yourself, yoursefl)  
I'd give it all away before I'd let your words get through, alright?  
  
Cos somebody out there, somebody somewhere loves me for me and nobody else
will...  
Stop me from dreaming, stop me from believing  
I'm on my own tonight  
  
(Chorus:)  
And whatever comes, whatever goes  
Whatever happens I'll be fine  
I am strong, the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
I'll pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again, up again...  
  
You can say whatever cos whatever comes I'll beat ya baby  
You can say whatever cos whatever comes I'll shine!  
  
(Chorus:)  
And whatever comes, whatever goes  
Whatever happens I'll be fine  
I am strong, the world is mine  
And I suppose that if the doors close  
I'll pick up my strength and bash it down and build it up again, up again...
