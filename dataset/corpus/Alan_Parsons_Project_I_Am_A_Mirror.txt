Suppose I were to tell you that the meaning of dreams  
Is not all that it seems and the ultimate truth is a lie.  
And you are just a puppet who can dance on a string.  
Do you feel anything?  
Would you laugh? Would you care? Would you cry?  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery, how can anyone disagree?  
And the music is a symphony which we play in a minor key.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
So if you are confused and don't know which way to go.  
You will certainly know. From the moment we're living we die.  
And if it's all a crazy game you don't want to play  
Tell me what you can say.  
It's a joke. It's the truth. It's a lie.  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery that we don't understand.  
And the music is a rhapsody if you're happy the way that you are.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
And the meaning of life is a mystery though we live it from day to day.  
But the music of live should be harmony so that anyone here can play.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.
