Sister moon will be my guide,  
in your blue blue shadows I would hide.  
All good people asleep tonight  
I'm all by myself in your silverlight  
I would gaze at your face the whole night.  
Though I'd go out of mind but for you  
I'd go out of my mind but you  
  
Lying in a mother's arms  
the primal root of a woman's charms.  
I'm a stranger to the sun my eyes are too weak  
How cold is a heart when it's warmth that it seeks?  
You watch every night, you don't care what I do  
I'd go out of my mind, but for you  
I'd go out of my mind, but for you  
  
My lover's eyes are nothing like the sun.  
My hunger for him explains everything I've done  
To howl at the moon the whole night through.  
And they really don't care if I do  
I'd go out of my mind but for you.
