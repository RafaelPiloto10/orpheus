Suddenly the night has grown colder.  
The god of love preparing to depart.  
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,  
They slip between the sentries of the heart.  
  
Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure,  
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine  
And radiant beyond your widest measure  
They fall among the voices and the wine.  
  
It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving,  
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.  
  
Even though she sleeps upon your satin  
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.  
Do not say the moment was imagined  
Do not stoop to strategies like this.  
  
As someone long prepared for this to happen,  
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in.  
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing.  
Your firm commitments tangible again.  
  
And you who had the honor of her evening,  
And by the honor had your own restored  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving  
Alexandra leaving with her lord.  
  
Even though she sleeps upon your satin  
Even though she wakes you with a kiss.  
Do not say the moment was imagined  
Do not stoop to strategies like this.  
  
As someone long prepared for the occasion  
In full command of every plan you wrecked  
Do not choose a coward's explanation  
that hides behind the cause and the effect.  
  
And you who were bewildered by a meaning  
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.  
  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving.  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost.
