So many people tried to help me on my way  
So little time and there's so much left to say  
There's no explainin' all the things I've been through.  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I finally found my to you  
I finally found my way to you  
  
Now the day is ending and the night begins to fall.  
Sometimes I wondered if I'd make it back at all  
I gave up everything I had and never knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember how we used to hide away.  
We'd share the secrets of or souls  
Turned down the lights and dance the night away  
We'd dance the night away.  
We'd dance the night away.  
We'd dance the night away.  
Remember how we used to hide away.  
We'd dance the night away.  
We'd dance the night away.  
And now I'll hold you like I never have before.  
I'll let you go just long enough to lock that door.  
The words I whisper come so late and over due  
  
[Chorus]
