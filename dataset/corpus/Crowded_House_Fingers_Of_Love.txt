Can you imagine that  
An itch too sensitive to scratch  
A light that falls through the cracks  
An insect too delicate to catch?  
  
I hear the endless murmur  
Every blade of grass that shivers in the breeze  
And the sound, it comes to carry me  
Across the land and over the sea  
  
And I can't look up  
Fingers of love move down  
And I can't look back  
Fingers of love move down  
  
Color is it's own reward  
Color is it's own reward  
The chiming of a perfect chord  
Let's go jumping overboard  
  
Into waves of joy and clarity  
Your hands come out to rescue me  
And I'm playing in the shallow water  
Laughing while the mad dog sleeps  
  
And I can't look up  
Fingers of love move down  
And I won't be helped  
Fingers of love move everywhere  
And there is time yet  
To fall by the way  
  
From the cradle to the grave  
From the palace to the gutter  
Beneath the dying rays of the sun  
Lie the fingers of love  
  
Into waves of joy and clarity  
A fallen angel walked on the sea  
And I'm playing in the shallow water  
Laughing while the mad dog sleeps  
  
And I can't look up  
Fingers of love move down  
And I won't be helped  
Fingers of love move everywhere  
  
And there is time yet  
For you to find me  
And all at once  
Fingers of love move down
