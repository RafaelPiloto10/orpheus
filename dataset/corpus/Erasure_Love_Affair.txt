It's not just a love affair, it's all or nothing  
Do I bet it all on love? Or change and freak out?  
When the chances come my way, will they up and disappear?  
Will it ever go my way? Or am I out of here?  
  
There'll be tears before your bedtime, you mark my words  
You wanted more than I could give you  
You wanted more than you could have  
  
It's not just a love affair, it's now or never  
Could I give it all to you? Is that what we're about?  
If I hold you, will you stay? Or will you up and disappear?  
Be forever and a day, like your letter said  
  
There'll be tears before your bedtime, you mark my words  
You wanted more than I could give you  
You wanted more than you could have  
  
When the chances come my way, will they up and disappear?  
Will it ever go my way? Or am I out of here?  
  
There'll be tears before your bedtime, you mark my words  
You wanted more than I could give you  
You wanted more than you could have  
  
More than you could have  
More than you could have  
More than you could have
