No I can't forget this evening,  
Or your face as you were leaving.  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes.  
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows.  
Yes it shows.  
  
No I can't forget tomorrow,  
When I think of all my sorrow,  
When I had you there but then I let you go.  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
What you should know  
  
I can't live, if living is without you.  
I can't give, I can't give any more.  
Can't live, if living is without you.  
Can't give, I can't give any more.  
  
No I can't forget this evening,  
Or your face as you were leaving.  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes.  
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows.  
Yes it shows.  
  
I can't live, if living is without you.  
I can't give, I can't give any more.  
Can't live, if living is without you.  
Can't give, I can't give any more.  
  
I can't live, if living is without you.  
I can't give, I can't give any more.  
Can't live, if living is without you.  
Can't give, I can't give any more.
