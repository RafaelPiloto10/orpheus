I'm digging my way  
I'm digging my way to something  
I'm digging my way to something better  
  
I'm pushing to stay  
I'm pushing to stay with something  
I'm pushing to stay with something better  
  
I'm sowing the seeds  
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken  
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted  
  
This thorn in my side  
This thorn in my side is from the tree  
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted  
  
It tears me and I bleed  
And I bleed  
  
Caught under wheels' roll  
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me  
Can't stop to save my soul  
I take the leash that's leading me  
I'm bleeding me  
I can't take it  
Caught under wheels' roll  
The bleeding of me  
Of me  
The bleeding of me  
  
I am the beast that feeds the feast  
I am the blood, I am release  
  
Come make me pure  
Bleed me a cure  
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under  
  
Caught under wheels' roll  
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me  
Can't stop to save my soul  
I take the leash that's leading me  
I'm bleeding me  
I can't take it  
I can't take it  
I can't take it  
The bleeding of me  
  
I'm digging my way  
I'm digging my way to something  
I'm digging my way to something better  
  
I'm pushing to stay  
I'm pushing to stay with something  
I'm pushing to stay with something better  
With something better
