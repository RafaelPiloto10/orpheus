Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring-ting-tingling too,  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo",  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
Let's go, let's look at the show,  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
It's grand, just holding your hand,  
We're riding along with a song  
Of a wintry wonderland.  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy,  
And comfy cozy are we,  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be,  
Let's take that road before us,  
And sing a chorus or two,  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
There's a birthday party  
At the home of Farmer Gray,  
It'll be the perfect ending to a perfect day,  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop,  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop.  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy,  
When they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie,  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives,  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember through all our lives!  
  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two,  
As you one can see, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.  
  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two,  
As you one can see, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you
