Someone's drinking all alone  
Someone's left the TV on  
I don't suppose  
No I don't suppose  
  
Someone's sleeping in my bed  
Someone's let the genie in  
I don't suppose  
No I don't suppose  
  
You know who you are  
Who you are  
Who you are today  
  
Baby's gone and died again  
Taken by the tide again  
And it's no surprise  
She hates goodbyes  
  
Someone's folding paper planes  
Someone's on the line again  
Someone's crying at the sonnet  
Someone's hiding from someone  
  
I don't suppose, no I don't suppose  
You know who you are  
Who you are  
Who you are today
