I wish you wouldn't say that  
I thought I'd have to come right over  
I thought I made it clear enough  
I guess I'll have to make it clearer  
  
Say something to change your mind  
Bring me back the way I used to be  
If it takes forever that's all right  
Say the words that I've been trying to hear  
  
I wish you didn't tell her  
I thought o'd have to come right over  
I thought I'd have to make it clearer  
Now jimmy's coming over  
  
There are places that I won't forget  
And I guess I'm never going back  
Guess it's information that I lack  
I've told lies without a hint or regret  
  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that...
