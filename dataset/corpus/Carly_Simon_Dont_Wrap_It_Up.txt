I'll take some of this, I'll have some of that  
And several more of these  
Now that I see it, I know what I like  
So I'll like it if you please  
I ain't nobody's princess, stuck in Sunday School  
So I'll help myself to love  
And have the whole career  
Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here  
  
Just look at you now, the ultimate guy  
Class and wit and style  
Once I might have pretended, to be someone else  
Attracting you with guile  
But now I'm not about to dress up, in some other woman's shoes  
I've got nothing to lose  
So I'll help myself to love,  
Gather round and cheer  
Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here  
  
I've stood there patiently waiting in line  
A take-out man's an O.K. plan  
If you've got lots of time  
Especially if he's biodegradable  
  
I ain't nobody's princess  
I ain't nobody's fool  
So I'll help myself to love  
There's nothing more to fear  
Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here
