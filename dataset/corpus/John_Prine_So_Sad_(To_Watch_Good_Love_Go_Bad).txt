We used to have good times together  
But now I feel them slip away  
It makes me cry to see love die  
So sad to watch good love go bad  
  
Remember how we used to feel dear  
You said nothing could change you mind  
It breaks my heart to see us part  
So sad to watch good love go bad  
  
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue  
When I know for certain that I'm losing you  
  
Remember how we used to feel dear  
You said nothing could change your mind  
It breaks my heart to see us part  
So sad to watch good love go bad  
So sad to watch good love go bad
