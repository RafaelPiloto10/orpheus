Oh Belladonna never knew the pain  
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe it'll drive you insane  
The open letter just carelessly placed  
And you move in silence, the tea so delicately laced  
  
Out of reach, out of touch  
How you've learned to hate so much  
  
Came from passion, and you gave it a name  
The fingers are poisoned like needles in the drivin' rain  
So smile discreetly as you watch with such grace  
Now I must slip away, but can you forget my face
