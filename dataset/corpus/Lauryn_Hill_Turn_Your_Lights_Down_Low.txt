(Lauryn - Uh)  
Turn your lights down low  
And-a pull your window curtain  
Oh let Jah moon come shining in  
Into our life again  
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time (Lauryn - Long, long time)  
I kept this message for you, girl  
But it seem I was never on time  
Still I wanna get through to you, girl?  
On time, on time (Lauryn - What)  
I want to give you some love  
I want to give you some good, good loving (Lauryn - Mm, mm mm)  
Oh I, oh I, oh I (Lauryn - Yeah)

Turn your lights down low (Word, word word)  
Never ever try to resist, oh no (No, no, no)  
Oh let your love come shining in (No, no, no)  
Into our lives again (No, no, no)  
Saying: ooh, I love you (I love you, I love you)

Yeah, uh uh  
Loving you (Loving you) is a like a song I replay (Baby, is so beautiful)  
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day (Uh)  
And every chorus (Uh) was written for us to recite (Right)  
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night  
This potion might, (Uh)this ocean might (Uh) carry me (Uh)  
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me  
And every word, every second, and every third  
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (Uh)  
And when I play 'em, every chord is a poem  
Telling the Lord how grateful I am because I know him  
The harmonies (Word) possess a sensation similar to your caress (Uh)  
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes (Yes, yes)  
Stand in love, take my hand and love Jah bless  
Right, right  
  
[Bob]

I want to give you some good, good loving (Lauryn - Yeah, uh uh)  
Turn your lights down low (Lauryn- Right, right now)  
And-a pull your window curtains  
  
[Lauryn]  
(I said right, right now)  
And let Jah love come tumbling in (Right, right now)  
Into our lives again (Uh, uh said right, right now)
