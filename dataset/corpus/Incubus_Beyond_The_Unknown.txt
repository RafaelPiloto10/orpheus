Perfect night  
The moon shines bride  
But covered with blood  
Because this is an evil night  
Calls for a sign  
Is what the invokers are meditating  
The souls from beyond  
Are hearing them calling  
Moving objects  
Sinister sounds in the air  
Nerves tense  
Hands holding tight  
You can fell it answering everywhere  
The seekers are happy  
Thinking that they are hearing  
The voice from their loved one  
Chorus  
Beyond the unknown  
Powerful spectre  
Closing in  
Is it a dream  
Or is it true  
Beyond the unknown  
Communication begun thru the incarnated body  
Of the spiritual leader  
Questions are asked, answers correct  
But they don't the real horrors  
Behind the spirit of the dead  
Ceremony is over now  
Relatives left in satisfaction  
Knowing that he's resting in eternal peace  
Days have passed  
Then there was a knocking at the door  
Live in the flesh  
The missing one that they thought was dead  
Memories coming back  
Realizing what they have heard  
Was nothing but a malignant force  
Telling them nothing but lies  
Chorus  
Beyond the unknown  
Powerful spectre  
Closing in  
Is it a dream  
Or is it true  
Beyond the unknown
