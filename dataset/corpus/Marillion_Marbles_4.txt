IV  
That was almost the end of my marbles  
Confiscated, I choked back the tears  
I hung onto a handful of favourites  
That disappeared over the years  
  
Did anyone see my last marble  
I swear that I had it before  
Sometimes I think I should go see a shrink  
In case he can find me some more  
  
Did anyone see my last marble?  
I'd saved it to give it away  
Since I was a youth  
Now I don't have no proof  
Only words  
Only words  
Only words.
