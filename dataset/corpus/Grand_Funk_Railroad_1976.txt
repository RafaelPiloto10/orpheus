Hey ...  
  
Ohhhh ...  
  
Oh, happy birthday america.  
Lord knows you ain't no sweet sixteen.  
But, we love you 'cause you're beautiful america.  
We still believe in the american dream.  
  
We better all keep remembering this land now.  
This land full of people been' gettin' their kicks lord, lord.  
I think we all better pick up the sticks.  
In 1976.  
  
God put man on this planet.  
But man forgot that he was heaven sent.  
Man takes the planet for granted.  
I thought american people would 'a had more sense.  
  
We better keep all remembering this land now.  
This land full of people bent on gettin' their kicks lord, lord.  
I think we all better pick up the sticks.  
In 1976.
