I've got a delicate mind  
I've got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides  
With your furniture  
I've got a delicate mind  
I've got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides  
With your furniture  
I'm an electric wire  
And I'm stuck inside your head  
I'm a hungry Mohican  
I've got a razor blade smile  
So don't come near me  
I've got a singular style  
Fifteen senses  
Are on my plate  
All the things  
That you love to hate  
I'm an electric wire  
I'm stuck inside your head  
Where I go to no one knows  
Find me where the cold wind blows  
Where I go to no one knows  
Find me where the cold wind blows  
(Regrets)  
I've got a delicate mind  
(Regrets)  
I've got a dangerous nature  
And my fist collides  
(Regrets)  
With your furniture  
(Regrets)  
I've got a delicate mind  
I've got a dangerous  
And my fist collides  
With your furniture  
(Regrets)  
I'm an electric wire  
I'm an electric wire  
I'm an electric wire  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
Black is red and red is white  
In this country I do what I like  
(Regrets)  
I said, "Black is red"  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
Do what I like  
(Regrets)  
That's right, that's right, that's right  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
Red is white  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)  
(Regrets)
