How does my north connect to my south  
How does my heart connect to my mouth  
How does my skin connect to my soul?  
Is the sum of my parts  
Anything whole?  
  
What do my eyes reveal of my dreams  
How can I laugh when inside I scream  
How does my song connect to my name?  
Can they be ever  
One and the same?  
  
N I want you  
N I need you  
N I, n I, ninininineed you  
N I want you  
N I need you  
N I n I n I  
  
And I want to set my insides loose  
Come to terms and sign a truce  
If I can't find the mystery code  
How will I ever  
Carry this load?  
  
N I want you...  
  
And I know you're getting tired of the fight  
To connect my left side with your right  
To connect two arms and legs and all four chambers  
Of the heart  
And understand forever - who we are.  
  
How can we live with anguish and fear  
How can we shelter all that is dear  
How can we take our fate in our hand?  
I'm talkin' to you -  
You'll understand.  
  
That I want you, n I need you  
N I, n I, ninininineed you....  
  
The universe begins with you and I  
Universe begins with you. N. I.
