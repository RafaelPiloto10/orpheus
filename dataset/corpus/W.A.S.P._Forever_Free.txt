I ride all alone and can't see The road to nowhere anymore And  
Shadows whispers are calling me To forbidden forrests by the  
Shore And there she fell deep in the night One breath away from  
Heaven's light And she said- don't cry for me, I'm leaving you  
  
The wind cries her name in the breeze But I can't hold her  
Anymore Some fallen angel had come to me And fell to heavy on my  
Soul And stole from me the love that I heard Lords of time say  
Never die And said- don't cry for me, cause I'll be Riding the  
  
Wind forever free High in the wind forever free I'll ride the  
Wind forever free High in the wind forever free Forever free  
Forever in my hearts afire, a fire burning I wake up nights and  
Hear her crying, crying my name Riding the wind forever free  
  
High in the wind forever free I ride the wind forever free High  
In the wind forever free Forever free
