Once upon a time  
Somewhere in the back of my mind  
I fell in love with you  
But then  
Everything went wrong  
I couldn't even write a song  
There was nothing to look forward to  
I don't go out very much  
I'm always home on my own  
Baby, I was just too blind to see  
I wanted to conquer the world  
But the world had a mind of its own  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you away too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you  
So sing and all the world will shine  
Somewhere in this nursery rhyme  
A happy ending lies  
For all the lovers with the lonely eyes  
Easy come, easy go  
This is just to let you know  
Baby, I apologize  
How could I turn away love?  
How could I turn into stone?  
How could I turn my back on you?  
I wanted to be a success  
But success ever leaves you alone  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you way too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you
