Oh my my what have we done?  
Guess we had a little too much fun  
But what comes down, goes up again  
  
Don't you worry about me my friend  
I'll boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
I'll boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
  
The resist only made a mess of you  
You wrecked your car and you cracked your tooth  
Come and sing our sewer song  
Whether we get loud and we get strong  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
  
Ah, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Ah, boot and rally, boot and rally  
  
Brother my brother, my oldest friend  
Vull yourself back up again  
Don't you be no graveyard man  
Time to finish what you began  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally
