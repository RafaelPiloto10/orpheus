I come home from work this evening  
There was a note in the frying pan  
It said fix your own supper babe  
I run off with the Fuller brush man  
Chorus:  
And I miss the way she used to yell at me  
The way she used to cuss and moan  
And if I ever go out and get married again  
I'll never leave my wife at home  
Sat down at the table  
Screamed, and I hollered and cried  
And I commenced a carryin' on  
Till I almost lost my mind  
Repeat Chorus  
If I ever see another salesman  
Come a knockin' at my door  
I'm gonna pick up a rock and hit him on the head  
And knock him down on the floor  
Repeat Chorus
