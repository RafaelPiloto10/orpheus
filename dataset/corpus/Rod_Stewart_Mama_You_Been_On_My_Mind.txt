Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat  
And coverin' the crossroads I'm standing at  
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that  
But mama you been on my mind  
  
I do not mean you trouble, don't put me down, don't get upset  
I am not pleadin' or sayin' I can't forget you  
I do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet  
Mama you been on my mind  
  
Even tho' my eyes are hazy  
And my thoughts they might be narrow  
Where you been don't bother me, or bring me down with sorrow  
I don't even mind where you be wakin' up tomorrow  
But mama you been on my mind  
  
I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no  
Please understand me, I've no place I'm calling you to go  
I'm just whisperin' to myself so I can pretend that I don't know  
Mama you been on my mind  
  
When you wake up in the mornin' baby, look inside your mirror  
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near  
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear  
As someone who has had you on his mind  
As someone who has had you on his mind  
Mama you been on my mind
