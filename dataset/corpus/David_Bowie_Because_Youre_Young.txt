Psychodelicate girl  
Come out to play  
Little metal faced-boy  
Don't stay away  
They're so war-torn and resigned  
She can't talk anymore  
What are they trying to prove?  
What would they like to find?  
  
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)  
These pieces are broken (like I say)  
These pieces are broken  
Hope I'm wrong but I know  
  
CHORUS  
Because you're young  
You'll meet a stranger some night  
Because you're young  
What could be nicer for you  
And it makes me sad  
So I'll dance my life away  
A million dreams, a million scars  
  
He punishes hard  
Was loving her such a crime  
She took back everything she said  
Left him nearly out of his mind  
They're people I know  
People I love  
They seem so unhappy  
Dead or alive  
  
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)  
These pieces are broken (like I say)  
These pieces are broken  
Hope I'm wrong but I know  
  
CHORUS  
  
A million dreams  
A million scars  
A million (repeat ad inf.)
