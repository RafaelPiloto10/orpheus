So tall, silent against the sky  
Up through the clouds where eagles fly  
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong  
They cut but never change, what stood so long  
  
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky  
Life's for the taking  
  
Like a man is a mountainside  
Greatness waits for those who try  
None can teach you, it's all inside  
Just climb  
  
I am in the ground, I am in the air  
I am all, I live in the hearts of men  
I am the call to greatness  
Not all can hear  
  
I awaken the creator in those who dare  
And the day will come, when we all must die  
And enter the mountainside  
  
I have no fear  
Death and glory  
Both draw near
