How could he know this new dawn's light  
Would change his life forever?  
Set sail to sea but pulled off course  
By the light of golden treasure  
  
Was he the one causing pain  
With his careless dreaming?  
Been afraid  
Always afraid  
Of the things he's feeling  
He could just be gone  
  
He would just sail on  
He would just sail on  
  
How can I be lost?  
If I've got nowhere to go?  
Searched the seas of gold  
How come it's got so cold?  
How can I be lost  
In remembrance I relive  
How can I blame you  
When it's me I can't forgive?  
  
These days drift on inside a fog  
It's thick and suffocating  
This seeking life outside its hell  
Inside intoxicating  
He's run aground  
Like his life  
Water's much too shallow  
Slipping fast  
Down with the ship  
Fading in the shadows now  
A castaway  
  
Blame  
All gone  
Away  
  
Blame gone away  
  
How can I be lost  
If I've got nowhere to go?  
Search for seas of gold  
How come it's got so cold?  
How can I be lost  
In remembrance I relive  
And how can I blame you  
When it's me I can't forgive?  
  
Forgive me  
Forgive me not  
Forgive me  
Forgive me not  
Forgive me  
Forgive me not  
Forgive me  
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?  
  
Set sail to sea but pulled off course  
By the light of golden treasure  
How could he know this new dawn's light  
Would change his life forever  
  
How can I be lost  
If I've got nowhere to go?  
Search for seas of gold  
How come it's got so cold?  
How can I be lost  
In remembrance I relive  
So how can I blame you  
When it's me I can't forgive?
