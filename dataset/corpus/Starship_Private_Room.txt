Know what she's done to me, and I have been around  
She sure can bring you pleasure, and she can bring you down  
I should not tell you, if you want to learn  
To take a tip from me now, don't turn your back on her  
  
When she's promising you pleasure all night long  
She may turn around and cut you to the bone  
  
Chorus:  
In a private room, she'll dance for you  
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes  
In a private room, she'll take your heart  
And with you under her control, she will leave you all alone, all alone  
  
I was a midnight runner on her side of town  
I used to get there early, to watch her dance around  
She had this way of movin', to tantalize a crowd  
When she lays eyes on you, you'd better watch out  
  
While she's promising you pleasure all night long  
She may turn around and cut you to the bone  
  
In a private room, she'll dance for you  
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes  
In a private room, she'll take your heart  
And when you're under her control, she will leave you all alone, all alone  
  
She's no angel  
  
Late at night she might get lonely, I know what she really needs  
Someone who can hold her all night long, all night long, in a private room  
  
In a private room, she'll dance for you, oh yeah  
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes, not too much more  
In a private room  
  
In a private room, she'll dance, she'll dance, dance for you  
  
Oh!
