Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
Too-ra-loo-ra-li  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
Hush now, don't you cry  
  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
Too-ra-loo-ra-li  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
That's an Irish lullaby  
  
Over in Killarney, many years ago  
My mother sang a song to me in tones so soft and low  
Just a simple little ditty in her good old Irish way  
And I'd give the world if I could hear that song of hers  
today  
  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
Too-ra-loo-ra-li  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
Hush now, don't you cry  
  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
Too-ra-loo-ra-li  
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral  
That's an Irish lullaby
