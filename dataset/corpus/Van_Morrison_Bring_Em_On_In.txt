Spoken:  
All these wise guys trying to put us down  
We gonna bring 'em on in  
An' bring 'em on home  
  
Sings:  
See them stumbling by the way side  
See them stumbling by the way side  
Though it won't sail, 'cross the water, yeah  
Row-in boats a-cross the water  
Pick them up baby, row them on  
Bring 'em on in, bring 'em on home  
  
Well, I was driving, in my Jag-you-are  
Do-in' ninety miles an hour  
I was driving up a clear way  
It was just my luckiest day  
An I, kept speed up  
An I, rowed these boats  
A-bring 'em on in  
A-bring 'em on in  
  
Bi-do-a, di-do-a, di-do-a-do  
  
Now, I went walking down by Queensway  
When I met a friend of mine  
He said, "Come on back, back to my pad  
We will have a nice time  
If you pick me up, row me on  
Bring me in, bring me in  
  
When I stepped off the boat  
And I walked upon the, dry land  
Slowly, to the car park  
And I jumped in, out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Bring 'em in, bring 'em on in, bring 'em in  
  
Ay-o-lotta, o-li-otta, o-li-otta, o-li-otta  
O-li-otta, o-ah  
  
Bring 'em in baby, bring 'em on in  
Hey-hey now  
Bring 'em on home  
Bring 'em in, hey-hey-hey  
Bring 'em on home, all right  
Bring 'em on home  
  
I said, pick me up, baby  
Row me home, bring me in, hey  
  
Bi-do-a, i-o-le, o-le-a, o-le-a  
O-la-te-do-da-la  
Alright  
  
Bi-oh-da-e-da-ee-da-o-a-la  
Alright
