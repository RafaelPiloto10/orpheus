He put it on me, I put it on,  
Like there was nothing wrong  
It didn't fit,  
It wasn't right  
Wasn't just the size  
They say you know,  
When you know  
I don't know  
  
I didn't feel  
The fairytale feeling, no  
Am I a stupid girl  
For even dreaming that I could  
  
If it's not like the movies,  
That's how it should be, yeah  
When he's the one,  
I'll come undone,  
And my world will stop spinning  
And that's just the beginning, yeah  
  
Snow white said when I was young,  
"One day my prince will come"  
So I wait for that date  
They say its hard to meet your match,  
Find my better half  
So we make perfect shapes  
If stars don't align,  
If it doesn't stop time,  
If you cant see the sign,  
Wait for it  
One hundred percent,  
With every penny spent  
He'll be the one that,  
Finishes your sentences  
  
If it's not like the movies,  
That's how it will be  
When he's the one,  
And my world will stop spinning,  
And that's just the beginning  
  
Oh yeah,  
Cause I know you're out there,  
And your, your looking for me  
It's a crazy idea that you were made,  
Perfectly for me you'll see  
  
Just like the movies  
That's how it will be  
Oh but that's how it should be  
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending  
Oh it's not like the movies,  
Oh but that's how it should be  
When he's the one,  
You'll come undone,  
And your world will stop spinning,  
And it's just the beginning
