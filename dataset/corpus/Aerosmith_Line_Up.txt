If you think that you're strong  
Wanna fight well come on  
And line up  
When the goin' gets tough  
And your talk ain't enough then come on  
And line up  
We gotta get up, get out before they get us down  
'Cause livin' up against the wall, yeah  
Has got us locked up  
Come on and line up  
So don't be surprised  
When they pull the wool over your eyes  
Yeah, don't get funked up  
If you got all the stuff  
And you can't get enough  
Then line up  
If you're out on a limb  
And you wanna come in  
Then line up  
Your head's down, sittin' 'round  
Pick yo face up off the ground  
And get yourself together baby  
And learn to stand tough  
Come on an line up  
We better get to it  
Instead of just standin' around  
It's time to get down  
If you're playin' to win  
Then your only way in  
Is line up  
If we all wanna live  
Then we all gotta give  
Line up  
We gotta get up, get out  
Before they get us down  
'Cause livin' up against the wall, yeah  
Has got us locked up  
Come on and line up  
You better get to it  
Instead of just standin' around  
Yeah, it's time to get down  
If you got all the stuff  
And you can't get enough  
Then line up - line up  
If you think that you're strong  
Wanna fight well come on  
And line up - line up
