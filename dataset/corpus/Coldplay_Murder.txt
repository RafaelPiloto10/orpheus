Tie me to a tree  
Tie my hands above my head  
Sing a song to me  
Sing a song like what you said  
  
Cause they're gonna murder me  
They're gonna take me down  
Something  
I crumble down  
  
Come spit at us  
Come and throw your weight around  
Come and fight with us  
Come and rock me to the ground  
  
Cause they're gonna murder me  
They're gonna take me down  
Something  
I crumble down  
  
So what can it possibly be?  
Oh what can it possibly be?  
Oh what can it possibly be?
