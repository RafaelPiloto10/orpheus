Please don't ask me how I feel, I feel fine  
Oh I cry a bit, don't sleep too good, but I'm fine  
When can I see you?  
When can I see you?  
  
Again and again I ask myself was I wrong?  
Oh but time's a healer, and heaven knows I've been strong  
Maybe we could try  
Maybe we could work this time  
  
I can remember when it was easy to say I love you  
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do  
  
But I can try  
I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world  
But I miss my boy  
I hope he's good as gold  
  
But enough of me, tell me how are you? You look good  
Oh you've lost weight I can see, your hair looks nice, you look good  
Maybe we should try, don't say it! I know why  
  
I can remember when it was easy to say I love you  
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do  
  
But I can try  
I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world  
But I miss my boy  
I hope he's good as gold
