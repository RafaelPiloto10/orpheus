Long time ago in Bethlehem,  
So the holy Bible say,  
The Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,  
Was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing,  
A new King was born today,  
And man will live forever more,  
Because of Christmas Day.  
  
And you know when I was in school,  
We used to sing it something like this, listen here:  
  
While the good shepherds watching their flocks by night,  
Them see a bright new shining star,  
They hear the heavenly choir just singing a song,  
That the music seemed to come from afar.  
  
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about:  
Now, Joseph and his sweet wife, Mary,  
You know, God come to Bethlehem that night,  
Them find no place, yes he did, to born that she child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
Alvin singing and listen:  
  
(By and by they find a little nook)  
(In a stable all forlorn, )  
(And in a manger cold and dark, )  
(Mary's little boy was born.)  
  
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this  
(Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen to what they say)  
Trumpets sound, I love you and angels sing, you see,  
Oh, Lord, be careful, listen what they say,  
And you oughta love him for it,  
'Cause that, that, that, that man will live,  
He told me he would, forever more,  
(Because of Christmas Day).  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I thank you Lord  
(Christmas Day).
