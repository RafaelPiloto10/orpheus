The hero he rode a white horse  
Across the desert to where his woman was  
He'd been riding for four days  
When he saw the tower where she was locked  
  
In the moonlight he left his old steed  
Near the drawbridge that he crossed  
And by way of a rope ladder  
He tip-toed to where his woman was  
  
If I recall you're the actor  
Who followed the stars  
Searching for  
The lost city of Mars  
  
Hoping time would heal the scars  
Knowing fate held no bars  
Are you the one  
That I think you are?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?  
  
The madman climbed  
The steeple spire  
"Go higher" said the crowd  
From down below  
  
"But, the world's on fire" cried the madman  
From the steeple spire  
"You're a liar" cried the crown  
From down below  
  
The madman climbed the steeple spire  
And let a crystal ball tear  
Fall on the crown  
From down below  
  
If I recall you're the actor  
Who took to the stage  
Set the world ablaze  
With your anger and your rage  
  
With every new leaf  
You turned and wrote a new page  
Cleverly concealing  
Your real age  
  
Those that knew you  
Were always quite amazed  
Are you the one  
Who can take this praise?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?  
  
"You're the only one"  
"who can save us"  
Said the wizard  
"Or all is lost"
