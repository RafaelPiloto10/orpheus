Saturday at midnight  
See you at the red light  
Don't want to be alone  
Saturday at midnight  
  
I can't wait for a call  
It's just not my style  
Been alone too long  
But in a little while  
When night closes in  
And lights are gettin' bright  
Makes it all worthwhile  
Makes it all worthwhile tonight  
  
Saturday at midnight  
See you at the red light (bad scene, man)  
Don't want to be alone  
Saturday at midnight  
  
I work hard every day  
Every day of my life  
My reward is to make a better life  
'cause I live for the weekend  
And what I want to do  
Is search for that someone  
So my dreams come true  
  
Saturday at midnight  
See you at the red light (bad scene, man)  
Don't want to be alone  
Saturday at midnight  
  
There's a lot of things  
That seem to go round  
Like the world and the love and the fun  
There's a lot of things  
That seem to go round  
But the girls and the love I get none  
  
Saturday at midnight (i don't want to go home)  
Saturday at midnight  
I can't wait for a call  
It's just not my style  
Been alone too long  
But in a little while  
When night closes in  
And lights are gettin' bright  
Makes it all worthwhile  
Makes it all worthwhile tonight  
  
Saturday at midnight (ha, ha, ha)  
See you at the red light (bad scene, man)  
Don't want to be alone
