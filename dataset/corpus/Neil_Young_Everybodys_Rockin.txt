When grandma and grandpa  
Get out on the floor  
They rock until they drop  
And then they rock some more  
Yeah, everybody's rockin',  
Well, everybody's rockin'  
Everybody's rockin',  
Rockin' to the dancin' beat.  
  
From the shakey city  
Down to New Orleans  
The Golden Gate  
To the Bronx and Queens  
Everybody's rockin',  
Yeah, everybody's rockin',  
Well, everybody's rockin',  
Rockin' to the dancin' beat.  
  
When Ronnie and Nancy  
Do the bop on the lawn  
They're rockin' in the White House  
All night long.  
Everybody's rockin',  
Everybody's rockin',  
Everybody's rockin',  
Rockin' their blues away.  
  
Everybody's rockin',  
Rockin' their blues away  
Everybody's rockin',  
Rockin' all night and day.  
  
Everybody's rockin',  
Everybody's rockin'  
Yeah, everybody's rockin',  
Everybody's rockin'  
Everybody's rockin',  
Rockin' to the dancin' beat.  
Everybody's rockin',  
Dancin' to the rockin' beat.
