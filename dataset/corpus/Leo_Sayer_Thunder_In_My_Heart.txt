Standing here alone with you  
Wondering what it is that I'm supposed to do  
And there you are with the love light in your eye  
The bridges are burnt down  
Your arms are open wide  
Am I in too deep or should I swim to the shore  
Is this the real thing?  
  
I don't know but I've never been here before  
And I feel a thunder in my heart that I can't control  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Should I walk away or follow my soul?  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Where it comes from I just don't know  
  
Oh no, oh no  
  
There's a storm ragin' deep in my soul  
There's a howlin' wind that I just can't control  
There'sa fire inside me I can't explain  
Every time you touch me my love falls like rain  
I've only known you for an hour or more  
The time is standin' still  
Your love has opened up the door  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
It takes my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Will I ever be the same?  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
It's telling me you're here to stay  
  
Oh no, oh no  
  
There's a thunder in my heart  
There's a thunder in my heart  
There's a thunder in my heart  
There's a thunder in my heart  
  
Take me baby I'm all yours  
Do just what you wanna do with my love  
Let's not let the night overtake us  
'Cause what's happening right now may make or break us  
Do you feel the way I do?  
Open up your heart now baby  
I'm comin' through  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Takin' my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Since I met you I'll never be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
I know you're here to stay  
  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Takin' my breath away  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
Since I met you I'll never be the same  
I feel a thunder in my heart  
I know you're here to stay
