[Hook]  
Gold in my champagne  
Your shit blank, boy your shit lame  
Probably just like your dick game  
So I don't need to know your name  
Don't you see these on my feet?  
Bet you can't guess how much I paid  
That's a shame  
Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane  
  
[Verse 1]  
Who the fuck told you to not have no chill?  
Who the fuck told you we splittin' that bill?  
Who the fuck told you that I'm in the hood?  
When you know fuckin' right I'm in Beverly Hills  
Why you keep starin' at me like you know me?  
Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginobili  
ESPN, photoshootin' with Kobe  
You Photoshop bitches be needin' Adobe  
Oh, oh, that's some baloney  
Oh, this is Missoni  
Oh, you are still lookin' for Kony  
Would tell you to call me, but I am not phony  
Oh, why your car got a cheap gear?  
Mothafucka in his car with some cheap gear  
I'm draped in McQueen, Balmain on my jean  
Ask Givenchy and Marie Claire
