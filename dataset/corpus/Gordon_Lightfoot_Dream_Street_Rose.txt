You've been in all my dreams since you've been gone  
Each mornin' that I wake up with the dawn  
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile  
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while  
  
You gave more than anyone could ask  
You washed away all shadows from my past  
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows  
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes  
Dream Street Rose let us not pretend  
Heaven knows will you love me  
Right 'til the end  
  
Somewhere in between there stands a dream  
The sweetest dream that we have ever seen  
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile  
Dream Street Rose please stay with me a while  
Dream Street Rose I miss you when you're gone  
Heaven knows I'm gonna love ya  
From now on  
  
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile  
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while  
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows  
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes
