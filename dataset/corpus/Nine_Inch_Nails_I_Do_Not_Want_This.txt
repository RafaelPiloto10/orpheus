I'm losing ground  
You know how this world can beat you down  
I'm made of clay  
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way  
I'm always falling down the same hill  
Bamboo puncturing this skin  
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm  
Drowning in  
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face  
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
You don't know just how I feel  
I stay inside my bed  
I have lived so many lives all in my head  
Don't tell me that you care  
There really isn't anything, is there?  
You would know, wouldn't you?  
You extend your hand to those who suffer  
To those who know what it really feels like  
To those who've had a taste  
Like that means something  
And oh so sick I am  
And maybe I don't have a choice  
And maybe that is all I have  
And maybe this is a cry for help  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
I do not want this  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
Don't you tell me how I feel  
You don't know just how I feel  
I want to know everything  
I want to be everywhere  
I want to fuck everyone in the world  
I want to do something that matters
