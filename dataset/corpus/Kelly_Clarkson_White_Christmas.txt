I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten, and  
Children listen to hear  
Sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white
