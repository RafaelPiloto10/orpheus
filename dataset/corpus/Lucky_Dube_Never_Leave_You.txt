We were only eighteen years old  
Didn't know much about anything  
The only thing we knew was this love  
That we have for each other  
You were the millionaire's daughter  
I was the grave digger's son  
They told me to keep away from you  
They told you to stay away from me  
Look at us now, we are living our dreams  
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood.  
Love is thicker than blood.  
Love is thicker than blood.  
Take your time, take your time  
Take your time don't hurry  
We have all aternity ahead of us.  
Chorus  
I will never, I will never leave you.  
No matter what happenes, no matter where life  
Takes us, I will never leave you.  
Take your time take your time love me  
Take your time, we have all etrnity ahead of us.  
You had a chance to be, with anyone you want  
You chose to be with me.  
Even though you knew, I had nothing to my name  
You still love me  
You were the millionaire's daughter  
I was the grave digger's son,  
They told me to keep away from you  
They told you to stay away from me  
Look at us now, we are living our dreams  
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood  
Love is thicker than blood.  
Take your time take your time  
Take your time love me  
We have all eternity ahead of us  
Chorus  
I will never, I will never leave you, I will never,  
I will never leave you  
No matter what happenes, No matter where life  
Takes us, I will never leave you.
