Strategic angles indirectly revealed  
Uniting human form and manufactured heels  
Go buy in a hurry, buying your chance  
You give your best by loving a classic  
Immoderation seems to suit her best  
But then I turn around and she's very delicate  
  
Go buy in a hurry, get all you can  
Give her your best ?  
Time has no pull on her soul  
When she is here I'm her doorman  
I'm ?  
  
Oh the coronation when she walks by  
Even if it's private makes you end your mind  
Buy in a hurry, go get all you can  
You give your best for loving a classic  
For loving a classic  
For loving a classic
