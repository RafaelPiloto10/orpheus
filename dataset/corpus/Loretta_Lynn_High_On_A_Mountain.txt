High on a mountain top  
We live, we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the world's like a little bitty spot  
I ain't comin' down, no, never I'm not  
High on a mountain top, high on a mountain top  
  
Where I come from, the mountain flowers grow wild  
The blue grass sways like it's goin' out of style  
God fearin' people, simple and real  
'Cause up on the ridge, folks that's the deal  
  
Well my daddy worked down in the dark coal mine  
Shovelin' that coal, one shovel at a time  
Never made a lot money, didn't have much  
But we're high on life and rich in love  
  
High on a mountain top  
We live, we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the world's like a little bitty spot  
I ain't comin' down, no, never I'm not  
High on a mountain top, high on a mountain top  
  
Well down in the holler lived my uncle Joe  
He'd pull out his fiddle and rosin his bow  
We'd all sing and dance and we ain't gonna stop  
And the moon shine flows behind every rock  
  
High on a mountain top  
We live, we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the world's like a little bitty spot  
I ain't comin' down, no, never I'm not  
High on a mountain top, high on a mountain top  
  
Well, we lay on our backs and we count the stars  
'Cause up here folks Heaven's not that far  
  
High on a mountain top  
We live, we love and we laugh a lot  
Folks up here know what they got  
High on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
Where the rest of the world's like a little bitty spot  
I ain't comin' down no never I'm not  
High on a mountain top, high on a mountain top  
  
High on a mountain top  
High on a mountain top  
High on a mountain top  
High on a mountain top
