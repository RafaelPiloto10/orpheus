Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it  
You play the guitar on the M.T.V.  
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it  
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free.  
  
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it  
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb  
Maybe get a blister on your little finger  
Maybe get a blister on your thumb.  
  
We gotta install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries  
We gotta move these refrigerators we gotta move these color T.V.'s.  
  
The little faggot with the earring and the makeup  
Yeah buddy that's his own hair  
That little faggot got his own jet airplane  
That little faggot, he's a millionaire  
  
We gotta install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries  
We gotta move these refrigerators we gotta move these color T.V.'s.

Look at that mama she got it stickin' in the camera  
Man we could have some fun  
  
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?  
You bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee  
Oh that ain't workin' that's the way you do it  
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free.  
  
We gotta install microwave ovens custom kitchen deliveries  
We gotta move these refrigerators we gotta move these color T.V.'s.  
  
Listen here  
Now that ain't workin' that's the way to do it  
You play the guitar on the M.T.V.  
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it  
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
