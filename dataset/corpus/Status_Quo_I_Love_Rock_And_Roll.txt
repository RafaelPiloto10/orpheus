When I'm playing my old guitar  
I know what I'm living for  
'Cause that's all I wanna do  
Keep right on rocking you  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll  
Bye bye, Johnny, I'm all shook up  
Bebopalula, rock around the clock  
You may or may not know  
But you'll never rock alone  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do  
And I'm a ready teddy, ready to rock  
And I'm a ready teddy, ready to roll  
Come on, let's all shout it out aloud  
I love rock and roll  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do  
I love rock and roll in my heart and in my soul  
I love rocking you
