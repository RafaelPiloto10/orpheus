You may think that I'm talking foolish  
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free  
You may wonder how I can promise you now  
This love that I feel for you always will be  
But you're not just time that I'm killin'  
I'm no longer one of those guys  
As sure as I live, this love that I give  
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  
  
Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever  
Forever and ever, amen  
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  
As long as old women sit and talk about old men  
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful  
I'll be happy to tell you again  
I'm gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever, amen  
  
They say time take its toll on a body  
Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray  
Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair  
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway  
They say time can play tricks on a mem'ry  
Make people forget things they knew  
Well, it's easy to see it's happenin' to me  
I've already forgotten ev'ry woman but you  
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever  
Forever and ever, amen  
  
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  
As long as old women sit and talk about old men  
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful  
Well, just listen to how this song ends  
I'm gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever, amen  
I'm gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever, forever and ever  
Forever and ever, amen
