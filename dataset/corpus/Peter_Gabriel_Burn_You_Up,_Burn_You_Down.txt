Straight as an arrow  
Carry your intentions to the wind  
Dogs all around you  
But you cannot get the message to your friend  
  
At every rendezvous you keep on walking around  
Nighttime in the city and the rain keeps falling down  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Ill wind blows the road to go  
How many times we've told you so  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
No rhyme or reason  
No way to make it easy 'til it's done  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
So you cross onto the other side of the street  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
Should know better but you keep turning up the heat  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Oh-oh-ai-ai  
(hey hey hey hey)  
Let me feel this  
(hey hey hey hey)  
Hey-ey Hey Hey  
(hey hey hey hey)  
Make me feel it  
(hey hey hey hey)  
  
When they lose you, it can bruise you  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
Break me open, I need someone to see me  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
Make me feel it, make me feel  
  
In the city and the rain is falling down  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
(Burn you up and I'll burn you down)  
You can make it happen with your eyes, with your eyes alone  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Break me open  
(Let me tell you how it all works out)  
(Never thought we had so much time to lose)  
Make me feel it  
(Just learning how to twist and shout)  
(Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use)  
Break me open  
(Let me tell you how it all works out)  
(Never thought we had so much time to lose)  
Make me feel it  
(You make me feel it)  
(Just learning how to twist and shout)  
(Doesn't matter much which damn beat you use)  
  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me, you can make me, you can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it
