It's nothing serious, just a simple case of bottles  
I left behind  
It's nothing serious, just a wooden case of bottles  
I left behind  
It'll go away someday, well alright  
It'll go away somehow, come on do your thing  
It's nothing dangerous, just a solid block of concrete  
I left behind  
It's nothing dangerous, just a solid block of action  
I left behind  
It'll go away someday, well alright  
It'll go away somehow, come on do your thing  
Peace on earth, God in heaven, peace on earth  
Living in heat, memory melting in pools of dirt  
The genetic plaything is eating what I left behind  
It'll go away someday  
Walking in the streets of Pnom Penh  
Giving me dangerous feelings and then  
Seeing those bottles in motion again  
Cruising in cocktails  
Peace on earth, God in heaven, peace on earth
