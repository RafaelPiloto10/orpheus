You couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face  
Your little world  
A little out of place  
You couldn't hear the ocean  
You couldn't hear the waves  
I know you meant to come back  
I know you meant to stay  
  
All you touched  
All you know  
All you loved - yeh  
  
Well I can see you smile  
Can you see my tears?  
I reach to hold you  
But you ain't there  
You left a hole so big lord, Beyond repair  
I'll try to find forgiveness in talkin' what  
Will never share  
  
All you touched  
All you know  
All you loved  
You just left 'em with nothing to say  
  
[Chorus]  
You're just throwin' it all away  
No you didn't care to see the light of day  
You're just throwin' it all away  
Like the sand upon the beach  
Your crashing waves came took you away
