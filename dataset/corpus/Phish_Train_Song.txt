All the way home we felt we had a chance  
To review the coulds before we were born  
And to invite a new game of can'ts  
  
Absorbed in the clouds a voice from afar said  
"With the right device you can make a pattern grow  
Or you can tune up your car"  
  
So we stayed on the train admiring the time  
As the lights of the city drew near  
We drank a little wine  
  
They were blurry and green outer space in between  
With a depth and a form unclear  
Then we saw it up ahead  
  
A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks  
In the rugs that had covered up the bridge  
From the banks of a river to the bed  
Of the valley upstream to the place we live  
  
The glass on the lantern cast back the sight  
Of a drive-in movie we drove by below  
We saw where we'd been in the pictures within  
Projecting all the places we would go  
So we follow the scene and flowed up your steps  
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance  
The train whistle melody woved through the trees  
And in through the door to signal the turns of a dance
