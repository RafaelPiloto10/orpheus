Christmas time is here  
Happiness and cheer  
Fun for all  
The children call  
  
Favorite time of year  
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times  
  
And ancient rhymes  
Love and dreams to share  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
Christmas time is here  
Families drawing near  
  
Oh that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
Christmas time is here  
Families drawing near  
  
Oh that we could always see  
A favorite time of year
