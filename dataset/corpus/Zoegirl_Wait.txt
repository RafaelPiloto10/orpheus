You've been hurt  
You've been lied to  
You ran all your life  
Just to get out of your shoes  
But you settled in too soon  
Now your road is clear-ly  
Darkno room  
For any light to break through  
  
You're on a mission to get even with the world  
To give back all the pain you received  
It's just too hard to believe  
That anything can make it better  
  
Please don't let it end this way  
You could wait another day  
It's foolish games that players play  
One choice can bring you so much ache  
Please don't end up this way  
There's got to be some other way  
You could live without this mistake  
So please wait  
  
You've been betrayed  
Left so confused  
Couldn't understand  
How trust could be so abused  
So you let the darkness  
Come over you  
Now you don't know  
Anyone to turn to  
  
You're beat up and bitter  
Face down in the cold  
Lyin' in the ground with footprints on your back  
Where ya gonna go?  
You've never been so low  
  
Please don't let it end this way  
You could wait another day  
It's foolish games that players play  
One choice can bring you so much ache  
Please don't end up this way  
There's got to be some other way  
You could live without this mistake  
So please wait  
  
Please don't let it end this way  
You could wait another day  
It's foolish games that players play  
One choice can bring you so much ache  
Please don't end up this way  
There's got to be some other way  
You could live without this mistake  
So please wait
