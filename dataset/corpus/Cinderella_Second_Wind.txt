Lightning strikes before my eyes  
Makes them burn, makes them blind  
I can catch what they throw at me  
Heaven's fire sets me free  
It's easy come and it's easy go  
Don't ya know, yea  
When I'm down and I'm feelin' low  
  
My second wind gets me strong  
I'm right back where I belong  
My second wind I can't go wrong  
I take what's mine then I move along  
  
Take my heart take my soul  
Take my rock I still roll  
T...T...T... take what you like  
Knock me down and watch me strike  
It's easy come and it's easy go  
Don't ya know, yea  
When I'm down and I'm feelin' low  
  
My second wind gets me strong  
I'm right back where I belong  
My second wind I can't go wrong  
I take what's mine then I move along  
  
It's easy come and it's easy go  
Don't ya know, yea  
When I'm down and I'm feelin' low  
  
My second wind gets me strong  
I'm right back where I belong  
My second wind I can't go wrong  
I take what's mine then I move
