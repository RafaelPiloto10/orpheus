Just come back where I came from,  
Looks the same as something's wrong.  
And all my friends that used to be,  
Have gone and turned their backs on me.  
Everyone's got different views,  
Now I'm all shook up and all confused.  
  
East is West, left is right,  
Up is down, and black is white,  
Inside-out, wrong is right,  
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.  
  
I've just come back from fantasy,  
Right back to reality.  
Stayed away too long but now I've found,  
My world is turning upside-down.  
I don't fit in but I don't stand out,  
I should stay cool but want to shout.  
  
East is West, left is right,  
Up is down, and black is white,  
Inside-out, wrong is right,  
It's back to front and I'm all uptight.  
  
No one knows where I come from,
