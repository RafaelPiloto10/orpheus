Charlie was a loser till that sunny day  
No-one saw him leaving as he sailed away  
Treated like a sinner, no-one gave a damn  
Till Charlie threw two sixes  
Now he's got them in his hand  
  
Now they're waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
  
No-one seems to know how  
No-one seems to care  
Doesn't really matter just as long as you are there  
Party in the moonlight, free drinks at the bar  
You can bet what's in your pocket that Charlie won't be far  
Now they're waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
  
Charlie bought a jet plane, Charlie rides the sky  
Friends appear from nowhere, Charlie gets them high  
Big D was a gambler with everything to lose  
Charlie didn't have anything  
So he didn't have to choose  
  
And they're waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
And they're standing in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie
