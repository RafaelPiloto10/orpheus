There were times I wasn't kind  
And there were times I wasn't even around  
And there were times I made you cry  
So many times I had to say goodbye  
When you want to talk  
I'm on the phone  
But now baby I am here for you alone  
  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
'Cause I can't live my life alone  
Without a home  
  
There were times I didn't understand  
And there were times I wouldn't hold your hand  
But baby now I'm here for you  
'Cause baby I am so in love with you  
  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
'Cause I can't live my life alone  
Without a home  
  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
'Cause I can't live my life alone  
Without a home  
  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
'Cause I can't live my life alone  
Without a home  
Stand by my woman now  
I'm gonna stand by my woman now  
  
'Cause I can't live my life alone  
Without a home  
Without a home
