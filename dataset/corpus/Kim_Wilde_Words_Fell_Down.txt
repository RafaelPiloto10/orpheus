I wake up in the morning, looking for reaction  
Then I see your faces, only for fraction  
Did you hurt my feelings ? You just nailed me to the wall  
  
Never say you're sorry, never show emotion  
Never show a good hand, never give a notion  
Don't you feel it's obscene ? Do you feel a thing at all ?  
  
[Chorus:]  
'cause you come right back with the same old story  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
You walk right back to the sound of glory  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless, it's so helpless  
  
Always a deceiver, never any answers  
Living in the shadows, taking any chances  
When you get a good line, come and talk in to my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You fight right back with the same reaction  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
The same old show with the same old caption  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless  
Oh, oh, oh, it's so helpless, it's so helpless
