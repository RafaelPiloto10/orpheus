How many more nails  
You gunna drive through my heart  
It was different from the...  
How many more knives into my back, Jack  
  
How many more broken hearts  
Can you stand through all the rain  
How many more nails  
You drive into my heart  
  
How many more, baby  
Haw many more times tried,  
Oh, oh, oh  
How many more, baby  
Will you go and leave me alone,  
Leave me alone...  
  
How many more times you like me to beg you,  
To leave e behind, oh  
How many more nails, baby  
Will you drive into my heart, baby  
  
How many more days  
You drive in  
How many more times  
You fill me with life  
How many more hours  
Must I wait at night  
For you to walk back through the door, baby  
  
How many more nails  
How many more knives through the back  
Oh, How many more nights......
