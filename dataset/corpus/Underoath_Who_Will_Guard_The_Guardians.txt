We are nothing they own our lives  
Just a statue of a stain in time  
Spinning in circles got left behind  
  
We were all warned this would happen  
But the words just rang in our ears  
  
Machines built by machines built by machines  
  
We can only hide for so long  
Before they harvest us for the souls that we have left  
  
I swear we cannot wake up from this hell that we live in  
But when the sun finally hits our face  
We see that we are merely reflections of reflections left by our predecessors  
Dragged through the mud  
(We can't wake up)  
Chained by the ankle  
There is no more running there is no more escaping  
If only God could lay his hands down on this barren land and wake us up  
Cause we are the lost we are the helpless we are the forgotten ones  
We are the lost and we are the abandoned  
  
I swear it's worth saving us  
We pray for the sun to dry us up  
I need a clearer head to see what we are worth  
There's still life left down here to revolt  
Oh I know what it looks like from there  
A loss of control to this place and we're set to extinct  
  
Revolt  
We stood by defeat for so long  
We've been under your control  
We will not be a part of your disease
