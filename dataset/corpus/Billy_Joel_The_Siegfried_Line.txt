All the guns are silent on the Western wall  
And they cleaned the rifles that we never use it all  
And we're writing letters just to pass the time  
And the days go by on The Siegfried Line  
  
Oh, they say the English have given up the war  
And we heard the Russians won't last through '44  
But a longtime soldier has an open mind  
And a man grows old on The Siegfried Line  
  
Soon, soon they say the war will be over, oh, oh  
Home, home, we will be home in the summer, no, no  
  
Oh, we light the campfire and we drank the beer  
And we know the flag we fly must last a thousand years  
And we eat Dutch chocolate and we drink French wine  
And they feed us well on The Siegfried Line  
  
Soon, soon they say the war will be over, oh, oh  
Home, home, we will come home in the summer, la, la, la  
(We will come home, we will come home, we will come home, come home)
