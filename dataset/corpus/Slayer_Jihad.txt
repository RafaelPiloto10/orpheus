I have witnessed your death  
I've see it many times  
Your tortured screams  
Your decrypted little mind  
A father's son  
With pathetic eyes that bleed  
Twins in the end  
Begin and let the brothers fall  
  
I will see you burned alive  
Screaming for your God  
I will watch you die again for him  
  
God won't touch what I've done  
He cries upon my feet  
A privilege pain  
Beneath buried are your dead  
On splintered bones I walk  
Sifting through the blood  
Besieged in fear  
Await the coming of the God  
  
I will watch you die again for him  
  
Blood is raining downward  
The stain reflects the sun  
Conquer divide within  
Terrorize the mind  
I have seen the end it's yours  
Rosary in hand  
Your selfish flesh it melts  
Spilling from the sky  
  
I will see you burn alive  
Screaming for your God  
I will watch you die  
  
This is God's War  
God's War  
This is God's War  
God's War  
  
War of holy principles  
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction  
Slit the throat of heaven man  
And let his blood dilute the water  
Bury your dead  
  
Fuck your God erase his name  
A lady weeps insanewith sorrow  
I'll take his tower from the world  
You're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed  
  
This is God's War  
God's War  
This is God's War  
God's War  
Fucking Holy War  
  
Be optimistic, happy and calm  
Show no fear or anxiety  
Smile at the face of God  
And your reward will be eternity  
Holy warriors  
Your patience will be justified  
Everything is for him  
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it  
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers  
Strike above the neck and at all extremities  
For it's a point of no return for almighty God  
God will give victory to his faithful servant  
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy  
The great Satan
