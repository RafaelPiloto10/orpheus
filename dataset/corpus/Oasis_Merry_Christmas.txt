Merry Christmas (Slade Cover)  
  
are you hanging up your stocking on your wall  
it's the time that every santa has a ball  
does he ride a red nosed reindeer  
does he turn up on his sleigh  
do the farries keep him sober for a day  
  
so here it is merry christmas  
everybodies having fun  
look to the future now  
it's only just begun  
  
are you waiting for your family to arrive  
are you sure you've got the room to spare inside  
does your granny always tell you  
that the old songs are the best  
and shes up and rock 'n' rolling with rest  
  
so here it is merry christmas  
everybodies having fun  
look to the future now  
it's only just begun  
  
what will your daddy do when he sees your moma kissing santa, ahaa  
  
are you hanging up your stocking on your wall  
are you hoping that the snow will start to fall  
do you ride on down the hillside  
in a boggy you have made  
when you land upon your head  
then you will say  
  
so here it is merry christmas  
everybodies having fun  
look to the future now  
it's only just begun  
(repeat chorus X4)
