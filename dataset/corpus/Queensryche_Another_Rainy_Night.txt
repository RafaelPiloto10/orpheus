Don't slam the door, on your way out  
Don't leave without saying goodbye  
Another long distance night alone  
You leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more  
Last word today, coming home to stay?  
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?  
  
But now my take-out food is growing cold  
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor  
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone  
  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
  
Listen, there's a foghorn blowing  
From the coast tonight  
Remember making love in the rain?  
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound  
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain  
I'm not much without you, can't leave  
If I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around  
  
But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire  
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour  
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called  
  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Waiting by the phone, alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
  
I know I've said it before  
Hate the sound of the closing door  
And your footsteps walking away  
  
But now my take-out food is growing cold  
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor  
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Waiting by the phone, alone  
And it's another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
  
It's just another rainy night, another rainy night  
Another rainy night without you
