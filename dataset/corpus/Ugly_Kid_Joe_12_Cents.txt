Watching, waiting  
You know it shouldn't take this long  
Leaning, forward  
I know I couldn't possibly take much  
Longer  
  
I now the pain moves on  
And I feel the same for the wrong  
  
Angels, walking, floating on and on  
Breathing eloquent  
I know it couldn't possibly wait much  
Longer  
  
Searching so long I know  
We'll find a way  
Reaching all alone I know they couldn't  
Possibly hate much longer
