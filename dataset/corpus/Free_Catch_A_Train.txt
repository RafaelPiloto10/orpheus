Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
I'm gonna meet you at the station, oh yeah  
You can tell me why you're feeling down  
  
Is it you mother, though she tends to shout a bit  
But she's got her problems too  
And I don't doubt it  
Baby your father  
I know he's always drinking  
Most of the time  
He don't even know what he's doing  
  
Now baby  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
Gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why you're feeling down  
  
I can't imagine  
Why you're feeling so alone  
It's just a week since I saw ya  
Baby why are you crying so?  
  
All you got to do is  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
I'm gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why you're feeling,  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
I'm gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why you're feeling,  
  
Ah baby why you're feeling down  
Down, down, down, down  
Why don't you come around  
Why don't you catch a train  
The midnight train's all right
