I am not a lucky man...  
I am not a lucky man...  
You are like a butterfly  
A Catipillars dream to fly  
So bust out of this old cocoon  
And dry your wings off  
Butterfly  
Go ahead, and fly  
  
Its always such a lonely loom  
Its sudden like a broken bone  
And your luck wont always come along  
So dry your tears away  
Butterfly  
Go ahead and fly  
  
Dry your tears away  
Butterfly  
Don't you, Cry
