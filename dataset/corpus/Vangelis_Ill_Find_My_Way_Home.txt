You ask me where to begin  
Am I so lost in my sin  
You ask me where did I fall  
I'll say I can't tell you when  
But if my spirit is lost  
How will I find what is near  
Don't question I'm not alone  
Somehow I'll find my way home  
  
My sun shall rise in the east  
So shall my heart be at peace  
And if you're asking me when  
I'll say it starts at the end  
You know your will to be free  
Is matched with love secretly  
And talk will alter your prayer  
Somehow you'll find you are there.  
  
Your friend is close by your side  
And speaks in far ancient tongue  
A seasons wish will come true  
All seasons begin with you  
One world we all come from  
One world we melt into one  
  
Just hold my hand and we're there  
Somehow we're going somewhere  
Somehow we're going somewhere  
  
You ask me where to begin  
Am I so lost in my sin  
You ask me where did I fall  
I'll say I can't tell you when  
But if my spirit is strong  
I know it can't be long  
No questions I'm not alone  
Somehow I'll find my way home  
Somehow I'll find my way home  
Somehow I'll find my way home  
Somehow I'll find my way home
