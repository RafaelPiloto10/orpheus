Appendages flailing, you're running at me  
Ferocious, tenaciously clawing at me  
The devious gelatin holding me fast  
Miraculous now you let me move past  
Over the wall rushing rivers of sleaze  
The tips of stalactites incising my knees  
A slipper, a sand dollar day at the shore  
Nice evening at home that I dread even more  
Would you please  
Make clear to me  
I'm peering out through your opacity  
Though you rehearse  
Tomorrow's verse  
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key  
Look back on those days when my life was a haze  
The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh  
Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank  
The free masons crank to the overflow tank  
  
Bane of the weasel, for biding his fun  
Jump on the turnstile and watch me go 'round  
Swim with the cactus and float with the stone  
I try to convey what you strive to condone  
  
Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo  
Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo  
Da da, da da, da-da, da da da-da da da da da do  
  
Would you please  
Make clear to me  
I'm peering out through your opacity  
Though you rehearse  
Tomorrow's verse  
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key  
  
Would you please (In all that dust and stone)  
Make clear to me (And when you see me)  
Why nothing is the first thing that I see  
?  
  
And if you do (In all that dirt and stone)  
And I see you (And when you see me)  
Then you will be the nothing left for me  
?
