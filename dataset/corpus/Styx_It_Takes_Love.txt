sometimes it's hard to smile  
keep looking back  
searching for somebody  
who once was in your life  
baby let him go now  
there'll be something better ahead  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
we all have tears to cry  
but there comes a day  
to leave your tears behind you  
and give your heart  
someplace to start  
and if you find your way there  
there'll be someone waiting for you  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
like a river  
that flows  
to the sea  
  
don't wait  
like a river  
flowing down  
  
whoa...hey...ooh...ah...ooh  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
it takes love to make love  
never mind the broken heart baby  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you
