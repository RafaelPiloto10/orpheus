I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
Don't want a doll, no dinky tinker Toy  
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?  
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue  
Just bring him through the front door, that's the easy thing to do  
  
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see my hippo hero standing there  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses  
I only like hippopotamuses  
And hippopotamuses like me too  
  
Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then  
Teacher says a hippo is a vegeterian  
  
There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage  
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage  
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see a hippo hero standing there  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
No crocodiles or rhinoceroseses  
I only like hippopotamuseses  
And hippopotamuses like me too! They like me too!
