Can't you feel our souls ignite  
Shedding ever changing colours, in the darkness of the fading night,  
Like the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows  
We have finally been freed to get back home.  
  
There's an angel standing in the sun, and he's crying with a loud voice,  
"This is the supper of the mighty one",  
Lord of Lords,  
King of Kings,  
Has returned to lead his children home,  
To take them to the new Jerusalem.
