I call it thirst trap, shawty, oh!  
And you know, they say it's a man's job to respect a woman  
For me personal I feel like a woman supposed to give a man something for a man
to respect  
I ain't wrong for thinking that as I am wrong for thinking this!  
  
On me to buy you a bag, but is you worthy?  
Nah, I ain't perfect!  
And I just followed you on Instagram  
Are you really into women and that you get around?  
Now I ain't judging, I'm just asking if that's fair to say  
But either way, it's my opinion, you know give or take!  
I told this model chick,  
The girls look up to you and the things you do  
Every nigga you work with, you're screwing,  
So you know she will love you, you know she don't do it, she like  
You don't know me, you don't pay my bills  
You don't know my struggle,  
Like this she real, but it is what it is  
But I know you lying, I know what's real  
I know your worth, I know that purse  
Ten bandz, Shawty!  
You can't pay your bills, you're'  
  
I will give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do to you!  
And I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
Oh, what you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect you earn, that you earn!  
  
Uh, I kiss on your neck  
Do you wanna get out of this?  
Would you feel disrespected  
If I said you fat as shit?  
Wow, if I called you my bitch  
When I'm with my partners eating?  
As a badge of honor or just be like no Wale  
Don't call me out at my momma's given.  
Name sacred, she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs  
And I leave her inner feelings, cause I never leave her dry!  
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised  
She know these Jones on my John, but I still give her time.  
I try follow her, everybody want her  
Worried about none if she gonna work that body!  
And I unfollow her, though my eyes still on her'  
I'm still caught up, call her thirst trap shawty  
  
I will give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do to you!  
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
Oh, what you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect you earn, that you earn!  
  
She lives for the night life, and that's alright  
But she wants to be treated like somebody's wife.  
But you can't be table hopping in a club trying to drink free  
Girl, come up to my table trying to stand next to me!  
Oh no, oh no, oh no  
  
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
And I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn, that you earn  
What you make me do, that's what I'm gonna do  
Give you the respect you earn!
