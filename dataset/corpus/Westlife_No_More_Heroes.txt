When the waves are crashing down  
Pulling you to sorrow  
I will sail you back to shore  
When there are no more heroes  
Over under, near or far  
I'll be right beside you  
Standing here with open arms  
When there are no more heroes  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
It was you who showed me how  
Brought me back to glory  
Through hopelessness and darkest days  
It was breath you gave me  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
And through it all  
And through it all  
When you're tired and you stumble I will carry you  
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home  
You'll never be alone  
When there are no more heroes  
  
When there are no more heroes
