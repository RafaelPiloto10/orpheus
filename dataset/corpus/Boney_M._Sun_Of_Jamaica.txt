Long time ago, when I was a young  
Boy,  
I saw that movie, "Mutiny on theBounty"  
Starring my idol, Marlon Brando.  
And I felt a yearning for that  
Great adventure.  
So many nights I woke up out of adream  
A dream of blue seas, white sands,  
Paradies birds, butterflies, and  
Beautiful warm-hearted girls.  
  
Sun of Jamaika, the dreams of  
Malaika,  
Your love is my sweet memory.  
  
Sun of Jamaika, Blue Lady Malaika,  
Someday I'll return, wait and see  
Walk in the sand and I'm happy  
With you  
We shall be loving and true.  
Oh I sure love Malaika,  
With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true,  
Yeah true.  
But now as I grew older  
The burning desire became so strong  
That I bought a tiket to fly home  
And then I found you  
And we found an eternal love  
Right from the beginning.  
The stars falling down from the Lagoon of gold,  
The palms swaying under the moon,  
We were swimming out into the  
Crystal sea,  
In that fateful night I thought to  
Myself  
I'll do everthing I can, save  
Every dime,  
And one day I'll return,  
And then I'll stay forever, forever.  
  
Sun of Jamaika, the dreams of  
Malaika,  
Your love is my sweet memory.  
Sun of Jamaika, Blue Lady Malaika,  
Someday I'll return, wait and see  
Walk in the sand and I'm happy  
With you  
We shall be loving and true.  
Oh I sure love Malaika,  
With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true,  
Yeah true.
