In a little while  
Surely you'll be mine  
In a little while I'll be there  
  
In a little while  
This hurt will hurt no more  
I'll be home, love  
  
When the night takes a deep breath  
And the daylight has no air  
If I crawl, if I come crawling home  
Will you be there  
  
In a little while  
I won't (be) blown by every breeze  
Friday night running  
To Sunday on my knees  
  
That girl, that girl  
She's mine  
And I've know her since  
  
Since you were a little girl  
With Spanish eyes  
Oh, when I saw her  
In a pram they pushed her by  
  
My, how you've grown  
Well it's been  
It's been a little while  
  
Slow down my beating heart  
Man dreams one day to fly  
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies  
He lives on a star that's dying in the night  
And follows in the trail  
The scatter of light  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
You turn me on  
  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love
