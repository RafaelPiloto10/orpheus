So now there's somebody new,  
These dreams I've been dreaming,  
Have all fallen through.  
You say I'll be fine,  
It only takes time  
Someday, that may be true  
  
But it's too soon to tell  
It's too soon to say  
Maybe someday I'll be able to wish you well  
But right now,  
It's just too soon to tell  
  
It's all for the best, so you say  
You never intended to hurt me this way  
You want to hear  
I won't drown in my tears,  
Well, baby the best that I can say  
  
Is it's too soon to tell  
It's too soon to say  
Maybe someday I'll be able to wish you well  
But right now it's just too soon to tell  
Well right now,  
It's just too soon to tell
