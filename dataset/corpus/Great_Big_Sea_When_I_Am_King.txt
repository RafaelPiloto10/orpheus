Wake up  
Without a care  
Your head's not heavy, your conscience clear  
Sins are all forgiven here  
Yours and mine  
Fear is gone without a trace  
It's the perfect time in the perfect place  
Nothing's hurting, nothing's sore  
No one suffers anymore  
The doctor found a simple cure  
Just in time  
  
All these things if I were king  
Would all appear around me  
The world will sing when I am king  
The world will sing when I am king  
  
Oh, she walks right in  
She don't even knock  
It's the girl you lost to the high school jock  
She shuts the door, turns the lock  
And she takes your hand  
She says she always felt a fool  
For picking the captain over you  
She wonders if you missed her  
Said she always told her sister  
Oh, that you're the best damn kisser  
That she's ever had  
  
All these things if I were king  
Would appear around me  
The world will sing when I am king  
The world will sing when I am king  
  
Daylight waits to shine until the moment you awaken  
So you never miss the dawn  
No question now, you know which road you're taking  
Lights all green, the radio plays just the perfect song  
  
Well, the war's been won  
All the fights are fought  
You find yourself in just the spot  
It's a place where everybody's got a song to sing  
Just like the final movie scene  
The prince will find his perfect queen  
The hero always saves the world  
The villains get what they deserve  
The boy will always get the girl  
When I am king
