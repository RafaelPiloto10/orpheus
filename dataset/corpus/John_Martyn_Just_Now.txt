Searching back through the friends I've known  
Sometimes sad for the way it's grown  
Ranging up and ranging out  
And trying to change my ways about  
There's a place in the leaf, a place in the bough  
Found a place for me just now, just now, just now  
Moving on with every word  
Moving with all the words I've heard  
Turning the wheel as fast as I can  
Turning the wheel to make me a man  
There's a man in the moon, a man in the sea  
Growing strong, there's a man in me just now, just now, just now  
No behind and no before  
There's no need to worry any more  
Happy then, happy now  
There's always a way to get happy somehow  
Friend on the road, a friend in the home  
A better friend now than I've ever known just now, just now, just now  
Searching back for the friends I've known  
Sometimes sad for the way it's grown  
Changing up and ranging out  
And trying to change my ways about
