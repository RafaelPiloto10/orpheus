Always safe to know, what is good for taking  
Blood stains from your clothes  
(Besides fire)  
Like I said before  
When I bite your tongue, out of your mouth, you'll know  
(You'll know)  
  
Just what am I supposed to say?  
And tell you why I turned out this way?  
Don't make me, don't make me  
  
If you love it, then let it go  
And how I thought you'll never know  
Just don't blame me, don't blame me  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(It's easier to know)  
You've always been on your own  
(It's easier to know)  
  
Nothing safe feels real  
Waiting here to dodge, so open I reveal  
(There's something)  
  
Picking up my Brains  
You can tell your mom that men are all the same  
(The same)  
Just what am I supposed to say?  
And tell you why I turned out this way?  
Don't make me, don't make me  
  
If you love it, then let it go  
And how I thought you'll never know  
Just don't blame me, don't blame me  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(It's easier to know)  
You've always been on your own  
(It's easier to know)  
You'll have to pay to watch me jump  
That I love you more  
You'll never make it alone  
It's easier to go  
It's easier to go  
  
Nowhere to go, I'm not leaving  
Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye on my own  
I'm nothing, just bleeding  
I'm not kissing you goodbye  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(Let it go, I'm not leaving)  
You've always been on your own  
(Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye)  
You'll never make it alone  
(On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding)  
You've always been on your own  
(I'm not kissing you goodbye)  
  
You'll never make it alone  
(Let it go, I'm not leaving)  
You've always been on your own  
(Not going, I'm not kissing you goodbye)  
You'll never make it alone  
(On my own, I'm nothing, just bleeding)  
You've always been on your own  
(I'm not kissing you goodbye)
