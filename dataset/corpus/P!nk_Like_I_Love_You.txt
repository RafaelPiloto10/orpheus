I kinda noticed in one night  
  
It's kinda wierd to me  
Since your so fine  
If it's up to me your face will change  
If you smile then that  
Should set the tone  
Just remember  
And if you let go the music  
Should move your bones  
Just remember  
(Sing this song with me)  
  
Can't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's  
What makes me trust ya  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference  
When I touch ya  
  
Some people are so phony  
Nosey 'cause they lonely  
Aren't you sick of the same thing?  
They say so and so is dating  
Love you or they hatin'  
And it doesn't even matter anyway  
Cause were here tonight  
If you smile then that  
Should set the tone  
Just remember baby  
And if you let go the music should  
Move your bones  
Just remember  
(Sing this song with me)  
  
Can't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's  
What makes me trust ya  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference  
When I touch ya  
  
If you give that chance  
To be your man(x2)  
  
Maybe we'll fly the night away  
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl) (x2)  
  
Maybe we'll fly the night away  
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl)  
  
Can't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's  
What makes me trust ya  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference  
When I touch ya
