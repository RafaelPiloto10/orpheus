Fighting fire with fire.  
  
You came here on purpose, in front of me, Diana  
To be seen with some other man  
You're wanting me to watch him, enjoy the freedom  
You're letting him take with his hands.  
  
Did you tell or must I tell him, Diana  
Does it matter to that kind of man?  
Any place he touches or kisses, Diana  
Is some place I've already been.  
  
You know you're fighting fire with fire  
Over something that broke us apart  
At least I was hiding and trying, Diana  
To keep it from breaking your heart.  
  
You must've been crazy, for taking advantage  
Of the fact that you weren't around  
But she was so soft and pretty  
And she made a promise, never to utter a sound.  
  
Can you tell or must I tell you, Diana  
It's a heart burning hell that I'm in  
And any place he touches or kisses, Diana  
I'd gladly crawl back there again.  
  
You know...
