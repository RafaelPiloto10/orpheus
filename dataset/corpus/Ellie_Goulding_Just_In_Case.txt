[Verse 1]  
Think of how we made love almost anywhere  
Haven't I taken you almost everywhere?  
Think of all the things that, that we shared  
Then imagine me not there, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Giving you more carrots than the rabbit  
Got you living lavish  
Anything I've got, you can have it  
Baby I'll do magic  
I'll do all I can to keep you satisfied  
So just in case I don't make it home tonight, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Just in case I don't make it home tonight  
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby  
Just in case, just in case  
Wanna cherish each moment like the last  
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case  
Just in case I don't make it home tonight  
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby  
Wanna cherish each moment like the last  
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case  
  
[Bridge]  
Case, night, I don't make it  
Case, night  
Case, night, I don't make it  
Case, night, I don't make it  
Case, night, I don't make it  
Case, night, I don't make it  
  
[Chorus]  
Just in case I don't make it home tonight  
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby  
Just in case, just in case  
Wanna cherish each moment like the last  
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case  
  
[Outro]  
There's something you need to know  
Just in case I don't make it home tonight  
Maybe make love to you for the last time, baby  
Wanna cherish each moment like the last  
Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
Your heart makes me whole  
Oh oh oh  
Hmm  
Oh oh oh  
Come on  
Oh oh oh
