These are my famous last words  
My number's up bridges will burn  
Oh won't you let me twist your fate  
It's getting kinda late  
  
And I don't wanna wait no more  
Oh may I have this dance of days  
Locked in your embrace  
You passed your test of faith  
  
Another time, another place, another line upon your face  
Another in your wake  
Down crooked stairs and sideway glances comes the king of second chances  
Now throw him in the flames  
  
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)  
Whatever keeps you warm inside  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
Your bridges are burning now  
  
Oh let me put you in your place  
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away, but  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Tell me now what's in it for me  
No one's getting this for free  
So tell me now what's in it for me  
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)  
  
Whatever keeps you warm inside  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
Your bridges are burning now  
  
Gathering the ashes  
Everything thrown away  
Gathering the ashes  
Scatter as they blow away  
  
Gathering the ashes  
Everything thrown away  
Gathering the ashes  
Scatter as they blow away  
  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
  
Your bridges are burning now  
They're all coming down  
It's all coming 'round  
  
You're burning them down  
It's all coming 'round  
They're all coming down  
Your bridges are burning now
