I went out to get some groceries the other day  
From my neighborhood grocery store  
And before I could open my mouth  
The grocery man said "No! You can't get that no more"  
That's what he said, you can't get that no more  
He said, "I sold all I had the other day  
It ain't me Mr. Jordan, it's the OPA  
You just can't get it, you got to do with what you got  
Ain't go have no more for the duration,  
You got to be careful with your boots on"  
  
The hip cats used to stand on the corner in their zoot suits  
And them long chains hanging down all looking cute,  
But things is very different now since Uncle Sam has got some Japs to shoot  
  
You can't do that no more  
You can't do that no more  
No more standing on the corner day and night  
Cause Uncle Sam says you got to work or you got to fight  
So you can't do that no more  
No you can't do that no more  
  
You know the glamour gals stopped glamorizing  
They working in defense plants wearing slacks  
And some of them fine chicks is cutting out everyday  
Joining the wave, the spas and the wax  
Now fellas, you can't get that no more  
I am telling you fellas, you just can't get it  
You can't jive these girls like you used to do  
Cause some of them is making more money than you  
I am telling you boys, you just can't get that no more  
No you can't get that no more  
  
You know the girls used to wake up every morning  
And say lord send me a handsome man  
One that is physically fit  
But uncle sam has got all of them now  
And the gals is got to take just what they can get  
  
You can't get that no more  
Aint no need to be giggling girls  
You just can't get it no more that's all  
Girls you can't be particular  
You've got to take what's left  
Either them worn out 3A's or them beat up 4F's  
That's all you just can't get it no more  
No you can't get that no more
