It's time to pack our bags and hit the highway  
And head on back for Christmas holiday  
I'll fall apart when I pull in the driveway  
It's my first time home since brother passed away  
  
His favorite time was always Christmas  
We'd reminisce about the days gone by  
Oh, how I wish that he were still here with us  
My memories of him will never die  
  
When the stockings are hung  
"Silent Night" has been sung  
And Christmas is finally here  
It won't be the same this year  
  
Losing my big brother hurt so badly  
It's helped me learn what Christmas really means  
There's nothing more important than your family  
We'll all the children of the King of Kings  
  
So when the stockings are hung  
"Silent Night" has been sung  
And Christmas is finally here  
It won't be the same this year  
  
When the stockings are hung  
"Silent Night" has been sung  
And Christmas is finally here  
It won't be the same this year
