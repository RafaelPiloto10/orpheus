You and me we try  
to change  
  
We try so hard it's all the same  
I'm just waiting for it to begin again  
Ahhhh  
I'm forgetting who I am  
That makes me wonder who I am  
Trying so hard to find sense when there's none at all  
Ahhh  
Down  
Staring at the sun all day  
If you stare too long you get burned away  
Now there's nothing left of me so have it all  
Ahhh  
Forgetting again I blame  
My past has just faded away  
Now I can tell you everything there is to know about  
Ahhh  
Down
