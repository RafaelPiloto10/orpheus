Everybody's lookin' for a happy ending  
Before the real story even begins  
It's so easy to pretend you're not pretending  
Till the naked truth comes walkin' on in  
  
But we ain't runnin' when the truth gets hot  
That's how ya find out just how much you've really got  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's make a long story longer  
Let's make this strong love a little bit stronger  
Our star is gonna shine, shine even brighter  
Believe what we feel, keep it real  
Make a long story longer  
  
The seed of love is so deeply planted  
Inside the heart is where it lives and grows  
We'll keep it safe 'cause we don't take it for granted  
Let the hard rains fall, let the cold wind blow  
  
Every storm is just a lesson to learn  
Just bring us closer with every page we turn baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ya gotta stand the test of time  
If ya want to keep the treasure you find  
Some can only dream about forever  
But look at us baby, we're creatin' it together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's make a long story longer  
Let's make this strong love a little bit stronger  
Baby, live what we feel, keep it real  
Make a long story longer  
Let's make a long story longer
