It was a cold November day  
Raindrops on the window  
I was asking you to stay  
Hoping you wouldn't deny and then you gave me that smile  
It only took me a while  
To see my heart was burning just for you  
  
  
And life with you is like paradise  
Standing hand in hand  
And that's just when I realize  
These memories are the treasures of my past  
  
Deep down in my heart  
The strongest of emotions  
Never wanting us apart  
I'm feeling hot devotion  
And every secret we share  
Nothing we can't take care  
Knowing our hearts share the strongest love of all  
  
And life with you is like paradise  
Standing hand in hand  
And that's just when I realize  
These memories are the treasures of my past  
  
And then you gave me that smile  
It only took me a while  
To see my heart was burning just for you
