From the deepest, darkest depths of... Whitby!  
Comes this sordid tale of speed...  
Murderous mayhem..  
Cataclysmic combustion...  
Picturesque powered pistons...  
Accellerating automotive alarms...  
Stunningly stupifying stereo stunts!  
One man... A dream... A car... A 1984... Plymouth... Horizon...  
  
I loved the car from tail to grill  
I wouldn't change a thing  
I wouldn't trade the ashtray  
For the Queen's engagement ring  
But things they started going wrong  
And went from bad to worse  
The clutch went kinda funny  
Then I couldn't use reverse  
Still I loved my baby  
And would not admit defeat  
Just because it left a trail  
Of rust along the street  
It kept on running bravely  
On duct tape and a prayer  
Plus a monthly tribute to  
The guy who did repairs  
It all seems so unfair (The man was glad the day he bought)  
  
Horizon!  
Horizon!  
  
Till one day on the parking lot  
They called 401  
My car became the meat between  
A Buick-Honda bun  
I saw some parts go flying  
That you really need to drive  
My car had become roadkill  
Though it never was alive  
Left a muffler in the passing lane  
A hubcap in the slow  
The windshield on the median  
A headlight in the snow  
And as I skidded off the road  
The other drivers laughed  
My middle-finger greeting  
Would be my epitaph  
Death would come at last (Here lies the man who dared to buy)  
  
Horizon!  
  
Now I look at my bent fender  
The twisted wheel rim  
I wonder if Horizon  
Will ever drive again  
But I know that this was not the end  
Road warriors die hard  
And I signed this Mr. Iacoca's  
Organ donor card  
The steel will get recycled  
And they'll build another car  
Bigger, faster, stronger  
An automotive star  
My quest will then begin  
And revenge will soon be mine  
As I drive my gleaming three-door  
Orange Chrysler Frankenstein  
Searching for that Buick  
To try to end it's days  
We'll settle off the score  
And then we'll drive away (The sun will rise again on the)  
  
Horizon!  
My Horizon!  
My Horizon!
