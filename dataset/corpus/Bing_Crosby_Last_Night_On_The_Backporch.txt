There's a girl I'm wild about, every time I take her out  
I hurry, I scurry, I worry so  
And we always can be found, where there's no one else around  
If I lost her, what a blow, I love her oh-wo-oh  
Yes, I love her in the morning and I love her at night  
I love her, yes, I love her when the stars are shining bright  
I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last night on the backporch, I love her best of all  
Oh, I love her in the morning and I love her at night  
First time that I dug this chick, it was true love at first sight  
I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last time, gave her my frat pin, then I loved her best of all  
Oh, I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last night Maw went shopping and then I loved her best of all
