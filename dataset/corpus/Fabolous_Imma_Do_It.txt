[Chorus]  
The block got my back, and my boys do too  
And my baby mama trippin' said she need more loot  
Every block, every hood, every ghetto got beef  
I got a heater on my lap, and another in the back  
See how I'm suppposed to cope with all this stress on me  
Everybody and their mama callin fed's on me  
I don't know what I'm a do but I'm a do it (I'm a do it)  
Look I don't know what I'm a do but I'm a do it (I'm a do it)  
I got money on my head but I'm ridin' in a drop, (drop)  
  
Yeah  
Feelin' just like JFK in the city that let em fly like JFK (Ayye)  
Sometimes LaGaurdia I ain't gone lie to ya  
If looks could kill then my style might body ya  
That's why I'm with Nadia I call my gun Nadia  
When she say hi to ya it's buh buh bye to ya  
Make it sound like Saudia  
Arabia, maybe the haters should watch what he say to her you think  
I can hold my head high and die or I can live and duck  
My attitude is celibate  
I don't give a fuck  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
Now who are you to tell me how to conduct myself  
Why don't you go practice safe sex and go fuck yourself  
The rumor is that I'm a hazard to a sucka's health  
I coulda told you that, yeah I coulda told you that  
Picture me not flop where is them explosives at?  
Right here on my lap  
That's where my composure's at  
I'm back like a gun cock  
I'm so cool that if I go to hell all I need is my sun block  
Nigga hold ya high and die or live and duck  
My attitude is celibate  
I don't give a fuck  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I mean let's be honest you never liked a nigga  
Tryin to live beyond this so I kept the strap on  
Clap on, clap off lights out like flights out  
You could be departed  
Never me who started  
I Lambo Gallarded I am vehically challenged  
That means the car is retarded  
But regardless I'm "Tin Man" heartless  
No love, if son lookin' for love  
Get a show on VH1  
Nigga hold ya high and die or live and duck  
My attitude is Virgin  
Still don't give a fuck  
  
[Chorus]
