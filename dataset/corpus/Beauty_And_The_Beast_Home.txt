Home  
  
Yes, I made the choice  
For papa I will stay  
But I don't deserve to lose my freedom in this way  
You monster!  
  
If you think that what you've done is right  
Well then,  
You're a fool  
Think again  
  
Is this home?  
Is this where I should learn to be happy?  
Never dreamed  
That a home could be  
Dark and cold,  
I was told,  
Every day in my childhood  
Even when we grow old  
Home should be where the heart is  
Never were words so true  
My heart's far far, away  
Home is too.  
  
Is this home?  
Is this what I must learn to believe in?  
Try to find something good  
In this tragic place  
Just in case  
I should stay here forever  
Held in this empty space  
Oh, but, that won't be easy  
I know the reason why  
My heart's far, far, away  
Home's a lie  
  
What I'd give  
To return, to the life that I knew lately  
But I know  
That I can't, solve my problems going back  
  
Is this home?  
Am I here for a day or forever?  
Shut away from the world until  
Who knows when  
Oh but then  
As my life has been altered once it can change again  
Build higher walls around me  
Change every lock and key  
Nothing lasts nothing, holds all of me  
  
My heart's far far, away  
Home and, free
