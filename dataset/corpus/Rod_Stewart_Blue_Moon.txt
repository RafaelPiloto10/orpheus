(feat. Eric Clapton)  
  
Once upon a time before I took up smiling  
I hated the moonlight  
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling  
Seemed flat as the noonlight  
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten  
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men  
  
Blue moon  
You saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Blue moon  
You know just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Someone I really could care for  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms will ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own  
Now I have a girl of my own
