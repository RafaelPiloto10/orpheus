Indian Lake is a scene you should make with your little one  
Keep it in mind if you're lookin' to find a place in the summer sun  
Swim in the cove have a snack in the grove or you can rent a canoe  
At Indian Lake you'll be able to make the way like the Indians do  
  
You take a bus marked Lakewood Drive  
And you keep on ridin' till you're out of the city  
Where the air is fine with the sweet smellin' pines and the country side's
pretty  
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills or a honey lovin' mama bear  
Just take a left at the bridge go down to Quaker town Ridge  
And in a minute you're there  
Indian Lake is a scene you should make  
  
Indian Lake is a scene you should make  
And you'll see daffodils peepin' over the hills  
Indian Lake is a scene you should make
