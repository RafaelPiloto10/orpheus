Let me tell you 'bout my life,  
Let me tell you 'bout my dreams,  
Let me tell you 'bout the thing that happen, all is real to me.  
Let me tell you of my hope, of my need to reach the sky,  
Let me take you on an awkward journey, let me tell you why.  
Let me tell you why  
  
Why should these curses be laid upon me,  
I won't be forgiven 'til I can break free,  
What did I do to deserve all this guilt,  
Pay for my sins, for the sale of my soul.  
  
Demons are trapped all inside my head,  
My hopes of god, reach for heaven from hell,  
My sins are many, my guilt is too heavy,  
The question of knowing of how then what I know?  
  
I'm able to see things, things that I don't wanna see,  
The lies of a thousand souls weigh heavy down on me  
  
I know they're crying for help reaching out  
The burden of them will take me down as well  
The sin of a tohusand souls knocked out in vain  
Reincarnation of me live again  
  
Someone to save me,  
Something to save me from myself  
To bring salvation  
To exorcise this hell  
Someone to save me,  
Something to save me from myself  
To bring Salvation  
To exorcise this hell  
  
Someone to save me  
Something to save me from my hell  
Our destination away from this nightmare  
Someone to save me  
Something to save me from myself  
To bring salvation  
To exorcise this hell
