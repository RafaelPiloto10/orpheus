While no one was looking on the old plantation  
He took her all the way down the long valley road  
They sent her away not too much later  
Left him walking down the old valley road.  
  
Sometimes i lead, sometimes i follow  
This time i'll go where she wants me to go  
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow  
Go deep in the woods down the long valley road  
  
Walk on walk on little doll walk  
Walk on little doll  
  
Out in the hall they were talkin' in a whisper  
Everybody noticed she was gone a while  
Somebody said she was gone to her sister's  
Everyone knew what they were talkin' about.  
  
While no one was looking on the old plantation  
He showed her what they do down the long valley road  
Came back around like nothin' really happened  
Left him standing on the old valley road  
  
Walk on walk on little doll walk on  
Walk on little doll  
Walk on, walk on the valley road  
  
Standing like a stone on the old plantation  
Rich old man wouldn't ever let him in  
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry  
When it all happens, nobody wins  
Walk on walk on little doll walk on  
Walkon little doll etc
