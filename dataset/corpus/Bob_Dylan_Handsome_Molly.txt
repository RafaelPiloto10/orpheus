Well, I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.  
While sailing 'round the ocean,  
While sailing 'round the sea  
I'd think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be.  
Don't you remember, molly  
You gave me your right hand?  
You said whenever you'd marry  
I would be the man.  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease.  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin' by  
I could tell her mind was changin'  
By the rovin' of her eye.  
I go down to the river  
Though everyone's asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An' I begin to weep.  
So I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.
