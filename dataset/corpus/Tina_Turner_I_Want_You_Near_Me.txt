Should you stay, should you go  
You're beginning to see  
I go hot, I go cold  
It's just the devil in me  
You've got to understand I am in love with a beautiful man  
So if you're feeling insecure you've really no cause to be  
  
I want you near me, don't you run away  
I just got used to having you around  
I want you near me, come on here and stay  
Don't let me down  
  
You're so good with your hands  
To help me with a hook or a zip  
Indispensable that's what you are  
For the occasional kiss  
I'm only playing games with you, I can't be nice without being cruel  
I know it's not fair, but I make the rules  
  
I want you near me, don't you run away  
I just got used to having you around  
I want you near me, come on here and stay  
Don't let me down  
  
All I want, I've decided  
Is your attention undivided  
  
I want you near, don't turn away  
I want you near me, won't you stay
