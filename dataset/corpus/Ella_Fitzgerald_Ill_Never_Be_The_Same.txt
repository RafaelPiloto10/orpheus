I'll never be the same  
Stars have lost their meaning for me  
I'll never be the same  
Nothing's what it once used to be  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring  
I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since we're apart  
  
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide  
I know down deep inside  
I'll never be the same  
Never be the same again  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring  
I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since we're apart  
  
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide  
I know down deep inside  
I'll never be the same  
Never be the same again, again  
My heart will never be the same again, again
