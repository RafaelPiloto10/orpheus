Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers  
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours  
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim  
  
Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire  
I never seem to set his love afire  
Gone are the years I've wasted on him  
Sometimes when I get feelin' low  
I say let's call it quits  
Then I hang on and let him go  
Breakin' my heart in bits  
  
Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me  
But even if he does you can believe me  
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim  
  
I'll go on lovin' my Jim
