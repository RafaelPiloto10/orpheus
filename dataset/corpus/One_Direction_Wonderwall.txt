Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you  
By now you shoulda, somehow, realized what you gotta do  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
  
Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
  
And all the roads we have to walk are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would like to say to you  
But I don't know how  
  
Because maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall  
  
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you  
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you've got to do  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
I said maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall
