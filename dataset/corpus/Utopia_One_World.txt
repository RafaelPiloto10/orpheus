One world  
Whoa, it's our world  
Yeah, yeah, one world  
Whoa, it's our world  
Yeah, yeah  
When I walk on th  
Music comes a'ringin' out of every door  
I see faces I know and they give me a sign  
We got something between us and it feels all right  
I see Chrissy the clipper, she colors my hair  
Micky and Margaret make the clothes that we wear  
And there's Gene who runs the club where we dance all night  
When you live in our world everything's all right  
Politicians and dictators and the guys with the dough  
They think they run the world but they just don't know  
'Cause down here on the street we got it under control  
From Berlin to San Francisco, from New York to Tokyo
