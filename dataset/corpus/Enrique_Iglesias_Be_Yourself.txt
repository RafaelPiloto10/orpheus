Well I am what I am could be what you are.  
Is your pain when you smile 'cause you feel alone?  
And are you strong enough to be yourself??  
Papa used to say "You're just a loser  
And you're never gonna have what it takes"  
Mama used to say "All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere"  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
If you cried, would you hide  
Would you want all the world to know  
And if you believe in love  
Would you let it show  
Are you in, are you hip, are you cool  
Do you try too hard  
Or are you strong enough to be yourself  
Papa used to say "You're just a loser  
And you're never gonna have what it takes"  
Mama used to say "All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere"  
Papa used to say "You're just a loser and you're never gonna have what it
takes"  
Mama used to say "All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere"  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
Ah you gotta be yourself.  
If you can't, can't be yourself you're gonna lose it all.  
If you can't,can't be yourself what are you living for?  
You're gonna find someday you gotta run away.  
You gotta run, run, run away.
