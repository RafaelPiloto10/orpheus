I know people who lose their lover turn around and they find another  
Fall in love and then they break up I don't know if I want to wake up  
Cause I'm still dreamin' I'm still dreamin' baby  
I'm still dreamin' oh oh oh about you  
Other women walk right up to me I hear them talking but it goes right through
me  
I know it's love that's on the line but they don't know what's on my mind  
Cause I'm still dreamin'...  
It's like a voice that's always calling it's like a feelin' that I'm always
falling  
I close my eyes and all I see is you you you  
Cause I'm still dreamin'...  
I'm still dreamin'...
