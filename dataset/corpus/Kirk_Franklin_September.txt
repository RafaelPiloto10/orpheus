Wow, it's your boy  
Let's go  
This is a tribute right here  
And it's about to go down  
  
Do you remember twenty-first night of September?  
Before you go cold like December  
And all you saw a cloudy day  
  
And I remember that day when you surrender  
You start turning 'cause you remember  
The season it won't last away  
  
Ba de ya, tell me you remember  
Ba de ya, and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop  
(I can see clearly now)  
Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop  
(The sun is much brighter now)  
Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop  
(The season it won't last away)  
  
Sing like forever  
You said when will my life get better?  
I'm tired of stormy weather  
But the sun always shines in day  
  
So just remember  
The next time you feel like December  
Remember the night in September  
When God wiped all your tears away  
  
Ba de ya, tell me you remember  
Ba de ya, and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba de ya, tell me you remember  
Ba de ya, and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Everybody has a September in their life  
You know, that first time you heart God's voice  
Oh, you felt His Love  
  
So no matter what season you're in right now  
After winter comes spring  
So if you love my Jesus help me sing  
  
Ba de ya, tell me you remember  
Ba de ya, and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba de ya, tell me you remember  
Ba de ya, and your heart felt like September  
You still had the joy and God was just a prayer away  
  
Ba de ya  
(I can see clearly now)  
Ba de ya  
(The sun is much brighter now)  
Ba de ya  
(The season it won't last away)  
  
Ba de ya  
(I can see clearly now)  
Ba de ya  
(The sun is much brighter now)  
Ba de ya  
(The season it won't last away)  
  
Ba de ya  
(I can see clearly now)  
Ba de ya  
(The sun is much brighter now)  
Ba de ya  
(The season it won't last away)
