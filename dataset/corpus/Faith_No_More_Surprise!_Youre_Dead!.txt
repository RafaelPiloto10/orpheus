Surprise! you're dead!  
Ha ha! open your eyes  
See the world as it used to be when you used to be in it  
When you were alive and wen you were in love  
And when I took it from you!  
It's not over yet  
You don't remember?  
I won't let you forget  
The hatred I bestowed  
Upon your neck with a fatal blow  
From my teeth and my tongue  
I've drank and swallowed, but it's just begun  
Now you are mine  
I'll keep killing you until the end of time  
Surprise! you're dead!  
Guess what?  
It never ends  
The pain, the torment and torture, profanity  
Nausea, suffering, perversion, calamity  
You can't get away
