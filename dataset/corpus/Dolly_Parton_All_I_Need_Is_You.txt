Find the loneliest girl in a thousand find the saddest eyes you've ever seen  
Find someone who's always longing for you find that man and you found me  
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you  
Find a man who wakes up every morning and lives in a world of make believe  
Find someone who's arms are aching for you you find that girl and you found me  
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you  
You're with me now so let the world forsake us  
I've found my heaven here within your arms  
And nothing in this world can separate us you're all I ever wanted all along  
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
