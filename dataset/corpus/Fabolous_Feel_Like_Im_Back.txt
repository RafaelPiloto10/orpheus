Hey my nigga do me a favor. (what's that my nigga?)  
If u happen to bump into the streets  
Can you please tell him I'm back? (oh okay I'll do that)  
I appreciate that (my nigga)  
  
[Repeat x4]  
Na nana na nana nana na  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
I take it in  
I blow it out  
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out  
Bentley waiting by the curb I spur it out  
Doors don't open they self the chauffeur get out  
My exhale made anything a foggy blur  
I make my way through the reporters and photographers  
I take my lady's hand I shake my attorney's  
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey  
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out  
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud  
Any last words?  
Justice has been served  
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
I ain't lose a step  
I ain't miss a beat  
Thugs have emotions we miss the streets  
We kiss the heat  
We love the block  
We rubber band the money we black glove the glock  
I'm screamin' free at last free at last  
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass  
That's real talk that's a real bitch  
Fly as I left the minx still fit  
They know my name but in case they didn't know so  
Appear in a casket courtesy of loso  
So you should have your shit packed  
I'm a need ya to not be here when I get back  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Aye daddy's home after a long day  
I'm from the hood I came a long way  
But I ain't goin' back I'm just visitin'  
I hear the streets talkin' I'm just listenin'  
If they ain't talkin' money I'm out my business then  
If that ain't what it is then what is it then?  
I'm out here grizzyin' swizzyin'  
It's me bitches sittin' in a phantom  
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom  
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson  
I came back for it like I left it nigga  
You try me you get more than a efa f it nigga  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)

Na nana na nana nana na
