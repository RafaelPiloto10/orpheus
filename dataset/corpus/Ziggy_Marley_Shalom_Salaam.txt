Lost am I in my memories of my forefathers' legacy  
I am one of you you are one of me  
Why don't we set the people free  
How I grieve to see fulfillment of prophecy  
Naive of me to think things could change  
While man remain the same so war will be for me everyday  
No peace no peace for the children of Israel  
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes  
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine  
  
Shalom salaam shalom salaam  
  
Who will take the blame for the blood of my children  
To who does vengeance belong to no one no one  
We're dying from tanks and suicide bombs  
The only answer is to live as one  
And justice will come for my sons and just will come for my sons  
  
Shalom salaam shalom salaam  
  
And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what  
Is in the heart of you  
And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what  
Is in the heart of you  
Children are children no matter color or faith  
And I wonder if history will teach us again  
  
So war will be for me everyday  
No peace no peace for the children of Israel  
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes  
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine  
  
And justice will come for my sons  
  
Shalom salaam shalom salaam
