I'm scared today  
More than I told you I was yesterday  
Give me a moment to catch my breath  
And hold me every second left  
  
Proud of me  
That's the only way I want you to be  
Look at me and love  
What you see  
  
I won't make it alone  
I need something to hold  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me it's not over  
I promised to always come home to you  
Remind me that I'm older  
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder  
And don't give up on what we're trying to do  
  
Don't count the miles,  
Count the "I love you's"  
  
We made it out  
And all the other people are asking how  
This doesn't even sound like truth  
To grow from a bruise  
  
But one day we will realize  
How hard it was, how hard we tried  
And how our hearts made it out alive  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me it's not over  
I promised to always come home to you  
Remind me that I'm older  
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder  
And don't give up on what we're trying to do  
  
Don't count the miles,  
Count the "I love you's"  
  
And these are words  
I wish you said  
But that's not how it went  
'Cause you gave up on us in the end  
  
And I won't make it alone  
I need something to hold  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me it's not over  
I promised to always come home to you  
Remind me that I'm older  
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder  
And don't give up on what we're trying to do  
  
Kiss me on my shoulder  
Tell me it's not over  
I promised I'd come home to you  
Remind me that I'm older  
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder  
And don't give up on what we're trying to do  
  
Don't count the miles,  
Count the "I love you's"
