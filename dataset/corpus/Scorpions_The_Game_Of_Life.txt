The time has come  
For me to talk to you  
And I don't mean  
To hurt your pride  
But everybody needs a friend sometimes  
To make you see the light  
  
[Chorus]  
In the game of life  
The strong survive  
We're on a one-way street  
We gotta make it out alive  
And never let 'em drag us down  
In the game of life  
We live and die  
Another breath begins  
Another chance to win the fight  
From the moment that you hit the ground  
In the game of life  
  
You're born to hunt  
And never run away  
And then you're hunted  
By the prey  
The wounded deer  
Leaps highest to the sun  
Until his day is done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Here comes the morning  
It's time to play  
The game of life  
The game of life  
  
[Chorus]
