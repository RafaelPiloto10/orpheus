Narcissistic anorexic so unstuck but so pretty  
I love you  
[something?] : you're the only truth in this city  
Don't ever change  
Don't change good champagne for some sad idiot and then complain  
That's good advice  
But a lady who has two black eyes is not the best one to advise  
She's already been told twice  
  
Don't ever change (why oh why oh why oh)  
Would you ever change (oh oh oh)  
Please don't ever change  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
  
Paranoiac drug addicted pornographically afflicted  
Sleep with me  
Two legs a cock a woman's soul strange how this lady can control  
Oooh show them to me  
You can hardly see this woman only wants you for your money  
You who have not  
Come inside my hive where bees are busy making honey  
Oooh love is about  
  
Don't ever change (why oh why oh why oh)  
Would you ever change (oh oh oh)  
Please don't ever change  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
  
One two three one two three one two three  
Half of half and half of half and half of half and half of that  
  
Artistic repetitious people-phobically suspicious  
With an oversize charm  
Unemployable illegal you're a whole film by Don Siegel  
Oooh write me a song  
  
Go away and blow away and fade away and the next day  
You're back in the line  
If love is leaving everything for homelessness and nothing  
Ooh you'll be just fine  
  
Don't ever change (why oh why oh why oh)  
Would you ever change (the best part of Ohio)  
Please don't ever change  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect  
You're almost perfect
