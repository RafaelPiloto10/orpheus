Are there years between us?  
Have you seen me when I didn't see you?  
Its so good to know that someone can  
Love me as much as I think you do...  
Do I love you?  
Your a fool if you don't know  
Or maybe I'm so good at hiding  
Even the truth is hidden from you  
But somehow I doubt that your  
As smart as I could ever be  
But still my question remains  
Is our love meant to be?  
Cause it feels too good to be true  
Can someone love me so much more than I love myself  
Is this all true?  
Does love resonate in your heart  
Like the songs say it does?  
I can't even begin to believe my dreams  
When they actually come true...
