There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that she turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although I may not be the man  
Some girls think of as handsome  
But to her heart  
I carry the key  
  
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although I may not be the man  
Some girls think of as handsome  
But to her heart  
I carry the key  
  
And this world would be like heaven, if she'd  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
Someone to watch over me
