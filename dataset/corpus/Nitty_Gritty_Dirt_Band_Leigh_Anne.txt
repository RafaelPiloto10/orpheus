Leigh Anne  
I don't want to need you like I do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Hard to stay away from something as fine as you  
  
Will I be the one you love enough  
Or just another angel I can't touch  
Leave me in between that will never do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Just a little piece ain't enough of you  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
I don't want to chase you like a fool  
Up and down the avenue  
Carry your books home too  
  
Let me be the one you love enough  
You're just another angel I can't touch  
Something in between it'll never do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Just a little piece ain't enough of you  
  
No no no  
Don't say no  
I don't want to need you like I do  
Just want to get close to you  
No no no  
Please don't go  
Cause baby you'll find  
That I'm too good to lose  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
I don't want to need you like I do  
Up and down the avenue  
I'm gonna carry your books home too  
  
Someday I'll be the one you love enough  
Or just another angel I can't touch  
Nothing in between will ever do  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
Just a little piece ain't enough of you  
  
No no no  
No no no  
Just a little piece ain't enough of you  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
  
Leigh Anne  
Leigh Anne  
  
Leigh Anne
