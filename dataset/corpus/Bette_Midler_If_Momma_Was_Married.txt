If Momma was married, we'd live in a house  
As private as private can be  
Just Momma, three ducks, five canaries, a mouse  
Two monkeys, one father, six turtles and me  
If Momma was married  
If Momma was married, I'd jump in the air  
And give all my toe shoes to you  
I'd get all those hair ribbons out of my hair  
And once and for all, I'd get Momma out too  
If Momma was married  
Momma get out your white dress  
You've done it before without much success  
Momma, Godspeed and God bless  
We're not keeping score, what's one more or less?  
Oh, Momma, say yes  
And waltz down the hall while you may  
I'll gladly support you, I'll even escort you  
And I'd gladly give you away  
Oh, Momma, get married today  
If Momma was married there wouldn't be anymore  
'Let's me entertain you', 'Let me make you smile'  
'I will do some kicks', 'I would do some tricks'  
Sing out, Louise, smile, baby  
Momma, please take our advice  
We aren't The Lunts, I'm not Fanny Brice  
Momma, we'll buy you the rice  
If only this once you wouldn't think twice  
It could be so nice if Momma got married to stay  
But Momma gets married and married and married  
And never gets carried away  
Oh, Momma, oh, Momma, oh, Momma, get married today
