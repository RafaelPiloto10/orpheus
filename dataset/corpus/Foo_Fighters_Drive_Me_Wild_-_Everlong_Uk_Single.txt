You could be in a cadillac  
You could be in contro of the child  
Whoever be kickin', baby your the first  
Come one baby, drive me wild, ooh  
  
You could be on the telephone  
Whatever you want just dial  
Come on baby please, its so easy  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby drive me wild  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
  
Look at me on the radio  
Call me up and make a request  
If you know a fine thing just name it  
When I'm bad baby I'm the best  
Come on baby please, its so easy  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby drive me wild  
  
This of me with a big guitar  
Stick me up here with a smil  
Come on baby please, its so easy  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby drive me wild  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby, drive me wild  
Drive me wild, do it baby drive me wild  
Drive me wild, do it baby drive me wild  
  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby drive me wild  
Come on you can do it, drive me wild  
Do it baby drive me wild
