Days can be sunny  
With never a sigh  
Don't need what money can buy  
Birds in the trees sing  
Their day full of song  
Why shouldn't we sing along?  
  
I'm chipper all the day  
Happy with my lot  
How do I get that way?  
Look at what I've got  
  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
I've got daisies  
In green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old Man Trouble  
I don't mine him  
You won't find him  
Round my door  
  
I got starlight  
I got sweet dreams  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
Who could ak for anything more?  
I got daisies  
In green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old Man Trouble  
I don't mind him  
You won't find him  
Hangin' round my front or back door  
  
Who could ask for anything more?  
Who could ask for anything more?
