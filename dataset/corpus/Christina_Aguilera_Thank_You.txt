Feel like I've been locked up  
Nobody seen, let's go  
Come on, come on  
Baby, baby, baby  
I grant you three wishes 'cause I be the genie  
Christina Aguilera  
It seems like a lifetime  
Since I felt like a prisoner of my dreams, yeah, yeah  
It took such a long time  
For me to realize just how to be and to listen to me  
Don't go thinking I'm not thankful  
'Cause me, I've got my hands full of good things  
And I hope I can give back  
A little bit of what you've given me  
So thank you for standing right by me, I will always love you  
So thank you for being behind me, you are just so amazing  
And watching me grow and letting others know  
That you still believe in what I'll be  
So people have said things in times  
About me that weren't always true, ooh, yeah  
But you've always been there  
To give that extra love to pull me through, to do what I gotta do  
'Cause there'll always be those ups and downs  
But you've always seemed to stick around and see  
See me through to believe, yeah  
And I hope I can give back  
A little bit of what you've given me  
You given me all that I need, yeah  
So thank you for standing right by me, I thank you for everything  
So thank you for being behind me, thank you, Christina  
And watching me grow and letting others know  
That you still believe in what I'll be, sing it, girl  
It took awhile 'til I could do what I wanted  
And now I'm so happy that it started where we started  
I'm thanking God that I could be in the position  
To do my own thing now and make my own decisions  
And so I'm thanking you for being true  
And standing by me through and through
