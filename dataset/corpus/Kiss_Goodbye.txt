Ain't it funny how the time slips away  
'Cause now I'm leavin' and I wish I could stay  
People wonder why they don't get a chance  
They wait for music but they don't get to dance  
Mmm, well now I know when my work is through  
I'm gonna be with you  
So goodbye  
Is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back  
I swear it somehow  
  
Ain't it funny how we win but we lose  
We're given prizes that we don't get to use  
People wonder 'bout the things that we've got  
It seems so little but we know it's a lot  
Now I know when my work is through  
I'm gonna be with you, oh yeah  
I'm gonna be with you  
  
So goodbye, is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back, I swear it somehow  
Oh, goodbye is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back, I swear it somehow  
Sing it  
  
I'm on the run  
So I must go  
And I hate to leave  
I hope that you know  
  
Oh, goodbye is only for now  
'Cause I'm comin' back, I swear it somehow
