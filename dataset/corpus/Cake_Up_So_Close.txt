Up so close I never get to see your face.  
Microscope I might as well be out in space.  
Up so close I never get to see the view.  
Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you.  
  
Up your nose down to your toes.  
In your mouth way down south.  
Up so close it seems I only think of you.  
Up so close I never see the sky so blue.  
  
I only wanted to be sure  
That what it was was really pure.  
I put my face down in the cake.  
My feet were flailing in a lake.  
  
Up so close, I never get to see your face.  
Microscope, I might as well be out in space.  
Up so close, I never get to see you.  
Microscope, I'm never sure if it's still you.
