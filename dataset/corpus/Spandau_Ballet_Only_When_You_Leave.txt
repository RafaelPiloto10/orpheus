Layin' in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
But now you're leavin'  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now you're leavin'  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh, it's killing me so much  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh only when you leave  
I'll need to love you  
And when the action has all gone  
I'm just a little fool enough to need you  
A fool enough too long  
Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger  
Ooh, I'll make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger  
And take this soul away  
  
I only want to make this things last  
So how could this have gone so fast  
And now you're leavin'  
How many times must I learn  
It's only when you've gone that I burn  
  
And now you're leavin'  
In the end, all that is left has come unbearable  
It's hard to change your mind  
So leave it all behind  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Layin' in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
Ooh, but now you're leavin'  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now you're leavin'  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh, it's killing me so much  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Woo-oh-oh-oh...no no no no  
  
Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger  
Ooh, I'll make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger...
