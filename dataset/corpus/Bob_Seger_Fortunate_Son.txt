Some folks are born made to wave the flag  
Ooh, they're red, white, and blue  
And when the band plays hail to the chief  
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord  
  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no senator's son, son, son  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, no  
  
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand  
Lord, don't they help themselves now  
And when the tax man comes to the door  
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes  
  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no millionaire's son, son, son  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, no, no  
  
Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes  
Ooh, they send you down to war  
And when you ask 'em how much should we give  
Ooh, they only answer more, more, more, more  
  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no military son, son, son  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one  
  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, one, one  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate son, son, son
