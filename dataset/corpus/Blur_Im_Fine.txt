Your man is always flaming  
He's hitting his head against the wall  
He do it to you  
He do it again, he knows to do  
I've always found you complicated  
A boy tried to shut you up  
I do what I do  
I do it again, again, again  
And I'd like you to know  
It's alright  
There's a world around us  
I need you to know  
I'm alright  
No need to worry about me  
'Cause I'm just fine  
Your man has lost his meaning  
Smash his head against the wall  
He do it to you  
He do it again  
He's coming back to you  
You give me the strangest feeling  
You shut me of myself  
You do it to me  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
Then you do it again  
And I'd like you to know  
It's alright  
There's a world around us  
I need you to know  
I'm alright  
No need to worry about me  
'Cause I'm just fine  
I'm just, I'm just fine  
And I'd like you to know I'm alright  
It's a world around us  
I need you to know  
I'm alright  
No need to worry about me  
'Cause I'm just fine  
I'm just fine  
I'm just fine  
I'm just fine
