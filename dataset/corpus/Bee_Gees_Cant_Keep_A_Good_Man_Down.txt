No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Ooh, with lips so sweet  
Our love just can't be beat, my darling, oh yeah  
A love like yours and mine  
Can stand the test of time, my darling, oh yeah  
But for tomorrow -- tomorrow never comes  
Love is the secret -- goes living on  
  
No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Just when I need you, show me the way  
You came into my world -- turned my night to day  
What good is a man without a woman?  
But for the trouble -- trouble always comes  
Love is the secret -- goes living on  
  
No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I got enough  
  
Ooh, your love is strong  
Keep me forever, you're my darling, oh yeah  
A love like yours and mine  
Can stand the test of time, my darling, oh yeah  
But for tomorrow -- tomorrow never comes  
Love is the secret -- goes living on  
  
No, you can't keep a good man down  
When you got a good woman to keep it up  
No, you can't stand on firmer ground  
When love is the question I've got enough
