Oh man  
I can't go to work  
I got 2 more sick days  
  
This is for my people working  
Waking up at six in the morning  
Try to make an honest living  
Oki oki oki oki oh  
  
Let me see your hands up high  
Touch the cloud reach for the sky  
Need some time peace of mind  
To make money, money, make money, money, money  
  
[Chorus]  
Holiday, holiday  
Cause I work hard everyday, everyday  
Need some time to get away, get away  
So tell my boss I need a holiday, holiday  
You know you want a holiday, holiday  
Cause you work hard everyday, everyday  
Tell your boss that you want a raise, want a raise  
Let's go make money, money, make money, money, money  
  
Moving you know we keep it moving  
My people in the front  
You gotta keep it moving  
Keep it moving you know we keep it moving  
My people in the back  
We gotta keep it moving  
Keep it moving you know we keep it moving  
My people in the rear  
You gotta keep it moving  
Keep it moving you know we keep it moving  
Let's go make money, money, make money, money, money  
  
This is for my people riding  
Can't make car no bills keep piling  
Wining, dining when the bill comes  
Breakout here comes the sound  
I'm tired of the same routine  
First one, last one on the scene  
A pocket little drives so I need the queen  
I gotta make money, money, make money, money, money  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now the house is on fire  
And we don't need no water  
As long as there's music hit it  
As long as there's music  
Let it burn, burn, burn, burn  
  
[Chorus]
