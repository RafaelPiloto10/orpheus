I've only got one real fan  
She is not woman, she is not man  
She's got her own coat of arms and her tartan and her own clan  
Her clan surpasses beauty  
always love and never duty  
A beauty that feels so alien to this land  
  
These feelings should be censored they should be banned  
But when you put a porn-star in these hands  
I'm the 6 month old with the keys to his own pram  
You got this straight to play the fool  
Miss out nursery, miss out school  
And gave the bullet train option to this old abandoned tram  
  
How do you make so special look like dross  
How do you make expensive look budget cost  
If it's power to the workers then you are the boss  
You make bluebells look like moss  
Gave a second coat to gloss  
And made Lennon's little Ono look like dross  
If prostitution was not illegal  
you'd make cheap sex look so regal  
Make the hottest little joint in town look like frost  
  
The famous they get stalkers, they get pests  
But I'd rather get a bullet right through my chest  
All that Lennon could imagine  
was not you, was just a fraction  
and all half-hearted get is second best
