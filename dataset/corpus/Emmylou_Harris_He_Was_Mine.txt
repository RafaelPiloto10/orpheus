(Paul Kennerley)  
  
You asked me if I've met your baby  
I have to say it's been some time now  
But it seems like yesterday  
He was mine for awhile  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now he's yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when he was mine  
  
You say he means the world to you  
Yes I can tell  
You'll make each other happy I wish you well  
He was mine for awhile  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now he's yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when he was mine  
  
He was mine  
He was mine
