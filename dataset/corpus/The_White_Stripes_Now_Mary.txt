Now Mary  
Can't you find a way  
To bring me down?  
  
I'm so sorry  
That I had to go  
And let you down  
  
Knowing you I'll think  
Things are gonna be fine  
But then again you'll  
Probably change your mind  
  
I'm sorry Mary but  
Being your mate  
Means trying to find something  
That you aren't going to hate  
  
What a season  
To be beautiful  
Without a reason  
  
Knowing you I'll think  
Things are gonna be fine  
But then again you'll  
Probably change your mind  
  
Mary  
Can't you find a way  
To bring me down?
