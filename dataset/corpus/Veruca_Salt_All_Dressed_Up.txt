Don't you see  
I'm the one for you, you're the one for me  
Don't you see  
The love I've got is the love you need  
Don't you see  
I'm all dressed up  
To be what you want  
Me to be I'm all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
I'm all dressed up  
All dressed up, all dressed up  
Don't you see, don't you see  
The infinite possibilities  
Don't you need, don't you need  
The kind of love that I need  
Don't you see me, don't you see me  
I'm all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
I'm all dressed up  
To be what you taught me to be  
I'm all dressed up  
All messed up, all messed up  
You don't even notice me  
Moving you like a ton of glaciers  
You don't even notice me  
Soothing you like a long lost sister  
You don't even care  
No you don't even care  
All dressed up  
With no place to go  
But home, but home  
I'm all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
I'm all dressed up  
To be what you want me to be  
I'm all dressed up  
All dressed up, all dressed up  
You don't even comfort me  
And carry on with the will of samson  
You don't even comfort me  
You keep your faith and you keep your phantoms  
And you don't even care  
No you don't even care  
All dressed up still there's something wrong  
I'm all dressed up and you're just a song  
I'm all dressed up you're forever gone everlong  
You don't even care  
No you don't even care  
You don't even care  
No you don't even care  
You don't even care  
No you don't even care  
You don't even care  
No you don't even care  
You don't even care  
No you don't even care  
You don't even care
