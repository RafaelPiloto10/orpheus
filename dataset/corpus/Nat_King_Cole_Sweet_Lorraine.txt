Just found joy  
I'm as happy as a baby boy, baby boy  
With another brand new choo-choo choy  
When I met my sweet Lorraine, Lorraine, Lorraine  
  
A pair of eyes  
That are brighter than the summer sky  
When you see them, you'll realize  
Why I love my sweet Lorraine  
  
Now when its rainin'  
I don't miss the sun  
Because its in my baby's smile, whoa ho  
And to think that I'm the lucky one  
That will lead her down the aisle, whoa ho ho  
  
Each night I pray  
That no one will steal her heart away  
I can't wait until that lucky day  
When I marry sweet Lorraine  
  
Now when its rainin'  
I don't miss the sun  
Because its in my baby's smile, whoa ho  
And to think that I'm the lucky one  
That will lead her down the aisle, whoa ho ho  
  
Each night I pray  
That no one will steal her heart away  
I can't wait until that lucky day  
When I marry sweet Lorraine
