Sell us a president, agency man  
Smiling Big Brother, stern father perhaps  
Sell us a president, agency man  
A gay smiling nothing we know never craps  
  
Let's try California,  
(Pay us first before we do it!)  
We'll get a smilin' nazi  
And march him right on through  
Rent a baby  
Kiss a baby  
Ladies in for tea  
  
And here's a bunch of speeches  
We'll toss 'em in for free  
  
Sell us a president, agency man  
Smiling Big Brother, stern father perhaps  
Sell us a president, agency man  
A gay smiling nothing we know never craps  
  
We'll sell him in the movies  
On the tube throughout the year  
We'll sell him by the buckets  
To the Okies drinking beer  
We'll teach him how to walk and talk  
We'll putty up his chin  
We'll print his picture everywhere  
Of course the schmuck will win  
  
From the heart of old Death Valley  
To the ruling of our land  
A simple trick, you simple pigs  
Just the way we planned
