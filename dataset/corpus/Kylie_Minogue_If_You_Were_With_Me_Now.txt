Without you standing by my side  
Love and good fortune passes me by  
And you were my guiding light  
It seemed so easy  
When we said goodbye  
  
How different would the world be now  
If only we had worked it out somehow  
What kind of fools are you and I  
There would be stars up in the sky  
If you were with me now  
  
And I know I may go astray  
But who's to say that we can't change our mind  
My love burns stronger each day  
If I'm sure of one thing  
  
One love at a time  
How could we throw our love away  
When we had so much more than words can say  
The darkest clouds would fade away  
To bring the light into my day  
If you were with me now  
  
If loving you is right  
Then turn back the hands of time  
I'd do anything to make you mine  
There'snothing that I wouldn't do  
I could make you feel my love for you  
If you were with me now  
If you were with me now  
If you were with me now
