You've always shared the light.  
Although you could clearly see the sacrifice.  
Preaching wrong from right.  
Prosecution was the story of your life.  
The blood money paid.  
A kiss betrayed.  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
And now the curtain is drawn.  
And I can see the moment of some kind of truth.  
They nailed you to the cross.  
Although you walked the righteous path since your birth.  
The blood money paid.  
A kiss betrayed.  
In this final hour.  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
[guitar solo]  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
To be crucified.  
It was his destiny
