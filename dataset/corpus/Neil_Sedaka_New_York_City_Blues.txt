Life and death in an alley way  
Just a heartbeat away from a ma-a-an  
Who's learned to turn his head away  
From the pai-ain that drai-ains the la-and  
Harlem's not too far from here  
You can smell the garbage, feel the fear  
I hear they're gonna build a skyscraper there-ere  
As if we didn't need the extra air-air  
  
[Chorus]  
New York City blue-ues  
In order to wi-in, you've got to lo-o-ose  
Old before your ti-ime  
The dirt and the gri-ime get into everythi-ing  
And the papers love to say-ay-ay  
It's the meanest town in the USA  
But I think it's okay  
It's the town I've ma-ade my home  
  
On another side of Park Avenue  
Respectable folks don't know-ow-ow  
Hungry eyes take in the view  
Of the wor-orld that lay-ays them low-ow  
Too many years on a welfare line  
The old song and da-ance, ti-ime after time  
You can only get so pushed arou-ound  
Until you want to tear the damn thing dow-own  
Tear it dow-own  
  
[Chorus x 2]
