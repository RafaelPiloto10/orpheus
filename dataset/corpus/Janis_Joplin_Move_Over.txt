I'll tell you something, man,  
I never expected that out of Toronto, man.  
You're looking real good, real good  
In fact you're all invited to my house for a drink.  
I live in San Francisco and if you can get there man,  
I'll give you the drink.  
I promise.  
I ain't too hard to find, ha ha ha ha ha  
I'm all over the streets, man.  
Ha Ha. I'm not.  
  
A while back, it was about a year ago,  
I think it was, I had this apartment in San Francisco,  
I lived on the third floor in this little tiny apartment building,  
Had a little two rooms and a dog, right.  
  
I lived on the third floor and I used to walk around town and I had,  
You know, a couple of pairs of Levis and a couple T-shirts  
And I thought I had my shit pretty good together, man.  
  
You know I was out on the streets talking and talking,  
Doing all that shit, and every time I found a nice piece of talent  
He went right straight downstairs to the chick on the second floor,  
There was another chick on the second floor, right.  
  
And I couldn't understand, I couldn't understand,  
I kept thinking, Janis, why are you doing wrong suddenly ?  
Well I so decided to get up one morning, ha ha ha,  
And check out the chick's action, right,  
Figure out what she had going that I didn't have going.  
  
I got up at 9:30 in the morning,  
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part.  
And I got up at 9:30 in the morning,  
I hid in the stairwell right next  
To the chick's across from her apartment, right.  
And I watched her and watched to see what she had, man,  
That I didn't have.  
  
And I'll tell you what she had man,  
That chick hit the streets at noon.  
I mean I didn't use to get up till three.  
That chick was already in the street hustling, man.  
So I figured out what you gotta do, man.  
Every time you're looking for a little piece of action  
And you ain't getting none, man,  
You know what you better do, baby,  
You better try harder, man.
