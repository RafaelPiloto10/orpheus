Did I work on the battlefield?  
Did I do what I thought was right?  
Did I do all that I could do?  
Did I put up a good fight?  
  
Did I love all that I should?  
To everyone in my sight?  
What did I do with my life?  
  
Did I exercise giving and forgiveness with all my might?  
Did I honor my freedom and did I live in the light?  
Did I cherish my moments?  
Did I take a good enough bite?  
What did I do with my life?  
  
You can live any way you want to  
All you have to do is dance  
Achieve anything you thought of  
You just have to take the chance  
You can fall in love with your life  
'Cause that truly is romance  
What did I do with my life?  
  
Did I learn what I came to learn?  
Did I listen with my heart?  
Did I do what I came to do?  
And how did I play the part?  
Did I see all the beauty?  
Because living is an art  
What did I do with my life?  
  
You can live any way you want to  
All you have to do is dance  
Achieve anything you thought of  
You just have to take the chance  
  
Learn to love your life  
'Cause that truly is romance  
Oh what did I do with my life?  
what did I do?  
say it again  
what did I do with my life?  
Oh what did I do?  
With my life  
What did I do?  
What did I do?
