Have I gone crazy  
Is there someone new  
Something strange is going on  
Between me and you  
But tell me baby  
Tell me it's not true  
'Cause I've been hearing things about you  
  
Are you unhappy  
Are you lonely too  
Won't you tell me face to face  
What you're gonna do  
Well I still love you  
But I'm nobody's fool  
I've been hearing things about you  
  
Yeah I heard I've been dancin'  
When you're out there runnin' 'round  
And I heard you've been seein'  
Some stranger you have found  
And I heard you've been thinkin'  
About tellin' me we're through  
Yeah I've been hearing things about you  
  
Yeah I heard you've been thinkin'  
About tellin' me we're through  
I've been hearing things, oh I ain't naming names  
I've been hearing things about you
