A cloud of eiderdown  
Draws around me  
Softening a sound.  
Sleepy time, and I lie,  
With my love by my side,  
And she's breathing low.  
  
And the candle dies.  
  
When night comes down  
You lock the door.  
The book falls to the floor.  
As darkness falls  
The waves roll by,  
The seasons change  
The wind is wry.  
  
Now wakes the hour  
Now sleeps the swan  
Behold the dream  
The dream is gone.  
Green fields are calling  
It's falling, in a golden door.  
  
And deep beneath the ground,  
The early morning sounds  
And I go down.  
Sleepy time, and I lie,  
With my love by my side,  
And she's breathing low.  
  
And I rise, like a bird,  
In the haze, when the first rays  
Touch the sky.  
  
And the night wings die.
