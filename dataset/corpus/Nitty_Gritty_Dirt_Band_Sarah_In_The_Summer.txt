I've driven this road as a stranger  
I've driven this road as a friend  
I've driven this road as a slack-jawed tourist  
And I'm drivin on it once again  
It might be cold and long and lonely  
But she's waiting on the other side  
And I'm an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And joyfully I ride.  
I climb through Georgetown, Silver Plume  
The tunnel at Loveland's cold?  
The lake on the left is a little low  
Route 9 is the Breckenridge road  
There's a sign right below Copper Mountain  
Telling the weather on Independence runs free  
And I'm an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And that's where I wanna be  
In the evening shadow of Red Butte  
Up the lane from the Slaughterhouse Bridge  
The first cabin the moonlight strikes as it crests the cliff in Hunter Creek
ridge  
Up from between old Red and Smuggler  
Rising high on a piano bench there  
And I'm an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And what lies between beware  
What lies between, beware  
And the red sandstone sentinels rising high on either side  
As I follow the Eagle Valley  
Through the canyon where the saints reside  
And my Sopris massive majesty South  
And East out of Glen-y-wood Springs  
And I'm an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
Where the Roaring River sings  
Where the Roaring River sings.I've driven this road as a stranger  
I've driven this road as a friend  
I've driven this road as a slack-jawed tourist  
And I'm drivin on it once again  
It might be cold and long and lonely  
But she's waiting on the other side  
And I'm an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And joyfully I ride.
