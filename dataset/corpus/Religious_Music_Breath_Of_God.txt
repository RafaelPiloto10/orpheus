Breathe on me, breath of God,  
Fill me with life anew,  
That I may love what Thou dost love,  
And do what Thou wouldst do.  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God,  
Until my heart is pure,  
Until with Thee I will one will,  
To do and to endure.  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God,  
Blend all my soul with Thine,  
Until this earthly part of me  
Glows with Thy fire divine.  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God,  
So shall I never die,  
But live with Thee the perfect life  
Of Thine eternity.
