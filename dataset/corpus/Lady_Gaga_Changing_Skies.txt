Ooh ooh ohh  
Oh oh oh  
Ooh ooh ohh  
Oh oh oh  
Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
I, need somebody who calls my name  
When clouds are smokin up my way  
You get me through these ch-changing skies  
  
I, don't wanna be afraid again  
It's just that I could use a friend  
You get me through these ch-changing skies  
  
Give me something that I  
Can wrestle to the ground  
There isn't anything that I can't handle now. We're out  
Believe me when I say  
That I Will Be Okay  
And listen that's advised  
And my Ch-Changing skies  
  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
Changing skies  
Changing skies  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
  
Ooh ooh ohh  
Oh oh oh  
Ooh ooh ohh  
Oh oh oh  
Oooh oh oh oooh oh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
And I,  
Don't wanna be the kind to cry  
I wanna dance right through the night  
You get me through these ch-changing skies  
  
Know, that I am not emotional  
It's just that I don't wanna fall  
Without my parachute tonight  
  
Give me something that I  
Can wrestle to the ground  
There isn't anything that I can't handle now-e-ow  
Believe me when I say  
That I Will Be Okay  
And listen that's advised  
And my ch-changing skies  
  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing  
Changing skies  
Changing skies  
Changing skies  
Ch-ch-ch-changing
