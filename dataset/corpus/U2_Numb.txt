Don't move  
Don't talk out of time  
Don't think  
Don't worry  
Everything's just fine  
Just fine  
  
Don't grab  
Don't clutch  
Don't hope for too much  
Don't breathe  
Don't achieve  
Or grieve without leave  
  
Don't check  
Just balance on the fence  
Don't answer  
Don't ask  
Don't try and make sense  
  
Don't whisper  
Don't talk  
Don't run if you can walk  
Don't cheat, compete  
Don't miss the one beat  
  
Don't travel by train  
Don't eat  
Don't spill  
Don't piss in the drain  
Don't make a will  
  
Don't fill out any forms  
Don't compensate  
Don't cower  
Don't crawl  
Don't come around late  
Don't hover at the gate  
  
Don't take it on board  
Don't fall on your sword  
Just play another chord  
If you feel you're getting bored  
  
Enough  
  
Don't change your brand  
Don't listen to the band  
Don't gape  
Get  
Don't ape  
Don't change your shape  
Have another grape  
  
Enough  
  
Don't plead  
Don't bridle  
Don't shackle  
Don't grind  
Don't curve  
Don't swerve  
Lie, die, serve  
Don't theorize, realize, polarize  
Chance, dance,dismiss, apologize  
  
Get  
  
Enough  
Don't spy  
Don't lie  
Don't try  
Imply  
Detain  
Explain  
Start again  
  
Don't triumph  
Don't coax  
Don't cling  
Don't hoax  
Don't freak  
Peak  
Don't leak  
Don't speak  
  
Don't project  
Don't connect  
Protect  
Don't expect  
Suggest  
  
Don't project  
Don't connect  
Protect  
Don't expect  
Suggest  
  
Don't struggle  
Don't jerk  
Don't collar  
Don't work  
Don't wish  
Don't fish  
Don't teach  
Don't reach  
  
Don't borrow  
Enough  
Don't break  
Don't fence  
Don't steal  
Don't pass  
Don't press  
Don't try  
Don't feel  
  
Don't touch  
Don't dive  
Don't suffer  
Don't rhyme  
Don't fantasize  
Don't rise  
Don't lie  
Don't project  
Don't connect  
Protect  
Don't expect  
Suggest  
  
Don't project  
Don't connect  
Protect  
Don't expect  
Suggest  
  
I feel numb
