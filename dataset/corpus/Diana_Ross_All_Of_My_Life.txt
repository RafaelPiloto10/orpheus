All of my life  
I have walked alone  
In search of a star  
You are that star  
You're the one I've waited for  
You're the one I've waited for  
  
All of my life  
There's a song to sing  
A chorus for two  
All that love can bring  
I'll share here with you  
You can make it all come true  
  
So darling  
All of your life to share  
Is all I'm asking  
All of the minutes and the years  
All of your happiness  
And sometimes all your tears  
  
So darling  
All of my life to share  
Is all I give you  
All of the flowers in the field  
We'll walk together through the sunsets and the years  
  
So darling  
All of my life to share  
Is all I'll give you  
And all of the flowers in the field  
We'll walk together through the sunsets and the years  
All of my life  
There's a song to sing  
A chorus for two  
All that love can bring  
I'll share here with you  
You can make it all come true  
  
So darling  
All of my life to share  
Is all I'm asking  
All of the minutes and the years  
All of your happiness  
And sometimes all your tears  
  
So darling  
All of my life to share  
Is all I give you  
All of the flowers in the field  
We'll walk together through the sunsets and the years  
  
So darling  
All of your life to share  
Is all I'm asking
