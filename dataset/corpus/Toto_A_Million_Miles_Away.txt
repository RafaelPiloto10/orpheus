I don't want to know the reason why you don't love me  
I don't want to know the reason why you don't care  
I don't want to know the reason why you're leaving me  
I'm not the only one that lost my love way down there - way down there  
  
I don't want to hear the reason why you don't need me  
I don't want to hear the reason why you don't stay  
I don't want to hear the reason why you're seeing him  
All I know is that I want you back, but you're  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A million miles away and it's killing me inside  
There's a stranger in a carriage and he's taking her out tonight  
The devil's riding on a full moon and he sends his love  
When I'm a million miles away  
  
I don't want to be the reason why you don't love me  
And I don't want to be the reason why you don't care  
I don't want to be the reason why you're leaving me  
I'm not the only one that lost my love  
  
He sends his love and I'm a hundred million miles away
