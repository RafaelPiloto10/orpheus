Get out old Dan's records  
Get out old Dan's records  
We will Dance the whole night long  
It's fun to play the old time songs  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
Bring out old Dan's records  
Bring out old Dan's records  
I remember my aunt Bea  
She'd dance with Dan till two or three  
If old Dan could see he now  
I know he'd shout out loud  
Dig out old Dan's records  
Bring out old Dan's records  
We're all here, we've all got dates  
We'll dance all night to the seventy-eights  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
If old Dan were with us still  
I know he'd come around  
Get out old Dan's records  
Dig out old Dan's records  
Back to nineteen thirty-five  
The foxtrot, jitterbug 'n' jive  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
Get out old Dan's records  
Bring out old Dan's records  
High above the fireplace  
There's a smile on old Dan's face  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know he'd be so proud  
If old Dan were with us still  
I know he'd come around
