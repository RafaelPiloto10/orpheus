Started at the age of four  
My mother went to the grocery store  
Went sneaking through her bedroom door  
To find something in a size four  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me  
  
My daddy threw me in therapy  
He thinks I'm not a real man  
Who put the drag in the drag queen  
Don't knock it until you tried it  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys, just wait 'til all the guys  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
