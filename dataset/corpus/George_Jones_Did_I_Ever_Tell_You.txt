Well honey did I ever tell you just how wonderful you are  
Every time you hold me I'll be floatin' with the stars in the sky  
I wonder why I guess it's love love love love  
Well baby did I ever tell you that you're the greatest guy  
Honey are you with me when I look into your eyes  
I wonder why I wonder why I guess it's love love love love  
Well now don't you know you send me where I never been before  
I just want to let you know I love you so  
Well I like to hear you talkin' but you're wastin' your time  
You're not playin' nothin' that I don't already know  
Well baby did I ever tell you that you got what it takes  
And every time you tuck me in your arms I shake  
I wonder why I wonder why I guess it's love love love love  
[ steel ]  
Well now don't you know you send me...  
I guess it's love love love love I guess it's love love love love
