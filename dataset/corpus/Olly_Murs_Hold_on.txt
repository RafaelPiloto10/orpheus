Middle of the night when it comes creeping  
I lay awake when I should be sleeping  
Like an Agatha Christie mystery  
Do an intermission  
I hold on  
I hold on-n-n  
  
Working everyday  
Living for the weekend  
I never learned to swim how did I end up in the deep end?  
Like a champion high diver waiting for the olympics  
I hold on  
I hold on-n-n  
  
We wrestle with the devil in the flickering light  
No way to tell who's winning the fight  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
You're gonna get through it  
  
Time and again it's the same old question  
Where am I heading with this strange obsession  
Like a gambler playing on when he keeps on losing  
I hold on  
I hold on-n-n  
  
We danced with the devil in the flickering light  
No way to tell when you're stepping it right  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
You're gonna get through it  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
You know you're gonna get through it  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
So today, this life goes on  
Got to keep on moving  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
So today, this life goes on  
Got to keep on moving  
To keep on moving  
  
We danced with the devil in the flickering light  
No way to tell when you're stepping it right  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
You're gonna get through it  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
You know you're gonna get through it  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
You're gonna get through it  
You gotta keep on moving  
You know you're gonna get through it
