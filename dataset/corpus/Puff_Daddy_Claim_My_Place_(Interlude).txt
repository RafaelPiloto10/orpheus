Sometimes I try to figure out  
Just why  
Why you are the way you are  
You... You make it so hard for me to love you  
  
Hold up now  
Listen... I ain't gonna try to sit here and say I'm perfect  
You know  
I mean... I'm tryin' to do the best I can  
With my time here on earth  
You know... You know my mother  
Mama always say that I'd be somebody  
You know  
So you know, I figured that I might as well be great  
You know  
I mean, it's hard to understand how I am  
Some shit you just don't really need to be  
Mother fuckin' understanding though  
I mean God put me here for a reason  
And I'm here to let these mother fuckers know  
  
I've come to claim my place  
  
I've come to claim my place  
  
I'll show you the way  
  
A lot of people don't understand  
They'll understand one day though  
  
I just like to make people feel good  
I really feel I can do anything  
I really truly believe in God that way  
So much that I believe in myself  
I guess I'm kinda like my father  
You know, Who had a relentless spirit  
You know  
He would stop at nothing to achieve his goal  
You now nowadays  
A lot of these mother fuckers don't understand that  
They gonna have to handle it  
Yeah, you feel me  
  
I've come to claim my place  
And I ain't gonna stop  
I ain't gonna never stop  
I thank y'all for ridin' with me  
Thank y'all for rockin' with me  
Through this journey  
It's just begun  
And I wanna take the time to say  
Thank you  
  
Listen to everything he says  
I've come to claim my place  
  
I truly appreciate you  
And I love ya  
Ain't nothin' else to say
