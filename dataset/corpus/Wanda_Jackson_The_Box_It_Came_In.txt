My clothes are all ragged my goodwill coat's not the best  
And I'm a walking on cardboard in my last dollar dress  
I looked in the closet for my wedding gown  
But the box that it came in was all that I found  
He took everything with him that wasn't nailed down  
Bet he's got a new sweetheart to fill my wedding gown  
But somewhere I'll find him then I'll have peace of mind  
And the box he comes home in will be all satin lined
