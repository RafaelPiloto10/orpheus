You left me, for another  
You told me, he was your lover  
So I'm begging and I'm pleading  
And I'm down on any knee, ooh baby  
That's what my heart needs  
  
Baby, ooh baby  
I'm calling you out loud and clear, baby  
Ooh baby  
I love you, yes I do  
And I want on meeting you, ooh baby  
That's what my heart needs  
  
Darling, my my darling  
I need you here right by my side, baby, darling  
If you hadn't left that day  
Then my love wouldn't be this way, ooh baby  
That's what my heart needs  
  
Come on baby  
I said I need you right here by my side  
I said I need you baby  
I need you here to protect me and be my guide  
And ooh, baby, yeah baby  
I know you don't know what I mean, baby  
Ooh, baby, yeah, hey baby  
Hey hey baby  
Come on, come on and love me, baby, lord  
Come on, come on and be right by my side  
Hey, come on
