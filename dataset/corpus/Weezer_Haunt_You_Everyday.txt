I don't feel the joy  
I don't feel the pain  
You were just adored  
I am just insane  
  
Walking on my own  
Leaving you behind  
You were crying out  
That you need to speak your mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ohhh  
So alone in love  
So alone at night  
I'm gonna haunt you everyday  
Haunt you everyday  
  
I am gonna kill  
When I need a thrill  
Beating at the heart  
Until I've had my fill  
When will stupid learn?  
Fires gonna burn  
Think of consequence  
Then you move when it your turn  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Walking on my own  
Leaving you behind  
You were crying out  
That you need to speak your mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
Haunt you everyday
