What's wrong with the world today?  
Things just got to get better  
Sho' ain't what the leaders say  
Maybe we should write a letter  
  
Dear Mr. Man  
We don't understand  
Why poor people keep struggling  
But you don't lend a helping hand  
  
Matthew 5:5 say,  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
We wanna be down that way  
But you been tripping since the day of you're birth  
  
Who said that to kill is a sin  
Then started every single war  
That you're people been in?  
Who said that water  
Is a precious commodity  
Then dropped a big old black oil slick  
In the deep blue sea?  
  
Who told me, Mr. Man  
That working round the clock  
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood  
With cigarette ads on every block  
  
Who told me Mr. Man  
That I got a right to moan?  
How 'bout this big ol' hole in the ozone?  
  
What's wrong with the world today  
Things just got to get better  
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand  
Maybe we should write a letter  
  
Listen, ain't no sense in voting  
Same song with a different name  
Might not be in the back of the bus  
But it sho' feel just the same  
Ain't nothin' fair about welfare  
Ain't no assistance in AIDS  
Ain't nothing affirmative about you're actions  
Till the people get paid  
  
You're thousand years are up  
Now you got to share the land  
Section one, the fourteenth Amendment says:  
No state shall deprive any person  
Of life, liberty, or property  
Without due process of law  
  
Mr. Man,  
We want to end this letter with 3 words  
"We tired you all!"
