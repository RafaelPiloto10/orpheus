Passing on  
On my own it was  
Given to me  
By these  
Causes unknown I don't  
Know why  
We have to live  
In prisons like  
These words  
Hollow  
Though it's not too late  
To escape from it  
  
Coming down  
From the high  
I don't live too long  
Before it  
Take a fall  
And just say  
It's alright  
Anywhere  
  
Take us to heaven  
Listen  
Because you know  
That I can't hear it  
Simple  
Just your living soul  
On my own  
I never  
So I thought that  
They were higher  
(I thought too)  
  
Coming down  
From the high  
I know it  
Won't be long, will it?  
Take a fall  
And just say  
It's just wrong  
To come wanting  
(To come wanting)  
  
I don't even  
Know the answer  
But its not been (not been)  
Taken further (further)  
The very last one  
That you'll hear from  
  
Why'd you think I'd try to  
I don't even try to  
I don't even want to  
Hey hey hey  
  
I don't even try to  
You don't even want to  
I don't even know that  
Hey hey hey  
  
I don't even want to  
You won't even know it  
I haven't even tried to  
Hey hey hey  
  
I don't even like you  
I won't even  
Come near you  
But you'll try
