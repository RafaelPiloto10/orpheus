Little Arabella Miller  
Had a fuzzy caterpillar  
(Tickle palm with two fingers)  
  
First it crawled up on her mother  
(Walk fingers up left arm)  
  
Then upon her baby brother  
(Walk fingers up right arm)  
  
They said, "Arabella Miller!  
(Walk fingers up over head)  
  
Put away your caterpillar! "  
(hide hands behind back)
