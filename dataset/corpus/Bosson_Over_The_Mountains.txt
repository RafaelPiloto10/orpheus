I've made up my mind I've packed my bags  
I'm not returning home, until someone will give me reason to  
I lock the door and take a breath  
I'm ready to let go, I know you're somewhere out there too  
There's only one thing for me to do and I go  
  
[Chorus]  
Over the mountains and over the sea  
To find a heart that belongs to me  
Anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere 'til I find you  
I run through the valleys  
I run through the fields  
I'd do anything I am hard to please  
And anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere 'til I find you  
  
I fly like the wind, I don't know where my heart will lead the way  
I need someone to love and hold on to  
But the road is long I've had my doubts  
But nothing lets me down cause  
I know you're somewhere out there too waiting for me to get to you and I go...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It doesn't matter what  
The time will tell  
'Cause I will be here waiting  
For you, for you and me  
It doesn't matter what the others say  
Cause I will keep on searching  
And I go and I go and I go and I go  
  
[Chorus: x2]
