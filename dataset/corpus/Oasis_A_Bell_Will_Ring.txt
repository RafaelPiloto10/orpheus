A little space, a little time, see what it can do.  
A little faith, peace of mind, see what passes through.  
The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all
will be brand new.  
  
Come alive, come on in, here's something that you know.  
The world's as wide, as your life is thin, So entertain your goals.  
The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all
will be brand new.  
  
All will be brand new.  
  
I can tell you what you want to hear, I've been there once before.  
You pulled me through my empty nights, sleepless on your floor.  
The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all
will be brand new.  
  
And all will be brand new.  
And all will be brand new.
