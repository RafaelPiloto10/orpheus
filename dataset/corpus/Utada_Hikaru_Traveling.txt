Uh, Uh, Come on, yea!  
Huh, Ohh, Mmm Mmmm  
Wha'ch doin' tonight, Let's go for a ride!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
  
I'm a workaholic even on  
Friday afternoons  
Snatchin' up a taxi is easy, (and I jump right in)?  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The taxi driver looks to me and says "Where to?"  
Oh, just kinda over there  
?The bad economy's a problem (closing)  
Please watch out for the door?  
  
Riding on the wind, Climbing up to the moon  
My place is here? right next to you  
The problem is it's hard to go home  
Admist the dreamy spring night  
  
Traveling, with you  
Traveling, onward  
Lighting up the asphalt (?In the asphalt, blazing up a trail?)  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you going?  
To anywhere far  
  
Traveling, beyond  
Traveling, get down (?shake it?)  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up  
Even though we're not in a hurry  
  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
Oooh Woa!  
Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta ta are you, Ta
ta are you, Ta ta are you  
  
There's a song and I want to sing it  
Over and over again  
So I can spur my feelings on until they won't stop  
That's the plan  
  
Partying with the waves, Thanking the clouds  
I finally met you  
Because we're young  
Nothing more than dust blowing in the wind  
  
Traveling, our hearts  
Traveling, press closer  
Now and forever let's abandon the usual  
Traveling, this place is  
Traveling, shabby  
Our destination is not here.  
  
Traveling, Your window  
Traveling, open it  
There's nothing to fear  
Traveling, here  
Traveling, all is well  
Everything we've got is in our hearts  
  
This is the time to dance and have fun  
Don't hold it back tonight  
The hidden wishes in your heart are gonna hurt you  
Put up your hands and have some fun!  
And why does  
Some wariness remain  
  
Traveling, with you  
Traveling, still  
In the asphalt, blazing a trail  
Traveling, where  
Traveling, are you?  
The good times are about to begin  
  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, shake it  
Let the light shine away all your troubles  
Traveling, let's fly now  
Traveling, speed up  
I don't want to stop  
  
Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?  
I would like to.  
Can you take me up?  
You look quite good.  
Can you keep it up?  
Ohhao oa oooh ohh whoa oh ohhoa (Traaaaaveling)  
Oh woa ohoa oha ohhh (Ohhhhhhh Traaaaveling)??  
Don't stop now, Don't stop now, Don't stop now, oooh whoa?
