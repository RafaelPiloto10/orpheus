New feel of you running through my vein  
Little bit of everything  
You know that's what you said  
  
[Chorus]  
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love  
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love  
Cause always you indulge  
And parents try to get you out of these jams  
You got that envy cause they won't understand  
  
The social life you lead leaves nothin' to desire  
Don't wanna see you bleed  
But you came on like a liar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wrecked myself to love you  
All you want is more  
One thing you're after  
You just try and score  
  
[Chorus]
