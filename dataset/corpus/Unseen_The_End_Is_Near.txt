Intro  
Let us not feel an ounce of remorse  
When the time comes and the brains  
Behind the muscle get what they fucking deserve!  
  
News broadcasts ratings grow.  
War and scandal do you want to know.  
How many people died today.  
Dealt with pain and suffering  
  
Are you terrified  
For our lives  
It looks to be  
The end's in sight  
  
Go and fight for evil and lies  
Everything you stand for I despise  
I'd rather live than die for something  
Something that will never end  
  
Force them to fight so we can be free  
Until the end  
Money and power is the reality  
Until the end  
It's two things the world leaders thrive for  
  
Until the end  
And that's why this will never stop  
Until the end  
That's why this will never stop  
Until the end  
  
The end is near
