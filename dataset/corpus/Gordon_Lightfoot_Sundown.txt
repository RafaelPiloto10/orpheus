I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress  
In a room where ya do what ya don't confess  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
  
She's bin lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream  
And she don't always say what she really means  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
  
I can picture every move that a man could make  
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sometimes I think it's a sin  
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again  
  
I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans  
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean  
Sometimes I think it's a shame  
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sundown ya better take care  
If I find you bin creepin' 'round my back stairs  
Sometimes I think it's a sin  
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again
