[Chorus]  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He's making a list  
and checking it twice  
gonna find out  
Who's naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
santa clause is comin'  
santa clause is comin'  
is comin' to town  
santa clause is comin' to town  
santa clause is comin'
