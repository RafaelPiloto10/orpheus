I got a secret and I can't explain  
All the time, I've waited for this day  
All along I was never in doubt  
I always knew it would never get out  
There are things that I cannot tell  
And there are things that you know damn well  
This is getting very hard for me  
I guess you'd better just wait and see  
  
This is all, this is all  
You heard a message and the message was clear  
All the time you wipe away that tear  
And all I want is to hold your hand  
To see the sun and walk the sand  
You make me sad and you make me glad  
My secret is this love  
Is love, is love  
All my secret is this love  
  
Everyday you're always there  
You comfort me  
And make me feel it's worth my while  
And then I look around and you're not there  
And everyday you say you care and I'll beware  
  
This is all, this is all  
  
I've got a secret and I can't explain  
All I want is to hold your hand  
All along I was never in doubt  
To see the sun and to walk the sand
