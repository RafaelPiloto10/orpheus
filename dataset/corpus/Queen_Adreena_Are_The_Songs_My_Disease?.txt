(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
I used to know this wretched girl,  
I made her open for me,  
I took her heart,  
And I kissed it clean,  
But she still kicks against me.  
Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?  
Maybe she's creating me,  
Mistaken accidentally,  
For a girl I used to know,  
In darkness permanently,  
If I find her the perfect line,  
My sickness might desert me.  
Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?
