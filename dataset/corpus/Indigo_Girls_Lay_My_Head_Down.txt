Oh the party?s kicked up a few notches  
Look at us getting loose  
She leans back against the wall and she watches, tugging her collar like it
might be a noose.  
And everyone's tied to their thing  
To their past or their drink or the date that they bring  
I just get tired all of sudden taking it in.  
And I want to lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of changes, strangers, illusion, confusion,  
I speak from my heart but I'm not really sure if it's true.  
I wanna lay my head down on you.  
Oh they say don't waste too much time planning  
Or you'll get rug ripped out  
And the only way you?ll be satisfied  
Is learning to live without.  
But some plan for the kingdom of heaven  
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven  
I don?t know what to believe, I just show up and breathe anymore.  
And I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers  
If I don?t get out I'll do something I don?t wanna do.  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.  
Was it so long ago  
That we sat and talked in your car  
Your things were all packed  
And the place you were headed not really that far  
Years later I think  
That I would have been much more alive  
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive  
Oh well everything that?s come before us leads us to where we are now  
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling  
That I'm lost somehow  
I'm just a ghost looking in  
Out of my own life just visiting  
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep.  
I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache  
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.
