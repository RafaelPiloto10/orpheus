Yesterday feels like running away  
Feels like givin' the child gettin' lost losin' my mind  
I'm feelin' low and I got no place to go  
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up yeah yeah  
Oh yesterday feels like running away  
And I know, I'm givin' up my time to still love  
Still love love's got me blind  
My mind sees the things I don't know and I got no place to go  
Gettin' all tied up, feelin' all tied up  
Things I need to tell you love  
You'll be true I know  
There's still a chance for a better life  
Yes, I know
