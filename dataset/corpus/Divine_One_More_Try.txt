Had enough danger  
And people on the streets  
I'm looking out for angels (Angels)  
Just trying to find some peace  
Now I think it's time  
That you let me know  
So if you love me  
Say you love me  
But if you don't  
Just let me go 'cause  
  
Teacher  
There are things that I don't want to learn  
And the last one I had made me cry  
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you  
Think that you're mine because it ain't  
No world for an uptown girl  
Whose teacher has told her goodbye  
Goodbye, oh goodbye  
When you were just a stranger  
And I was at your feet  
I didn't feel danger  
Now I feel the heat  
What look in your eyes  
It's telling me no  
So you think that you love me  
Know that you need me  
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong  
Just let me go  
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you  
Think that you're mine  
No world for an uptown girl  
Who just isn't willing to try  
I'm so cold inside  
Oh maybe just one more try  
One more try to ease my mind I feel so cold inside  
One more try to ease my mind I feel so cold inside
