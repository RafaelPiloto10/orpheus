Are you falling asleep at the wheel  
Maybe there's a feeling, you've been brushing off  
Asking reason, what's left for me here  
Well he's all out of answers  
You're not out of luck  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it now  
Are you hungry?  
Won't you come get your fill  
We could put this thing in motion  
If you'd stop acting tough  
Superstar you sit up high on your hill  
I know why you're running  
Only you know what you've lost  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it now  
When the sun goes down  
It's here waiting  
It is still right here for you now  
And when the sun comes out  
It's still waiting  
It is still right here for you now  
Doo doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
I've got this something, yeah

You don't know it  
But you need it

You need this something now
