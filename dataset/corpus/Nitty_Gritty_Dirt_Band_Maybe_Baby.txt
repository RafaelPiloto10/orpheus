Maybe baby, I'll have you  
Maybe baby, you'll be true  
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me  
It's funny Honey, you don't care  
  
You never listen to my prayers  
Maybe baby, you will love me someday  
Well, you are the one that makes glad  
Any other woman just makes me sad  
  
When someday you want me, well,  
I'll be there, wait and see  
Repeat Verse 1  
Repeat Bridge  
Repeat Verse 1  
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me
