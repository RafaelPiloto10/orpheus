What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
It's the only thing  
That there's just too little of  
  
[Chorus]  
What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
No not just for some  
But for everyone  
  
Lord we don't need another mountain  
There are mountains and hillsides  
Enough to climb  
There are oceans and rivers  
Enough to cross  
Enough to last  
Till the end of time  
  
What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
No not just for some  
But for everyone  
  
Lord we don't need another meadow  
There are cornfields and wheatfields  
Enough to grow  
And there are sunbeams and moonbeams  
Enough to shine  
So listen, Lord  
If you want to know  
  
What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
It's the only thing  
That there's just too little of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More love, more love  
Everybody know that  
(the world needs love)  
Everybody, Everybody knows that  
(this world needs love)  
This world, the whole world  
(the whole world needs love)  
The whole world, the whole world  
(more love, more lovin')  
There's not enough
