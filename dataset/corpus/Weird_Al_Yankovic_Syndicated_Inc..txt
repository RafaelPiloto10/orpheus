My whole family  
Loves "Three's Company"  
See the reruns constantly  
There on my TV  
Syndicated Incorporated  
  
Well, I know what's on the tube  
I know just what to see  
Got my TV Guide with me  
  
"MASH" and "All in the Family"  
"The Munsters" and "Mayberry R. F. D."  
I will always be busy  
Watching my TV  
  
Oprah Winfrey talks to me  
Every day at three  
Then soon it'll be  
"Wheel" and "Jeopardy"  
  
Syndicated Incorporated  
Syndicated Incorporated  
  
Well, I'm in such ecstasy  
When I'm watchin' TV  
I'm a boob tube devotee  
  
Think I'm losin' my sanity  
I'm addicted to Regis and Kathie Lee  
Forever I will always be  
Glued to my TV  
  
Love "The Partridge Family"  
And "Dynasty"  
And "Laverne and Shirley"  
And "Hard Copy"
