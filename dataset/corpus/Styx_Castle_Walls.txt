Once in a dream  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Down by the bay where the  
Moonlit water falls  
I stood alone while the minstrel sang his song  
So afraid I'd lost my soul  
  
There in the fog his song kept calling me  
Leading me on with its haunting melody  
Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing  
I knew I'd soon be wandering  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where the distant harbour meets the sky  
There the battle raged like hell  
And every dove had lost its will to fly  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where I thought I heard Tiresias say  
Life is never what it seems  
And every man must meet his destiny
