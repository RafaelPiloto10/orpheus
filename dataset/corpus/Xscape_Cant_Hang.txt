Let's get down  
Let's get down  
  
You claim you've been waiting  
With no game  
Just anticipating  
How it would be  
If you and I were in the sack  
But to me  
You look like you wouldn't know how to act  
  
I need someone to hold me  
(All night long)  
It must be you my darling  
(Am I wrong)  
It ain't a damn thing baby  
Show me what you can bring  
Cause some try to swing but they still can't hang  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang  
I betcha can't hang  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang  
I betcha can't hang  
  
You claim you can do this this and that  
Ain't no shame in my game  
If it's wack I gotta tell you that  
So you betta be  
(Up on your down stroke)  
(You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat)  
Cause in my mind think your gonna slip baby  
  
I need someone to hold me  
(All night long)  
It must be you my darling  
(Am I wrong)  
It ain't a damn thing baby  
Show me what you can bring  
Cause some try to swing  
But they still can't hang!  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang  
I betcha can't hang  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang  
I betcha can't hang  
  
You talk alot of this  
And you talk alot of that  
Is it all fact  
Brotha man are you Phat  
Cause if it's on the real  
I come with mad sex appeal  
Flip light delicous  
You know the deal  
Hey that's me  
I be the chic  
The one with the physique  
I freak you in the sheets  
I take a nigga deep down under  
I make him wonder  
How to make the lighting come before the thunder  
That's the pleasure I bring  
I make a nigga get up and sing:  
Tinga linga ling ling  
I got the pow  
Da boogie and the bang bang  
You can't hang don't talk da game  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang  
I betcha can't hang  
  
You and me, let's get down  
Even though you claim that you've been around  
I betcha can't hang  
I betcha can't hang
