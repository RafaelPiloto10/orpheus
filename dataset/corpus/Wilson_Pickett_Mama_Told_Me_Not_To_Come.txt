Will you have whiskey with your water  
Or sugar with your tea?  
What are these crazy questions  
That they're asking of me?  
This is the wildest party that there ever could be  
Oh, don't turn on the light 'cause I don't want to see  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama said, "That ain't no way to have fun"  
  
Open up the window, let some air into this room  
I think I'm almost choking on the smell of stale perfume  
And that cigarette you're smoking 'bout to scare me half to death  
Open up the window, let me catch my breath  
  
The radio is blasting, someone's beating on the door  
Our hostess is not lasting - she's out on the floor  
I seen so many things here I ain't never seen before  
I don't know what it is - but I don't wanna see no more  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama said, "That ain't no way to have fun"
