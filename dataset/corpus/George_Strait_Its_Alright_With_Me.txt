It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright I know  
Your love will see me through  
When the car won't start  
The rain won't stop  
And all of the bills are due  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
  
Well the boss man rides me all week long  
And it's all that I can take  
I work each day till' the sun is gone  
And no time for a break  
But when I get home you rub my back  
And tell me I'm your man  
With a little love I get back on track  
And do it all over again  
  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright I know  
Your love will see me through  
When the car won't start  
The rain won't stop  
And all of the bills are due  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
  
No matter what life throws at me  
I've got the upper hand  
'Cause nothin' else can set me free  
The way your lovin' can  
If I lived in the shack out in the woods  
And never see me blue  
I just throw another log in the old wood stove  
And make sweet love to you  
  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you  
It's alright I know  
Your love will see me through  
When the car won't start  
The rain won't stop  
And all of the bills are due  
It's alright with me  
If it's alright with you
