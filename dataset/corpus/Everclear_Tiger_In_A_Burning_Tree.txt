A friend of mine woke me up to tell me about his dream  
All the lights in the world went black  
He felt like a tiger in a burning tree  
It was like he was late for something  
That he did not wanna see  
His life looks better on paper  
He lives like a tiger in a burning tree  
  
Blow out the candles and make a wish  
  
A woman from the city in the South  
She lost her cow when the bottom fell out  
She sold her life to the deep blue sea  
She left a message for the world to see  
She knows better what it's like to be  
A tiger in a burning tree  
  
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath  
Blow out the candles and look away  
  
I was a child that painted my toys angel blue and devil red  
I broke him into pieces, set them on fire  
Swept him under my bed  
I never learned how to play nice with all the other kids  
I never learned how to draw inside the lines and probably never will  
  
Close your eyes and take a big deep breath  
Imagine a world so much better than this  
Now close your eyes and jump to a place you attain to be  
And you can tell me what it feels like  
To be a tiger in a burning tree
