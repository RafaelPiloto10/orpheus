Paint me a picture of two lovers, show me the lovers torn apart  
  
You made me fall in love with you, the dance of lovers takes two  
Somehow the music stopped, and so did our love  
  
I tried to put the pieces together, and I got a grip on my life  
They say there's one born every minute who has all for a lifetime  
What good is a lifetime if I can't be with you  
  
I just want to hold you, just want to touch you, just let me love you  
When I see your face, my heart cries out for you  
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love  
  
I do admit I really miss you, there are some things time cannot change  
And I would be a liar baby, if I told you I didn't care  
'cause it makes a difference, baby when you're not there  
  
I just want to hold you, just want to touch you, just let me love you  
When I see your face, my heart, my heart goes crazy baby  
It's what's calling your name  
  
I just want to hold you, just want to touch you, I just want to hold you  
When I see your face, my heart cries out for you  
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love
