A pretty boy Charlie's the name that you've been a given  
And you act like the whole wide world all you were livin'  
You tell me you can get any girl you know  
You say it got what it takes to me you're just a heartache  
So get what'cha got and go  
You think you're the greatest thing in this whole town  
Oh number one but everyone no one can put you down  
Every night you go downtown where the go-gos go  
Oh well you think you're so hot and you tell me you're not  
So get what'cha got and go  
[ steel ]  
You better watch that sneaky smile right off of your face  
For I just might to knock it off and put it in your place  
Just like the wild wild wind all you do is blow  
Just say I'm holdin' you back but baby I'll have to pack  
So get what'cha got and go  
You think you're the greatest thing...
