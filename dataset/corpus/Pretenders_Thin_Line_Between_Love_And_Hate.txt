It's a thin line between love and hate  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
  
It's five o'clock in the morning  
And you're just getting in  
You knock on the front door  
And a voice sweet and low says  
"who is it?"  
She opens up the door and lets you in  
Never once asks where have you been  
She says "are you hungry?  
Did you eat yet?  
Let me hang up your coat  
Pass me your hat"  
All the time she's smiling  
Never once raises her voice  
It's five o'clock in the morning  
You don't give it a second thought  
  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
(repeat)  
  
The sweetest woman in the world  
Could be the meanest woman in the world  
If you make her that way  
You keep hurting her  
She'll keep being quiet  
She might be holding something inside  
That'll really, really hurt you one day  
  
I see you're in the hospital  
Bandaged from foot to head  
In a state of shock  
Just that much from being dead  
You couldn't believe the girl  
Would do something like this, ha  
You didn't think the girl had the nerve  
But here you are  
I guess action speaks louder than words  
  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
(repeat)
