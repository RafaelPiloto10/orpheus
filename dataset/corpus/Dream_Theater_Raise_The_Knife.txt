Have I thanked you for your time?  
Or will your life go unrewarded  
Again?  
Never asking for a dime  
You just gave all of yourself  
Until I turned my back on you  
My friend  
  
The powers that be made you a martyr  
Conspiracy led you to slaughter  
I tried to control it but as soon as I showed it  
I was shot down again  
  
Once again outnumbered  
Appreciation slumbered  
You can ask yourself why  
But that look in your eye  
Doesn't pass the test  
You've been laid to rest my friend  
Again  
  
Tortured artist bears his soul  
Seems the pressure took its toll  
Lived a life so punishing  
Now he keeps the publishing  
  
Spilling your guts out to a pad and pen  
Communication to your silent friend  
  
Raising the knife  
To a picture of a life  
(I once knew)  
There comes a time  
Compromising my life  
(Just won't do)  
I cannot lie  
I can't try anymore  
(To reach you)  
I just can't fight  
Raise the knife  
Raise the knife  
Cut through  
  
I remember once you were the quiet type  
Content to sit and watch the motions of your life  
With false sensitivity  
You cut yourself open so people would adore you  
  
They all bought into your contrived sincerity  
And how you wore your heart and soul right on your sleeve  
Laughing sarcastically  
You turned your back on the people who adored you  
  
Self-absorbed exhaustion  
Self-esteem distortion  
Self-infused extortion  
Self-serving abortion  
  
I'll take the blame for these things that I say  
'Cause I had the heart and the will and the courage to stay  
Every day  
I won't walk away  
  
Reading through all the digests you show me  
I notice the way that you
