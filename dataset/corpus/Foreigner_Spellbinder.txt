I found out the hard way, some things you just cant get  
When I fell in love with a woman I wish I never met  
I was in the wrong place, at the wrong time  
I fell easy prey to an innocent way, I was so blind  
  
I call out her name, I turn around to find her  
She's a spellbinder  
  
I've never been a easy man, so hard to please  
But she made me feel life was unreal, oh Lord, how she satisfied me  
I tried to break away, but I didn't stand a chance  
She planned it so well, I was under her spell, I was in a trance  
  
I call out her name, I turn around to find her  
She's a spellbinder  
  
Now do you know what love can do?  
Oh no, what she puts me through?  
It took so long for me to find her  
Now she won't set me free  
She's a spellbinder  
  
Now do you know what love can do?  
Oh no, what she put me through?  
You say you can't believe, believe that it's true  
Let the spellbinder put a spell on you
