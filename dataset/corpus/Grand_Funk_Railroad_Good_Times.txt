Good times, good times,  
I'm goin out tonight just to ease my mind.  
I worked all day I'm gonna' play all night,  
I ain't gonna' stop 'till it feels alright.  
You gotta' take time for what you wanna' do,  
And if you had the chance I know you would too, baby.  
  
Are you gonna' meet me on the moon tonight?  
Can't guarantee I won't touch you, girl, 'cause I just might.  
  
Good times, good times,  
I watched you wiggle, baby, from behind, hey.  
Skin tight pants and I watched you dance,  
I asked you, honey, and you took a chance.  
I'm kinda' outspoken 'cause my mind is broken,  
I love you, baby, I sure ain't jokin', now.  
  
Are you gonna' meet me on the moon tonight?  
Can't guarantee I won't touch you, girl, 'cause I just might.  
  
Good times, good times.  
Good times, good times.  
Good times, good times.  
Good times, good times.
