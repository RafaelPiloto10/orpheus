Whether you like it or not,he's back  
D-A-double D-why Fat Sacks  
Ridin' in the Cadillac  
Beatin' like some beat it up  
The game dun' changed Out-  
Kast came to heat it up  
  
Sharp as a tack like I just left church(clean)  
Smart than a tack when the windows won't work(mean)  
Ridin' in the Cadillac Beatin' like some beat it up  
The game dun' changed Out,  
Kast came to heat it up  
  
And everybody wanna know was really goin' on  
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?  
So on and so on  
I can go o-on and o-on  
And on,and on,and on  
Hell yes!  
  
[Chorus]  
Music make the world go round  
Where it goes(where it goes)  
Ya' just don't know(ya just don't know)  
My heart is like a marching band  
I'm a fan in the stands  
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby  
Saying hey baby  
  
So baby please don't leave me  
Don't you go(don't you go)  
Baby no,no,no(baby no,no,no)  
My heart is like a marching band  
I'm a fan in the stands  
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby  
Saying hey baby  
  
Two dope boys in the Cadillac still  
'Kast, the crown on ya Cadillac Seville  
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)  
Like your DJ got killed  
The fire marsh,  
Fire Marshall  
Shut'er down,time to go!  
OutKast royalty by design of logo  
Wanna count it out loud?  
93, 94, 95, 96  
Plus a dime,still that's fire  
Hot like the perm on the back of ya neck  
Left it in too long  
Now ya got Cabbage Patch Silky  
Ridin' the Cadillac  
Beatin' like some beat it up  
The game dun' changed Out,  
Kast came to heat it up  
  
Bendin' corners like a crowbar,oh so unique  
Got the pedal to floor,but the 4 door just creeps  
  
Ridin' in the Cadillac  
Beatin like some beat it up  
The game dun' changed Out,  
Kast came to heat it up  
  
Exotic,melodic melody jep,we got it  
Funking for the funk of it and everybody want it  
  
you make it make it put a dog on it  
you make it make it put a dog on it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm tipping my hat off to ya baby  
'cause you're so fine,blow my mind  
I put in the time  
Everybody knows you can't let the pretty one past ya by  
Without sayin' hi  
  
I'm so gone over you  
Yes it's true  
Baby do what ya you do  
My nose is open so wide(so wide,yeah)  
Looking at you such a pretty sight(so wide,yeah)  
My heart on my sleeve(my sleeve,yeah)  
And this is how it sounds to me(this is how it sounds to me)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby you and me  
We make a musical masterpiece  
I travel the land  
Me and my band  
We bringin' the church back to ya feet  
So wait baby  
Don't leave me,baby  
Say wait,baby  
Don't leave me ,baby  
[2x]
