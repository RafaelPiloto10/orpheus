Spit it out, suck it in.  
Let that genius flow.  
All the answers to all the questions,  
There's nothing you don't know.  
Experience is an asset,  
When you've done most anything.  
Just call it intuition.  
Just call it anything!  
  
Watch him fade,  
The jack of all trades.  
Backed against the wall!  
Watch him fade,  
He's quite afraid,  
To contradict it all!  
  
I know you like a book.  
I know all the lies.  
I know, that you know,  
Your mouth is catchin' flies.  
Blank expression, a burnt out bulb,  
A thimble full of wit.  
Endless stories never follow,  
In short you're full of shit.  
  
Watch him fade,  
The jack of all trade.  
Backed against that wall...  
To an all but captive audience,  
Watch out!  
Here it comes!  
Brainfade!  
  
Take a minute to think,  
Brainfade!  
Stop flappin' your gums  
Brainfade!  
You're gettin' in deep.  
Brainfade!  
And I'm fallin' asleep.  
  
When you're talkin' to me,  
Brainfade!  
It's easy to see,  
Brainfade!  
That what comes outta your mouth,  
Brainfade!  
I can't believe!  
  
"Hey you know, you ain't gonna believe,  
this is what really happened last night.  
Vegas, I went out there, I went, I lost a hundred bucks.  
I go all the way back to the RV, right?  
I get back, I don't even drink any times.  
I got another hundred bucks, I didn't want to be screwed up.  
I finally won all my money back. Unbelievable by the way,  
what the hell did you guys do with all the towels?  
I'm gonna have to explain this to the desk clerk."  
  
Brain! fade!

Watch him fade,  
The jack of all trades.  
Up against that wall!  
Watch him fade,  
He's quite afraid,  
He'll contradict it all!
