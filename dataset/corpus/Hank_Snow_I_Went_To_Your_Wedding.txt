I went to your wedding although I was dreading  
The thought of losing you  
The organ was playing my poor heart kept saying  
Your dreams your dreams are through  
  
You came down the aisle wearing a smile a vision of loveliness  
I uttered a sigh then whispered goodbye goodbye to my happiness  
Your mother was crying your father was crying and I was crying too  
The teardrops were falling because we were losing you  
  
Your mother was crying...
