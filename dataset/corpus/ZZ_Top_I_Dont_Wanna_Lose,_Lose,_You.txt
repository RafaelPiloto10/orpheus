Sometimes it's hard to make things clear  
Or know when to face the truth  
And I know that the moment is here  
I'll open my heart and show you inside  
My love has no pride  
  
I feel with you I've got nothing to hide  
So open your eyes and see who I am  
And not who you want for me to be  
I am only myself, myself  
  
I don't wanna lose you now  
We're gonna get through somehow  
I don't wanna lose you now or ever  
  
Baby I've finally found  
The Courage to stand my ground  
But if you want me  
I'll be around, forever  
  
We all make mistakes, we all lose our way  
But we stood the test of time and I hope  
That's the way it will stay  
It's all up to you, to tell me to go  
'Cause it won't be me to walk away  
When you're all that I know  
And I know that  
  
I don't wanna lose you now  
We're gonna get through somehow  
I don't wanna lose you now or ever and ever  
Baby I've finally found  
The courage to stand my ground  
  
But if you want me  
I'll be around, forever, forever, yeah , yeah  
  
Don't wanna lose you , lose you now  
We're gonna get through somehow  
Don't wanna lose you now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you
