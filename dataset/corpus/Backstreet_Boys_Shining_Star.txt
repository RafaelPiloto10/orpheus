[Chorus]  
You're my shining star  
That is what you are  
There is no one like you baby  
Angels everywhere  
Every time you're near  
You will always be my baby  
  
Baby when you do the things you do  
I want to be close to you  
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh  
Baby I can never say how much  
I need your touch, I can't get enough  
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby you're as close as close can get  
And baby you know I'd let  
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah  
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring  
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms  
Cause you know what to do to turn me on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've never been so satisfied  
With anything in my entire life  
Cause you are doing everything so right  
Oh, oh baby  
I've never been so satisfied  
With anything in my entire life  
Cause you are doing everything so right  
Oh, oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know that I adore you  
want to be there everyday for you  
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby  
You know that I adore you  
want to be there everyday for you  
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]
