Your life has seemed so hard  
It's been dried up  
Angels that can't keep guard  
I'm trying to reach your hand  
But I'm on fire  
I never planned to fade away  
Stay with me  
  
Stop pretending  
When they say that your nothing  
Are you sad, are you holding yourself  
You shouldn't be  
Are you sad, are you locked in your room  
You shouldn't be  
I'm drowning inside your head  
Help me to answer  
  
Help understand  
But its been so long  
Since we talked like friends  
Please forgive me  
I'm just a man  
Whose made  
Mistakes.
