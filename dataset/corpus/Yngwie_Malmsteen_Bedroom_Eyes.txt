Come on baby, what's on your mind  
You're stumbling in the darkness  
Like you're running blind  
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around  
This same old graveyard  
on the same playground  
Be my late night movie star  
By my nature I can tell who you are  
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes  
There's no innocence  
In your bedroom eyes  
Baby Baby  
Got no self-defense  
For your bedroom eyes  
Over and over then we do it again  
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when  
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around  
Is there any way to stop this merry go round  
Be my late night movie star  
By my nature I can tell who you are  
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes  
There's no innocence  
In your bedroom eyes  
Baby Baby  
Got no self-defense  
For your bedroom eyes  
Over and over then we do it again  
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when  
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around  
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
