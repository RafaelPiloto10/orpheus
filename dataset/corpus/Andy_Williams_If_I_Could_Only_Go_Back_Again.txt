If I could only go back again  
To the places where I have I have been  
Feeling love as we did then  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
Crystal waters of yesterday  
Golden rainbows you washed away  
Lonely clouds that can only say  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love like we did then  
To run free as the wind forever  
  
Silver wings of eternity  
Take me back like the child to see  
Faces lost in the memories  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love as we did then  
To run free as the wind forever, run
