Missed the Saturday dance  
Yet they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it much without you.  
Don't get around much anymore.  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might of gone but what for  
Awfully distant without you  
Don't get around much anymore.  
  
Well, it's all gone I guess  
But my minds more at ease  
And never the less  
We'll stir up some more memories.  
  
Been invited on dates (well, well)  
I might of gone but what for (I've heard that before, myself)  
It's so lonesome without you (I miss you George)  
Don't get around much anymore.  
  
(Spoken)  
You know George it's really true  
You don't get around much anymore  
You haven't been to see me on a Leer Jet  
I'm out here right now bro.  
I know but I was thinkin' about the old days  
When you used to take the lawn mower  
Oh, I tried to get to Amirillo  
But man, it was to far with a ten horse power  
Well, you had, you had a red Buick though didn't you  
For two week I had a red Buick  
And found out later it was gold  
Well, hmm as long as you don't start doing that duck  
Well, he's not to bad anymore haha  
Nancy run him off... haha quack...  
  
(Sang)  
It's all gone I guess  
But my minds all at ease  
And never the less  
We'll stir up some old memories.  
  
Been invited on dates  
I might of gone but what for  
It's so lonesome without you  
Don't get around much anymore.  
  
(Spoken)  
Hey, you know we need to get back on the radio  
George, that's what we need to do  
Hey  
  
(Sang)  
Don't get around much anymore
