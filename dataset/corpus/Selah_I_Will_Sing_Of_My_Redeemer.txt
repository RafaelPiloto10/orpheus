Will sing of my Redeemer  
He who took the nails for me  
I've been purchased, I've been pardoned  
Bound to Him I'm truly free  
  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
How He sought me while a slave  
Loosed me from the curse of sin and  
From the power of the grave  
  
[Chorus]  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
Lift my voice to praise my Lord  
Ransomed by His blood and mercy  
I am His forevermore  
  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
He who bore my cross, my curse  
Came a servant, chose to suffer  
Lifted up and cast from earth  
  
I will sing of my Redeemer  
Tell about the grace I've known  
Here on earth with those forgiven  
And one day around His throne  
  
[Chorus]
