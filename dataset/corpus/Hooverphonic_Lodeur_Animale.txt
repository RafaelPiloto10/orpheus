Feel the need to wonder  
Inside  
Fulfill your basic needs  
Deep inside  
We wander by the lake of tears  
And smell the odor of our fear  
Inside  
Deep inside  
All these creepy things crawling  
Deep inside  
Feel the urge to grow  
Inside  
Our world is covered with clouds  
Deep inside  
We wander by our ocean of tears  
We try to hide our frozen fear  
Inside  
Deep inside  
All these creepy things crawling  
Deep inside
