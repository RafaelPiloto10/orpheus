Watchin' a stretch of road  
Miles of light explode  
Driftin' off a thing  
I'd never done before  
  
Watchin' the crowd roll in  
Out go the lights, it begins  
A feelin' in my bones  
I never felt before  
  
People always told me  
That bars are dark and lonely  
And talk is often cheap  
And filled with air  
  
Sure sometimes they thrill me  
But nothin' could ever chill me  
Like the way they make  
The time just disappear  
  
Feelin' you here again  
Hot on my skin again  
Feelin' good, a thing  
I'd never known before  
  
What does it mean to feel  
Millions of dreams come real?  
A feelin' in my soul  
I'd never felt before  
  
And you, you always told me  
No matter how long it holds me  
If it falls apart  
Or makes us millionaires  
  
You'll be right here forever  
We'll go through this thing together  
And on Heaven's golden shore  
We'll lay our heads
