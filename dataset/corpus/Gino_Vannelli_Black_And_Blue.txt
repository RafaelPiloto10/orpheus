Feelin' light and low  
Like nothin I've felt before  
My woman is black, but now she's blue  
And I'm wonderin just what to do  
(the day is new)  
  
A motor-city love affair  
In the heat of the night  
A woman dark and debonair  
Too hard to resist  
The moment you've kissed  
  
Feelin' good, feelin' down  
Repercussions of a heavy heart  
(torn apart)  
  
The summer night is hot  
But soon turns cold  
Like a winter's song  
(when something's wrong)  
  
Oh lady black! please don't be blue  
Wash the midnight with the morning dew  
(the day is new)
