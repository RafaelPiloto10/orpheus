Well I was thinking that I should of  
But I didn't ever leave you  
But baby I'm leaving tonight  
And there's a trucker drinking coffee in the station who can give me a ride  
  
Well I was thinking about heading down to Mobile, Alabama  
And that was just last Saturday night  
Well I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
And I'm gonna tonight  
  
'Cause I got a bucket full of tears  
And a hard luck story  
There's a bad moon rising behind  
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you  
  
But I changed my mind  
Well I'm a fast talking, hell raising, son of a bitch  
And I'm a sinner and I know how to fight  
And I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
  
And I'm gonna tonight  
'Cause I got a bucket full of tears  
And a hard luck story  
And there's a bad moon rising behind  
  
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you  
But I changed my mind  
Well I'm a fast talking, hell raising, son of a bitch  
And I'm a sinner and I know how to fight  
  
'Cause I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
And I'm gonna tonight  
Well I was sitting  
I was drinking on a barstool  
  
Thinking how true love could come as a lie  
And I never should have left you  
But I had to  
And I'll bet you there's a man there with you tonight  
  
And I swore it to your daddy that I missed you  
But I didn't  
If I came back it wouldn't be right  
'Cause I can leave you if I wanna, little baby  
  
And I'm gonna tonight
