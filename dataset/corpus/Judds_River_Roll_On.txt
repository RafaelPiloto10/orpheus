River roll on  
Wish I could be like you  
No looking back  
And no heart that breaks in two  
  
You'll never now  
What a goodbye can do  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
River roll on  
  
Free as the winds that blow  
Feelin' no pain  
We just roll 'em with the flow  
No tears to cry  
  
No songs to make you blue  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
  
Oh, I never thought that  
I could ever feel so all alone  
But I'm learnin'  
  
The world keeps on a turnin'  
Even though he's gone  
River roll on  
  
Keep rollin' endlessly  
Down to the arms  
Of the ever waiting sea  
  
I wish that I had someone waitin' too  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
I wish that I had someone waitin' too  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
Oh, I wish I were you  
River roll on  
River roll on  
River roll on  
River roll on
