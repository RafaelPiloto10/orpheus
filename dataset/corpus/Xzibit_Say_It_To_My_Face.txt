Bitch ass nigga was talkin' all this shit right?  
I'm like damn, you bitch ass nigga  
I should sock you in your motherfuckin' mouth  
Talkin' all this shit about my homie  
So I chirped him (chirp-chirp)  
Hey 'cause, this nigga talkin' all this shit right?  
Boom, the homie came up and was like  
"Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face"  
Popped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga  
Niggaz be talkin' all this shit  
The only thing I wanna know is, look  
  
[Chorus]  
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault  
My back was up against the wall, thanks to y'all  
(Niggas talkin' like bitches)  
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me  
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be, but you ain't no G  
(Niggas talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me  
  
Sometime men got some more than women  
You do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom  
You can't walk in these shoes nigga, you can't fit 'em  
I'm bout five seconds away from the "let's go get him"  
So nigga (say it to my face) if you're feelin' like King Kong  
Mysery love company, I guess I'm a leave y'all  
Until that day, you wanna tuck them nuts  
And try to hit my switches and get your frame fucked up  
You gotta (say it to my face), I'm right here with a 12-gauge  
You talkin' to a man that plan on dyin' of old age  
Until that day, I crush everything in my way  
And give a fuck about what y'all say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much of anything makes you a addict  
Wantin' contact with another man makes you a faggot  
Patience is virtue, don't make me hurt you  
I came full circle, about-face reversal  
Salute the general, make yourself presentable  
Analytical, every move made political  
(Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital  
Huh, gutter never takin' me under  
Fuckin' nerve of you motherfuckers  
Thinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers  
X went off the deep end, I'm determined you motherfuckers  
So watch how you speakin'  
Cause I'm listenin' closely for any pussy approachin' me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nigga, you better come with the Taliban  
Never been a slave or afraid of another man  
X move like the brutal force of an avalanche  
It ain't my fault you smoked off your chance  
See motherfuckers envy what they cannot be  
Mr. X to the Z, H.N.I.C.  
Shh, half assed niggaz gon' shit on me  
If they sentence me to five I'll be out in three  
You'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat  
Tucked in for eternity, time to sleep  
Til' that day, I'll crush everything in my way  
And give a fuck about what y'all say  
  
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault  
My back was up against the wall, thanks to y'all  
(Niggas talkin' like bitches)  
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me  
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be, but you ain't no G  
(Niggas talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me  
(Niggas talkin' like bitches)  
  
All that yackin' don't do shit  
Dogg Pound homie, the homie Xzibit  
Kurupt Young Gotti, Bigg Snoop, we here  
Daz Dillinger, nickels and nines homie  
Look back,
